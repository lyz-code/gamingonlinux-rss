      <title>Nexus Mods app makes improvements to Collections, fixes Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Script Extender on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The newer open source and cross-platform Nexus Mods app has another update out, this time with more UI changes and improvements to the Collections system along with bug fixes. Still in Alpha, with a limited selection of supported games, but they're working on supporting more games.</p>
<p>For the Collections feature it will now sit at the top if you have some installed, along with being read-only when you first add them to ensure "you get the full experience the curator intended". Downloading and installing mod collections was also improved, along with a UI change to show you when a collection has been updated. They also said "mod updates are coming soon".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9802176141738593915gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>All the other changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Workspace Improvements</strong></p>
<p>We've made several improvements to the behaviour of the left menu in your Workspaces:</p>
<ul>
<li>The left menu has been reorganised with the Library at the top, the mods in your loadout in the middle, and the extra utilities at the bottom.</li>
<li>Pages in the left menu will now show active/selected states based on which panels/tabs are open and in view.</li>
<li>Tooltips have been added to the left menu items so you can always see the full name.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mod Thumbnails</strong></p>
<p>We've added the mod page image as a thumbnail in the Library, My Mods, and Collection Download pages. It's a small change, but we think it makes a big difference.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added a new error pop-up when the app encounters an unexpected error. This can be turned off in the Settings.</li>
<li>Added CLI commands to allows users to delete files from the hidden Override folder where this has compromised their setup.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Health Checks not refreshing properly when the Loadout changes.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue when installing Baldur's Gate 3 Script Extender on Linux.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Known Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>On Windows, a Command Prompt window will appear behind the app while it is running.</li>
<li>When viewing a read-only collection, it is still possible to toggle individual mods on and off, but this does not affect your loadout.</li>
<li>Stardew Valley (Native Linux version) is not detected when installed via Heroic Launcher on Linux. The Windows version of the game can be used instead until this issue is fixed.</li>
<li>Bundled mods included with collections do not appear in the UI but are still applied to your game.</li>
<li>The success rating for collections does not show the correct value.</li>
<li>The game version is not checked when adding a collection meaning you can install outdated mods without being warned.</li>
<li>The "Switch View" option does not persist in the Library/Installed Mods view.</li>
<li>The "Load Order" heading toggle does not persist in the Load Order view.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm really looking forward to Nexus adding the likes of Skyrim and Fallout into this one, it's what many keep asking for. Their <a href="https://trello.com/b/gPzMuIr3/nexus-mods-app-roadmap" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">roadmap</a> clearly shows Bethesda games are planned, so it's only a matter of time.</p>

      <title>Run a game store and go through gaming history in GSC - Game Store Chronicle</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Imponix Game Studio have announced GSC - Game Store Chronicle, a management simulator where you run your very own game store.</p>
<p>They say it's "not just another simulator" like we've seen quite a lot of pop up recently including Supermarket Simulator, TCG Card Shop Simulator, Grocery Store Simulator, Clothing Store Simulator and various others, as it "features a timeline tied to gaming industry history, letting you follow the greatest consoles, games, and moments through the generations".</p>
<p>The first trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="foXS-oSy1H8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/75fef4918997e0a82ef12809e2720785.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/foXS-oSy1H8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the very first console launches to the dawn of iconic gaming eras, your store will grow alongside the industry. Organize shelves, create attractive displays, and ensure your shop is the go-to destination for gaming enthusiasts. Make every decision count—your store layout and product selection are key to customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>Every decision you make shapes your business—from product selection to pricing strategies. Will you build a thriving store that becomes a gaming hub, or will you fall behind as trends shift and evolve? The choice is yours in this vibrant simulation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer confirmed Linux / Steam Deck support on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/imponix.com/post/3lh2swsioas2o" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course it will have! Steamdeck and Linux, in fact, this one I'll do better testing on desktop Linux. VoS I did test directly on Steamdeck, but not on desktop linux, just through players feedbacks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's due out sometime in Q3 2025.</p>

      <title>FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH gets stability fixes and a Steam Deck graphics setting tweak</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH has its first post-release patch to improve how it runs across all systems, with some useful improvements.</p>
<p>Version 1.001 includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improved overall game stability, including several bug fixes.</li>
<li>Fixed the graphics preset to be set to 'Low' when launching for the first time on Steam Deck, even when save data is linked from the cloud. (The next time the game is launched on Steam Deck, the saved settings will be applied.)</li>
<li>When playing on a PC that supports NVIDIA DLSS, the default setting for 'Anti-Aliasing Method' is now set to 'DLSS'.</li>
<li>The DirectStorage DLL (Dynamic Link Library) has been updated to the latest version.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8490529261738580976gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>For some reason certain developers keep syncing up graphics settings to the Steam Cloud. Something that really <em>shouldn't</em> be done, as it can cause all sorts of problems when playing across different systems. In this case, moving between a PC and Steam Deck caused the Steam Deck to try and run the much higher settings. Hopefully this will no longer happen now, and hopefully in future developers will just stop doing that entirely.</p>
<p>If you missed it: Valve recently updated <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-should-work-better-on-linux-steam-deck-with-the-latest-proton-hotfix/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton Hotfix to make it run smoother on Linux / Steam Deck</a>.</p>

      <title>1997 classic adventure The Space Bar upgraded with ScummVM and Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another classic revived. The ZOOM Platform recently announced that the 1997 classic adventure The Space Bar has been upgraded to use ScummVM and there's now a Linux version to go with it.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">In the announcement the ZOOM Platform said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we first released The Space Bar, the engine source code was considered lost. However, in early 2024, the Boffo Intergalactic Games team was able to locate it. We shared the source code with the team at ScummVM to ensure this classic adventure game was preserved. The Space Bar can now be enjoyed on any ScummVM supported system. Using ScummVM, we've updated the game on <a href="https://www.zoom-platform.com/product/the-space-bar" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ZOOM Platform</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2253580/The_Space_Bar/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>. You can now run the game natively on Windows, Linux and MacOS!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More about the game: "A shapeshifting assassin is loose on the planet Armpit VI, and all signs of its whereabouts point to a local space bar, 'The Thirsty Tentacle'. You are the only human on this bizarre planet, who happens to be a telepathic detective tasked with tracking down this dangerous criminal."</p>

      <title>PS2 Emulator emulator PCSX2 should get Wayland support &#34;in the coming months&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PCSX2 is a free and open source Sony PS2 Emulator, and it seems they're working towards ensuring it has full support for Wayland on Linux.</p>
<p>Back with the 2.0 release in July 2024, the developers switched over from wxWidgets to a much more modern Qt for the interface. And now, they're looking to upgrade again to Qt 6.9 which should arrive in March, and bring with it support for the modern Wayland protocol on Linux.</p>
<p>As they announced on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pcsx2.bsky.social/post/3lh247gkfvc2q" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@PCSX2/113923210493503370" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A few of the project members are looking at Qt 6.9 as a way to finally get #Wayland working with PCSX2 on #Linux. We're going to keep testing, but we haven't found any problems so far. Qt 6.9's final release is on 18 March. We hope to see Wayland support in the coming months.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While technically it has Wayland support, in a way, it was <a href="https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/pull/10179" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">previously</a> disabled by default due to lots of issues.</p>
<p>Going by their current compatibility page there's now 97.92% of the PS2 library at least playable, with only 0.22% noting they can only get just into the menus so it's looking great.</p>

      <title>Video Game History Foundation launches a digital archive free for everyone</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Giving everyone free access to their new launch (well, it's in "early access"), the Video Game History Foundation have put up their digital archive of video game history research materials.</p>
<p>This was originally announced <a href="https://gamehistory.org/introducing-the-vghf-digital-library/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">back in late 2023</a>, the idea is to give you an easy way to access various historic collections of video game development materials, magazines, artwork, ephemera and more. There's already a huge amount of resources available in it (they say there's over "1500 full-text searchable out-of-print video game magazines—including game industry trade magazines rarely available to the public") which includes some never-before-seen game development materials.</p>
<p>Check out their announcement video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6Tysm_Wf60Q"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fbf45e9b0f1b9007a3538b514253ebf8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6Tysm_Wf60Q" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>To make it all actually work they even built a new "state-of-the-art text recognition toolset that makes even the wildest, weirdest video game magazines and promotional materials fully text-searchable". This is a wonderful initiative to ensure gaming history of all forms is not lost. Love seeing more preservation efforts like this.</p>

      <title>Physics building game Besiege gets a big 10 year anniversary update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Besiege from Spiderling Studios just had a big free upgrade for all players to celebrate the 10th anniversary.</p>
<p>More about it: Besiege is a physics building game about constructing mechanical machines to annihilate armies, obliterate castles and overcome challenging obstacles. Conquer the campaign or skirmish with friends in Multiplayer!</p>
<p>They put up a new showcase video for the event you can see below, and they said to expect other events throughout the year. A roadmap for 2025 and beyond updates is also going to be announced, as it seems they're going to continue expanding the game.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7Yk_dBLvH0g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9e5786590427c7f5aad10d265f73206c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7Yk_dBLvH0g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Update Highlights:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Steam Trading Cards, Emotes, Backgrounds, and Badges: Celebrate the Besiege journey with collectible Steam trading cards, custom emotes, backgrounds, and unique badges to showcase on your profile.</li>
<li>The Remaster of the Original Sandbox: Revisit the beloved sandbox that launched Besiege’s legacy, allowing players to relive the charm of the game’s early days while building and experimenting in a remaster of the classic environment.</li>
<li>Scoreboard System: Compete against yourself and Besiege’s other players with a brand-new scoreboard system for tracking stats and ranking the performance of your builds. From speed records to destruction efficiency, the scoreboard adds a competitive layer to the fun and the motivation to challenge yourself and refine your machines.</li>
<li>New Achievements and Campaign Content: Unlock brand-new achievements that push the boundaries of your creativity and skill and enjoy refreshing new content in some of the campaign’s classic levels.</li>
<li>Rulers in Campaign Levels: The rulers of each campaign island now exist in game, fighting alongside their armies in defence of their kingdoms. Each ruler has a unique style that brings a new layer of personality to your campaign conquests.</li>
<li>Original 2015 Early Access Version: Take a nostalgic trip to the past with access to the original 2015 Early Access version via Steam’s beta system. Relive the game’s humble beginnings and see how far it’s come.</li>
<li>Automatic Timescale Adjustment: This new innovative feature provides a smoother player experience by automatically adjusting the timescale slider, enabling slow motion during hardware-intensive moments and complex physics simulations. Say goodbye to frame rate drops and enjoy the added bonus of watching Besiege’s beautiful, chaotic, destruction in slow motion.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>"This update is more than a celebration of our game's history, it’s a thank-you to the community that has supported us for the past decade," said Spiderling Studios. "We’re proud to commemorate Besiege’s legacy with content &amp; features that blend nostalgia with innovation, enhancing the existing campaign and providing new challenges for players."</p>

      <title>The Sims and The Sims 2 officially return with a Legacy Collection for each</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The rumours were true, EA have re-released the classics. The Sims Legacy Collection and The Sims 2 Legacy Collection are live on Steam now. Both include a bunch of previously released DLC for each game.</p>
<p>Of course, since it's EA, you also have to deal with: "EA online activation and EA app software installation and background use required" and also Denuvo Anti-tamper. Should still work fine on Linux with Valve's Proton though, apart from the occasional EA app blip. Valve rated The Sims 1 as <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Steam Deck Playable, currently no rating on The Sims 2.<br/>
<em><strong>Update: 19:54 UTC</strong> - EA have removed the mention of the EA app and Denuvo on both.</em></p>
<p>The Sims Legacy Collection includes: The Sims, The Sims 4 Throwback Fit Kit. Plus The Sims packs: The Sims Livin’ Large, , The Sims House Party, The Sims Hot Date, The Sims Vacation, The Sims Unleashed, The Sims Superstar and The Sims Makin’ Magic.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16346728411738340014gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - The Sims</em></p>
<p>The Sims 2: Legacy Collection includes The Sims 2 and The Sims 4: Grunge Revival Kit, plus the following The Sims 2 packs: The Sims 2: University, The Sims 2: Nightlife, The Sims 2: Open for Business, The Sims 2: Pets, The Sims 2: Bon Voyage, The Sims 2: Seasons, The Sims 2: FreeTime, The Sims 2: Apartment Life, The Sims 2: Holiday Party Pack, The Sims 2: Family Fun Stuff, The Sims 2: Glamour Life Stuff, The Sims 2: Happy Holiday Stuff, The Sims 2: Celebration! Stuff, The Sims 2: H&amp;M Fashion Stuff, The Sims 2: Teen Style Stuff, The Sims 2: Kitchen &amp; Bath Interior Design Stuff, and The Sims 2: Mansion &amp; Garden Stuff.</p>

      <title>Warner Bros platform fighter MultiVersus goes offline for good in May</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Player First Games / Warner Bros. Games have announced that the Super Smash Bros.-like game MultiVersus is officially closing.</p>
<p>Technically, this is the second time it's being closed. It originally launched in 2022 in what they called a Beta, which they then closed in 2023, with a proper relaunch in May 2024. This time though it seems it's not going to be coming back, as they're pulling all online features and you will not be able to download it either (unless you already have it added to your library - it's a free to play game).</p>
<p>In a short and blunt <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1818750/view/509570438492325577" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Season 5 will serve as the final seasonal content update for MultiVersus. As January 31, 2025, real money transactions are no longer available. Season 5 will begin on February 4, 2025, and run through May 30, 2025. All online features will continue to be available until Season 5 concludes on May 30, at which point MultiVersus will no longer be available to play online or download. Unused Gleamium and character tokens can be used to access and purchase content in-game until the end of Season 5 on May 30. To play MultiVersus offline after May 30, download the latest version of the game and log in during Season 5, between February 4 and May 30.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7864378551738338168gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Going by <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1818750/charts/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> it doesn't have all that many players left. It's seen a steady decline after each time it was released and then re-released. While talking player numbers isn't always a useful thing, in this case it's a multiplayer-focused title so it seems fitting when you see that it had a 24 hour peak online player-count of only 648 players. Which would be mostly fine for a smaller game, but this was a game with major licensed characters.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-admits-multiversus-underperformed-contributing-to-another-100-million-hit-to-revenue-in-its-games-business" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a> last year, taken from a financial call, "MultiVersus' failure had added another $100 million to the $200 million writedown the company's games business had already suffered earlier this year". Seems they had some seriously inflated expectations for this one.</p>
<p>At least for people who like it you'll still be able to play offline. MultiVersus works on Linux with Proton and is rated Playable on Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Linux performance overlay MangoHud 0.8.0-rc1 out now for testing with Intel GPU support and lots of improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>MangoHud is a performance overlay you can use on Desktop Linux, and it's what powers the built-in overlay on Steam Deck. A new release candidate is now available for testing for an upcoming stable release with version 0.8.0-rc1.</p>
<p>This release adds a few more applications to the blacklist to stop it appearing and causing issues with them including the Ubisoft Store (UplayWebCore.exe), halloy (IRC client) and Plutonium Launcher (plutonium.exe, plutonium-launcher-win32.exe).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7912058801738327495gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7912058801738327495gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Stalker 2 on Linux with MangoHud, click image to enlarge.</em></p>
<p>If you like my simple horizontal layout you can find it on <a href="https://gist.github.com/LiamDawe/199a3341f0d91d2f306375a76ab4e7f3" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Just pop it into "~/.config/MangoHud/MangoHud.conf".</p>
<p>Also some fixes made it in including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">read_cfg</code> didn't properly overwrite config options.</li>
<li>logging would sometimes crash if it returned an empty vec.</li>
<li>fix double-logging of avg fps.</li>
<li>nvidia: warn if both nvml and xnvctrl are unavailable.</li>
<li>mangoapp didn't properly respond to hide/show hud.</li>
<li>add 32bit xkbcommon to project dependencies.</li>
<li>add missing dependencies for opensuse.</li>
<li>proper vsync implementation.</li>
<li>refactor FPS calculation in metrics.</li>
<li>fix exec, network, gpu and vram displaying incorrectly in horizontal mode.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Various other changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple GPUs can be displayed</li>
<li>Changed logger errors to debug</li>
<li>Added CPU power to logging</li>
<li>Improved wayland keybinds</li>
<li>Memory usage has been refactored to be inline with other apps</li>
<li>DLSYM is enabled by default, <code class="inline-code">MANGOHUD_DLSYM=0</code> to disable it.</li>
<li>mangoapp vulkan layer is deleted (it was a testing project and no longer in development)</li>
<li>OpenGL shim
	<ul>
<li>The shim is preloaded first instead of the opengl library</li>
<li>it checks to make sure there is an opengl context to hook before loading mangohud</li>
<li>this should resolve some crashes. More detailed information here <a href="https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud/commit/c22ced01083fd32476b0bdd8b969ee749631469a" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">c22ced0</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If using exec and inside steam runtime, launch command using <code class="inline-code">steam-runtime-launch-client</code>
<ul>
<li>If mangohud is used inside flatpak, you need to allow your app to speak on <code class="inline-code">org.freedesktop.Flatpak</code> dbus address.</li>
<li>Example if you're using mangohud in steam: <code class="inline-code">flatpak override --user --talk-name=org.freedesktop.Flatpak com.valvesoftware.Steam</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added Intel GPUs support (integrated and discrete, i915 and xe drivers)
	<ul>
<li>Temperature is only available in linux 6.13+</li>
<li>Temperature and Power Usage is not available for integrated gpus</li>
<li>VRAM and GPU Usage is per-process not per-system (that would require root rights)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Multiple GPUs support:
	<ul>
<li>By default, MangoHud displays all GPUs. To select needed GPUs, you can use <code class="inline-code">gpu_list</code> or <code class="inline-code">pci_dev</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Params</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">network_color</code> sets the color of the network hud element</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">display_server</code> shows if the display server is Xorg, Xwayland or wayland</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">gpu_list</code> set the GPUs to display in the hud e.g gpu_list=0,1</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">proc_mem</code> and <code class="inline-code">io_read</code> now works properly in gamescope (mangoapp)</li>
</ul>

      <title>Calamities are coming to Old World in the Wrath of Gods DLC plus they hit a big sales milestone</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mohawk Games have announced the Old World - Wrath of Gods is coming on March 4, which has some big new features and content, plus they've hit a nice sales milestone. Old World has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Playable by Valve.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZD4umDe1MHU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/721b434de6c45c328eae2f3bd017518c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZD4umDe1MHU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What you'll get is the big new dedicated Wrath of Gods scenario. Here you will lead your nation while heeding the ever-increasing (and conflicting) demands of their nation’s pantheon. Problem is - you can't keep them happy all the time so they will end up unleashing one of nine new calamities. The developers said "Calamities work in the base game as well (but without the gods metagame) and come with new visual and environmental effects, such as heavy flooding that can change land tiles into water or certain disasters that change the resources a tile offers".</p>
<p>There's also the new Aksum playable nation from Northeast Africa. Aksum comes with five dynasties headed by legendary figures from the nation's past along with two unique units, their own special events and more.</p>
<p>You can also expect a "smattering of general content" being added to the game as well.</p>
<p>On top of that they've revealed they've now hit 300,000 sales since the full 2022 release. Nice to see another 4x grand strategy game doing well. Especially nice that it has full Linux support too.</p>

      <title>Free tense horror game Those Who Crawl about exploring shrinking caves added Linux / Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Originally released in 2022, Hush Fin Games have upgraded the free game Those Who Crawl, which now includes Linux and Steam Deck support. They're currently working on a VR version, and decided to port over a bunch of improvements.</p>
<p>More about it: "​As you progressed through the cave tunnels, they slowly tightened until you could not even stand. Now, as you crawl, you wonder if you are not alone in the darkness. Those Who Crawl is a tense horror game about crawling and climbing through cave tunnels. Each hand is controlled individually with a unique crawling and climbing system."</p>

<p>Following on from a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/minecraft-gets-new-pigs-wildflowers-and-ambient-features-in-the-latest-beta/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previous testing snapshot update for Minecraft</a> that added in new pigs, wildflowers and ambient features there's another snapshot available for testing with more new content. <em>Head over to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/an-idiots-guide-to-setting-up-minecraft-on-steam-deck-steamos-with-controller-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my guide for installing Minecraft on Steam Deck</a>.</em></p>
<p>With this update two new cow variants are joining Minecraft with the snow biome fluffy cow, along with the auburn warm cow that can be found in sandy biomes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20311285601738324626gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Perhaps a bit more exciting is the new firefly bush. A new plant block that spawns dancing firefly particles that glow in the dark. You can also place this block below other blocks to give them a bit of a sparkle - sounds sweet. There's also a new bush block you can find across forests, birch forests, plains, windswept hills, and other green biomes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/203243241738324649gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Additionally they've further expanded the ambient sounds into the desert. This includes the chirping of crickets, rustling twigs, and howling winds. You can bring some of it with you by placing down the dead bush on two sand blocks outside, or by clustering several sand or terracotta blocks together.</p>
<p>All of the changes will be coming to first the upcoming stable 2025 update sometime hopefully soon but you can test them all in the snapshot right now in Minecraft Java.</p>

      <title>The Spell Brigade gets lots of gameplay improvements plus a UI update for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Spell Brigade is a popular survivor-like with online co-op for up to 4 players, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/the-spell-brigade-is-an-online-co-op-survivor-like-bullet-hell-friendly-fire-chaos-festival/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">it's sold well</a> and the developers continue making big improvements to it. The Spell Brigade has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>What makes it different is not just the online co-op play but the team-based objectives too, giving you a fun spin and with various overpowered spell synergies it can be a lot of fun. It's not finished though, with it being in Early Access. The latest update adds in some new content including a new lobby, two new objectives, a visual revamp of the interface, some visual tweaks and quite a lot of general gameplay improvements.</p>
<p>This includes a tweak for Steam Deck players where they "Increased the size of the XP bar, HP bar and Spell Slots to improve readability".</p>

      <title>FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH should work better on Linux / Steam Deck with the latest Proton Hotfix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Even though FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH is rated as Steam Deck Verified, it did launch with some problems on Linux / Steam Deck but Valve's Proton developers are moving quickly to improve it.</p>
<p>VKD3D-Proton, the layer that translates Direct3D 12 to Vulkan, had some updates to work around some issues that have been seen. Developer Hans-Kristian Arntzen <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/8408#issuecomment-2624835518" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">said</a> "For AMD hangs, we have two game workarounds merged now which have successfully worked around some hangs on our end at least" and those are:</p>
<ul>
<li>"<a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/pull/2319" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Add PSO retain workaround for FFVII Rebirth.</a>"</li>
<li>"<a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/pull/2320" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Workaround missing CS barrier in Rebirth.</a>"</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of those have been merged into VKD3D-Proton, and a new <strong>Proton Hotfix</strong> update has been made available, which Valve have now set as the default for FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH. So if you have set a specific Proton version on it, you should unselect it to get it to use the latest Proton Hotfix and get a more stable experience right now.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8225680071738315747gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Confused on all the Proton versions? Check out <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my guide to explain more</a>.</p>
<p>At least for AMD GPU users it will be better now but we're still waiting for NVIDIA driver updates to improve the situation there on Desktop Linux.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA Beta driver 570.86.16 released with VRR for multiple displays and lots of improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA today released the 570.86.16 Beta driver for Linux which includes various new features, and a few good bug fixes too. Quite an exciting one too since it brings support for VRR on systems with multiple displays.</p>
<p>This is a Beta driver available for preview, but it should be good enough for most gamers to use but it may also come with issues as it hasn't yet been through their full testing like their certified drivers.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>New Features and Tweaks:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added support for VRR on systems with multiple displays.</li>
<li>Updated the nvidia-settings control panel to use NVML rather than NV-CONTROL to control GPU clocks and fan speed. This allows related functionality to work when using Wayland, where the NV-CONTROL X extension is not available. Note that as a result, some operations which were previously available to unprivileged users, due to the privileges of the X server, may now require elevated privileges.</li>
<li>Added an application profile to improve performance on Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</li>
<li>Added an application profile to resolve a corruption issue on Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Assassin's Creed Mirage.</li>
<li>Implemented support for the VK_KHR_incremental_present extension.</li>
<li>Updated GPU overclocking control to be available by default in nvidia-settings, for GPU boards that support programmable clock control. Previously, this was only available when bit 3 was set in the "Coolbits" X config option.</li>
<li>Disabled a power saving feature on Ada and above generation GPUs for surfaces allocated with the DRM Dumb-Buffers API, for example, when using a DRM fbdev. The power saving feature could cause black screens for DRM Dumb-Buffers which use front buffer rendering instead of KMS flips.</li>
<li>Added support for querying Dynamic Boost status via the 'power' file in /proc/driver/nvidia/gpus/*.</li>
<li>Enabled 32 bit compatibility support for the NVIDIA GBM backend.</li>
<li>Added a new kernel module parameter, 'conceal_vrr_caps', to the nvidia-modeset kernel module. This parameter may be used to enable usage of features on some displays such as ULMB (Ultra Low Motion Blur) which are incompatible with VRR. See the "Direct Rendering Manager Kernel Modesetting" (DRM KMS) chapter of the README for further information.</li>
<li>Added /usr/share/nvidia/files.d/sandboxutils-filelist.json which lists all the driver files used by container runtime environments such as nvidia-container-toolkit and enroot.</li>
<li>Added support for the systemd suspend-then-hibernate method of system sleep. This feature requires systemd version 248 or newer.</li>
<li>Enabled the nvidia-drm fbdev=1 option by default. When supported by the kernel and the nvidia-drm modeset=1 option is enabled, nvidia-drm will replace the system's framebuffer console with one driven by DRM.<br/>
	This feature can be disabled by setting fbdev=0.</li>
<li>Implemented a feature that allows low latency display interrupts to be serviced even when the system is under heavy contention. This is especially useful for reducing stutter when using virtual reality.<br/>
	This feature is experimental and disabled by default.<br/>
	This feature can be enabled by loading nvidia.ko with the `NVreg_RegistryDwords=RMIntrLockingMode=1` kernel module parameter.</li>
<li>In Linux kernel 6.11, drm_fbdev_generic was renamed to drm_fbdev_ttm. Use drm_fbdev_ttm when present to keep supporting direct framebuffer access needed for Wayland compositors to present content on newer kernels.</li>
<li>In linux-next commit 446d0f4849b1, output_poll_changed is removed from struct drm_mode_config_funcs. Do not implement the function pointer member when not present to ensure the driver can compile with newer kernels. The driver now supports enumerating modes on hotplug events through the DRM fbdev API.</li>
<li>In linux-next commit 446d0f4849b1, intended to be included in Linux kernel 6.12, output_poll_changed is removed from struct drm_mode_config_funcs. Do not implement the function pointer member when not present to ensure the driver can compile with newer kernels. Populating modes for DRM connectors during hotplug events will not be supported with r535 and kernels containing the relevant commit.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Bug Fixes:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused the nvidia-settings control panel to crash when querying VRR attributes on some monitors.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause some Vulkan applications to crash when responding to window resize events.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause some multi-threaded OpenGL applications, for example Civilization 6, to crash when running on Xwayland.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause games to crash when the "PROTON_ENABLE_NGX_UPDATER" environment variable was set to a value of "1".</li>
<li>Fixed a bug, introduced in 555.58, where some DVI outputs would not work with HDMI monitors.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause external displays to become frozen until the next modeset when using PRIME Display Offloading with the NVIDIA dGPU acting as the display offload sink.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Open source RTS 0 A.D. Alpha 27 released bringing a new Vulkan renderer, new maps, AMD FSR and lots more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The free, open source and cross-platform RTS 0 A.D. Alpha 27 is now finally available and it brings with it a whole lot of new features and content. Alpha 26 was all the way back in 2022, so it's been a while, but it looks like the wait was worth it!</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">New features highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Vulkan Renderer.</li>
<li>Multiplayer Savegames.</li>
<li>Tips &amp; Tricks Page.</li>
<li>Naval Overhaul.</li>
<li>Observer Flares.</li>
<li>New random maps: Foothills, Migration, Coast Range; New skirmish map: Isthmus of Corinth; and updated skirmish maps: Watering Holes, Sporades Islands.</li>
<li>New and updated art.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3MhcRPm7Zhg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6c87fd27136abb6533f05e58d5d13c35.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3MhcRPm7Zhg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some more of what's new includes AMD FSR support, GPU Skinning config option that can boost FPS, various technical upgrades to their underlying tech, various civilizations should now feel more unique and more.</p>
<p>With this release they're also moving away from the Alpha label on the game. The next will simply be known as "Release 28". They mentioned how the game at this stage is "polished in many aspects, sometimes more so than some released professional strategy games, but not feature-complete", noting how the gaming industry as a whole has changed since their early releases with Early Access and so they don't really feel the "Alpha-Beta-Release plan" doesn't seem relevant for them now. Plus, they would plan to continue after the "final release" as well.</p>
<p>For developers, they also finally moved from SVN to a more modern <a href="https://gitea.wildfiregames.com/0ad/0ad" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Git</a> that they said "allows us to leverage powerful tools of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery, improving the stability and the quality of the game during development".</p>
<p>Their team will also be present at the upcoming <a href="https://fosdem.org/2025/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">FOSDEM 2025</a> event. See all in their <a href="https://play0ad.com/new-release-0-a-d-alpha-27-agni/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>.</p>
<p><em>Hopefully it won't be long before the Linux packages are updated.</em></p>

      <title>Free bite-sized photography platformer Batography out now on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's short, it's cute, it's free with Linux support and it's out now on Steam. Batography is a photography platformer where you play as a curious bat on their mission to take a full-fledged photo of the moon. Here you will run, climb, glide and snap your way through an array of obstacles while interacting with the cheeky characters in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Created by SporkTank, that's mostly just solo developer Martin Stradling, it was previously released on itch.io and they also made the puzzle game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2278300/A_Symmetric_Escape/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">A Symmetric Escape</a>. Batography was developed as a way to get his younger cousins involved in game development. The game was developed as a small side project whilst working on the upcoming <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2984850/Rita/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Rita</a>, which was chosen for the PAX Aus Indie Showcase.</p>
<p>"While working on Rita (a game heavily inspired by family), I thought it would be nice to get a project that was actually created with family on to Steam!" Martin shared, "So here it is, a beautiful little side-scroller with sassy characters and some hidden extras. I hope you enjoy!"</p>

      <title>Put your thinking cap on for Fallacy Quiz a game that will test your reasoning skills</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Released back in December that I missed, developer Tim Krief put up Fallacy Quiz, a game that tests your ability to identify misleading or incorrect reasoning. The developer emailed to note how it was made using free and open source tools on Linux with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot</a>.</p>
<p>From the developer: "Fallacy Quiz is a game for Windows and Linux, that tests your ability to identify misleading or incorrect reasoning, also known as fallacies. Players can improve their critical thinking skills and better recognize deceptive arguments in everyday situations. They’ll be presented with various statements and must determine if they are valid or fallacious, or even identify specific fallacies in expert mode."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Ajm-r5ppUwA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/530e6a930bfa8c280ed1403a27bf22f9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Ajm-r5ppUwA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Solo or local multiplayer gameplay: Up to four players can play together. Two players can play on the same keyboard.</li>
<li>A lot of content: 200 questions.</li>
<li>A great variety of fallacies: 50 different fallacy types.</li>
<li>A virtual 3D book: The fallacies have definitions available in a glossary that the player can flip through as if it was a real one.</li>
<li>Two difficulty levels: In expert mode, the player must not only identify if a statement is fallacious but they must also select the specific type of fallacy.</li>
<li>A custom mode: Players can choose the difficulty, the number of rounds and questions and disable the timer if they want.</li>
<li>Achievements to unlock!</li>
<li>Available in English and in French.</li>
<li>Full controller support.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It just last week had a major update too adding in a 3D virtual notebook to flip through achievements, there's a new question history screen, a secret third difficulty option, new game settings and various fixes.</p>

      <title>The End of the Sun is a Slavic fantasy time-travel adventure out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for a fresh and unusual experience? The End of the Sun is out now with Linux support taking you across time in this Slavic fantasy adventure.</p>
<p>More about it: "The End of the Sun is a first-person, adventure, story-driven mystery game, set in the fantasy world of Slavic beliefs, legends, and mythical creatures. The small village becomes a place of enigmatic events, through which the line between myth and reality begins to fade perilously."</p>
<p>Check out the new launch trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="dbtvQ59zoqE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/422dda428627e7785b5e46429ad6a390.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/dbtvQ59zoqE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Photogrammetry of ethnographic museums – To get unique graphics, we visited ethnographic museums. We scanned hundreds of objects and entire buildings, so you can admire them in the game the way they actually are.</li>
<li>Time travel – Teleport between four main seasons far away from each other by many years. Get to know the stories of the same heroes at different stages of their lives. Use your power to solve the mystery!</li>
<li>Non-linear and engaging story – Experience particular immersive stories at your own pace and at the moment you feel like it.</li>
<li>Consequences of time manipulation – Set the paths of fate and bring the course of events back on the right track to discover further fragments of the game world and story. Events from the past have an impact on the future.</li>
<li>Slavic culture – Enjoy not only the immersive story but also look at the long-forgotten everyday activities and objects that are no longer used today.</li>
<li>Exploration and Open World – Travel between the homesteads and the surroundings of the village, discovering pieces of the mystery that lies somewhere there.</li>
<li>Dynamic environment – The time of day, weather, and lighting change smoothly and dynamically right before your eyes as you discover parts of the mystery.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It has full voice acting full English and Polish with subtitles available for German, Spanish, Russian, French, Czech, Simplified Chinese, Italian, and Ukrainian.</p>
<p>The developer did send over a key and the Linux version runs fine, although you'll need a good system to run it on as even at 1080p on Medium it was often struggling to hit 60FPS on my Radeon 6800 XT. Featuring lots of quite beautiful scenery, and a story that really captures your attention (although it's slow going) from the very beginning. Full of mystery, the story is centred around a small valley and village where a creature resembling the mythical Phoenix which appears to be setting things ablaze. The time-travelling mechanic is interesting too, with you seeing the way time moves as you interact with the world. </p>
<p>The End of the Sun is a slow but thoughtful and thoroughly interesting adventure.</p>

      <title>NTSYNC driver support heads to Wine in a new Merge Request</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the NTSYNC driver landing <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/ntsync-for-proton-wine-now-in-linux-kernel-6-14-that-should-make-many-steamos-users-happy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ready for the Linux kernel 6.14 release</a>, there's now an open <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/merge_requests/7226" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Merge Request</a> to actually hook up support for it in Wine.</p>
<p>Opened by developer Elizabeth Figura, the request notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This introduces a faster implementation of signal and wait operations on NT events, semaphores, and mutexes, which improves performance to native levels for a wide variety of games and other applications.</p>
<p>The goal here is similar to the long-standing out-of-tree "esync" and "fsync" patch sets, but without the flaws that make those patch sets not upstreamable.</p>
<p>The Linux "ntsync" driver is not currently released. It has been accepted into the trunk Linux tree for 6.14, so barring any extraordinary circumstances, the API is frozen and it will be released in its current form in about 2 months. Since it has passed all relevant reviewers on the kernel side, and the API is all but released, it seems there is no reason any more not to submit the Wine side to match.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully we shall see it soon in a fresh Wine development release. There's a few comments on it, and no doubt more will come as the code gets reviewed, so it will likely need some tweaks before it gets accepted into Wine.</p>
<p>Once ready and you have both an up to date version of Wine and Linux kernel 6.14+, you'll hopefully then get the benefits of improved Windows game compatibility on Linux. And, compared to plain Wine, better performance too. Eventually then we'll see it in a new release of Valve's Proton.</p>

      <title>Next-gen construction simulation RoadCraft gets a new trailer and release date</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From the teams that gave us the popular SnowRunner and MudRunner, the next-gen construction simulation RoadCraft is looking great. I had a lot of fun getting stuck in SnowRunner, so I can't wait to see how their tech has advanced since then.</p>
<p>From the press release: "RoadCraft takes Saber’s expertise in off-road and construction simulation to new heights, introducing the studio’s first heavy-machinery simulation. Powered by a cutting-edge physics engine, players will interact with the environment like never before in an immersive experience that seamlessly blends driving, operating construction machinery, and managing reconstruction resources."</p>

      <title>Collabora take over libsurvive development an open source VR lighthouse tracking system</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Collabora have announced they've taken over development of libsurvive, an open source lighthouse tracking system for VR. It's now moved over to their <a href="https://github.com/collabora/libsurvive" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> to continue to expand.</p>
<p>The developers at Collabora continue working on Monado, the cross-platform open source OpenXR runtime that works across Android, Linux and Windows. So this seems like a perfect fit to add.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/welcoming-the-libsurvive-project.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> written by developer Frederic Plourde:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Collabora's involvement in Open Source XR development continues to grow today as we welcome the <a href="https://github.com/collabora/libsurvive" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">libsurvive project</a> into the fold! The open source lighthouse tracking system is entering an exciting new chapter as it transitions its ownership over to our GitHub organization where we will have two members from our XR team as official maintainers.</p>
<p>Due to other commitments, the previous maintainers have decided to step back and pass the torch to ensure the project continues to thrive. We are grateful for their contributions and look forward to supporting the project as much as we can.</p>
<p>Libsurvive is a set of open source tools and libraries that enable 6 dof tracking on lighthouse and vive-based systems, and can run on any device. It currently supports both SteamVR 1.0 and SteamVR 2.0 generation of devices, and is also easily usable with <a href="https://monado.dev/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Monado</a>, the cross-platform, open source XR runtime.</p>
<p>This is an exciting moment to further push 6 dof tracking for all devices in a true, open source fashion. Catch us on the <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/7QbCAGS" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">libsurvive Discord</a> to stay in the loop for the latest news!</p>

      <title>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II from Warhorse Studios confirmed playable on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is quickly approaching release and it's looking good, to the point that Warhorse Studios have announced that it will be playable on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>So far they seem to have only announced it on social media site X, with nothing noted on the Steam page, and there's no official rating posted from Valve yet. Going by their wording, I expect it will see the yellow <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Steam Deck Playable notice and not be Verified.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5335874831738229586gol1.png"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Warhorse Studios on X</em></p>
<p>This is of course good news for all other Linux systems too, since if it's playable on Steam Deck, you should have no problem running it on Desktop Linux with Valve's Proton.</p>
<p>A recent story trailer can be seen below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vPS-pgg3scE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9dc82061f9e9f3e32116b07cf8befddd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vPS-pgg3scE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is a true sequel to its predecessor but developed and written in such a way that it is perfect for newcomers and longtime fans alike.</p>
<p>Diving back into the heart-pounding world of 15th Century Bohemia (Central Europe), Kingdom Come: Deliverance II picks up where its predecessor left off, thrusting players into the shoes of Henry, the steadfast son of a blacksmith, embroiled in a tumultuous tale of vengeance, betrayal and self-discovery.</p>
<p>In this gripping sequel, players will traverse a meticulously crafted medieval landscape, from the humble confines of a blacksmith's forge to the grandeur of royal courts, all while navigating the treacherous currents of a kingdom torn apart by civil war.</p>

      <title>Relaxed factory automation sim Learning Factory 1.0 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A few years in Early Access and it's now complete. Luden.io have released the 1.0 update for Learning Factory, a chilled factory building automation sim about supplying cats on Mars with everything they need. It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>More about it: "Learning Factory is a relaxing automation game, which lets you concentrate on the most important task in the Universe: making cats happy again. You're a humble genius scientist who gets invited to become the chief engineer at an abandoned Factory on Mars, designed to produce and sell exquisite goods for cats. It was conceived to learn everything about cats and make them happy, but it is desolated now, and cats are leaving Factory Stores unhappy and empty-pawed."</p>
<p>Check out the release trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="PDDGuagYU68"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/531242365ac697bd82c6ae12c68b5ed3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/PDDGuagYU68" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Renovate an abandoned factory on Mars.</li>
<li>Design and automate production chains.</li>
<li>Produce and sell exquisite goods to cats.</li>
<li>Collect and analyze data with Machine Learning.</li>
<li>Scale and make the factory more efficient.</li>
<li>Make cats happy!</li>
<li>Rebuild the ancient Monument.</li>
<li>Establish Catopia in the feline society!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Much like their previous game, the acclaimed puzzle game about machine learning while True: learn(), Learning Factory is backed by specialists in the subject, and implements real-world machine learning models.</p>
<p>I checked it out years ago and was quite impressed with it and since it has expanded massively. The game now has a Very Positive rating on Steam too.</p>

      <title>PlayStation Network requirement on PC will now be optional with in-game rewards</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sony have announced that their PC game releases will no longer force a PlayStation Network Account requirement. Instead it will be optional and give you certain in-game rewards.</p>
<p>As announced in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/29/new-in-game-content-incentives-coming-to-playstation-games-on-pc/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Starting with tomorrow’s release of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 for PC, we’re working to add more benefits to playing with an account for PlayStation Network. The Last of Us Part II Remastered (coming April 3, 2025), in addition to God of War Ragnarök and Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, will all soon be adding in-game content unlocks for PlayStation Network account users.</p>
<p><strong>An account for PlayStation Network will become optional for these titles on PC.</strong> Players who still opt to sign into a PlayStation Network account will also enjoy added benefits like trophies and friend management.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Emphasis ours.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7289801061738169185gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Marvel's Spider-Man 2</em></p>
<p>They've also revealed the first few benefits for signing in:</p>
<table class="table-stripes-tbody">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</strong></td>
<td>Early unlock suits: the Spider-Man 2099 Black Suit and the Miles Morales 2099 Suit</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong></td>
<td>Gain access to the Armor of the Black Bear set for Kratos at the first Lost Items chest in the Realm Between Realms (previously only accessible in a New Game+ run) and a resource bundle (500 Hacksilver and 250 XP)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The Last of Us Part II Remastered</strong></td>
<td>+50 points to activate bonus features and unlock extras<br/>
<br/>
			Jordan’s Jacket from Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet as a skin for Ellie</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</strong></td>
<td>Gain access to Nora Valiant outfit</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This is a most unexpected move but an incredibly welcome one. It caused various regions to be unable to even buy some of their PC releases but even worse, requiring an online account for single-player games should never be a thing. Nice to see some sense come back to Sony. Hopefully this will mean the region restrictions on purchases can also be lifted.</p>
<p>Sony have clearly learned some lessons, likely a fair bit from the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/helldivers-2-sees-over-130k-bad-reviews-on-steam-as-sony-double-down/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">backlash</a> they had with Helldivers 2 that eventually forced them to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/sony-gives-up-on-forcing-playstation-network-for-helldivers-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">drop the requirement</a>.</p>

      <title>DOOM + DOOM II adds multiplayer mod support but it&#39;s broken on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 29/01/25 - 18:42 UTC</strong> - An update has been released that appears to have already solved the issue. Nice to see such a quick turnaround direct from the developer on this one!</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>The updated version of DOOM + DOOM II that bundles them together with enhancements from id Software / Nightdive Studios, Bethesda just got Update #2 with more improvements for playing with mods.</p>
<p>With this new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2280/view/500563239247021416" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> they've added support for mods during online play. They say game hosts need to activate it before entering the multiplayer menu, with other players needing to subscribe to the mod before joining a match. Mods for the game collection must be made with either "Vanilla DOOM, DeHackEd, MBF21 or BOOM" to be compatible.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11643986341738168559gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Various other changes also came with the update including:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Resolved an issue in which some red doors did not display as red on the automap</li>
<li>Fixed multiple crashes reported by the community when loading game saves</li>
<li>Improved text line wrapping legibility for mod descriptions in Asian languages</li>
<li>Removed map prefix from intermission screen to be consistent with original game behavior</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Multiplayer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added spectator mode when players are dead and waiting to respawn in co-op mission play (it can also be initiated manually from the scoreboard button)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in which disabling the crosshair would also turn off player name and co-op respawn text display</li>
<li>There are now more than 4 player colors available in game and on scoreboards</li>
<li>Resolved an issue in which players would lose weapons when respawning in co-op using modern rules</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in which the cross-platform friends menu could not be properly backed out of when no friends were available</li>
<li>Further optimized multiplayer networking code</li>
<li>Addressed crosshair centering issue in certain splitscreen configurations</li>
<li>Intermission animations now run at the correct speed in splitscreen mode</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Modsl</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The mod downloader can now process more than the first 100 subscribed mods</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>However, there's also <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2280/discussions/0/595139432990916051/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reports</a> that it has been <strong><em>broken</em></strong> on Steam Deck. Causing the developer to add the previous update as a Steam Beta (no password) and edit their update announcement for anyone affected while they work on a solution.</p>
<p>Initially I got a bit confused, because both singleplayer and online play worked fine on both Desktop Linux and Steam Deck. But it's specifically playing <em>with</em> mods that causes the problem. As soon as you've got even a single mod downloaded, the game will no longer run and leads to this error:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21083205011738168103gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21083205011738168103gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>I've noted it in the Proton GitHub <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/1534#issuecomment-2622085337" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">bug report</a> with log files from both systems, so hopefully Valve developers can track down the issue in Proton.</p>

      <title>No Man&#39;s Sky - Worlds Part II brings Gas Giants, New Story Missions, Trillions of New Planets</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hello Games have given us another almighty whopper of an update to No Man's Sky here. The scale was already impressive and now it's just completely ridiculous. According to Managing Director Sean Murray they've added in "billions of new solar systems and trillions of new planets".</p>
<p>Just a short look over what's new includes: new landscapes like mountains and deep valleys, a new class of purple star with countless new worlds to explore along with a new story, water rendering was enhanced further, deeper oceans with various aquatic lifeforms (and a scary deep water guardian), inventory sorting at the tap of a button, gas giants, a new narrative-mission, dense jungles, new local environmental hazards, a new game mode that removes all alien lifeforms, improved modding, faster game loading and so much more.</p>
<p>First up is the main trailer:</p>

<p>I'm absolutely going to have to make some time to play more soon. Can't wait to explore it all. No Man's Sky works on Linux with Proton and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Strategy business sim Summer Islands a spiritual successor to Holiday Island from 1996 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Summer Islands from Marttalin Games is a real-time strategy business simulator and after a few years of Early Access the 1.0 release is out now.</p>
<p>Clearly inspired by the classic Holiday Island, a classic from 1996. Summer Islands takes the same idea, and the same visual style, and made what you could call a spiritual successor to it. There's plenty of differences though it's not just a modern clone.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_Kv1ACQHLq4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8f23de49294b422802a87c1508a90e6c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_Kv1ACQHLq4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can create an almost infinite number of maps with different seeds. One island, several or the Summer Islands mode. From small 100x100 maps up to 1500x1500 maps. From high mountains or just sandy islands. You'll be building up the perfect island resort filling it up with hotels, restaurants and various other tourist attractions. While also managing your income, debts, natural disasters and potential sabotage from opponents.</p>
<p>This is a classically designed building sim like the earlier Sim City, Holiday Island, Transport Tycoon and other similar games.</p>
<p><span style="background-color:var(--article-main-background); color:var(--font-color); font-size:16px">I actually <em>loved</em> Holiday Island, I remember fondly how it hooked me for weeks when I first discovered it a great many years ago when I still had hair. Nice to see smaller developers bringing back such similar games.</span></p>

      <title>Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter is out now and looks fantastic</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Available with Linux support, Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter has launched from Odd Bug Studio and it looks like another hit. It's also Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>More: "Fully narrated by RPG-legend, Doug Cockle, prepare to embark on an epic adventure across the northern realms of the Ratdom; an expansive, frost-bitten land on the brink of all-out war. Track down and defeat the legendary monsters of this realm, and be rewarded with rare resources with which to craft devastating equipment. But be warned, these colossal creatures won’t go down without a fight… and then some."</p>
<p>Check out the launch trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZshLNCVGmz0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/91dc6338dd901aa10a0b18a56695bfd4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZshLNCVGmz0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Regretfully I simply haven't had time for this one personally, haven't even finished the first game yet. But both of them appear to be well worth grabbing. It's shot up quickly to a Very Positive rating on Steam.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explore a vast, wintry kingdom:</strong> Fully narrated by RPG legend Doug Cockle <em>(The Witcher </em>franchise, <em>Alan Wake 2</em>, <em>Baldur’s Gate 3)</em> prepare to embark on an epic adventure across the northern realm and biomes of the Ratdom; an expansive, frost-bitten land on the brink of all-out war.</li>
<li><strong>Hunt down giant beasts: </strong>Track down and defeat 15 legendary beasts of the Ratdom’s northern frontier and be rewarded with rare resources with which to craft devastating equipment. But be warned, these colossal creatures won’t go down without a fight… and then some.</li>
<li><strong>Unleash the power of gods: </strong>Unlock the power of the four deities and unleash their powerful ‘Elementa’ spells in combat; harness the magics of fire, poison, ice, and electric upon the damned malevolent Dark Wings!</li>
<li><strong>Master challenging combat: </strong> Face down the Dark Wing threat in deadly battles; let the devilish bats taste steel of blade and spear, or attack at range with bolts and arrows… and set elemental traps against these marauding foes <em>(and adjust the difficulty at any point if it’s getting *too* much of a challenge – we won’t judge!)</em></li>
<li><strong>Improved base building: </strong>Construct and upgrade the devastated Rat fortress of Winter’s Edge to gain access to more powerful items from the smithy, tastier meals at the kitchen, a wider range of powerful traps from the shoppe, and more!</li>

      <title>Lucky Tower Ultimate is hilarious and now Steam Deck Verified with a big update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Probably one of the funniest games I've had the pleasure of playing over the last year, Lucky Tower Ultimate is a gem and worth a go. Now even more so. I wrote about my appreciation of this one <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/lucky-tower-ultimate-is-an-absurdly-funny-dungeon-crawler-you-need-to-play/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in November last year</a>, noting how easy a recommendation it was. </p>
<p>What is it: "Lucky Tower Ultimate is a roguelite adventure game infused with slapstick humor and a hand-drawn aesthetic, where each run feels like an immersive cartoon. It continues the cult classic Flash game series about choosing between three mysterious doors. The Lucky Tower beckons seasoned fans and new players alike to experience the unique pleasure of getting all geared up just to slip on a banana peel and die."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7105846881738150486gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>As of last week, it got bumped up to Steam Deck Verified thanks to upgrades to the game. The developer also <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1700270/announcements/detail/521955337470739286" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> another update that's big on the technical side but sounds good for the long-term health of the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>New Backup System</strong></p>
For this update, we added a lot of safety fallbacks and a whole new backup system to keep your files even safer! For most of you, nothing will actually change, but we did implement a few things to ensure the safety of your progress, so here's a short overview:<br/>
<p><strong>Auto Save</strong></p>
Since some people reported crashes or weird behavior when using Alt + F4, we implemented a brand new autosave feature. While you're in the village, the game will create a backup every two minutes. This way, even if your computer crashes, your progress should still be saved.<br/>
<p><strong>Daily Backups</strong></p>
Your data will now also be saved into a separate daily backup folder. Your most recent save files will be copied into this folder, saving the newest data for the last five consecutive days you've played the game. This is just an additional backup, as long as nothing breaks, you don't need to worry about this folder, but you can use the files to restore your progress if needed!<br/>
<p><strong>Local Backups</strong></p>
<p>Before this update, every file was saved in the Steam Cloud, now we're also creating local backups. You don't need to worry about these, it's just an additional safety net. If somehow Steam Cloud messes with your files, you can copy your local files into the proper folder manually and restore what Steam destroyed!<br/>
<br/>
All of these features should help prevent broken or corrupted save files, create regular safety backups, and allow you to manually restore your files in case your computer crashes or Steam Cloud is messing with your files.<br/>
<br/>
Please note, that many people (players and developers alike) have problems with the Steam Cloud sometimes not properly syncing files between different computers. We tried our best to create the best possible backup system for you guys!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am very much looking forward to another attempt to beat it soon. Really good fun.</p>

      <title>Awesome free retro RPG Moonring gets another big update - looking good on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Moonring originally released back in 2023 from the co-creator of the Xbox's Fable series, it's free, has a lot of good reviews and now it should be even better for all players. The developer has steadily continued to upgrade the game since release, with this being "build 900".</p>
<p>More about it: "Moonring is a retro-inspired open-world, turn-based, tile RPG in the style of the classic Ultima games, but created from the ground up with modern design sensibilities. The world's geography is hand-designed, but the deadly dungeons beneath the surface reconfigure each time you leave... or die. Travel, trade, sneak, fight and sail the world of Caldera. Speak with the townsfolk, learn Caldera's secrets, and challenge the Archon for his throne... or even overthrow the Gods themselves!"</p>
<p>If you love your classics but appreciate the modern touches, this is definitely one for you. It works well on Linux with Proton and is Steam Deck Verified on Steam. There's also a Linux version on the itch.io page (but not Steam).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/183819801738146799gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/183819801738146799gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Moonring on Desktop Linux</em></p>
<p>In the latest update the developer noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Welcome to build 900. Yes, really. So much has changed since last year.<br/>
<br/>
I've held off doing this for the longest time because there are a LOT of you out there, and I didn't want to deal with a huge influx of issues at one time. This way, I've tested the game out on a smaller (more insane) audience and annoyed them instead of all of you.<br/>
<br/>
Those on the experimental branch will be well aware of this, but the rest of you are in for a big surprise. Well, several actually.<br/>
<br/>
- the UI has had a complete overhaul<br/>
- the dungeon generator was thrown away and started again from scratch<br/>
- there are lots of new dungeon features, too<br/>
- minor ruins are now far more interesting<br/>
- the Traders have been replaced with far more varied Events (which also include traders)<br/>
- the map is way more helpful<br/>
- the balance of the game is a little more challenging, with way fewer exploits<br/>
- armour makes more sense<br/>
- the Steamdeck version is actually really nice<br/>
<br/>
...and so much more.<br/>
<br/>
I personally think the game has never been better, more stable, or more of a retro ego-stroking exerc... I mean goose-filled nightmare.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Testing it on Steam Deck today and it's looking really good there. The Steam page doesn't say so but it <em>does</em> have full controller support with the correct icons and all.</p>

      <title>System76 Meerkat Mini PC gets a nice upgrade with Intel Core Ultra</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hardware vendor and Pop!_OS Linux distribution developer System76 have revealed the brand new upgraded Meerkat Mini PC. This new fancy refresh gives you up to an Intel Core Ultra 7 155H processor with Intel ARC graphics.</p>
<p>This new refresh also brings with it System76 Open Firmware that they say brings "fast boot times and tighter security" powered by coreboot. From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While the mini Meerkat only occupies a 4.5-inch square of desk space, it can also occupy zero. Dorm dwellers, Clutter Clydes, and Neat Nathans can use a VESA mount to hide the Meerkat behind their monitor, saving precious space to gain the upper hand against the forces of messiness.</p>

      <title>The new trailer for sandbox strategy game Antimatter shows off the epic scale</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Back in 2020 the strategy game Antimatter sure looked exciting during the Kickstarter, with the developer steadily building up all the promised features.</p>
<p>To begin 2025, they've put up a new showcase trailer of various bits done on the game during 2024. The trailer really helps to show off the immense scale of it. The kind of mega scale you don't see many games try and it does look like it will be quite an interesting one to play.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AZ1HwH0pp2c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c90ae6f72a9f93e55c852b6ff445015b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AZ1HwH0pp2c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>One bit shared in the recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1343010/view/508444538590725207" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> on Steam, that some players might frown upon, is that they're using the "GPT API" to translate the game into various languages. As they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have initiated localization of the game and about 1500 string keys are bound already. I am glad to say that the game and all mods will be very easy to translate (a single file).<br/>
I speak French and can muddle through a bit of English, so both languages are included as core languages.<br/>
<br/>
For the rest of the languages, I wrote a program that automatically translates the game through the GPT API by incorporating already translated languages and context. The more core languages, the better the generated translations will be. I am confident that after some training, most languages will have a proper translation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps they will earn enough from it to get real translations done by people who actually understand context and the languages properly.</p>
<p>They're not giving an update on when it will release but in a previous update said "All I can say is that the game, the software, is in excellent technical shape, and I am very optimistic".</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A procedurally generated and dynamic universe with thousands of systems to explore, where dozens of factions struggle for power or survival.</li>
<li>Take command of a spaceship, trade, mine, harvest, scavenge, produce, and participate in the simulated economy.</li>
<li>Manage an existing city or found new colonies and outposts on any planet.</li>
<li>Climb the political ladder of a commercial or sovereign organization.</li>
<li>Interact with AI characters who are living independent and simulated life in the Antimatter universe.</li>
<li>Terraform entire planets by altering their atmospheric compositions.</li>
<li>Fulfil missions for corporations, factions, or individuals, or unravel the secrets of this galaxy.</li>
<li>Get involved in the Antimatter Crisis and try to change the course of history.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Survival horror Chernobylite updated for better Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While working on Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone, developer The Farm 51 have gone back and further enhanced Chernobylite Complete Edition to bring some Steam Deck improvements.</p>
<p>What is it? According to the dev: "Chernobylite is a science-fiction survival horror RPG. Set in the hyper-realistic, 3D-scanned wasteland of Chernobyl’s Exclusion Zone, explore a non-linear storyline in your search to uncover the truth of your tortured past."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="fobhrngLLk0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1da29ce629b4be3e3c0c251d105ae77b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/fobhrngLLk0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1016800/announcements/detail/532087167537644004" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> was released on January 21st that I spotted today:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Default Config Performance optimized for Steam Deck.</li>
<li>Text Legibility - some texts increased in size and the whole UI upscaled by 20% to provide better readability of texts.</li>
<li>External Controller support so that the game does not have to be restarted after attaching other controller</li>
<li>Default Sound Device change to better suit the needs of the device.</li>
<li>Some options excluded from Steam Deck like changing fullscreen/windowed mode to avoid problems with video.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Like a few other developers, it's hiding things on Steam Deck that isn't usually going to be used. You should however be able to override their Steam Deck detection (for whatever reason) using <code class="inline-code">SteamDeck=0 %command%</code> as a launch option if they're doing it the same as other developers.</p>
<p>Perhaps this update will see the game get bumped up from Playable to Verified.</p>

      <title>The latest Two Point Museum trailer shows off Museum Management</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Releasing with Linux support on March 4, Two Point Museum has a brand new trailer to showcase Museum Management and more.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two Point Museum takes players into a realm where art meets antics, and exhibits collide with occasionally questionable management choices. To ensure aspiring curators are well equipped to run their own museum empire when Two Point Museum launches on March 4th, 2025, this video gives an overview of all the intricacies and foibles of management.</p>
<p>Running a museum is a balancing act of epic proportions. Money comes from ticket sales, donations, and the perfectly reasonable prices at the gift shop. But beware – arranging expeditions, marketing, workshops, decorations, training, and all those other pesky expenses could put you in the red. Fortunately, loans and sponsorships are always available as backup, though they come with their own risks.</p>
<p>A major component of any curator's management duties is overseeing their staff. They are the backbone of any museum… and occasionally its biggest headache. Experts analyse and maintain exhibits, janitors handle messes and workshop builds, assistants manage ticket booths, gift shops and expeditions while security protects exhibits, donations and the peace. Skilled staff come at a price, so museum managers must keep those pay checks flowing or risk facing their wrath. So, who’s up for the challenge?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See the new trailer below:</p>

<p>While it releases for everyone on March 4th, they also have Advanced Access starting on February 27th if you buy the more expensive Explorer Edition.</p>

<p>For Dying Light they said: "Even after 10 years we are working on a new update for the game. It still looks great but we wanted to squeeze a little bit more out of it. Free for all Dying Light owners, the 10th anniversary update will increase the visual quality and will feature a remastered soundtrack."</p>
<p>They didn't give a date on when other than "very soon".</p>

<p>Both games have big discounts right now, with Dying Light 2 having its biggest discount so far since release.</p>
<p>Dying Light also has a few in-game events over the next few weeks, along with a free time-limited DLC you can claim on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3454290/Dying_Light__10th_Anniversary_Bundle/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Dying Light 2 also has some special in-game rewards you can get, and a new Tower Raid permanent rogue-lite mode will be added to the game with a fresh update sometime in late February.</p>

      <title>Steam / Steam Deck Beta update will no longer bug friends in-game when you reconnect</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released another smaller Steam Client Beta update for Desktop / Steam Deck, with a little tweak for in-game notifications amongst some other bug fixes.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/523081237389116486?snr=2___" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a> is the same across Steam Desktop and Steam Deck:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When reconnecting to Steam (including when resuming from suspend), in game notifications will no longer appear for friends currently in a game.</li>
<li>Fixed the Backup Game Files dialog sometimes failing to complete.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Big Picture</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an error when receiving a voice chat invite.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed L3/R3 buttons not working on fightsticks or other devices that don't have left/right stick analog axes</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: This client update was re-released to fix a regression when opening the standlone on-screen keyboard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A useful tweak to the notifications, since they could end up a bit spammy once you have quite a few friends. If some were having issues, it could end up filling up your notifications. If you even have them turned on that is.</p>

      <title>NTSYNC for Proton / Wine now in Linux kernel 6.14 that &#34;Should make many SteamOS users happy&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems like the upcoming Linux kernel 6.14 release is going to be a nice one for gamers on Linux / Steam Deck, as the NTSYNC code has now been properly merged in ready.</p>
<p>Developer Greg Kroah-Hartman sent in the <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/Z5fJmQlVQmnnqAC4@kroah.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">request</a>, which was then <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=13845bdc869f136f92ad3d40ea09b867bb4ce467" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">accepted</a> by Linus Torvalds. Amongst other things it includes the completed and enabled NTSYNC driver. As a refresher: Proton already has the likes of Esync and Fsync, which are ways to match certain behaviour expected by Windows games. This new NTSYNC driver directly in the Linux kernel should be more accurate and give better compatibility overall.</p>
<p>For plain Wine there's a big performance benefit, but for Valve's Proton it will mostly be around the same. However, we may see some better compatibility in certain games. The performance difference versus plain Wine that were <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20241213193511.457338-1-zfigura@codeweavers.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shown off before</a> across different systems:</p>

      <title>Iron Roads is a cute-looking rail network optimisation sim out in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love your building and management sims? Iron Roads puts a rather cute looking style on it and it's now available with Linux support in Early Access. Developed by Cowleyfornia Studios, who also made the narrative games We'll always have Paris and Sarawak.</p>
<p>More about it: Iron Roads is a top-down 2D train management game with a focus on optimising train networks. With a minimalistic interface that stays out of your way while you set up complex networks, while remaining approachable for new players. They said they're aiming for the accessibility of Mini Metro and the depth of games such as OpenTTD and Opus Magnum, while also capturing the irreverent tone of games like the Two Point series and Let's Build a Zoo.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_63znauDUD8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2b9b91cafc6867b3476798e829e3c8a0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_63znauDUD8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Board game like mechanics</strong> For example, Iron Roads has resource tokens rather than money. These can be earned by growing towns or completing contracts, and need to be used strategically to expand networks and progress the game.</li>
<li><strong>Procedural music</strong> Music in Iron Roads is a combination of notes generated from trains and passengers, and authored melodies. The music generated is as unique as the layouts built by players.</li>
<li><strong>Performance graphs</strong> The main goal of Iron Roads is to optimise the train networks, so charts are available to analyse data relating to finances and passengers.</li>
<li><strong>3 Game modes</strong> Scenarios are hand crafted levels with unique gameplay elements; in the time-based challenges you must transport as many passengers as possible in a fixed period of time; there is also a free play mode where you can build your network and transport passengers free of any constraints.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer previously mentioned to me how a lot of it was developed on Linux too. Their roadmap also includes controller support and proper Steam Deck support coming later.</p>

      <title>Originally PS5 exclusive Team NINJA are bringing Rise of the Ronin to PC in March</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rise of the Ronin from Team NINJA and KOEI TECMO has now been confirmed to be launching on Steam and it's coming soon too. It was originally released on the PlayStation 5 back in March 2024, the Steam release arrives on March 11.</p>
<p>More about it: An open-world RPG set in the Bakumatsu period, where players take on the role of a ronin forging their own destiny. The game features multiple possible endings, allowing players to choose which faction to support—such as the anti-shogunate faction, pro-shogunate faction, or Western forces—which significantly alters the story's outcome.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The PC release will include new features including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>8K resolution support.</li>
<li>DirectX 12 Ultimate support.</li>
<li>Ultra-wide and super ultra-wide monitor compatibility.</li>
<li>120FPS support.</li>
<li>Ray tracing support.</li>
<li>3D audio support.</li>
<li>Customizable keyboard and mouse controls.</li>
<li>AMD Fidelity FX Super Resolution support.</li>
<li>NVIDIA DLSS and Reflex support.</li>
<li>UI menu with mouse clickability.</li>
<li>Intel XeSS graphics technology support.</li>
</ul>

<p>What a great time for PC gamers. Consoles are seeing less exclusives. Although the titles still take a while to come onto PC, we're getting a steady flow of them now. And thanks to Valve's Proton, it should hopefully run well on Linux platforms.</p>

      <title>AMPLITUDE announce ENDLESS Legend 2 with publishing from Hooded Horse</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AMPLITUDE Studios have announced ENDLESS Legend 2 and teamed up with Hooded Horse, who are quickly becoming known for publishing some great strategy games. It looks gorgeous too.</p>
<p>Back in November 2024, AMPLITUDE Studios <a href="https://community.amplitude-studios.com/amplitude-studios/endless-space-2/blogs/953-returning-to-our-roots" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> a break from SEGA going back to being an independent studio, with ownership of the studio going back to some of the original founders. Hopefully their teaming up with Hooded Horse for this new game will go well.</p>
<p>More about it: "Dive into Saiadha, a breathtaking yet perilous oceanic world where ever-changing seasons and monstrous tidefalls dramatically transform the landscape. As the water goes down, the environment itself becomes both an obstacle and a chance for discovery. Players will have to adapt to these constant shifts, confront ancient threats, and uncover the secrets buried deep within Saiadha. Each cataclysm brings new dangers but also unique opportunities."</p>
<p>Check out the reveal trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="d6CrUefP7UE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dd004deed97e2fa9c1ca50c8ad1c83e5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/d6CrUefP7UE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“Amplitude has been making world-class strategy games for over a decade,” says Hooded Horse CEO Tim Bender, “We’re honored to be part of their next game.”</p>
<p>The first game works well on Linux with Proton, I expect this new one to run just as well.</p>

      <title>Mahjong gets the Balatro treatment with Aotenjo: Infinite Hands</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We're likely to continue seeing more developers try mixing up classic games like Balatro did with Poker, and now we have Aotenjo: Infinite Hands aiming to do similar for Mahjong. It's already proving quite popular with a Very Positive rating on Steam.</p>
<p>Here the ancient Chinese game of Mahjong meets deck-building. And of course, you get to make it ridiculous with special Artifacts to change the game along with various special Tiles and Gadgets. The developer said: "Inspired by over 40 different regional Mahjong styles, Aotenjo offers a blend of familiarity and novelty. Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned player of Richii, MCR, or Cantonese Mahjong, you’ll find something to enjoy. From Two-Suit Only challenges to Dora and Flower Tiles, we have it all!".</p>
<p>Official trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UGrEnu1TaLU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0c7df58e257da1dc2ea7ce180ed11ff1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UGrEnu1TaLU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Artifact Mastery: Unlock and utilize 144 unique Artifacts.</li>
<li>Pattern Variety: Explore and activate 100 different Patterns.</li>
<li>Dynamic Gameplay: Experience ever-changing levels with seeded generation.</li>
<li>Different Mahjongs: Enjoy elements from over 40 regional Mahjong styles.</li>
<li>Strategic Depth: Design your strategies and combine all of your Patterns, Tiles, Artifacts and Gadgets to overcome powerful innate threats.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You'll need Proton to play it on Linux.</p>
<p>I'm loving the return of so many of these smaller games each providing some new spin on a classic. </p>

      <title>Yield! Fall of Rome is the &#39;child of Polytopia and Civilization&#39; out in Early Access and Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A bit of strategy gaming on the go? Developer Billionworlds and publisher Daedalic Entertainment recently announced the release of Yield! Fall of Rome.</p>
<p>They claim it's the "child of Polytopia and Civilization" where it offers you deep strategic decision-making with accessibility, giving you a fresh and focused approach to the genre that retains the core elements fans love. It also managed to get Steam Deck Verified very early, as the publisher noted in an email how it was "designed for Steam Deck".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FlFcHL55gnQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ea679a755309f09252b617cca9f0d0bf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FlFcHL55gnQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

      <title>Chaosmonger Studio have announced a new adventure game with MIGHTY 1990</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>MIGHTY 1990 is the next game from Chaosmonger Studio who have been pumping out releases over the last few years including ENCODYA, Speedollama, Three Minutes To Eight and Clunky Hero.</p>
<p>What is it? This retro-inspired adventure game, combines the charm of text-based adventures with point-and-click puzzle mechanics, RPG-inspired features, and a humour-filled narrative. No release date or trailer has been provided on it yet just some early screenshots and a now-live Steam page.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16456356921737985725gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16456356921737985725gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5843684471737985726gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5843684471737985726gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Retro Gameplay Mechanics</strong>: The entire game can be played using only the keyboard—just like the first text-based adventures—ensuring fast, focused gameplay without the distractions of pixel hunting. However, players can also use the mouse to interact with the streamlined lower interface, which houses all the necessary commands.</li>
<li><strong>Skill-Based Challenges</strong>: Choose your class, develop skills, and influence outcomes by rolling dice. Whether using charisma to win over an NPC or solving puzzles creatively, every playthrough feels fresh and unique.</li>
<li><strong>Branching Endings</strong>: Your decisions, class, and skills dynamically shape the narrative, leading to a variety of satisfying—or hilariously tragic—conclusions.</li>
<li><strong>Monochromatic Blueish Palette</strong>: A visually stunning 16-color design inspired by MS-DOS games and the hardware limitations of the 386/486 era, blending retro aesthetics with a unique artistic twist.</li>
<li><strong>Humorous Nostalgia</strong>: Packed with quirky dialogue and nods to the golden age of gaming, <strong>MIGHTY 1990</strong> will keep players laughing while they save the world.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nicola Piovesan, CEO of Chaosmonger Studio, said: "MIGHTY 1990 bridges two iconic eras of gaming: the text-based adventures of the early PC gaming years and the point-and-click classics of the early '90s. It’s a gameplay hybrid that feels like the missing link in gaming history. All actions are mapped to a keyboard for seamless interaction, emulating the fast-paced flow of classic adventures, while still allowing players to explore at their own rhythm. Its 16-color monochromatic blueish palette and gameplay style evoke the era of 386 and 486 processors, delivering a truly authentic retro experience."</p>

      <title>The ridiculous Steam Brick just makes me want a proper Steam Machine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One modder took it upon themselves to turn their Steam Deck into a Steam Brick, a tiny little console that makes me really want a proper Steam Machine.</p>
<p>Yes, I know, the original Steam Machine things failed, but since then Valve have learned a lot. Proton exists now and runs tens of thousands of Windows games, plus the Steam Deck has clearly been a success. With the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">expansion of SteamOS for more devices</a>, I think it's about time. Valve need to get Steam into the living room properly again. Until then, people are going to do crazy things like the Steam Brick.</p>
<p>Created by crastinator-pro and written up in a blog post, it details how they tore apart a Steam Deck to stick it into a fancy little screenless box. Why? Well "the Steam Deck didn’t fit in my backpack" they said and also "Because I was so preoccupied with whether or not I could that I didn’t stop to think if I should".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4192515891737984910gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>This type of hardware modding is obviously a niche thing, and not something I'm going to suggest anyone do. A lot could go wrong and you end up with totally broken hardware. But for this modder they said most of their time was spend either plugged into a TV or using AR Glasses so it seemed to make sense. Even they said "This project was not approved or endorsed in any way by Valve and is generally a very bad idea".</p>
<p>All of this was possible since Valve made the device easily repairable, with the modder noting the help of the various iFixIt guides and they used the OLED Steam Deck for this little project.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16802888051737985105gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The creator notes the casing is "Overture Polycarbonate Pro (PC) which should be heat-resistant enough not to melt while the deck attempts to run Cyberpunk 2077".</p>
<p>See <a href="https://crastinator-pro.github.io/steam-brick/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">their full post</a> for all the details.</p>

      <title>War Thunder gets BattlEye anti-cheat enabled for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>War Thunder from Gaijin Entertainment <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/war-thunder-is-moving-away-from-easy-anti-cheat-to-battleye/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced back in December 2024</a> that they would be changing the anti-cheat, which continues to be rolled out in stages. They're moving from Easy Anti-Cheat to BattlEye, both of which support Linux platforms and War Thunder did <em>already</em> support Linux.</p>
<p>As of the latest update posted January 24th, they noted "BattlEye anti-cheat has been enabled for Linux", so players on Linux / SteamOS / Steam Deck should be good to <em>continue</em> playing. The update is noted on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat compatibility page</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1425749491737807547gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - War Thunder</em></p>
<p>It's great to see Gaijin Entertainment have kept up their Linux support for this game for so long. Showing many others how it can be done successfully, unlike <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/grand-theft-auto-v-gets-battleye-anti-cheat-breaks-online-play-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GTA Online</a>, which also uses BattlEye but Rockstar are choosing not to enable it.</p>
<p>War Thunder remains wildly popular too with a 24 hour peak of 87,363 players, and that's just on Steam, the game is available direct from the developer and on consoles.</p>

      <title>The Last of Us Part I added AMD FSR3.1 Frame Generation and Super Resolution</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For those interested in maximising game performance on Linux / Steam Deck, The Last of Us Part I just got another major tech upgrade. v1.1.4 released January 24th, further enhancing the graphical options available.</p>
<p>Patch notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Feature Support</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for AMD FSR3.1 Super Resolution</li>
<li>Added support for AMD FSR3.1 Frame Generation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>[Hometown] Fixed rendering issue that could appear on TVs when using NVIDIA DLSS or AMD FSR</li>
<li>[The University] Fixed issue that could occur when interacting with a generator while enemies were still present</li>
<li>[Bus Depot] Fixed issue where Joel's flashlight would turn on when inspecting certain artifacts despite being in direct sunlight</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Accessibility</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Text to Speech issue where "M" key was not being read when assigned to a function</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Now it might make the experience even better on Steam Deck, depending on your settings. As we've seen before, unless the game is already performing somewhat well, Frame Generation can seriously mess with the frame timings.</p>

      <title>Airships: Lost Flotilla is a perfect time-killer where you can make some ridiculous ships</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Airships: Lost Flotilla is a steampunk themed auto-shooter just released from David Stark, an offshoot of their other game Airships: Conquer the Skies and it's simply great. <em>Disclosure: the publisher Metaroot sent me a key.</em></p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of Vampire Survivors, Brotato and all the others that have come along that in some way fit into this bullet heaven genre, you probably already know a lot of what to expect from a game like this. You go through waves of enemies against a timer, trying to survive to make it to the next wave, so you can upgrade and keep pushing further.</p>
<p>Here you're piloting a steampunk airship of some sort, and gradually adding more weapons and buffs to make the most ridiculous build you possibly can. Like a ship that has a cannon, a giant saw blade and…tentacles (because why the hell not it looks cool!).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6214210641737738706gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>When you manage to complete a wave, you then get to go through various ship upgrades. This could be entirely new weapons, ability buffs you can repeatedly train, weapon level upgrades and other modules to install. There's quite a <em>lot</em> to pick from, and you really can make some varied builds once you start unlocking more ships that have more space on them. Bigger isn't always better though. The smaller ships are speedy, while the bigger ships are sluggish and quite challenging to play as.</p>
<p>Trying out all the hundreds of different combinations has been exceptionally fun, the key to this game really is the variety in all the builds to keep trying something new.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15789400431737740546gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Weapons having two different upgrade paths for each of them is a nice touch too. So even if you pick the same weapons one run, you could upgrade them an entirely different way in another run.</p>
<p>After going through the upgrades, it's time to pick a path across the map. This part is what I really like about the game, because it makes you think and try to plan a little. Each location offers up something different in terms of risk versus reward. You might want to pick an easy path just to get further, or risk it for more research and different types of rewards available to progress in other ways.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="GIPgpacnFQ0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c68bc0720c9f9f856a815ebd3a064c14.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/GIPgpacnFQ0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Once you get further in, the game opens up a little more too with all the different types of enemies with their various weapons and attack patterns. Then add to that there's some environmental interactions too like clouds that can help reduce fire but also visibility, sandstorms that push you around and more.</p>
<p>The boss battles can be pretty insane too, and thoroughly challenging. The game as a whole is pretty challenging though, although I've been playing it on the middle difficulty which does feel about right.</p>
<p>Quite accessible too since not only does your ship auto-fire but you can make it so it powers forwards by itself, with you only needing to control left and right. Easy one-handed gaming.</p>
<p>While it's not much to look at, with some truly basic artwork for a lot of it, Airships: Lost Flotilla is a perfect time-killer for when you've got a few minutes spare but it can easily sink your entire evening.</p>
<p>Airships: Lost Flotilla has Native Linux support and Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified.</p>

<p>Explore outer space with your word-finding skills.</p>
<p>You are dealt a handful of letters and must make words on an empty grid. Letters replenish with oxygen after you use them, and so you have to make new words, to find new oxygen. The grid might not be empty anymore but don't fret, it is as boundless as the universe itself. Oxygen on the other hand...</p>
<p>In Mission mode, set your own difficulty with 28 unique modifiers and try to beat the game by mining up resources.</p>

      <title>Cross-platform Nexus Mods App v0.7.2 improves the UI, adds Bannerlord Software Extender support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Nexus team continue building up their newer cross-platform open source Nexus Mods App that will eventually replace Vortex. Version 0.7.2 was released recently further expanding what you can do with it.</p>
<p>With this update the UI has seen some further refinements like the Games, Loadouts, and Health Check pages to bring them up to date along with a bunch of new icons. They've also made improvements to how they handle File Conflicts. For players of Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord, they've added in support for the Bannerlord Software Extender.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15109160921737722879gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Other changes and known issues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Technical Changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Free users will now see a modal prompting them to upgrade to Premium when clicking the "Download all" buttons for Collections. Downloading mods individually is still possible.</li>
<li>When a loadout is removed, the associated Workspace data is now cleaned up.</li>
<li>Reduced the number of log messages to make troubleshooting issues easier.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bugfixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where collections that include bundled mods would never be installable as it would always show pending downloads.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where users in timezones 6 or more hours ahead of UTC would be unable to download collections.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Known Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stardew Valley (Native Linux version) is not detected when installed via Heroic Launcher on Linux. The Windows version of the game can be used instead until this issue is fixed.</li>
<li>Bundled mods included with collections do not appear in the UI but are still applied to your game.</li>
<li>The success rating for collections is not showing the correct value.</li>
<li>The game version is not checked when adding a collection meaning you can install outdated mods without being warned.</li>
<li>The Collections (WIP) page is not filtered by game.</li>
<li>The "Switch View" option does not persist in the Library/Installed Mods view.</li>
<li>The "Load Order" heading toggle does not persist in the Load Order view.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This app works across Linux (including Steam Deck) and Windows.</p>

      <title>Games to claim from Prime Gaming, Jan 24 edition round-up for SteamOS Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's the up to date list of games available on Amazon Prime Gaming for January 24th, and what compatibility you can expect for Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck. Each week Prime Gaming, part of what you get with a subscription to Amazon Prime, add and remove various games you can claim to keep.</p>
<p>I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"/> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play. Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now.</p>

      <title>Palworld gets a roadmap including co-op crossplay, world transfers for Pals and an ending</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Palworld developer Pocketpair have recently revealed a fresh roadmap of what's to come for the popular monster catching survival game. There's still no update yet on the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/palworld-dev-details-the-patents-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-for/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo and Pokemon lawsuit</a>, hopefully we'll see a resolution to that sometime soon.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/109465341737717092gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">To celebrate the first anniversary they've revealed their upcoming plans which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>CO-OP Crossplay.</li>
<li>World Transfers for Pals.</li>
<li>World Tree / Ending Scenario.</li>
<li>Further ways to strengthen and improve Pals.</li>
<li>Various new content such as new Pals and technologies.</li>
<li>Game Collaborations (Including Terraria).</li>
<li>Improvements to world object placement.</li>
<li>Improvements to base Pals.</li>
<li>Improvements to optimization.</li>
<li>Improvements to UX.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you missed it the developer also recently launched <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/palworld-developer-pocketpair-launches-pocketpair-publishing/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pocketpair Publishing</a>.</p>
<p>Palworld works on Linux Desktop with Proton, and Valve rated it Steam Deck Playable (it has a lot of issues). Would be nice if Pocketpair would also work on improving how it runs on Steam Deck where it would be a really good fit if they put some effort into it.</p>
<p>It's continued to see a lot of players since the recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/palworld-feybreak-v0411-is-out-now-and-its-a-huge-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Feybreak update</a> with it seeing a 24 hour peak player count of 96,808.</p>

      <title>Base-building survival game Necesse gets a big update and Free Weekend</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Necesse is an impressive open-world base-building survival and adventure game from developer Fair Games ApS, with a big update out now and you can try it free this weekend. There's also a 35% discount if you want to keep it.</p>
<p>The game has full Native Linux support and Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified. So if you've been stuck for something to play, this could be a great pick for you to game away your weekend.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0n5zR0_sW40"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/89f4d98a040be6946962230d6cb1aa74.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0n5zR0_sW40" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Writing about the update the developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I talked about in the last update, we've focused more on making the progression and exploration less repetitive. This time around we’ve added new hazards to the snow, swamp and desert caves. The Deep caves will receive a similar treatment in a future update.</p>
<p>In the spirit of the Free Weekend and co-op play, we’ve also added 4 new staves that specialize in buffing your allies. But if you prefer to play solo, you can also give them to your settlers. If you enjoy playing a supportive playstyle, then these staves are for you!</p>
<p>And other smaller changes, like a new critter when exploring the caves along with a new crop and some food. This will make it harder to run out of food while deep in the caves :)</p>
<p>Some of the other features in this update include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Hoverboard now better handling and a dash ability!</li>
<li>Several gravel tiles that couldn't be crafted before, are now craftable.</li>
<li>More gems will now drop from the crystal mini biomes.</li>
</ul>

      <title>DOOM: The Dark Ages launches May 15 with a new trailer and developer video</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>id Software and Bethesda Softworks have revealed more gameplay for DOOM: The Dark Ages, plus it's now set for release on May 15th. Although, like many bigger developers, you can get it a few days early if you buy the more expensive edition of the game for Advanced Access on May 13th.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8KyA7bf4IB0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c532b0b356f87d7f21071f1be93d32e6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8KyA7bf4IB0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>If you want a longer look at the game they also have a developer video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FGFuaVUI6_E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6555745d418def9a90f2c57e76811db3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FGFuaVUI6_E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Something to note, is that the game <em>requires</em> a GPU with Ray Tracing capabilities, even on their minimum settings. As they announced in a <a href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-EU/article/doom-the-dark-ages-pc-specs" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> they said: "Note: DOOM: The Dark Ages requires a hardware ray tracing-compatible GPU to play on PC, including Minimum Specifications. Details on Path Tracing specifications will be revealed at a later date."</p>
<p>They say it's using a new generation of their idTech game engine, idTech8, which takes "full advantage of modern hardware on all platforms, idTech8 ushers in a new era of gameplay performance and visual fidelity featuring all-new dynamic interactive ray-traced lighting and shadows, higher-fidelity image quality, increased gore and destruction and so much more".</p>
<p>Sounds quite exciting, if your PC will run it, as it has the "largest environments ever in a DOOM game" to date with dragons and great big mechs. This might be a bridge too far for the Steam Deck though. Hopefully there won't be any issues with normal Desktop Linux via Proton.</p>
<p>Here's the specifications they've given:</p>
<blockquote>

      <title>FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH broken on Linux with NVIDIA GPUs but works with AMD GPUs like Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sad news for NVIDIA GPU owners on Linux who want to play FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH, which just released on Steam yesterday as it appears broken. Works on Linux for those with an AMD GPU like the Steam Deck though.</p>
<p>According to the developer of VKD3D-Proton, the Direct3D 12 to Vulkan translation layer used by Proton, this is an NVIDIA driver bug that has been reported to NVIDIA already. As developer Hans-Kristian Arntzen said on <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/8408#issuecomment-2610069931" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The RTX issues are known. It's a driver bug and it has been reported to NV with bug number 5059946.</p>
<p>I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out a reasonable workaround, but to no avail.</p>

<p>NVIDIA do have a new 570 Linux driver coming soon to support the new GeForce RTX 50 series, which should be coming on January 30th. However, some have spotted an early build of the 570 driver and tested it and <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/8408#issuecomment-2611708530" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a> that it does not fix it (but it's not clear if that's a complete driver).</p>
<p>The good news for everyone else, is that it does work with an AMD GPU (including the Steam Deck with SteamOS). However, if you're on a SteamOS-like distribution, you might need to tell the game you're not on a Steam Deck, otherwise it will give you low visuals. Set this launch option:</p>

      <title>Proton Hotfix updated to get THE FINALS working again on Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recent updates to THE FINALS ended up breaking it on Linux / Steam Deck, but Valve have pushed out a new update to Proton Hotfix to get it working again.</p>
<p>Lots of reports came flowing into <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/2073850" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> about it being broken, and on Valve's GitHub too where yesterday a Proton developer <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/7317#issuecomment-2608576332" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noted</a> Proton Experimental's Beta version got a fix that should help (with reports showing it did). So now Valve have updated Proton Hotfix and set it as the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/891390/history/?changeid=27141418" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">default</a> for THE FINALS. So you shouldn't need to do anything, except untick any Proton version you may have forced on it previously.</p>
<p>Testing it myself today on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu) and yup, all working just fine again.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3202100991737714020gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3202100991737714020gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

<p>Unlike normal Proton version and Proton Experimental, Valve don't generally announce changes for Proton Hotfix since it's not used too often and only in certain special cases like this where they're not ready to update the other main Proton versions. See <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">more in my guide on all the Proton versions</a>.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental updated with fixes for Battle.net, Atelier Resleriana, Dirt Rally 2 and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve updated Proton Experimental for January 22nd with a bunch more fixes for gamers on Linux, SteamOS and Steam Deck. Like the Battle.net update issue that came up recently that was fixed in a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/ge-proton-9-23-released-with-a-battlenet-fix-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent GE-Proton update</a> too. <em>Confused on all the Proton versions? Go and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">read my guide explainer</a>.</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Noted as now playable with this update:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stronghold Crusader: Definitive Edition Demo.</li>
<li>Atelier Resleriana: Forgotten Alchemy and the Polar Night Liberator.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Other fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed non-Steam battle.net installations.</li>
<li>Fixed desync issue with 60FPS AVPro videos in VRChat.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Fixed Proton 9 regressions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed performance degradation in Dirt Rally 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nice to see Valve continue to fix issues with apps people add into Steam like Battle.net, since you can install various third-party standalone stuff using Proton too.</p>

      <title>GDC 2025 survey shows PC game development growing with lots interested in Valve&#39;s Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest Game Developers Conference (GDC) survey has been released, and it gives a rather glowing overview of how great things are for PC gamers with lots of developers working on games.</p>
<p>With the survey including over 3,000 game developers and industry professionals, they've managed a decent enough sample size. What's really interesting though, is that PC game development is not just alive and well but expanding. As they said last year only "66% of developers reported that they were working on games for PC", but this year "that number climbed up to 80%".</p>
<p>Another interesting point here is that while the Steam Deck was <em>not</em> listed as an option, of those who picked "Other", the survey saw "44% of them wrote in Steam Deck as a platform they’re interested in". <em>They didn't state how many filled out Other though.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2096528541737662408gol1.jpg"/><br/>

<p><em>PC in this case means Windows specifically since Mac and Linux are separated. The industry still generally writes PC as meaning Windows. Maybe one day we'll break away from it. <strong>Update 8PM UTC</strong>: Image updated to their newer corrected version for some text.</em></p>
<p>Developers still don't seem all that keen on AI as well with "30% of respondents reported that they believe that generative AI is having a negative impact on the games industry, which is a 12% increase from last year". However, there's plenty that are using AI as GDC note: "More than half of developers surveyed (52%) work for companies that have implemented generative AI and one-third (36%) personally use them. Respondents within Business and Finance Roles in companies were most likely to use Artificial intelligence tools (51%), followed by Production and Team Leadership (41%) and Community, Marketing and PR (39%)".</p>
<p>Layoffs continue to hit hard too with "11% of developers reported being laid off in the past year".</p>
<p>Going by the results 4% of developers are using the free and open source <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> for their current game, with the majority currently sticking to Unity and Unreal both at at 32%. 13% said they use other proprietary tools and then there's CryEngine at 0.2% and O3DE at 0.1%.</p>

      <title>over the hill is an offroading exploration game announced by the art of rally devs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The devs of art of rally, Funselektor Labs along with Strelka Games have announced over the hill, a new offroading exploration sim where you can bring a friend along for the ride.</p>
<p>With graphics quite similar to art of rally, they're not going for realism but sticking with the colourful style they're known for and I think it looks wonderful. They're continuing the nostalgia trip too with it focusing on the "golden age of offroading" they say that gives you access to "iconic vehicles from the 60s to 80s".</p>
<p>Check out the announcement trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hFi39URiesI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5e7868c0e97a883b9d6eb917fcc0aa0b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hFi39URiesI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Highlights:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>a world of discovery - Discover portals to travel to new areas, and complete objectives to unlock new vehicles, upgrades, customizations, and cosmetics, with many combinations to try. Who knows, maybe you’ll find some hidden gems along the way.</li>
<li>multi or single player - Take a friend or go on a solo tour. Challenge yourself, collaborate with up to three friends, or just enjoy the sights - the world is your oyster.</li>
<li>adapt and overcome - Take on the elements with dynamic weather, day/night cycles, and realistic terrain deformation. Find solace in nature, even when you’re stuck in the mud.</li>
<li>Fancy a break? Gather your friends around the campfire, grab a hot cocoa, and catch up on the day’s events.</li>
<li>it’s about the journey - The best stories never start at the end. With so much to explore and uncover, it’s all about the cruise. Complete all the objectives, unlock the many customizations and upgrades, and discover everything the wilderness has to offer. Just take your time and find peace in the minimalistic serenity.</li>
<li>capture the beauty - Grab stills of your favourite landscapes with the built-in photo mode. We can’t wait to follow your journey. You never know what you may discover just over the hill.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems you'll probably need Proton to play it on Linux.</p>
<p>This one is going right into my wishlist.</p>

      <title>Linux &#39;fascinates and terrifies&#39; the dev of DEAD LETTER DEPT. but they&#39;re supporting it anyway</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mike Monroe / Belief Engine are approaching the release of DEAD LETTER DEPT., a thoroughly creeping looking typing game and it's coming with Linux support. <em>Disclosure: the developer emailed over a pre-release key for the game.</em></p>
<p>What is it? An unusual typing game that revolves around you taking a temp job while you get situated in a new city, being tasked with the data-entry work of typing up various words and addresses written on the mail &amp; letters that were not able to be successfully delivered- due to bad handwriting or other reasons unknown. As the days pass on, strange stories begin to emerge from the mail you review. Sometimes it feels like they're talking directly to you.</p>
<p>The developer summed it up as:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In terms of game mechanic themes, you could say DEAD LETTER DEPT. is relative to other horror games like Home Safety Hotline and The Mortuary Assistant, in which you are tasked with a job to accomplish but with rising complications as the story and tensions progress. Details lie under the surface, for those willing to look.</li>
<li>Horror wise, it is a technological ghost story with the focus being on building mood, dread, atmosphere, and the fear of the unknown.  There is certain programming in DEAD LETTER DEPT. that I specifically kept unpredictable for certain occasions, as I wanted the game to feel haunted even during it's own development.</li>
<li>The mail in each playthrough is intelligently randomized, meaning no two playthroughs are quite the same. A typical playthrough can run around 2 hours, with multiple endings to encounter.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="sIyIh7-1P7o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/45c47f77b03210e004ac4e91f174efca.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/sIyIh7-1P7o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Writing about the Linux / SteamOS support for the game in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1627350/view/693091765959262378" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam the developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's a long story really. What began as a casual investigation into making sure the game functionally runs on Steam Deck, turned into: 'Oh, the game appears to run surprisingly well on Linux???' Frankly I anticipated random filesystem explosions and graphical razorblades to have to solve for this, like with any port. But nope? It's been tested on 4 different distros (Zorin, Arch, Ubuntu, and the SteamOS of course) and appears to run pretty identical to its Windows counterpart. So I think that's cautiously optimistic enough results to try.</p>
<p>Frankly making a Linux version automatically solves a MASSIVE GAMEBREAKING VIDEO CODEC issue if the game would be run under Proton (on the Steam Deck), so I might as just publish a Linux version.</p>
<p>I realize the Linux user demand for this game isn't necessarily huge (to be fair I haven't listed it as Linux supported yet either), but I'm willing to give it a fair shot. Linux fascinates and terrifies.</p>

      <title>Adventures of a Cat in Space is an upcoming musical adventure starring Arthur Darvill</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Adventures of a Cat in Space sounds like an exciting one to keep on your radar. An upcoming musical point and click adventure game starring Arthur Darvill (Doctor Who, Broadchurch, Legends of Tomorrow and more).</p>
<p>Commissioned by <a href="https://www.thespace.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The Space</a>, Adventures Of A Cat In Space is a collaboration between family music specialists Little Seeds Music, and narrative game developers Tall Story Games (Heir of the Dog, Lucy Dreaming). Players take on the role of a cat stranded in space after an unexpected mishap. To make their way back to Earth, they must explore a vast and colourful array of planets, solve puzzles, and unlock songs that will help guide them home. They are aided in their quest by the ship’s computer, voiced by Olivier award winning actor and musician Arthur Darvill, who also performs the game's main theme song. </p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LX9fJXmz6wI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/97aa2d49410f58107228c6d505833c33.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LX9fJXmz6wI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release: Adventures Of A Cat In Space has been commissioned and funded by The Space, who were established in 2013 to fund the creation of new digital cultural content and provide free training, mentoring and online resources for organisations, artists and creative practitioners. Harmeet Chagger-Khan, Head of Digital Innovation for The Space says: “Adventures of a Cat in Space is a charming and funny, interactive game filled with catchy tunes that you’ll be singing for days.  The Space is delighted to support the project which sees Little Seeds venture from traditional music and storytelling into the gaming world to excite and engage younger audiences and families in new ways."</p>
<p>A demo will be released on 24th February 2025, ready for Steam Next Fest and it will have Native Linux support. The developer sent me over an early demo key, and the theme song is already firmly stuck in my head. This is going to be a good one, nice and family friendly too.</p>

      <title>Paradox announce Stellaris 4.0 will be a big overhaul sometime in Q2 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox Interactive have announced that a big free Stellaris 4.0 update is coming later this year, and it's going to overhaul quite a lot. There's no date set for it yet but it will be sometime in Q2 2025, and will launch along with another major paid expansion.</p>
<p>This was originally announced <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/281990/view/577123891031310365" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">January 16</a>, with a follow-up first part to go over some more changes on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/281990/view/515199938040168701" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">January 23rd</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8090741021737636412gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Stellaris, credit: Paradox.</em></p>
<p>As any Stellaris player will know, the game has grown to such a scale that there's so many moving parts, there's a lot that can break and performance can be an issue in the late game too with all the calculations the game is doing. So thankfully performance is going to be a big focus of it too.</p>
<p>To help players understand the game one thing that has been announced is the new compendium, allowing you to search through all sorts of things that will be in nice neat categories. They've been iterating over their tooltip system too, and this will all work together to give you all the info you need on every concept in the game. Sounds useful.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6165305121737636640gol1.png"/></p>
<p>There's also going to be improvements to the Ship Designer as they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve taken the Ship Roles that were introduced in the 3.6 ‘Orion’ update and made selecting one part of the basic ship design flow and giving them a better representation than a scrollable text list. Some pain points of ship design, like the Auto-generate changes button blocking saving, have been removed, and in general it’s a faster and easier process to create a general ship design.</p>
<p>We’ve added a “Custom” role for veteran players that want to design the ship from scratch, or you can take one of these generated templates and modify them to suit your needs before saving.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More updates to help newer players are coming as well, as the game does quickly get quite complicated, so they're making numerous quality of life improvements to make the game flow easier to understand.</p>
<p>On the subject of game-flow, they're converting events that don't need you to pick any options from a game-interrupting pop-up into a simpler "toasts or notifications". However, you'll be able to adjust it, as they're adding a Message Settings screen to change how you wish to view them all across notifications, toasts, pop-ups and auto-pause for each type. They also said that "Certain event chains that are not particularly loved have had (or will have) a bit of adjustment as well".</p>
<p>There's so much more like improvements to galaxy generation, and a big one they have in other Paradox games with Focus Trees, will make a sort-of appearance but tweaked for how different and dynamic Stellaris is. Instead of a set tree, they're going to add in "suggested tasks that fall into Conquest, Exploration, or Development aspiration categories".</p>

      <title>Palworld developer Pocketpair launches Pocketpair Publishing </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Palworld developer Pocketpair are not slowing down, as they just launched their own video game publisher with Pocketpair Publishing.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pocketpair Publishing provides comprehensive support for game development through funding, development assistance, and publishing for indie game developers and small studios. Pocketpair Publishing promises to take a hands-off approach, providing as much support as developers need without overstepping or imposing strict conditions on the development process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/976035971737635846gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Their first published game has been announced as a brand new horror game from SURGENT STUDIOS, founded by British actor and video game developer Abubakar Salim. More from the press release:</p>
<p>From John "Bucky" Buckley, Head of Pocketpair Publishing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At Pocketpair, there is nothing we love more than games, and Pocketpair Publishing is our latest venture to help the world enjoy gaming even more. Game development comes with many challenges, but we want to ease that process as much as possible and provide an environment where creators can pursue their dreams.</p>
<p>We are pleased to be able to support SURGENT STUDIOS’ new title as our first step. We deeply sympathize with their original ideas and passion and are honoured to help them realize their vision. We will respect the autonomy and vision of developers and work together to make great games for people all over the world.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope that more creators will be able to realize their dreams through Pocketpair Publishing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From Abubakar Salim, CEO of Surgent Studios:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We noticed a pattern in the entertainment industry, and Pocketpair has given us the opportunity to make a horror game about it. Both Surgent and Pocketpair are well-versed in taking risks. This game will be short and weird, and we think players will be interested in what we have to say.</p>
<p>We’re still in earnest conversation about further projects set in the Tales of Kenzera universe, but this will be a standalone piece: a mile marker between where we’ve come from and where we’re going.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nice to see that Pocketpair are using their success with Palworld to help other developers, even in the face of the Nintendo lawsuit that's ongoing.</p>

      <title>Linux kernel 6.13 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One missed earlier this week while I was running around Wales, Linus Torvalds announced the release of Linux kernel 6.13.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">In the release <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2025/1/19/281" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> Torvalds said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So nothing horrible or unexpected happened last week, so I've tagged and pushed out the final 6.13 release.</p>
<p>It's mostly some final driver fixes (gpu and networking dominating - normal), with some doc updates too. And various little stuff all over. The shortlog is appended for people who want to see the details (and, as always, it's just the shortlog for the last week, the full 6.13 log is obviously much too big).</p>
<p>With this, the merge window for 6.14 will obviously open tomorrow. I already have two dozen pull requests pending - thank you, you know who you are.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some highlights of what's new:</p>
<ul>
<li>A proper fix for data corruption on 64GB Steam Deck models. Plus a few other miscellaneous kernel improvements for Steam Deck APU support.</li>
<li>A fix for AMDGPU when running Steam games and YouTube videos together, to prevent a system hang with multiple monitors.</li>
<li>Case-insensitive support for tmpfs. An interesting one that can help Wine, Proton and Flatpak as noted:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The use case for this feature is similar to the use case for ext4, to better support compatibility layers (like Wine), particularly in combination with sandboxing/container tools (like Flatpak).<br/>
<br/>
Those containerization tools can share a subset of the host filesystem with an application. In the container, the root directory and any parent directories required for a shared directory are on tmpfs, with the shared directories bind-mounted into the container's view of the filesystem.<br/>
<br/>
If the host filesystem is using case-insensitive directories, then the application can do lookups inside those directories in a case-insensitive way, without this needing to be implemented in user-space. However, if the host is only sharing a subset of a case-insensitive directory with the application, then the parent directories of the mount point will be part of the container's root tmpfs. When the application tries to do case-insensitive lookups of those parent directories on a case-sensitive tmpfs, the lookup will fail"</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights continued:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new AMD 3D V-Cache optimizer driver to help X3D processors improve performance.</li>
<li>Improvements to Apple M1 device support.</li>
<li>The open source NVIDIA driver Nouveau got DRM panic support for nv50+ cards.</li>
<li>Improved support for various <em>older</em> Apple devices including phones, Apple TV, iPad and more.</li>
<li>Platform profile support for Dell laptops with new WMAX thermal interface, present on some Alienware X-Series, Alienware M-Series and Dell's G-Series laptops.</li>
<li>V3D driver for Raspberry Pi gets "Super Pages" support to help performance.</li>
<li>Added support for the Corsair Void headset family.</li>
<li>Lots more new hardware support as usual.</li>
</ul>
<p>As usual I'm just searching through and cherry-picking random bits here. It's a ridiculously long read as always with thousands of changes across all areas. See more in the <a href="https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v6.x/ChangeLog-6.13" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">full changelog</a>.</p>
<p>Is there a particular addition you're excited to see that made it into Linux kernel 6.13? Let me know in the comments.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck sales drop hard following the Nintendo Switch 2 announcement (updated: Valve fixed it)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 11:21AM</strong>: it's possible the weekly global top sellers list is having issues, as it's been pointed out some clearly top selling games vanished from the last week. I've reached out to Valve to see what's up.</p>
<p><strong>Update #2 8:07PM</strong>: seems Valve got the message, and they've updated it. The Steam Deck on the weekly global top seller for the week beginning January 14th was actually <strong>4th</strong>, not 47th.</p>
<p>With that in mind here's an updated corrected version of the positions over time for you:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4897488031737662833gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4897488031737662833gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>So we can back to saying I'm right, nothing will dethrone it except a Steam Deck 2.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Valve's Steam Deck with SteamOS has been consistently in the top sales charts on Steam since release, but recently it dropped down rather hard following the Nintendo Switch 2 announcement.</p>
<p>I've been tracking the sales over time and have posted a few times about how well it was doing. However, the week during which the Nintendo Switch 2 was announced, it really has dropped down massively to the lowest point since the original release back in February 2022.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind the global Steam sales charts are for revenue, not numbers sold, the Steam Deck is generally higher anyway since it's the equal cost of multiple sales of the most expensive games. Still, it's an interesting look into how the Steam Deck is doing overall and still means usually it's selling a lot considering the games it's up against sell often hundreds of thousands and millions.</p>
<p>Here's how it's position in the weekly global <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topsellers/global/2025-1-14" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">top sellers list</a> has changed:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7485795531737628534gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7485795531737628534gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>I guess I need to admit here I was wrong then don't I? Back in July 2024 when I last looked at this I said "<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/will-anything-dethrone-the-steam-deck-probably-not/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Will anything dethrone the Steam Deck? Probably not</a>", seems the Switch 2 did it.</p>
<p>Sales dropping was bound to happen eventually though, one way or another, and I do fully expect it to bounce back, but it's just surprising to see it drop down so drastically like that.</p>
<p>This won't cause any alarm bells to ring at Valve HQ though, they probably expected this to happen too. I don't expect them to speed up any work on a Steam Deck 2 due to this either. Valve clearly have a plan, especially with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS coming to more devices</a>, and they're still waiting for a truly next-generation APU to slot into a Steam Deck 2.</p>

      <title>The devs of Celeste have cancelled their follow-up game Earthblade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Extremely OK Games, creators of the popular platformer Celeste, have <a href="https://exok.com/posts/2025-01-22-earthblade-final-update/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> that their follow-up game Earthblade has now been cancelled. This was announced in a news post on their official website yesterday, January 22nd.</p>
<p>In the post titled "Final Earthblade Update" written by developer Maddy Thorson they mention clearly "Late last month, Noel and I made the difficult decision to cancel Earthblade". They said the decision was made in December but they waited until now to announce it.</p>
<p>As for why? Their team had a breakdown in communication with Pedro Medeiros, who they said is was "a founding member of EXOK, longtime friend &amp; collaborator, and art director of Earthblade and pixel/ui artist on Celeste and TowerFall". The issue: "a disagreement about the IP rights of Celeste" which they said they won't be going into publicly.</p>
<p>Medeiros has moved onto their own game with <a href="https://saint11.art/games/neverway/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Neverway</a>. Worth noting that Medeiros did post on X back in November 2024 that they had left EXOK:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19758198891737626172gol1.png"/></p>
<p>The decision to cancel Earthblade, the post from Thorson makes clear, was made by Maddy Thorson and Noel Berry. As for why? Multiple reasons it seems. The game wasn't as far along as they had hoped, along with the pressure of Celeste's success: "Celeste's success applied pressure on us to deliver something bigger and better with Earthblade, and that pressure is a large part of why working on it has become so exhausting".</p>
<p>Other members of their team have moved on now too, so Thorson and Berry are going back to smaller-scale projects and have begun prototyping again.</p>

      <title>AMD reveals AMDGPU Composition Stack, a fork of Wayland&#39;s Weston compositor for advancing the Linux desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With many Linux desktops now running Wayland quite nicely, it seems it's time to keep pushing ahead. AMD have revealed what they call the AMDGPU Composition Stack (ACS).</p>
<p>This is a fork of Wayland's Weston compositor with some "additional advanced features". It all sounds pretty exciting when you look at what AMD developer Shashank Sharma noted on the <a href="https://gitlab.com/acs-wayland/weston/-/wikis/home" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitLab Wiki</a> page with these being the primary goals:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>To act as a staging area for Weston/Wayland features to be opensourced to mainline.</li>
<li>To act as a reference compositor for AMD's advanced graphics and display feature development.</li>
<li>To provide a middleware compositor which extracts the best out of AMD Display and Graphics HW (We don't mind being biased to AMDGPU HW)
	<ul>
<li>To host some of the AMD HW specific code, which can't be merged in weston mainline due to its bias towards AMD HW.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To be utilised in full stack opensource delivery vehicle for AMDs commercial solutions and products.</li>
<li>To be the space where AMD specific in-house SW tools (performance tweakers, multimedia players, 3D games, profiling tools etc) can be saved in future.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6400159901737583151gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6400159901737583151gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Picture credit: AMD</em></p>
<p>As noted on the Wiki page some initial features added include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>VRR / Freesync.</li>
<li>MPO using underlays.</li>
<li>Color Management and Wide gamut support.</li>
<li>ACS media-player app.</li>
<li>Fullscreen HDR video playback.</li>
<li>Multi-seat config support.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's also a basic video player included to "demonstrate some of these advance feature in a video playback context".</p>
<p>This was announced on the dri-devel <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/dri-devel/2025-January/486833.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">mailing list</a>.</p>

      <title>SDL 3 officially released for game devs plus an SDL 2 to SDL 3 compatibility layer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) is a popular free and open source library for developers that handles audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick and graphics with SDL 3 now available. Plus a new SDL 2 to SDL 3 compatibility layer.</p>
<p>Much like they already have <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/sdl12-compat" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">sdl12-compat</a>, which allows you to use SDL 2 if you're stuck on SDL 1, they've also released <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/sdl2-compat" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">sdl2-compat</a> for people stuck on SDL 2 to get the benefits of SDL 3.</p>
<p>There's a huge amount of new features and overall improvements including (taken from the SDL 3 <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-3.2.0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release post</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/APIByCategory" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Extremely good documentation</a>: We've spent a ton of effort writing and revising the API reference.</li>

<li>More consistent API naming conventions. Everything is named consistently across the API now, instead of different subsystems taking different approaches. Also, we've tended toward more descriptive names for things in SDL3.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/README/main-functions#main-callbacks-in-sdl3" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Main Callbacks</a>: optionally run your program from callbacks instead of main().</li>

<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_OpenAudioDevice" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Logical audio devices</a>: different parts of an app can get their own unique audio device to use.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_CreateAudioStream" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Audio streams</a>: handle buffering, converting, resampling, mixing, channel mapping, pitch, and gain. Bind to an audio device and go!</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_PLAYBACK" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Default audio devices</a>: SDL3 will automatically manage migrating to new physical hardware as devices are plugged in, ripped out, or changed.</li>

<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/BestKeyboardPractices" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Better keyboard input</a>, for all your keypress needs.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_StartTextInputWithProperties" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Customizable virtual keyboards</a> on iOS and Android.</li>

      <title>Windows compatibility layer Wine 10.0 out now bringing Wayland and ARM64EC support, new FFmpeg multimedia back-end</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The big release is here! The Windows compatibility layer Wine version 10.0 is officially out now bringing lots of big new features. Wine is a major part of what powers Valve's Proton, enabling thousands of Windows games to run on Linux.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some highlights of what's new includes (compared with Wine 9):</p>
<ul>
<li>ARM64EC support</li>
<li>Wayland support that's enabled by default.</li>
<li>An FFmpeg-based multimedia back-end as an alternative to the GStreamer backend. Still experimental though, but should hopefully begin to improve Media Foundation support (good for gaming).</li>
<li>Much improved High-DPI support.</li>
<li>Network sessions are supported in DirectPlay.</li>
<li>An initial Bluetooth driver.</li>
<li>Support for the Dvorak keyboard layout.</li>
</ul>
<p>And lots more! Full changelog on the <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/releases/wine-10.0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Wine GitLab</a>.</p>
<p>Eventually we will see Valve update Proton as well to move it onto Wine 10 and see Proton 10 later this year.</p>

      <title>Cats vs Cthulhu is a weird and charming survivor-like with unique movement</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In a genre full of clones and copycats, Cats vs Cthulhu is a very unique bullet-heaven survivor-like where you bounce around the arenas trying to avoid all the enemies while collecting everything to power up. Note: developer sent a copy to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4218320-GamingOnLinux/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">our Steam Curator</a>.</p>
<p>Here instead of running around, you fling yourself around at different angles and speeds to either avoid or smash into every weird creature that comes along. While also trying to collect stars and since you're a cat, fish and boxes to power yourself up during a run and unlock more cats and arenas. It's seriously weird but ridiculously charming and entertaining.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8lTcPmIVbDU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ae71c0b3bb52e494f640e204acbd61d1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8lTcPmIVbDU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Dozen of cats to choose from - Every cat has unique attributes. Recognize their strengths and weaknesses and adjust your build accordingly.</li>
<li>Buy yourself something comfortable and powerful - Increase your attack speed, improve your durability or unleash the power of the rainbow! Upgrades, People, Upgrades!</li>
<li>Injection of Love - Eat your weapons to gain permanent buffs.</li>
<li>Meta-Progression - While fighting Cthulhu you collect cardboards, which you can then use to buy new cats or arenas.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer told me "It's a small game but I poured my soul into it". It's a fantastic little coffee-break game that's nice and different. As the waves go on and you power up, along with the different enemy types it really does get rather chaotic.</p>

      <title>Roll the dice to make crazy combos instead of collecting cards in the roguelike Die in the Dungeon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Build up a deck of dice in Die in the Dungeon, where all your dice have a different purpose that you stack up together to make crazy combinations. As a big fan of games like Slay the Spire and Dicey Dungeons, this looks like a really fun mixture that's probably going to suck away lots of my time when it arrives.</p>
<p>More: "In Die in the Dungeon, each dice represents a different action, from basic ones like attacking or healing to boosting other dice or copying their abilities. Improve the quality of your dice, combine them and acquire powerful relics to defeat the monsters that dwell in the dungeon! Find great synergies by combining dice with unique abilities to create powerful and bizarre decks!"</p>
<p>The developers announced it's set for launch on February 21st with a brand new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5geKorczBrI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/df67c3240b6dd4234eb5c66c238ea95f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5geKorczBrI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Craft your deck from an ever-growing collection of dice.</strong><br/>
	Every dice has its purpose, with tons of combinations to discover and exploit. On top of that, special properties and upgrades will ensure no single dice feel exactly the same.</li>
<li><strong>Explore the dungeon and its unwelcoming inhabitants.</strong><br/>
	Forged by strong magic, the walls and floors of the dungeon shift continuously, creating a brand new experience in every run. Thankfully, encounters are not always hostile, but never let your guard down... it’s all a game of risk and reward down here.</li>
<li><strong>Discover powerful synergies by choosing from a myriad of relics.</strong><br/>
	Stack their powers and use them to boost your dice and board slots, multiplying the power of your combinations and becoming unstoppable. But don’t get too greedy, the stronger a relic is, the bigger their drawbacks will affect you and your deck.</li>

      <title>On a massive space station spiraling out of control the action roguelite Katanaut is full of cosmic horrors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a demo now available, Katanaut is an action roguelite set aboard a massive space station spiraling out of control. It looks like it has some great action, and it's pretty grim.</p>
<p>More: With the station slowly spiraling out of control, and its once-human inhabitants twisted into terrors, you’re the unlucky one tasked with uncovering what is going on... assuming you’re able to survive the station's violent halls with souls-like combat.</p>
<p>Check out the new demo trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6X56abT6DSc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4e2fd5923836497d062f9f8def06bd72.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6X56abT6DSc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Diverse Builds | Experiment with different weapons, guns, and abilities to create a strategy that matches your style, or something completely unexpected.</li>
<li>Unique Challenges | Experience a unique mixture of hand-crafted and procedurally generated levels where it could be a quick and easy run, or an intense onslaught of surprises.</li>
<li>Unlockable Arsenal | Roguelites aren't roguelites without unlockable items! Katanaut offers a vast number of weapons, skills, and perks waiting to be discovered and upgraded.</li>
<li>High-Stakes Combat | Got quick reflexes? We serve up speedy fights where playing smart and thinking quick can make all the difference.</li>
<li>Pixel-Perfect Design | Experience a pixel-art universe where all the details are refined and designed by hand. All to inspire the unsettling beauty of this cosmic nightmare!</li>
<li>Synthwave Soundtrack | Our soundtrack brings immersive energy to every battle and simultaneously aims to paint the vibe of the station’s darkest corners – all made by one immensely talented musician!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I tested out the demo on Kubuntu Linux 24.10 with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the latest Proton 9.0-4</a> and it works without issues. Giving a definite Dead Cells meets Dead Space vibes from this one. With very fast-paced combat and a nice mixture of great lighting with pixel-art it looks great in motion. One to try out and keep an eye on.</p>

      <title>Games to claim from Prime Gaming, Jan 17 edition round-up for SteamOS Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's the up to date list of games available on Amazon Prime Gaming, and what compatibility you can expect for Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck. Each week Prime Gaming, part of what you get with a subscription to Amazon Prime, add and remove various games you can claim to <u>keep</u>.</p>
<p>I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"/> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play. Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Today, January 16th 2025, NVIDIA have revealed multiple security flaws in their GPU drivers, so it's time to get updating again. There's a mixture of issues that affect both Linux and Windows.</p>
<p>Copied below are the security issues announced:</p>

</div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Depending on what driver series you go for, you will need to check what the next version up is that has fixes. NVIDIA listed these Linux driver versions as safe:</p>
<ul>
<li>550.144.03 (released today)</li>
<li>535.230.02 (released today)</li>
</ul>
<p>All driver versions prior to the above are vulnerable to the listed issues.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">550.144.03 Linux <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/drivers/details/238869/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Minor bug fixes and improvements</li>

</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">535.230.02 Linux <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/drivers/details/239545/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Updated the kernel module build process to use CONFIG_CC_VERSION_TEXT from the Linux kernel's Kconfig to detect the compiler used to build the kernel. This may help select the correct compiler on systems where the kernel was built with a compiler other than the default one.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented kernel modules linked using precompiled kernel interface files from loading on recent Debian systems.</li>
<li>In linux-next commit 446d0f4849b1, intended to be included in Linux kernel 6.12, output_poll_changed is removed from struct drm_mode_config_funcs. Do not implement the function pointer member when not present to ensure the driver can compile with newer kernels. Populating modes for DRM connectors during hotplug events will not be supported with r535 and kernels containing the relevant commit.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Windows users need at least 553.62 or 539.19.</p>

      <title>Cubic Odyssey announced as a fusion of Minecraft and No Man&#39;s Sky</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a style that's a fair bit similar to Minecraft with an expansive universe seen in the likes of No Mans Sky, the recently announced Cubic Odyssey from Atypical Games and Gaijin Network Ltd looks pretty darn fun.</p>
<p>An open world multi-planet adventure that blends in all sorts. Planet and space exploration, crafting, vehicle building, quests and an "epic story of saving the galaxy" – it seems to have just a little bit of everything. <em>It was bugging me where I've seen the idea before, turns out it was slightly similar to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2016/10/stellar-overload-the-block-based-adventure-fps-is-now-on-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Stellar Overload</a> from 2016 that is no longer for sale and another called Outerverse.</em></p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="pESTJPDZmmk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c0107dbf08e8abe0f5f06903baf8880b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/pESTJPDZmmk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I love the idea of it, but I have to be blunt, that combat looks pretty <em>weak</em>. Everything else about it looks and sounds great, especially with it having co-op support too.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cubic Odyssey starts right after a crash landing on the surface of a distant planet. A player mines resources, refines materials, and builds everything from tools and outposts to vehicles and starships that give access to free exploration of the galaxy. Every star seen in the sky or in space is the light of a star system. Each star is orbited by planets filled with life, with shifting day-night cycles, bustling NPC cities, pirate outposts, and dangerous ruins waiting to be discovered. The ultimate goal here is to stop the Red Darkness, a spreading galactic infection that mutates wildlife, consumes planets, and threatens all living beings.</p>
<p>The game features seamless ground, air and space traversal, with a brief slice of this experience shown in an announcement trailer. Experience warp jumps between star systems, cruise at blazing fast speed between planets, use the planetary speeders to travel on planets, and explore the underground caves on foot. Players will also be able to join forces with others in an optional co-op mode to take down massive enemies, initiate orbital laser strikes, or build cooperative megastructures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“We’re happy to support the creativity of indie game developers and were thrilled by the scope and ambition of Cubic Odyssey”, - comments Anton Yudintsev, founder of Gaijin Entertainment.</p>
<p>“We intend to build a boundless open world where every planet, every system, and every moment is yours to shape”, - says Andrei Lopata, CEO of Bucharest-based Atypical Games.</p>
<p>You'll need Proton to play it on Linux.</p>

      <title>THREAT VECTOR is an action sci-fi horror FPS coming from KillPixel Games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>KillPixel Games, one of the dev teams responsible for WRATH: Aeon of Ruin, have announced their next game with THREAT VECTOR. Seems it will have Linux support like WRATH too.</p>
<p>About the game: "In 2197, an interplanetary mankind encounters a rogue planet passing through the solar system. Beneath its frozen surface lurks a discovery that threatens all of humanity.  As the human race is brought to the edge of extinction, a failing AI locates a remaining hypersleep pod within lunar orbital Theia's crisis unit chamber. Once awakened, the last surviving soldier must journey across the solar system to secure the THREAT VECTOR."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/49690231737034858gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>They've so far only released a short teaser video on the game, which doesn't give away much and doesn't really show any gameplay but even so, it has me rather excited because it seems like it's going to be incredibly creepy. Story from their Steam page noted above sounds interesting too.</p>
<p>Check out the first teaser below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="9GULXgdgMhk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2732f1c955fb1f2243d96575f3fa4667.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/9GULXgdgMhk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>THREAT VECTOR has a laser focus on the core elements that make classic shooters timeless:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>ENGAGING COMBAT</strong></p>
<p><strong>&gt;</strong> easy to learn, hard to master; varied, dynamic and refined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>EXCELLENT LEVEL DESIGN</strong></p>
<p><strong>&gt;</strong> succinct and elegant levels are infused with the rich history of classic FPS design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>GRIPPING ATMOSPHERE</strong></p>
<p><strong>&gt;</strong> ambience and mood so thick you can cut it with a knife.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Neutralize the murderous mechs, augmented animals and antisocial aliens that menace lunar bases, orbital facilities and space stations across the solar system with an arsenal of ballistic weaponry, including shotguns, carbines, precision rifles, explosive launchers and high-tech, experimental weaponry.</p>

<p>I was hoping this would be the case, since the developer did <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-comes-to-pc-on-january-23-2025-its-getting-optimised-for-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously confirm</a> they were working on Steam Deck optimisations.

      <title>Popular diorama builder Tiny Glade is getting better Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tiny Glade is a gorgeous and relaxing diorama builder about doodling castles and all sorts all over the screen, it's seriously impressive and they've announced work is ongoing for improving it on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>More about it: "Tiny Glade is a relaxing free-form building game. Tap into the joy of making something pretty with no management, no combat, or wrong answers - just kick back, doodle some castles, and turn forgotten meadows into lovable dioramas. Explore gridless building chemistry, and watch the game carefully assemble every brick, pebble and plank, adapting to your whim. Draw a path through a building? A door pops up! Raise the building? Columns and beams line up to support it."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20737348231737032793gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>In an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2198150/view/547850400377602109" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam the developer mentioned working on "controller support &amp; improving the experience on Steam Deck". It's not coming in one big patch though, and instead will come as and when each bit is ready.</p>
<p>One such patch is already out now adding "an alternative mode for camera rotation and zoom" which "should improve the Steam Deck experience, and if you’re on PC, and you’ve been struggling with the camera suddenly yeeting itself as you try to rotate, we recommend checking it out too".</p>
<p>See the separate <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2198150/view/543346166601876515" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes</a> for more.</p>

      <title>Game save data backup tool Ludusavi v0.28 brings new features</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you want to make backups of your game saves, the free and open source tool Ludusavi is an essential item to put in your toolbox. The developer just put up a new release, v0.28.0, which includes a bunch of fixes and new features.</p>
<p>Cross-platform so you can run it on Linux (including Steam Deck), Windows and macOS. Fully featured with the ability to detect thousands of games across Steam, GOG, Epic, Heroic Launcher, Lutris and more. It has a full user interface, as well as command-line tools. Useful for backing up to another drive or anywhere else like somewhere on the cloud.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8158414311737030861gol1.png"/></p>
<p>For this release here's the new features added:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>On Linux, for Lutris roots that point to a Flatpak installation, Ludusavi now checks <code class="inline-code">$XDG_DATA_HOME</code> and <code class="inline-code">$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code> inside of the Flatpak installation of Lutris.</li>
<li>Custom games now let you specify installed folder names. This can be used to satisfy the and path placeholders in cases where Ludusavi can't automatically detect the right folder. For more info, <a href="https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi/blob/v0.28.0/docs/help/custom-games.md" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">see the custom games document</a>.</li>
<li>On the "other" screen, there is a new option to skip backups when saves are only removed but not added/updated. This can be useful because uninstalling a game may cause some of its data (but not all) to be removed, but you may not want to exclude that data from your backups yet.</li>
<li>CLI: <code class="inline-code">config show</code> command.</li>
<li>CLI: The <code class="inline-code">backup</code>, <code class="inline-code">restore</code>, <code class="inline-code">cloud upload</code>, and <code class="inline-code">cloud download</code> commands now support a <code class="inline-code">--gui</code> option for graphical dialog prompts.</li>
<li>CLI: The <code class="inline-code">backup</code> and <code class="inline-code">restore</code> commands now support a <code class="inline-code">--dump-registry</code> option, which includes the serialized registry content in the output. This may be useful if you're consuming the <code class="inline-code">--api</code> output to back up with another tool, but don't have a good way to check the registry keys directly.</li>
<li>CLI: The <code class="inline-code">find</code> command now supports <code class="inline-code">--fuzzy</code> and <code class="inline-code">--multiple</code> options. This is also available for the <code class="inline-code">api</code> command's <code class="inline-code">findTitle</code> request.</li>
<li>CLI: The <code class="inline-code">wrap</code> command now supports several options from the <code class="inline-code">backup</code> command: <code class="inline-code">--path</code>, <code class="inline-code">--format</code>, <code class="inline-code">--compression</code>, <code class="inline-code">--compression-level</code>, <code class="inline-code">--full-limit</code>, <code class="inline-code">--differential-limit</code>, <code class="inline-code">--cloud-sync</code>, <code class="inline-code">--no-cloud-sync</code>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's some other behaviour changes and bug fixes too.</p>

      <title>Intel and NVIDIA drivers holding back a public SteamOS release, Valve not trying to compete with Windows</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>During CES, Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais <a href="https://www.frandroid.com/marques/valve/2462758_il-y-a-12-ans-de-travail-pour-en-arriver-la-interview-de-pierre-loup-griffais-developpeur-de-steamos-los-phare-du-steam-deck" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">spoke to Frandroid</a> about SteamOS, Steam Deck and more and there's some interesting bits in there about the future. In case you missed it recently Valve announced a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">public beta of SteamOS is coming as 'SteamOS expands beyond Steam Deck'</a>.</p>
<p>The interview on Frandroid is in French, but here's some <em>Google-translated</em> info for you. On the subject of SteamOS for everyone, it appears that issues with both Intel and NVIDIA drivers are part of what's holding up the release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:start"><strong>One of the promises was to release SteamOS for everyone, how difficult is it to release it now?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:start">“I think there are a couple of factors. One is that on some platforms, the support is still very basic. Intel, it works a little bit better than before, but our driver teams and Intel are working on it. NVIDIA, the integration of open source drivers is still pretty nascent. There’s still a lot of work to be done on that side… So it’s a little bit complicated to say that we’re going to release this version when most people wouldn’t have a good experience.”</p>
<p style="text-align:start">“And then there’s the ease of installation. We had an installer for SteamOS 2, but here we started with the Steam Deck so everything came straight out of the box, so the process right now is basic. Unlike some community alternatives that add this layer of installation that accompanies users. We haven’t done that yet.”</p>
<p style="text-align:start">“It’s just a matter of priorities.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:start">So it's all in progress and they're working on it together with various driver teams. Eventually the situation should be solved.</p>
<p style="text-align:start">Anyone who uses NVIDIA on desktop Linux will know how badly Steam Big Picture Mode currently works, so this is not exactly a big surprise to me. When I switched over to an AMD GPU, it was like a night and day difference.</p>
<p style="text-align:start">As for the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/lenovo-legion-go-s-with-valves-steamos-is-official-expected-to-launch-in-may/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Legion Go S that will use SteamOS</a>, an interesting note here is that Valve / Lenovo will be using the open source tool <a href="https://github.com/ShadowBlip/InputPlumber" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Input Plumber</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:start"><strong>Are the works of Bazzite, ChimeraOS, Nobara also profitable for you?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:start">“Sometimes yes. A lot of their work is integration, where they use things that the community has developed to create a much more streamlined installation and support experience than our development trees. But there are also quite a few components that are originally developed by the community that we use. For example, on the Legion Go S, we use a component called Input Plumber to manage the controller.”</p>
<p style="text-align:start">"We're not too interested in inventing our own sauce [<em>sic</em>]. If something is already done and meets our standards of performance and functionality, we use it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you're hoping that SteamOS is going to be the Windows-killer that other news sites keep reporting on, Valve have much calmer words to say about that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:start"><strong>Back in the Windows 8 days, Gabe Newell accused Microsoft of killing the PC ecosystem. Is SteamOS the Windows killer developed by Valve?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:start">"I don't think the goal is to have a certain market share, or to push users away from Windows. If a user has a good experience on Windows, there's no problem. I think it's interesting to develop a system that has different goals and priorities, and if it becomes a good alternative for a typical desktop user, that's great. It gives them choice. But it's not a goal in itself to convert users who already have a good experience."</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:start">Valve are also leaving the door open for a future Steam Machine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:start"><strong>Are Steam Machines still in sight, or are portables your priority?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:start">"Right now, we're focused on handhelds. But as our work expands our ability to work on other platforms and have a good experience in different form factors... We've already done a lot to make these consoles connectable to screens, connectable to a controller..."</p>
<p style="text-align:start">"We're not there yet to give priority to a Steam Machine. But in collaboration or internally, it's an open door to the future."</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:start">So in other words, they're just focused on providing a good experience for their own Steam ecosystem. Users moving over if they see it works better for them is nice to have, but they're not trying to directly compete against Windows completely (yet…).</p>

      <title>WebScreen is a customizable open source mini-screen that sits on your monitor to show notifications and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>WebScreen is an upcoming mini-screen that can sit on top of your monitor like a webcam, allowing you to customize it to get notifications and all sorts so you don't miss anything while you're busy (like playing video games). <em>It was announced a while ago, which I missed, but the developer emailed over the press details on it recently.</em></p>
<p>What is it? As they explain: "WebScreen is a customizable secondary display that sits atop your monitor, like a webcam, providing critical notifications, reminders, and visuals right in your line of sight. Whether you’re deep in a game, focused on work, or streaming, WebScreen lets you see what matters most without the constant urge to check your phone or disrupt your workflow. Featuring a vibrant AMOLED display and powered by an ESP32-S3 microcontroller, WebScreen fits seamlessly into any setup and can be personalized to display only the information you want to see."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19709020691736949727gol1.png"/></p>
<p>The device is fully open source too. It's already certified by the <a href="https://certification.oshwa.org/us002702.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">OSHWA</a> along with various bits on <a href="https://github.com/HW-Lab-Hardware-Design-Agency" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>I quite like the idea of it, as I do have a habit of checking my phone constantly. It's clearly something I don't need, but do I want it? Yes, yes I do. The whole thing is built to be as flexible as possible allowing you to run all sorts of applications directly on the device so you never miss a thing with apps built via JavaScript.</p>
