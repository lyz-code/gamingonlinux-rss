      <title>Paradox Interactive completely cancelled Life by You</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox Interactive announced today that Life by You from their studio Paradox Tectonic is now fully cancelled, after previously being delayed. Tectonic is led by former Executive Vice President of EA Play and Head of The Sims label Rod Humble.</p>
<p>A once promising sounding take on The Sims, it seems it just wasn't going to be good enough and so rather than push out another failure, they're canning it completely.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>"For a long time, we’ve held hopes for Life by You and the potential we saw in it, but it is now clear that the game will not be able to meet our expectations. A version that we’d be satisfied with is too far away, and therefore we are taking the difficult decision to cancel the release. Moving forward, we should perform at a much higher level, and it’s obvious that we have work ahead of us," said Fredrik Wester, CEO of Paradox Interactive.</p>
<p>"We’ve performed poorly in recent releases," continued Wester. "Even though we now start new projects in a different manner, it is clear that we must make further changes so that quality is more consistent and the promises we make to our players are met. We have to evaluate how we manage projects and how we organize, for we will and must get better. We have a very solid financial position and a strong core game portfolio, which keeps us confident about our future."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13144738361718654950gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13144738361718654950gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10566097291718654952gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10566097291718654952gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured: Life By You, shots taken from the Steam page</em></p>
<p>An expanded announcement was <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/life-by-you-is-cancelled.1688889/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted</a> on the official Paradox Forum from Mattias Lilja, Deputy CEO of Paradox Interactive, which for the most part was a slightly wordier version of the above, but ended on this note:</p>
<p>"At the end of the day, our job is to release games that are fun, interesting, and challenging for our players, and our every decision should be taken with that purpose in mind. When we get that right, we earn our pay. So, how do we ensure we don’t find ourselves here again? Honestly, there are no real guarantees. Games are difficult to get right, and we’ll definitely make mistakes, which, as these things go, always become painfully apparent in hindsight, but still shouldn’t reach this kind of magnitude regardless. We have to take a long and hard look at what led us here and see what changes we have to make to become better. In the end, our mission remains the same, and we’ll continue to take whatever steps we need to do just that."</p>
<p>The press release notes that this will "negatively" impact their second quarter by "MSEK 208" (nearly 20 million USD).</p>
<p>Paradox aren't exactly doing too great lately, as Wester noted above. Looking at games they've published there's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1268590/Millennia/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Millennia</a> that released in March, which has a Mixed review score on Steam and the player counts dropped like a rock since release. Then there's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1622900/Star_Trek_Infinite/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Star Trek: Infinite</a>, a fancy re-skin of Stellaris, which they abruptly stopped all updates for last year and now has a Very Negative recent review score. At least <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/983870/FOUNDRY/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FOUNDRY</a> that just released in May seems to be doing okay so far though.</p>

      <title>Classic free physics sandbox game The Powder Toy is now on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Remember when falling sand on your screen was all the rage? The Powder Toy is a classic physics sandbox game, which simulates air pressure and velocity, heat, gravity and a countless number of interactions.</p>
<p>It's free and open source, with a pretty active community around it and a lot of fans and now it's been released on Steam too. Making it easier than ever to mess with physics and just — see what happens. It has Native Linux support and my test of the Steam release showed it working fine on Kubuntu 24.04.</p>

      <title>Open source evolution sim Thrive adds endosymbiosis, toxin customization, day / night cycle</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Thrive just keeps on getting more interesting. An open source evolution sim powered by <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot</a> that allows you to take control of a species from its first steps as a tiny organism.</p>
<p>With Thrive version 0.6.7 out now it adds in some pretty big new features. The first being endosymbiosis, which allows you to be more of a predator, giving you the option to engulf prey and process them to serve your needs. This is used as an alternative method to normal unlock conditions for organelles (what you use to build and evolve your creature).</p>
<p>An upgraded day and night cycle is now turned on by default, new toxin varieties to weaponize yourself with, each with a unique effect and colour and <a href="https://github.com/Revolutionary-Games/Thrive/releases/tag/v0.6.7" rel="noopener" target="_blank">lots more</a>. In the next set of updates they're looking into "the implementation of a stamina and sprinting system, new cell parts and customization, and expanded features for toxins".</p>

<p>Thrive has Native Linux support.

      <title>Burn With Me is a deck-builder where you burn your cards to win</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, that's certainly different. Usually a deck-builder card game is about building up your deck, here's it's about sacrificing them and burning them away.</p>
<p>Burn With Me was originally made for the Ludum Dare 55 game jam, but it's now getting an extended version with a Steam release. Made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot</a>, the <a href="https://nozomu57.itch.io/burn-with-me" rel="noopener" target="_blank">itch.io page</a> for the original has it available to try in the browser and there's free downloads for Windows / macOS. My testing showed it working well in Wine 9 on Linux, with the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2954010/Burn_With_Me/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> release noting it will have Linux support.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/695716671718629773gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/695716671718629773gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You only have a limited amount of cards to burn through, with the idea being you place one onto each corner of the Pentagram to add up to the score required to beat the current creature without using up all your cards. The cards all have different totals, and some work together to boost your total.</p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Burn With Me: game prototype that we summoned in 3 days at Ludum Dare 55:</p>
<ul>
<li>14 creatures with unique effects</li>
<li>A wild mechanic of sacrificing your own deck card by card to get advantage</li>
<li>Choosing your difficulty right at the final boss</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">What can you expect in full Steam release?</p>
<ul>
<li>A secret companion to guide you through the mysteries (and to introduce new ones)</li>
<li>Polished graphics, animations and sounds</li>
<li>New cards for new strategies</li>
<li>Branching paths and mini-bosses</li>
<li>New game modes</li>
<li>Ways to bend fate in your favor (at a cost)</li>
<li>A dark story to reveal</li>
</ul>

      <title>Canonical detail improvements the Steam Snap, work to advance gaming continues on Ubuntu</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Canonical are well into development on Ubuntu 24.10, the next non-LTS version of the popular Linux distribution and things keep improving for gamers.</p>
<p>In their latest <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-desktop-s-24-10-dev-cycle-june-update/45784" rel="noopener" target="_blank">developer update</a>, Oliver Smith the Interim Engineering Director for Ubuntu Desktop, goes over some details that were already made in Ubuntu 24.04 like some of the <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/fine-tuning-the-ubuntu-24-04-kernel-for-low-latency-throughput-and-power-efficiency/44834" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fine-tuning</a> they did to the Linux kernel that improved gaming performance.</p>
<p>As for what's to come, plenty of changes are planned for the Steam Snap package. This actually appeared for the first time in the recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/linux-user-share-on-steam-breaks-2pc-thanks-to-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Survey for May</a>, which shows up as "Ubuntu Core 22". Smith noted how the Steam Snap will soon get updates "with a broader range of permissions that should resolve a number of outstanding reports" that will "enable Steam to have access to the things it expects whilst still maintaining the dependency management and updated userspace driver benefits".</p>
<p>More changes are coming like GNOME 46.2 for Ubuntu 24.04 and there's improvements to the new Ubuntu Desktop installer. Their App Center is getting various improvements like running Snaps no longer blocking "users from using the ‘update all’ option in the management interface", supporting externally downloaded .deb files and the gaming tab will soon sort applications by their average rating by default.</p>

      <title>Factory building sim shapez 2 is launching in August</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The truly impressive looking shapez 2 from tobspr Games now has a release window, with the Early Access period set to begin in August.</p>
<p>More about it: "Shapez 2 is a top-down factory-building game where you extract and process geometric shapes. Each shape is its own set of building-blocks that your factories can take apart, stack, paint and put back together in unique ways. Build and automate to produce distinct shapes and solve the production challenge of each goal."</p>
<p>Posted in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2162800/view/4149584538797983676" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam the developer mentioned it should be "Mid-August" but they're not ready to give an exact date just yet. The game has advanced so much since the first title, they're saying the first game now feels much more like a prototype for this second game. They've added in trains, multi-layer factories, fluids, platforms, undo / redo, customizable map generation and so much more. On top of the new fully 3D look too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0VO_52LJ268"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/95d1a2afb300507942c52c325258bf32.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0VO_52LJ268" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's launching with Native Linux support. I'm looking forward to getting lost in this for hours.</p>

      <title>Cats is another idle / clicker item farming game like Banana rising up the Steam player counts</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It seems Egg and it's copy <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/hundreds-of-thousands-of-people-are-now-clicking-a-banana-on-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Banana</a> have potentially started off another trend on Steam, with games designed for you to farm items to sell on the Steam Market.</p>
<p>Banana continues to explode in "player" counts on Steam, with it hitting an all-time peak of 834,343 only 24 hours ago. Of course, most of those are likely bots and people with multiple Steam accounts trying their luck. Meanwhile, Cats has managed a peak count of 48,668 in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>Cats released on May 21st and it's using the same basic idea. Give you something super simple, that you can click a few times and run in the background and over time you get special item drops into your Steam Inventory. These items include various styles of cats, sushi and more.</p>

<p>As you can see opening for a few minutes, clicking a few times and it dropped me a few items:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12300029711718619263gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12300029711718619263gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>That one selected above as you can see, has been sold almost 100,000 times on the Steam Market. It's completely ridiculous. People are leaning into these like the NFT craze, only with less of the blockchain scam silliness. Here it's just as <em>dumb</em> though, but it's also a seemingly super-simple way for a developer to earn money when they get a % cut (I believe it's 10%) of all Steam Market item sales (Valve get a cut too). So if a developer can hook enough people in (or bots…) it's probably a reasonable amount going into their pocket.</p>
<p>Expect others of this type to come as more developers figure it out. We're likely to see quite a few low-effort attempts, and I imagine we'll gradually see them expand to pull in more people with a couple extra hooks. We've had the explosion of survivor-like bullet heaven games (thanks Vampire Survivors), now we're getting Egg-likes? Just like Vampire Survivors, they're not the <em>first</em> to do them, but they do seem to be the first few to really make it big.</p>
<p>You can find Cats on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2977660/Cats/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It runs with Proton 9, not that I suggest you try it, I just like to cover the absurd things that happen on Steam at times.</p>

      <title>Selaco has sold 51,000 copies in only two weeks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The seriously impressive GZDoom-powered shooter Selaco from Altered Orbit Studios has managed to do quite well for the Early Access launch. Be sure to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/selaco-is-now-in-early-access-one-of-the-best-shooters-ive-played-in-forever/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check out my initial thoughts</a>.</p>
<p>Posting on X (Twitter) the developer <a href="https://x.com/SelacoGame/status/1802359554262335590" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SELACO has sold 51,000 units in just two weeks!</p>
<p>Thank you all so much for making this possible 💙</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11820592521718618462gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>In a follow-up post they also mentioned the first "True Update" is due this week, Chapter 2 production is about to begin (which will be a free update) and the official soundtrack is coming really soon which includes extra bonus and unused tracks.</p>
<p>For Steam Deck players, they also posted in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1592280/view/4152961604374721645" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam, that for some reason Valve gave the game a Playable rating for the game using Proton 9 instead of their Native Linux version. This is not what they wanted, as it "skips all of the optimizations we made for the Steam Deck, the custom menus and will make old save files not show in game" so you'll need to tick the Compatibility box in the settings and pick the Linux Runtime which will force it to grab the Linux version. They said they are "still working with Valve to get the game verified".</p>

      <title>NVIDIA exploring ways to support an upstream kernel mode GPU driver</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Time to get your popcorn out, as it seems NVIDIA are continuing their steps to further improve their Linux support on their GPUs.</p>
<p>We've seen NVIDIA make a few more direct steps towards open source lately like the 560 series and above will <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/nvidia-switching-to-open-kernel-modules-by-default-in-future-driver-update-for-turing/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">switch to open kernel modules</a> by default on Turing+, a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/former-nouveau-driver-lead-joins-nvidia-and-sent-a-massive-patch-set/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">big patch set for Nouveau</a>, and even <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/nvidia-developer-contributing-to-the-open-source-nvk-driver/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">contributions to NVK</a>.</p>
<p>Now they're exploring more ways to support the an upstream kernel mode driver. As <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/dri-devel/2024-June/457630.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted</a> on the dri-devel mailing list from NVIDIA's Ben Skeggs, who was the former Nouveau lead:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NVIDIA has been exploring ways to better support the effort for an upstream kernel mode driver for GPUs that are capable of running GSP-RM firmware, since the introduction<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/3ed356488c9b0ca93845501425d427309f4cf616.camel@redhat.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">[1]</a> to Nova.</p>
<p>Use cases have been identified for which separating the core GPU programming out of the full DRM driver stack is a strong requirement from our key customers.</p>
<p>An upstreamed NVIDIA GPU driver should be able to support current and emerging customer use cases for vGPU hosts. NVIDIA's vGPU deployments to date do not support compute or graphics functionality within the hypervisor host, and have no dependency on the Linux graphics subsystem, instead implementing the minimal functionality required to run vGPU guest VMs.</p>
<p>For security-sensitive environments such as cloud infrastructure, it's important to continue support for running a minimal footprint vGPU host driver in a stripped-down / barebones kernel environment.</p>
<p>This can be achieved by supporting both VFIO and DRM drivers as clients of a core driver, without requiring a full-fledged DRM driver (or the DRM subsystem itself) to be built into the host kernel.</p>
<p>A core driver would be responsible for booting and communicating with GSP-RM, enumeration of HW configuration, shared/partitioned resource management, exception handling, and event dispatch.</p>
<p>The DRM driver would do all the standard things a DRM driver does, and implement GPU memory management (TTM/HMM), KMS, command submission etc, as well as providing UAPI for userspace clients. These features would be implemented using HW resources allocated from a core driver, rather than the DRM driver being directly responsible for HW programming.</p>
<p>As Nouveau's KMD is already split (in the logical sense) along similar lines, we're using it here for the purposes of this RFC to demonstrate the feasibility of such an architecture, and open it up for discussion.</p>

      <title>SteamOS 3.6.5 Preview for Steam Deck out, plus two Steam Beta Client updates</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has now put up SteamOS 3.6.5 Preview for Steam Deck, plus a further two Beta releases of the Steam Client for all users.<em> They're all pretty small updates.</em></p>
<p>First up SteamOS 3.6.5 Preview <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/6851744408519077027" rel="noopener" target="_blank">notes</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue with 3.6.4 that could cause incorrect inputs on the left side of the Deck controller.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given that the recent updates to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/steamos-36-preview-for-steam-deck-brings-numerous-big-new-features/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.6 Preview</a> have been quite small, perhaps we're getting close to the stable release now. It's going to be another fun one to see everyone on that includes the likes of an updated Arch Linux base, updated Mesa graphics drivers, support for some HDMI CEC features, Steam Deck LCD overclocking and much more.</p>
<p>And the two Beta updates for the main Steam Client (Desktop and Steam Deck) <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements" rel="noopener" target="_blank">include</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed disk write failures reported in the logs when starting games with the shader manager disabled. (June 14th)</li>
<li>Fixed in-game purchase browser not loading properly. (June 16th)</li>

      <title>Mysterious new Shovel Knight title teased, plus Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope DX</title>
      <author>Pengling</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As confirmed by developer Yacht Club Games at the end of their latest <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_FCGpSAgM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Yacht Club Games Presents broadcast</a>, a brand new Shovel Knight game is on the way! Plus, we're also being treated to Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope DX.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/what-s-next-for-shovel-knight/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the official announcement</a>;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>We're committed to crafting an experience that not only honors the Shovel Knight legacy but also pioneers groundbreaking, innovative gameplay mechanics. This isn't just another sequel - it's a bold new adventure that will launch Shovel Knight into an entirely new dimension of gaming.</em></p>
<p><em>We're not quite ready to unveil everything just yet, rest assured, the game will bring electrifying action, richer mechanics, and all the timeless charm you expect from a Shovel Knight title.</em></p>
<p><em>It's been four years in the making because we're dedicated to perfecting every pixel and ensuring that the innovation will redefine what a Shovel Knight game can be.</em></p>
<p><em>And for those of you eager to uncover what's coming next, you might find subtle clues scattered throughout our previous games. Be sure to play Dig, Pocket Dungeon, and all the games in the Treasure Trove to notice the hidden details we've planted. Stay tuned, Shovelers- the future of the Blue Burrower is bright!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A cryptic 9-second teaser video was also provided;</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lfhm3IPPMcU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/94d705db879e729edd8c27d3ff0ec45c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lfhm3IPPMcU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The description's mention of "<em>an entirely new dimension of gaming</em>", and the teaser simply showing the Yacht Club Games logo in 3D, might suggest that the long-requested so-called "Shovel Knight 64" 3D platformer could finally be on the way - though that's just my own speculation!</p>
<p>No other details, including platforms, have been announced as yet, but hopefully the fact that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/250760/Shovel_Knight_Treasure_Trove/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the original Shovel Knight</a> had a native Linux version will have some bearing here. If not, we've always got Proton!</p>
<p>On top of that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2661310/Shovel_Knight_Shovel_of_Hope_DX/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope DX</a> is coming which is an "enhanced edition of the pixel-perfect adventure that started it all". This does list Linux in the system requirements just like the original. More:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jump, battle foes, and seek treasures as you quest to defeat the Order of No Quarter and their vile leader, The Enchantress. Shovel of Hope DX enriches the original game with 20 distinctive playable characters, seamless online multiplayer, and innovative additions like rewind and save states. Whether you're a long-time shoveler or eager to discover the Blue Burrower for the first time, Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope DX invites everyone to celebrate a decade of digging, dashing, and discovery.</p>

      <title>Killer Bean looks absolutely nuts in the latest trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Over the top action? Check. You play as a Bean? Check. I'm not sure what else you need to really know about it other than you obviously need to play it.</p>
<p>"After being betrayed by the Shadow Agency and learning the truth about their evil ways, Killer Bean has made it his life goal to destroy them. Yet this is easier said than done, as Killer Bean will face armies of enemies, and mysterious Shadow Beans who are better trained and more powerful than him."</p>
<p>What you get is a first and third person roguelike shooter. Each campaign you play is fresh, with everything changed. So the locations will be different, new missions, new characters, new bosses and even the story changes each time.</p>
<p>Check out the newer slightly extended trailer from a few days ago below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="87KtMnmZWzQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8debe9895567ba2fcfa3786b07356b8d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/87KtMnmZWzQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Totally procedurally generated missions and story, packed with plot twists and surprises.</li>
<li>Level up Skill Trees for your style of play: Stealth, Melee Combat, Parkour, Guns Blazing.</li>
<li>Different factions of enemies who all dislike each other.</li>
<li>Ragdolls and physics combat galore.</li>
<li>Lots of vehicles to drive, and lots of weapons to try.</li>
<li>Main characters that roam the map, who will either help you or hurt you.</li>
<li>Design your own Shadow Beans that will hunt down Killer Bean.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As for what support to expect? Well it was already confirmed <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/08/the-ridiculous-killer-bean-is-getting-a-third-person-shooter-video-game/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in 2021</a> that it will have Linux support. That was quite a while ago though, so the developer has <a href="https://x.com/Real_KillerBean/status/1801496757198639328" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed</a> again on X (Twitter) in reply to a question about if it's going to be Steam Deck optimised: "Yes, I have a Steam Deck to test on. Plus it will be a native Linux build.".</p>

      <title>Ancient Forge are giving away a custom-skin Steam Deck for Hotel Galactic</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hotel Galactic was recently revealed at the PC Gaming Show, a cozy management game inspired by Studio Ghibli's classic pictures and they're giving away one fancy looking Steam Deck.</p>
<p>More about it: "Hotel Galactic is a cozy management game where you transform a rundown intergalactic hotel into a thriving tourist destination. Inspired by the enchanting worlds of Studio Ghibli, Hotel Galactic blends wholesome nostalgia with modern fairy tale magic, ushering you into a new era of simulation games crafted by Ancient Forge."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="z5PjZNMq6Do"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5058372ae7d25609858702ebec4bb057.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/z5PjZNMq6Do" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They announced today they're "throwing a special giveaway to celebrate Hotel Galactic's announcement and our presence at Pyrkon 2024". It really does look lovely too:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9944194391718374818gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Presumably, this means it will have good Steam Deck support. Be a bit weird doing this if it didn't. You can enter the giveaway on <a href="https://gleam.io/QhmjA/pyrkon-x-hotel-galactic-giveaway-" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gleam</a> with the top prize being the customized 512 GB OLED Steam Deck, and some Steam keys for runners up. Winners will be picked on July 8th.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2183670/Hotel_Galactic/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow the game on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>The Tricky Trials update is live now for Minecraft</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another big Minecraft update is live now with Tricky Trials bringing with it new decorative blocks, hostile mobs, items, weapons, paintings and the trial chambers.</p>
<p>With the new trial chambers structure you get to explore something filled with traps and treasures, so there's plenty of challenge. You'll also find the new mobs to fight off in here too including the breeze that has a powerful projectile attack to send you flying, and it like to spin around in circles around you. There's also the bogged too, a poisonous skeleton that will be quite a nuisance.</p>
<p>A new block with the vault is a big part of this too. Once you defeat all the mobs from the spawner, you get a trial key which can open the vault and every player involved gets it, instead of one player just emptying the rewards.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NG-5L34HqOs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/aca8538bef52e523c070a1c2a8ef07f7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NG-5L34HqOs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's a lot more to this update including a larger system of opt-in challenges that include village raids, a new mace weapon, a new block with the crafter to set up auto-crafting, a whole bunch of new decorative blocks, new music discs, 4 new tipped arrows, 6 new status effects, 9 new music tracks and more in the <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-java-edition-1-21" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Minecraft</a> is also on sale with 50% off so a good time to go and grab it.</p>

      <title>Steam Client updated with improvements for Steam Deck, Linux, VR and Steam Input</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lots and lots of improvements and bug fixes have arrived in the latest stable update to the Steam Client for Linux, macOS, Windows, VR and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>First up the stuff that's <em>specific</em> to the <strong>Steam Deck</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Show battery information for connected Bluetooth devices under Settings-&gt;Bluetooth and in the Quick Access menu.</li>
<li>Added a per-device toggle to Settings-&gt;Bluetooth that controls whether a device is allowed to wake SteamDeck from sleep.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that would cause the UI to show stale data for Bluetooth devices.</li>
<li>Fixed clickable screenshots in the post-game summary and library screenshot section not opening the screenshot dialog to the correct item.</li>
<li>The magnifier scale can now be configured in Settings-&gt;Display.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And then the main Steam Client update that everyone will see across Linux, macOS, Windows and Steam Deck:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Overlay</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Significantly improved in-game overlay responsiveness and fixed cases where the UI could feel stuck or run at 1fps on Windows.

</ul>
<p><strong>Library</strong></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Update the Steam/Guide button configurations for non-Deck gamepads to match the behavior on Deck, ex: Steam+X button to open the on-screen keyboard instead of Steam + Select, etc.</li>
<li>Allow external gamepad controllers to load the same guide button configuration they would normally load on Desktop.</li>
<li>Improved Gyro To Mouse behavior when connected over bluetooth.</li>
<li>Added the -nojoy command line option to prevent Steam from enumerating controllers for users with who are experiencing crashes.</li>
<li>Added "Universal Face Button Glyphs" toggle in controller settings.</li>
<li>Added exclusion of Gyro Activation Buttons from controller configs that don't have those buttons.</li>
<li>Fixed issue with stale bindings on Quick Settings menu when multiple controllers are plugged in.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remote Play</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added a one time pairing step when streaming from a remote computer.</li>
<li>The Remote Play Together UI is always available in the Steam overlay for supported games.</li>
<li>Use ScreenCaptureKit for desktop capture on macOS 14 (Sonoma).</li>
<li>Added support for hardware video encoding on macOS 14 (Sonoma).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Big Picture Mode</strong></p>

<li>Fixed a crash when opening the overlay in some games.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>VR</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fix for empty Steam screen in SteamVR dashboard after launching a game.</li>
<li>Improved the layout of notifications.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Build the greatest car parks ever in the retro-tycoon styled Car Park Capital</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I feel like I just need to play Car Park Capital after discovering it today. Styled much like a late 90s retro tycoon game, it looks like it's from a different time and I love it.</p>
<p>You know the games I mean right? The classics like Transport Tycoon Deluxe, Rollercoaster Tycoon, Sim City and all the others from around that sort of time. Car Park Capital would fit right in there!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The car industry has identified a few places on earth that do not know <strong>THE FREEDOM OF CAR DEPENDENCY</strong>.<br/>
So they hired you to increase car sales and oil consumption.<br/>
How? <strong>By building the greatest car parks ever!</strong><br/>
<br/>
Turn neighborhoods into car parks, create the need for car commuting and parking.<br/>
Use propaganda to inform people on why they need it.<br/>
<br/>
Learn to become a real tycoon.. Asphalt means freedom, <em>right</em>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have a look at their first trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="VU5TaRFOOs4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3f35dcad5b7fda26f3578b30caa92367.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/VU5TaRFOOs4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Real time simulation with hundreds of vehicles and citizens.</li>
<li>Per-person behavior simulation: Each person is different, except they're all bald.</li>
<li>Play into their minds with propaganda.</li>
<li>3D map editing: Be creative when designing car parks or other buildings. You can make multi-floor structures.</li>
<li>Expand as the demand increases. Get rewarded accordingly.</li>
<li>Elevators!</li>
<li>Retro styled graphics with an aesthetic color palette.</li>
<li>Moddability: Scripts and content can be altered if you possess some Lua skills.</li>
<li><em>More features are in development.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The developer mentioned it's being built on Linux, so it will of course have Native Linux support.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3031880/Car_Park_Capital/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wishlist / follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, after being Epic Exclusive for so long! Hopefully we won't see such long exclusive deals in future, as part of Square Enix's change in strategy they <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/square-enix-shifting-from-quantity-to-quality-and-be-more-multi-platform/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced recently</a>.</p>

      <title>Bronze Age pixel-arts RTS game TFC: The Fertile Crescent 1.0 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For those of you who love base-building RTS games like Age of Empires, perhaps give TFC: The Fertile Crescent a try now it's fully released.</p>
<p>It's a little different to most other similar strategy games though, with food playing a much more active role in the game. It's not just a case of getting x amount of food to train units, as food determines the growth rate of your population and the speed at which you accumulate Knowledge Points. You need to keep a constant eye on your food, as a sneak attack on your farmland could end up crippling you. It's as much about your economy and defense, as it is about destroying the enemy base. Quite a challenge actually overall!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vZIlCRfQ3po"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/12cb00520b2c8170f5a7e0fdfa4a2542.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vZIlCRfQ3po" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Campaign Mode:</strong> Dive into 10 missions that will test your strategic skills across diverse challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Overhauled Artwork:</strong> Experience revamped pixel art graphics, showcasing a fresh new look for environments, as well as an enhanced user interface.</li>
<li><strong>New Map Types: </strong>Explore new terrains with our newly added map types, each offering unique strategic challenges. Expect map obstacles, rivers, and fish to add depth and variety to your gameplay.</li>
<li><strong>War Chariot Units:</strong> Unleash the power of the war chariot, a formidable new unit that can turn the tide of battle with its speed and strength. The war chariot has different stats for each Bronze Age civilization.</li>
<li><strong>New Technologies: </strong>Enhance your civilization with cutting-edge Bronze Age technologies: Master of Siege Warfare for the Assyrians, Improved Watchtower for the Babylonians and Hieroglyphic Networks for the Egyptians.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Game Mechanics:</strong> Prepare for deeper strategic gameplay with improved starvation mechanics.

      <title>Hypersomnia is a free and open source top-down competitive 2D shooter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Feeling competitive? Hypersomnia from Patryk Czachurski is a top-down 2D competitive online shooter. It's free, open source and you can play it via Steam or directly in your browser. The developer of it mentioned they wrote it in C++ without using a game engine, and some of the code they've written (<a href="https://github.com/TeamHypersomnia/rectpack2D" rel="noopener" target="_blank">rectpack2D</a>) was even used in the likes of Assassin's Creed: Valhalla.</p>
<p>What's their aim with it? They want it to become the "ultimate open-source 2D shooter - a grand community project extensible without limit". A lofty goal but perhaps they just might be able to do it, if they get some more eyes on it and what they've been able to do with it is quite impressive.</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Some highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>24 unique firearms.</li>
<li>2 game modes: Bomb defusal (team-based) and Gun game (free-for all).</li>
<li>6 magic spells, 4 grenade types and 7 melee weapons.</li>
<li>An in-game map editor that lets you host a work-in-progress map to test with your friends in a single click. Quickly iterate your map unlike in any game engine.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Writing about the game the developer mentioned in <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our Discord</a>: "The netcode relies on full simulation determinism - this includes Box2D physics. I'm using standard floating-point calculations and rely on IEEE754 compliance. I also use STREFLOP for portable math function implementations. This is commonly done for RTS games with a lot of synchronized units, however this technique is rarely if ever seen in games with complex physics, esp. shooters." — sounds like some impressive tech going on behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Check it out free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2660970/Hypersomnia/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>, play via the <a href="https://hypersomnia.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website</a> and see the code on <a href="https://github.com/TeamHypersomnia/Hypersomnia" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a> (AGPL-3.0 license). It has Native Linux support too of course.</p>

<p>The laptops are made in partnership with Carbon Systems, a company known for supplying the MSP channel but with Kubuntu Focus ensuring all parts have the "most complete, Linux-first support".</p>
<p>“Linux powers many of the ecosystems we rely on today, from servers to smartphones. The Ir series is perfect for developers, creators, and engineers who want a reliable, Linux-native device compatible with these ecosystems.” says Dana Roth, CEO. “These beautiful, light-weight, slim notebooks are portable, and make working anywhere incredibly easy.”</p>
<p>They offer free shipping to continental US and Canada but outside those regions you need to get in touch with them.</p>

      <title>Valve faces a £656 million lawsuit in the UK for &#39;overcharging 14 million PC gamers&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A new lawsuit was filed earlier this month in the UK that alleges Valve, owner of Steam, has been "overcharging 14 million PC gamers and abusing its dominant position in the UK".</p>
<p>First reported by the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpwwyj6v24xo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BBC</a>, the claim was filed by Vicki Shotbolt, the founder and CEO of <a href="https://parentzone.org.uk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Parent Zone</a>. Shotbolt is also on the executive board of the UK Council for Child Internet Safety and is a trustee for MILA the media literacy and information alliance.</p>
<p>There's even been a dedicated website set up for this lawsuit under <a href="https://steamyouoweus.co.uk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">steamyouoweus.co.uk</a>, with Shotbolt setting up a company named Vicki Shotbolt Class Representative Limited to bring this action.</p>
<p>From the claim website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Valve Corporation faces a £656 million collective action claim for overcharging 14 million PC gamers and abusing its dominant position in the UK. Valve owns and operates Steam – the largest digital distribution platform for PC games in the world.</p>
<p>Companies who hold a dominant position in a market are not allowed to charge excessive or anti-competitive prices. They also cannot impose other unfair trading conditions that prevent or hinder others from competing with them.</p>
<p>We believe Valve Corporation has been unfairly shutting out competition for PC games and in-game content, which has meant that UK customers have paid too much for these products.</p>
<p>Vicki Shotbolt, a leading campaigner for children’s digital rights, filed the claim, via Vicki Shotbolt Class Representative Limited, on behalf of all affected gamers at the Competition Appeal Tribunal 5 June 2024.</p>
<p>Vicki accuses Valve Corporation of shutting out competition in the PC gaming market by forcing game publishers to sign up to pricing restrictions that dictate the lowest price games can be sold for on rival platforms.</p>
<p>This has led to UK consumers paying too much for PC games and add-on content, and has enabled the gaming giant to continue charging an excessive commission – of up to 30% – to publishers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Represented by Milberg London LLP, it's worth noting this is not their first rodeo, as they're also <a href="https://playstationyouoweus.co.uk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">going after Sony</a> for £5 billion.</p>
<p>Natasha Pearman, the partner leading the case, says: “Valve has a had a stranglehold on the PC games market for a long time and with this claim we’re challenging the status quo. Competition law is there to protect consumers and ensure that markets work properly. When they don’t work properly and consumers are harmed, collective actions of this kind provide consumers with a voice and a way of holding big companies, like Valve, to account. We’re delighted to be working with Vicki to seek compensation for UK consumers.”</p>
<p>It boils down to their three main issues that they claim:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>Price </strong><strong>parity obligation clauses</strong>: We say that Valve Corporation imposes price parity clauses that restrict and prevent game developers from offering better prices on PC-games on rival platforms, limiting consumer choice and harming competition.</li>
<li><strong>Tying</strong>: We say that the restrictions Valve Corporation imposes, that mean the add-on content for games must also be purchased from Steam, restricts competition in the market.</li>
<li><strong>Excessive pricing</strong>: We argue that Valve Corporation has imposed an excessive commission, of up to 30%, charged to publishers, that resulted in inflated prices on its Steam platform.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The first point is one we've heard repeated many times before, but there's never been any proof on it. Which perhaps the Wolfire lawsuit and this may actually bring to light. An accusation doesn't necessarily mean they're right though. Something people get confused on often is Steam Keys, which are completely separate to Steam Store purchases. Valve <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/keys" rel="noopener" target="_blank">do ask</a> developers not to "give Steam customers a worse deal than Steam Key purchasers", but again, that's specifically for Steam Keys.</p>
<p>This sounds very similar to the case that Wolfire brought up against Valve in the US.</p>
<p><em>I've reached out to Valve press for any comments on it. Will update if they reply,</em></p>

      <title>Terrorformer TD is a tower defense roguelite with a map you terraform as you go</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a map that erodes and grows as the game progresses, Terrorformer TD puts a rather unique spin on the tower defense genre.</p>
<p>What began as a Master of Fine Arts thesis project quickly transformed into the pride and joy of solo developer TJ Cioffe of onewinter games, as he realized that this was a real opportunity to build upon previous tower defense staples and take the genre in his own direction. Check out the trailer for Steam Next Fest:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WtgP7XmrM-Q"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/590be82bf837f81ab6992944e5da58e4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WtgP7XmrM-Q" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"I've had a blast researching and testing what makes the best tower defense games so good,” onewinter games solo developer TJ Cioffe stated. “It’s a fascinating genre that stands between modern Vampire Survivors-likes and RTS classics like Starcraft that’s spawning some really creative concepts lately. There’s never been a more interesting time to be making a tower defense game and I’m excited to share Terrorformer TD with the world!"</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Terraform the Battlefield: </strong>Unlock new procedurally generated maps, each with unique terraforming opportunities and base-building strategies. Grow along with the dynamic battlefield and design the right defenses for each playthrough's challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Assemble a Home Tower: </strong>Customize your Home Tower each run from the components you've unlocked, giving you access to special abilities, upgrades, and weapons! Earn dozens of permanent perks as you play and level up, increasing your survivability on each run.</li>
<li><strong>Choose Your Own Adventure:</strong> Unlocks, upgrades, and map erosion are randomized every round, so each playthrough is different. Try your hand at a harder difficulty, or see how long you can last using the Weekly Challenge's loadout!</li>
<li><strong>Take on Enemy Hordes:</strong> Counter enemy abilities like Fortify, Warp, and Disable Tower with 25 unique towers that earn XP and level up, growing stronger as the game goes on. Mix-and-match defenses to find the best combination for each enemy challenge.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2837760/Terrorformer_TD/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a> - it has Native Linux support. The full release is planned for September 2024.</p>

      <title>Sally is a life sim about community and belonging aboard a magic flying ship</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Points for trying something a little different with the life sim genre here. Sally puts you aboard a magic flying ship, which is a bit unusual.</p>
<p>It has all the usual points you might expect though like crafting, cooking, farming, building and then add into that exploring the skies. The skies are filled with floating islands each their own distinct ecosystem with different seasons, resources, animals and inhabitants. There's some random generation here with each play-through being different as it gives you new characters each time with their own emotions, tastes, interests and more. You also get to completely customize your character.</p>

<p>This one actually had a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lucid-tales/sally/description" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> campaign which was quite successful back in 2022 with CA$137,377 raised.</p>

      <title>Piece together the broken memories of a cybernetic house in Psychroma</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Psychroma looks pretty wild. A narrative-driven side-scroller where you play as a digital medium. Confront the past by piecing together the broken memories of a cybernetic house, and exorcise the ghosts in the machine.</p>
<p>If you enjoy games that have a diverse setting with BIPOC and LGBTQIA+ characters that are central to the narrative, this one is for you. This is quite a <em>dark</em> game too with a mature and violent theme to it. So you've been warned on that. This is probably one of the wildest looking side-scrolling adventure games I've seen for a while.</p>
<p>More about it: "Acid rain rots away exposed rebar in the half-developed megacity once known as Toronto. Humanity modifies itself at a frequency never seen before. A housing crisis not only endangers the market, but the displaced and unhoused. One dilapidated house, only referred to as The Commons, is the center of our story. What was once meant to be a safe haven has turned against every occupant to have dwelled within.</p>
<p>You can't remember how you got here, and you are trapped inside. You must use a strange deck of memory cards holding the recorded memories of the past and present residents to manipulate time and navigate the house."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UgjmwywNCgI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0e768fff955beb69da62996b7eb9371c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UgjmwywNCgI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>/TIME JUMP</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use a cybernetic memory card system to navigate through time.</li>
<li>Gain the perspective of others' stored memories.</li>
<li>Gain access to new parts of the house.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>/COMMUNICATE WITH THE DEAD</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use an interactive Ouija system to speak with ghosts and gather info that would otherwise be hidden.</li>
<li>Descramble memories by inputting keywords provided by the ghost in the machine.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>/SURGERY</strong></p>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available with a Native Linux <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1879950/Psychroma/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">version on Steam</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Update 13/06/24 16:00 UTC</strong>: on desktop Linux it's currently an empty download so I've let the developer know. The issue is that they've set it for Steam Deck in their Steam admin, which ends up making it <em>only</em> available to download on Steam Deck and not desktop Linux. This has been a repeating issue lately, so I've emailed Valve to ask if they plan to make this more clear for developers.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1879950/depots/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> as an example, you can see their Linux build is set for Steam Deck:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20173188601718292896gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The idea, as I understand it on the Steam Deck setting, is for special content <em>just</em> for Steam Deck. So when it's set, that's <em>only</em> available for Steam Deck.</p>
<p><strong>Update 14/06/24 08:00 UTC</strong>: the developer has now fixed that issue above.</p>

      <title>Prickle is a wholesome Sokoban-style puzzler about catching baby hedgehogs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In the game Prickle you play as a hedgehog dad trying to collect all your children, as they've done a bit of a runner so you need to stick them all together and get them back home.</p>
<p>Prickle is a Sokoban-style puzzler but instead of the usual block-pushing, you're zipping around levels and collecting little hoglets that stick together like glue. Then you need to somehow get around to the exit, which is easier said than done. It's actually quite a nice little tweak to the usual because these sticky little critters can end up stuck together in all sorts of different ways, so you'll need to attempt to get them stuck exactly how you want, so you can rotate them all around and get them home.</p>
<p>It's a very sweet and wholesome idea.</p>

      <title>Logic puzzler Linkito will tease your brain as you connect everything together</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>French solo developer Kalinarm has a demo available for Linkito, a logic puzzler all about making engineering connections. Split across over 80 levels in the full game you'll be mastering the flow of power and information in no time, apparently.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5198950981718177718gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5198950981718177718gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>What's quite interesting with this one is that not only does it have the main story campaign to play through, where you use your logic to climb the corporate ladder, but there's also a full level editor with over 100 elements to design your own puzzles, and of course play the creations of others including full campaigns. But not just that, it will also have integrations with real-life circuits like Arduino or OSC protocols. There's even going to be a special Twitch campaign to play with viewers.</p>
<p>The developer gave a nice overview in a recent video:</p>

      <title>Hundreds of thousands of people are now clicking a Banana on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As a ridiculous update to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/over-30000-people-are-clicking-a-picture-of-a-banana-on-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an article I did recently</a> about the free game called Banana, where it seemed insane that over 30,000 people were clicking it - now a whole lot more people are doing so too.</p>
<p>To refresh your little minds a moment. On Steam, there's a game called Banana. It's an idle clicker game, where all you do is load it up and click a picture of a Banana. You can leave it in the background, and let it do its thing. Over time, you gradually get Steam Items in the form of random Bananas.</p>
<p>It looks like this and that's literally it:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20102023881718137047gol1.png"/></p>
<p>The number of players has only continued to climb on it too. About 7 hours ago (<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2923300/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>) it hit a peak player count of 252,171. Although, according to what the developer told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24173617/banana-clicker-game-steam-egg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Polygon</a>, they've had a bit of a bot problem they're trying to solve. The developer has given the game updates, like forcing you to actually click now and then, to help reduce some botting so the actual number of people is probably a reasonably good deal lower.</p>
<p>In a recent post, the developer also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2923300/view/4190115667805431237" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> over 650,000 people have now downloaded it.</p>
<p>Why? Those Steam Items. Those gloriously tasty bananas. People are going, well — ape over them. Bananas go into your Steam inventory and so you can sell them. And clearly, people are actually buying them too, just look at my Retronana that's had nearly 10,000 sold in the last 24 hours. Not for much though for these but some of them are very limited and so people are trying their luck.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8925894331718137290gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8925894331718137290gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>The game has a Linux version, although it doesn't work for me, but Proton 9 does. Not that I suggest you "play" it, I just find it amusingly <em>absurd</em> that this continues to be a thing. It's <em>not</em> a surprise though, this <em>is</em> the kind of thing Valve invites with the Steam market.</p>
<p>It's low-stakes trading that takes no effort at all from everyone, somewhat reminiscent of the stupid NFT bubble (glad that's over) or actual trading cards but not as fun. People just like to collect things and be a part of something in some ways, while of course there's going to be a large percentage that are hoping to nab one of the rare items that they might be able to sucker someone into buying to then spend their Banana money on Steam directly for a new game.</p>
<p>Banana is available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2923300/Banana/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Old school immersive sim FPS &#39;Core Decay&#39; still alive and the latest update sounds awesome</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A few months ago there was <a href="https://x.com/ScottApogee/status/1742587980785590339" rel="noopener" target="_blank">news</a> about layoffs at 3D Realms and Slipgate Ironworks, and it seemed like Ivar Hill's immersive sim Core Decay was hit. Thankfully though, Core Decay is alive and well.</p>
<p>Posted in an update on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1260940/view/4148458004753967730" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> and the developer's new <a href="https://community.coredecay.com/blog" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website</a>, Hill mentioned "I am entirely dedicated to seeing the project to completion and am personally working on it every day" but there's "no specific news to share in regards to the development schedule or involved parties, but it is my full intent to continue to work on Core Decay".</p>
<p>Some fresh screenshots were shared as well and it's looking rather interesting:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10389615811718116360gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10389615811718116360gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15241609211718116362gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15241609211718116362gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The latest <a href="https://community.coredecay.com/blog/16-dev-blog-2-troubleshooter" rel="noopener" target="_blank">development update</a> posted June 9th goes into a lot more design detail, with even more screenshots sprinkled in it and it's a fun read, and getting me quite excited for it. I like the thought of having multiple ways to go about an objective, from brute force to talking people into doing it for you, or just finding another way around sneakily.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12851744061718116556gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12851744061718116556gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Certainly sounds like a Deus Ex game, and that's awesome.</p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>THE FINAL BREATH OF HUMANITY.</strong> Travel a world on the brink of annihilation, uncover a great conspiracy, and face the lengths we are willing to go for our own survival. Your search for answers takes you across Antarctica, Asia, North America, Africa, and Europe.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>A TRUE IMMERSIVE SIM.</strong> Engage with an endless variety of gameplay mechanics, and solve challenges your own way. Talk your way out of tricky situations, pick locks and hack computers, find paths through city rooftops and ancient sewer systems, engage in lethal or non-lethal combat, and explore places that feel like real locations inhabited by real people.<br/>
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most recent trailer from 2023 is below:</p>

<p>Core Decay will have Native Linux support. In fact, Hill actually <a href="https://mastodon.social/@ivarhill/110407571977284554" rel="noopener" target="_blank">moved over</a> to using Linux last year.</p>
<p>Go give it a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1260940/Core_Decay/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wishlist and follow on Steam</a> or on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/core_decay" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>

      <title>WOLFHOUND is a sci-fi World War II metroidvania from the creator of Chasm </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bit Kid creator of Chasm have announced WOLFHOUND, a sci-fi World War II metroidvania where you play as a one-man-army Capt. Chuck “WOLFHOUND” Rosetti.</p>
<p>Here you infiltrate a super secret Axis base in the Bermuda Triangle where Allied forces have gone missing. WOLFHOUND quickly finds not just enemy soldiers, but grotesque, mutated nightmares out to stop him. Steal their weaponry and use powerful experimental equipment while venturing into the heart of the island, where castles and crystal caverns hide dark, fascinating secrets.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="iWprFF0A-io"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/08694a166dfa9e8154ceefe7fc8b138c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/iWprFF0A-io" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explore</strong> a massive, hand-crafted island with 10 interconnected areas</li>
<li><strong>Relive</strong> an iconic era of action gaming with challenging 2D mechanics and authentic pixel art (320x180 native res), with native 4K resolution and your choice of razor sharp pixels or convincing CRT effects</li>
<li><strong>Survive and thrive</strong> with cutting-edge technology like an upgradable jetpack, offering new strategies for overcoming obstacles</li>
<li><strong>Unleash</strong> deadly weaponry against foes both human and monstrous with arsenal ranging from conventional firearms to devastating experimental weapons like Rail Guns and Flamethrowers</li>
<li><strong>Upgrade</strong> your arsenal to pack an extra punch using modified gun parts and special types of ammunition</li>
</ul>
<p>It will have a Native Linux version and Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>After more than 200,000 recruits ventured into the procedurally-generated depths of Chasm, Bit Kid sought to return to the Metroidvania genre, while eschewing procedural generation in favor of a single, intricately-designed world. Bit Kid brought together artistic talent behind the Shantae series, Freedom Planet 2, and Sparklite along with a heroic chiptune soundtrack courtesy of musician RushJet1 (Cave Story+, Alwa’s Legacy, PewDiePie's Tuber Simulator).</p>
<p>“While I’ve always been a big fan of retro games and pixel art, I really wanted to dive deep into the style of NES and 8-bit gaming,” said James Petruzzi, founder and lead developer at Bit Kid. “We’re aiming to be as authentic as possible, stylistically: an 8-bit color palette, 320x180 pixel resolution, and a soundtrack composed in Famitracker which has enabled homebrewers to create authentic NES music for many years.”</p>

<p>Pugstorm and Fireshine Games have revealed more details about the 1.0 release for Core Keeper that will arrive on August 27th.</p>
<p>Coming to Core Keeper for the very first time, the 1.0 update will introduce brand new (optional) PvP functionality, an entirely revamped world generation system and a mysterious new biome to explore: The Passage. We're also getting two brand new combat styles with the introduction of the Mage and Warlock builds, plus new skill trees, equipment, enemies, bosses and the conclusive chapter to Core Keeper’s main story, alongside much, much more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="L4IVUApXbXU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1b20c8d9159f498e4574bdab083fe6e2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/L4IVUApXbXU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With the new world generation, old worlds will still work, but the developers said they "strong encourage" players to start a new world to get all of it.</p>
<p>Honestly, it sounds amazing from what they've said. </p>
<p>Core Keeper is available right now in Early Access on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1621690/Core_Keeper/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Free-roaming megasim sandbox RPG &#39;Streets of Fortuna&#39; sounds wonderfully unique</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently announced by Kitfox Games (publisher of Dwarf Fortress) is Streets of Fortuna, a free-roaming megasim sandbox RPG that's a bit like The Sims meets Project Zomboid but a whole lot more than that.</p>
<p>Kitfox say it's "complicated" in how to describe it, because it's "sort of its own special sandbox you'll muck around in, and the city texture gives that playfulness a tone we haven't seen in other games".</p>
<p>A megasim sandbox where you just do whatever the heck you want, and deal with the emergent chaos that comes with it rather than following a story. So you can live as a thief, a blacksmith, a rebel, a priest, a smuggler, a lover, a cook, or just a street rat. Eventually even take on the ruler of the land, if you want.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-IlPTZ8-bjE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/465faadbcdc253cc973182359bdee2ed.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-IlPTZ8-bjE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Freeform gameplay in a dense, seamless, generated city.</li>
<li>No job or class system to constrain you, only heaps of skills to grow.</li>
<li>Made in consultation with the creators of Dwarf Fortress to optimize for emergent player stories.</li>
<li>Simulated people and communities for infinite hours of megasim gameplay.</li>
<li>Focus on narrow escapes and heists rather than toe-to-toe combat.</li>
<li>Original, richly textured world and lore, loosely inspired by Constantinople circa 500 AD.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kitfox mentioned they've been working on it in secret for years, and they've had Tarn Adams of Dwarf Fortress give over their time to help with as they said in their email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For now Tarn has been generous enough to share an hour of his time every 4-6 weeks, but they've been really valuable hours for us at Kitfox, going anywhere from NPC movement simulation to playtesting to save files, sometimes more fluffy design questions and sometimes more technical conundrums. For now this cadence is great for both parties, since it lets us learn from his experiences without significantly distracting him from Dwarf Fortress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds really unlike anything else.</p>

      <title>Kitsune Tails is a gay furry Mario-like steeped in Japanese mythology releasing August 1</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kitsune Tails from developer Kitsune Games and publisher MidBoss, the gay furry Mario-like, is now going to be released on August 1st.</p>
<p>Jump through mythological matters of the heart as Yuzu, a young half-fox/half-human messenger to the god Inari voiced by Kira Buckland, the voice of NieR: Automata’s 2B. Run and jump through multiple worlds full of legendary Japanese creatures standing between Yuzu and her destined locations. Help Yuzu move mountains to rescue her love interest Akko from a dire fate, and access an array of mystical moves along the way.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="eW3RF5QYzag"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/653ce06a7962cadedce0fdf40e04a09a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/eW3RF5QYzag" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It will also support modding too via the open source <a href="https://www.mapeditor.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tiled</a> level editor.</p>
<p>“Kitsune Tails is so much more than just a visual nod to the classic 8-bit platformers,” said Eniko Fox, Founder, Kitsune Games. “We built this from the ground up to offer the community an accessible, diverse game-design experience — in addition to telling our own tale with those very same tools. We can’t wait to see what you all create!”</p>
<p>They do have a demo available right now for Steam Next Fest, but the demo only has a Windows version, although it will likely work fine with Proton. For the full release it will have Native Linux support.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1325260/Kitsune_Tails/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

<p>Tempopo is the next title from Witch Beam, creators of the popular Unpacking and Assault Android Cactus due out sometime in 2024.</p>
<p>Looks like quite a relaxing one, as it seems Witch Beam are sticking to their more casual games following on from Unpacking which was very chilled and quite a departure from the chaos in twin-stick shooter Assault Android Cactus. Here you're dealing with a garden of musical flowers that have been scattered across the sky, and only the magical Tempopo with their unique abilities can rescue them. These creatures are mischievous and uncoordinated by nature, so they'll be relying on your conducting skills to work together to solve the puzzles.</p>
<p>The first trailer, which is a music video masquerading as a trailer, introduces us to "the flow, feel and vibe of Tempopo, where soundscapes act as a heartbeat to synchronise all living elements of the game together while you play". Check it out below:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guide Tempopo through 60 levels, manoeuvring, smashing, blocking, lifting and pushing your way through spatial puzzles across four seasons.</li>
<li>Experience a bright and joyful world that’s permeated with music, where every living element moves in harmony with the musical heartbeat.</li>
<li>Build your own melodic garden with the flowers you rescue throughout the game and enjoy a unique musical performance.</li>
<li>Find your comfort level with an accessible by design approach to input requirements, gameplay modes, and bonus challenge puzzles.</li>
<li>Soundtrack by BAFTA award-winning composer &amp; audio director Jeff van Dyck.</li>

      <title>Streets of Rogue 2 hits Early Access on August 14 - I&#39;m going to need a week off</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>That's it, I'm going to need a holiday for this one. Streets of Rogue 2 from Matt Dabrowski and tinyBuild is due to enter Early Access on August 14th.</p>
<p>Here you'll get to experience unprecedented freedom to topple a corrupt president by any means necessary. With a full open-world, you can even just go and chill in the countryside somewhere, or just cause total chaos in various cities. The choice here is yours.</p>
<p>With loads of unusual playable classes including a dirty mob boss, a hardworking farmer, a genius-level hacker, or even a blood-sucking vampire. How about sneaking around as a ninja? Or having the power to conjure up a horde of flesh-eating zombies? It seems to take everything great about the first and just make it a whole lot bigger. Complete with destructible environments and the ability to play in co-op with friends.</p>
<p>Check out the brand new trailer below and you might even spot a little word from a familiar website in it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="giKX3jFF47A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dbc071a339f5eb4df7e24facd934509f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/giKX3jFF47A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You heard me, it really is one of my absolute most wanted games for this year.</p>

      <title>Pinball Spire is a fresh Pinballvania blending multiple genres with classic ball flipping</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pinballvania? That's actually a new one to me, although Pinball Spire is not the first, it sure does look good.</p>
<p>There's quite a lot of great looking Pinball games out there, plenty that stick quite closely to being just a jazzed-up version of the game, but not too many actually expand on the basic idea and throw in other genres into the mix like Pinball Spire does.</p>
<p>"Conquer the titular spire as a brave, plucky little pinball called Pip, destined to step into the plunger and explore the inner chambers of a mysterious spire that appeared in their world overnight."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="a9ki0eKVk9Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1751726f867cd35de843eec6bfd8e20c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/a9ki0eKVk9Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Inside the Spire there's a big maze of Pinball games, full of various secrets to unlock and enemies to bump into along with various types of contraptions to interact with. You also have some special abilities, that play a role in getting you through this strange building.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pinballvania, a unique blend of genres, mixing classic video game platforming with arcade pinball games.</li>
<li>Elaborate pinball levels to explore, combining traditional pinball tables with atmospheric dungeons and passageways to explore.</li>
<li>Mana-powered pinball abilities enable unorthodox ways to interact with the environment.</li>
<li>Mystery that actually gets resolved conclusively instead of ending up on a cliffhanger!</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2601940/Pinball_Spire/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a> which worked great with Proton 9.</p>

      <title>You may want to avoid NVIDIA driver 550 if you&#39;re on a laptop</title>
      <author>nwildner</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you are a laptop user, you may want to avoid driver version 550 because there is a megathread on the NVIDIA forum where users are reporting that this version is making their distributions randomly crash.</p>
<p>Photos from my personal laptop last night after doing some reboots just for fun and testing (Arch Linux 6.9.1-zen + nvidia-dkms 550):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7030580881718014659gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7030580881718014659gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Crash right after decrypting the disk</em></p>
<p></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/488447431718014681gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/488447431718014681gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Crash right before trying to load sddm</em></p>
<p>It does not follow a pattern. Sometimes the laptop boots, sometimes it crashes. I would say that in 40% of the times that I've tried to boot it crashed during this week.</p>
<p>The way it happens, you can't say for sure where <code class="inline-code">nvidia</code> module is poking around because sometimes the crash is related to <code class="inline-code">vfs</code> sometimes with <code class="inline-code">rcu_schedule</code>. It happened to me right after decrypting my secondary NVMe, but it also happened right before trying to launch <code class="inline-code">sddm</code> so it is pretty random. Some folks reported it happened during upgrades when <code class="inline-code">udev</code> was triggered, but I didn't have that more catastrophic version of this problem (yet), having to deal with the system running and maybe breaking my initrd or package database.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The available options to mitigate this situation are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Revert back to version 545 or 535 with <code class="inline-code">dkms</code></li>
<li>Use the beta version 555. It looks like it is <a href="https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/series-550-freezes-laptop/284772/190" rel="noopener" target="_blank">stable enough</a> from the standpoint of this bug.</li>
<li>Use the <a href="https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/series-550-freezes-laptop/284772/181" rel="noopener" target="_blank">following</a> workaround involving disabling <code class="inline-code">udev</code> triggers and setting some kernel command line related to GSP firmware.</li>
</ol>

      <title>TUXEDO tease an ARM Snapdragon X Elite Linux notebook is coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>TUXEDO Computers have teased that they're working on an ARM notebook with a Snapdragon X Elite SoC from Qualcomm. It's not just Microsoft and Apple making an ARM push, Linux users will be able to get in on the fun officially soon too.</p>
<p>The hardware vendor explained in a <a href="https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en/TUXEDO-on-ARM-is-coming.tuxedo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">news post</a> that they recently presented a prototype of the ARM notebook they're working on at Computex, and they have the specifications of it now finalised. Work is ongoing though, like getting everything ported over and working on ARM fully.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The specs for their first ARM notebook as teased are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite, 12 cores, 20 W TDP (model X1E80100 in the prototype)</li>
<li>14" 16:10 IPS screen at 2560 x 1600</li>
<li>Aluminium body with USB4, HDMI</li>
<li>50Wh battery</li>
<li>32GB LPDDR5X</li>
<li>1x M.2 PCIe Gen 4 SSD slot</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15442724101718013956gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15442724101718013956gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>As Qualcomm themselves explained in a <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/developer/blog/2024/05/upstreaming-linux-kernel-support-for-the-snapdragon-x-elite" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a> they're working on getting full Linux support all sorted, as they said "It’s been our priority not only to support Linux on our premium-tier SoCs, but to support it pronto". And with the Snapdragon X Elite, they had a patchset ready for the Linux kernel the day after announcement back in October last year.</p>
<p>It should be truly ready hopefully in Linux kernel 6.11.</p>
<p>When it comes to the status of the project at TUXEDO, they said their first prototype is about to be replaced by a second, but they're still in the "alpha" stages. However, they said it's "quite conceivable that an ARM notebook from TUXEDO will be under your Christmas tree in 2024".</p>
<p>Exciting times for hardware!</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>All new interface - Our transformational UI redesign is complete! Fully mouseable, fully gamepaddable, and much prettier, but all carefully designed to maintain the essence of what makes Qud Qud. More polish is coming, but everything functional is in.</li>

      <title>Gears of War: E-Day announced and it&#39;s coming to Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Showing just how much Microsoft's attitude has changed with Xbox Game Studios, they've announced Gears of War: E-Day and it's coming to Steam. I have to admit, of the games Microsoft would announce during their event, I thought titles like this would remain a console exclusive. Happy to be surprised by the game and the Steam release!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Story of E-Day</strong><br/>
Fourteen years before Gears of War, war heroes Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago return home to face a new nightmare: the Locust Horde. These subterranean monsters, grotesque and relentless, erupt from below, laying siege on humanity itself.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>New Foundations</strong><br/>
Built from the ground up with Unreal Engine 5, Gears of War: E-Day delivers unprecedented graphical fidelity.</p>

<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="12m0bw1W_tk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5e1efcb5092ee04d915a422e25ef7e50.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/12m0bw1W_tk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I played through I believe only the first two in the series many years ago, and did very much enjoy them. Given how long it's been, a prequel actually makes sense to bring a whole new audience to it. From the detailed <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/09/gears-of-war-e-day-interview-details-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a>, you can expect a similar style to the gameplay of the originals with third-person action as you charge between cover.</p>
<p>“It’s going to feel like a new Gears game, because that’s what it is,” Creative Director Matt Searcy says. “It’s us revisiting the tone and the feeling of what makes Gears great, but we’re tapping into new techniques, new processes, and new technology that’s going to make the gameplay feel better than ever. It’s going to be awesome, a game that feels both truly new, and authentically Gears.” </p>
<p>Thanks <em>again</em> to Valve and their work with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>, we should be able to experience this on Linux. Given how quickly we've seen Valve get Proton updates out for major releases, I'm excited!</p>

      <title>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl has a new trailer - still releasing September 5</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl from Ukrainian developer GSC Game World has a brand new trailer and thankfully no more delays as it's still going to release on September 5th.</p>
<p>"Chornobyl Exclusion Zone has changed dramatically after the second massive explosion in year 2006. Violent mutants, deadly anomalies, warring factions have made the Zone a very tough place to survive. Nevertheless, artifacts of unbelievable value attracted many people called S.T.A.L.K.E.R.s, who entered the Zone for their own risk striving to make a fortune out of it or even to find the Truth concealed in the Heart of Chornobyl."</p>
<p>With a huge borderless open-world and a non-linear story, check out the brand new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="g6HH5kKLAlw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3ffd432d35b5540623f3acd89490b73c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/g6HH5kKLAlw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This is the part where I confess to you something terrible, that you're going to rinse me in the comments for…I've put all of maybe 20 minutes into the originals. I just…don't get them. Considering how big they were originally, and still are loved by many even now, I guess I'm really missing something here.</p>
<p>With the previous games all having a pretty good <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating, I'm hopeful this next one won't have too many issues. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> has come such a long way that it's easy to get excited about huge games like this just being playable in a click or two on Linux thanks to Valve.</p>
<p>You can pre-purchase on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Age of Mythology: Retold arrives on Steam on September 4</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Always great to see an RTS classic get revived. Age of Mythology: Retold from publisher Xbox Game Studios will be coming to Steam on September 4th.</p>
<p>From the creators of the award-winning Age of Empires franchise, Age of Mythology: Retold goes beyond history to a mythical age where gods, monsters, and humans collide. As a huge fan of classic RTS games, and someone who actually entirely missed the original (too busy with Age of Empires), I can't wait.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_OrFkvxC_N4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b47830275b314ad9f7cd8973bd71342c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_OrFkvxC_N4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><u>Call Upon the Gods</u></strong><br/>
Choose your gods from the Greek, Norse, Egyptian, and Atlantean pantheons. Devastate your enemies by summoning powerful lightning storms, earth-shattering quakes, and even the famed Nidhogg dragon. Or call upon nourishing rains and protective Dryads to help your people grow &amp; prosper.<br/>
<br/>
<strong><u>Unleash the Monsters</u></strong><br/>
Unleash Centaurs, Trolls, Mummies, and more. From bejeweled crocodiles who harness the power of the sun to the mighty one-eyed Cyclops, you will command diverse units inspired by the world’s great mythologies.<br/>
<br/>
<strong><u>An Epic Mythological Universe</u></strong><br/>
Embark on multiple campaigns spanning 50-missions that take you across a vast, mythical world: besiege the mighty walls of Troy, battle Giants in the frozen wastes of Midgard, and discover the mysteries of Osiris in the shifting sands of Egypt. Become a hero of myth—or even a god.<br/>
<br/>
<strong><u>Better with Friends</u></strong><br/>
Play with your friends, either head-to-head or against the advanced AI on dozens of randomly generated maps and scenarios for limitless re-playability. *</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's available for pre-purchase on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1934680/Age_of_Mythology_Retold/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> now. If you own Age of Mythology: Extended Edition on Steam, you also get a discount which is nice to see. They're also doing 7 days Advanced Access for the Premium Edition.</p>
<p>Really nice to see Microsoft doing so many more PC releases, especially on Steam too, making it super-simple to play games like this on Linux thanks to Valve's effort with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>

      <title>DOOM: The Dark Ages announced for Steam in 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I know this will excite many of you. DOOM: The Dark Ages has been announced today and it will arrive on Steam in 2025. Get ready for more ripping and tearing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vile forces push a kingdom to the brink. Fangs gnashing, their fury is emboldened by the flames of Hell’s own malevolence. No mortal blade cuts their masses down. No bulwark stays their advance. No army dares match them in the battlefield.</p>
<p>But you will. You are the super weapon primed to destroy evil.</p>
<p>For when Hell is at the gates, the DOOM Slayer answers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems like I really need to go and play through DOOM Eternal to the finish now. I know, I'm a bit of a late bloomer on the recent DOOM games after only finishing DOOM in the last year. Although, you don't actually have to play the others, since DOOM: The Dark Ages shows off the Slayer's origin and is actually a <em>prequel</em> to the other two modern DOOM games. Oh, and this time you've got some fun toys to play with like the Atlan, a "daunting skyscraper-sized mech capable of toppling Hell’s behemoths with titanic metal fists" and a Mecha Dragon to fly around on too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4tk8lkmYGWQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1a51593524bbd623b5ada6838e5d83e8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4tk8lkmYGWQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Since it will be on Steam, thanks to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> we shouldn't have much trouble playing it, and we know id Software use Vulkan so it's likely it will run really well.</p>
<p>Hell yeah, this looks awesome!</p>
<p>Read more in the full <a href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-EU/article/doom-the-dark-ages-revealed" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a>.

      <title>Sid Meier&#39;s Civilization VII arrives in 2025 with a teaser</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sid Meier's Civilization VII was officially revealed from Firaxis Games and 2K, due to arrive sometime in 2025. Although we don't exactly know much about it just yet.</p>
<p>The official teaser video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="pygcgE3a_uY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7c7adc504c7ec92083ff16b200977759.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/pygcgE3a_uY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Here's the thing that might excite you perhaps: multiple previous games in the series had Native Linux versions, although they were external ports by Aspyr Media. This time around, it appears Linux (and macOS) will be supported once again but it's not entirely clear who is doing the Linux / macOS versions as it wasn't stated.</p>
<p>The press release made it clear <em>multiple</em> times it will be available across "PlayStation®5 (PS5®), PlayStation®4 (PS4®), Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo™ Switch, and PC, Mac and Linux via Steam".</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>"For more than 30 years, players from around the world have shared their love and support for Civ," stated Sid Meier, Founder and Director of Creative Development at Firaxis Games. "I'm incredibly excited for Civ fans to see Civilization VII, a game that represents the culmination of three decades of strategy innovation and refinement."</p>
<p>“With more than 70 million copies sold-in and over 1 billion hours played, the Civilization franchise is a crown jewel for 2K," stated David Ismailer, President of 2K Games. “What the team is looking to accomplish with Civilization VII is nothing short of breathtaking, and we're confident that Firaxis Games has another hit on their hands with Civilization VII."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam page</a> that's now live does have both Linux and macOS sections in the system requirements too, but they're noted as "TBD" (to be decided).</p>

      <title>Looks like GPU switching tool optimus-manager isn&#39;t abandoned yet</title>
      <author>nwildner</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As we have previously <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/the-state-of-optimus-manager-explained-by-its-developer/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reported here</a>, optimus-manager, the GPU manager for laptop setups was going silent because the main developer didn't have the time or resources to keep that project running on <a href="https://github.com/Askannz/optimus-manager" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Github</a>. Looks like it's coming back!</p>
<p>After I got notified that a long-standing <a href="https://github.com/Askannz/optimus-manager/issues/471#issuecomment-1315628537" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bug</a> I'm participating in related to PCI ID generation missing the Domain ID on Xorg configuration generation was closed as fixed, I've noticed that a bunch of other stale Pull Requests got merged recently too.</p>
<p>Referring back to the main discussion <a href="https://github.com/Askannz/optimus-manager/issues/543" rel="noopener" target="_blank">thread</a>, "The state of optimus-manager", to my surprise someone nicknamed es20490446e is doing all the hard work to get the software active again and asking people to deliberately tag him on pull requests so he can better handle them because he is not (yet) the owner of the software.</p>
<p>It's nice to have such piece of software back into active state. I've switched back to <a href="https://github.com/bayasdev/envycontrol" rel="noopener" target="_blank">envycontrol</a> recently because of optimus-manager being abandoned and crashing a lot on newer kernels but, since this software is more feature rich and also supports some of my VFIO (GPU pass-through) stuff, I would definitively give it a try again when it gets in a better shape again.</p>

      <title>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita&#39;s Rewind announced for 2024</title>
      <author>Pengling</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The original Power Rangers return to fight a robo-reincarnation of the rotten Rita Repulsa in an all-new retro-style beat-'em-up!</p>
<p>Just announced by Digital Eclipse and Hasbro (under a new imprint called "Hasbro Retro Arcade", perhaps suggesting that we'll be seeing more licensed titles in this vein going forward), the game sees new foe Robo-Rita travel back in time to team up with the original Rita Repulsa, in order to bring back plenty of past monsters in an attempt to rewrite history and prevent the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers from ever existing.</p>
<p>As well as side-scrolling brawler action for up to five players (local or online), which is rendered in a 1990s throwback pixel-art style, there are also into-the-screen shooting and driving segments, along with first-person big boss fist fights played from the perspective of the cockpit of the mighty Megazord, all resembling Super Nintendo Entertainment System Mode 7 effects or Sega Super Scaler arcade titles.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="s7wSPJZPqas"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/25f002e4436229e7eb8a339280d65f73.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/s7wSPJZPqas" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The reveal-trailer hits all the right retro notes, and shows a little bit of what you can expect, with plenty of recognisable elements for fans of the classic TV-show to spot.</p>
<p>The Power Rangers' new outing has only been announced for Windows, but it should be an ideal fit for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> on Linux and the Steam Deck!</p>
<p>From the official description;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In <strong>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind</strong>, the team faces off against a robotic reincarnation of the Power Rangers' long-time nemesis. Robo-Rita has conjured a portal to send herself back in time so she can finally vanquish the Power Rangers by forming an alliance with her younger self. Working together, Robo-Rita and Rita Repulsa rewind, rewrite, and remix the past in an attempt to stop the very formation of the Power Rangers, altering the course of history.</em></p>
<p><em>Will the two Ritas and their army of monstrous enemies from across the MMPR timeline finally succeed in destroying the Power Rangers? Or will these teenagers with attitude learn to work together and counter this catastrophic chronological collaboration?</em></p>
<p><em>Players will be able to experience the origins of the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers again – for the first time! The past will never be the same…</em></p>
<p><em><u><strong>FEATURES</strong></u></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Classic 90's look and feel with hand-drawn pixel art</em></li>
<li><em>Fan-favorite enemies pulled from different seasons of the hit tv show</em></li>
<li><em>Events and episodes that players remember from the show have been remixed</em></li>
<li><em>Action-packed, 2-D brawler gameplay with arcade-style shooting and driving sequences</em></li>
<li><em>Pilot all of the original Dinozords</em></li>
<li><em>Jump into the cockpit of the legendary Megazord and take down gigantic bosses</em></li>
<li><em>Offline and Online support for up to 5 players</em></li>
<li><em>And lots more!</em></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind is scheduled for release sometime in 2024, and you can wishlist it right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2816870/Mighty_Morphin_Power_Rangers_Ritas_Rewind/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>So much for preservation, the classic Delta Force games are getting delisted</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A staffer on GOG <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general/delisting_all_delta_force_titles_available_in_our_store" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mentioned</a> that due to legal reasons, the classic Delta Force series is going to be removed from all storefronts.</p>
<p>Here's what the GOG team said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey all, I don’t know what’s wrong with this week, but I have to post another delisting news.<br/>
<br/>
Just now, we’ve received a request that we have to delist all Delta Force titles that are available in our store, due to legal reasons that are beyond our control. Affected titles are:<br/>
<br/>
Delta Force: <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/delta_force" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.gog.com/game/delta_force</a><br/>
Delta Force 2: <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/delta_force_2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.gog.com/game/delta_force_2</a><br/>
Delta Force: Land Warrior: <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/delta_force_land_warrior" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.gog.com/game/delta_force_land_warrior</a><br/>
Delta Force: Task Force Dagger: <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/delta_force_task_force_dagger" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.gog.com/game/delta_force_task_force_dagger</a><br/>
Delta Force Xtreme: <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/delta_force_xtreme" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.gog.com/game/delta_force_xtreme</a><br/>
Delta Force: Black Hawk Down Platinum Pack: <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/delta_force_black_hawk_down_platinum_pack" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.gog.com/game/delta_force_black_hawk_down_platinum_pack</a><br/>
<br/>
The removals will happen today - June 7th, 1 PM UTC.<br/>
<br/>
They will be removed from all storefronts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14262868241717762369gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Delta Force</em></p>
<p>So you have just under an hour from this post until they're gone if you did want to quickly grab them. Delisting means no one can buy them, but they will <em>not</em> vanish from your own library. The notice from GOG does clearly say "all storefronts" so they will presumably vanish from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?franchise=Delta%20Force" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> too.</p>
<p>A shame, this always makes preserving gaming history far more difficult, but that's not to say they won't return at some point in future. </p>
<p>There is a new game coming called Delta Force: Hawk Ops, which will be a free to play shooter. So it will likely have some form of anti-cheat, which means the likelihood of it working on Linux / Steam Deck is pretty slim.</p>

      <title>Fight the devs of Fishards, if you win - it goes open source! Lose and it&#39;s deleted from Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, that's certainly one way to pull in some eyes isn't it? Fight the developers, get it open source or Fishards will be gone from Steam.</p>
<p>More about it: Combine the intense, skill-shot PVP of Magicka or Battlerite with some wacky 2-legged-fish and you've got yourself Fishards! The unique spell combining mechanic creates a brand new type of PvP​ ​arena​ experience that you have to try with friends!</p>
<p>Posted on the Godot Engine <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/1d85n3z/comment/l73xrqd/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, the developers announced a tournament with a twist:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We released Fishards a few years ago and sadly it wasn't able to support us developers financially, so we stopped development.</p>
<p>However, instead of letting the game fade into obscurity we have now decided to make the game open source...</p>
<p><strong>IF!</strong></p>
<p>...the Fishards community can beat us in a tournament taking place in a few weeks! (June 29 19:00 CET*)</p>
<p>If we developers win however... <strong>We are deleting Fishards from Steam!!</strong> &gt;:)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>* That's 5PM UTC on June 29th.</em></p>

<p>Will you be taking part? Sounds like a fun little marketing stunt.</p>

      <title>Obsidian gave Pillars of Eternity a big patch - Linux and macOS updates being investigated</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Obsidian Entertainment have gone back and upgraded the original Pillars of Eternity with a big update, although it's currently only for the Windows version.</p>
<p>In the patch notes they said "This update is currently unavailable for OSX &amp; Linux. We are investigating bringing these platforms up to speed as part of a future patch.". So I'll be keeping an eye out for if / when that happens, shame to see updates delayed though. But for those who can't wait it should work fine in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>
<p>They use Unity, which does have both Linux and macOS game export support, so it's likely some kind of middleware is holding up updating those versions.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5872943251717756004gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5872943251717756004gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10977266841717756033gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10977266841717756033gol1.jpg"/></a></p>

      <title>Build up, command and fight with a big walking colony in Trailblazers: Into the March</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another one shooting to the top of my wishlist from the Guerilla Collective Showcase is Trailblazers: Into the March, I've not seen a colony-sim strategy game quite like it. Looks like a blending of some ideas from FTL: Faster Than Light, RimWorld and The Wandering Village into something rather unique overall and I need it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6529023971717754984gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6529023971717754984gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>"You are a Trailblazer... the captain of a ‘Landship’—a powerful vessel shaped by undying dedication and boundless dreams. It is your lifeline through 'The March,' a perilous frontier engulfing civilization's remnants. Your mission: blaze a trail in this wilderness and uncover the mystery at its heart.</p>
<p>Trailblazers: Into the March is a roguelite colony-sim that integrates tactical combat with the emotional journey of procedural characters. Before setting off, you will purchase and customize your Landship, recruit crew members with their own backgrounds and skills, trade supplies and materials, and take on contracts. Once you venture into the March, you must manage your crew's daily lives, witness their evolving relationships and stories, and defend your moving home in tactical landship battles as you explore the vast uncharted territories."</p>
<p>Developer Strangers and publisher Joystick Ventures showed off the reveal trailer, and it starts off quite intriguing and then when it gets into the gameplay — just wow.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="PXGuzybAmMI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5e2cf94f669329eb9eb50adfff67e7ad.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/PXGuzybAmMI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>One that should have no problems with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> on Linux.

      <title>Gangster FPS &#39;Fallen Aces&#39; will have you punch a shark in the face</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Punching a shark in the face. Do you expect any less from a game published by New Blood Interactive? Fallen Aces is a FPS crime noir that plays right out of the '90s and looks right out of a comic.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7176829341717753230gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7176829341717753230gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A gritty crime noir saga:</strong> spanning three episodes and <strong>dozens</strong> of levels, and featuring fully voiced <strong>hand drawn</strong> comic cutscenes - Fallen Aces tells a <em>real</em> story.</li>
<li><strong>The world is your weapon:</strong> use fists, knives, pipes, bats, trash cans, frying pans, pistols, shotguns, nail guns, spear guns, Tommy guns and more to take back Switchblade City.</li>
<li><strong>Non linear level design:</strong> Choose your path, use <strong>stealth</strong>, go <strong>loud</strong> or <em>try a mixture of both!</em></li>
<li><strong>Hand drawn:</strong> 100% original hand drawn art and animation (No AI) brings the game to life.</li>
<li><strong>Fuggedaboutit!:</strong> Hundreds of lines of <strong>authentic</strong> period era gangster dialogue injects personality into the wide array of people and places in <em>Fallen Aces.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Shown off with a new trailer during Guerilla Collective 2024 Showcase have look:</p>

<p>Announced for Windows, it should work just fine on Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> though. It has controller support too, so hopefully it will also work well on Steam Deck. One I very much plan to play, shooting right to the top of my wishlist.</p>

<p>Here you have the usual suspects of features like taking over a farmstead in a quaint little town, plus crafting, fishing and life-sim elements where you make friends and build relationships. But then you also have — the Blobs. Cute and wobbly creatures you hatch from eggs, which you can train up and battle others with.</p>

      <title>GOG will purge your Cloud Saves that hit over 200MB</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GOG have <a href="https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/18730340487709-Review-your-Cloud-Saves-to-avoid-loss-of-files?product=gog" rel="noopener" target="_blank">revealed</a> in a new support notice that they're going to impose a hard-limit on your Galaxy Cloud Saves at 200MB, and purge saves from any games that go above it.</p>
<p>This is a <em>per-game</em> limit, so each game on GOG will have 200MB total for Cloud Saves. GOG said any game saves that go over the limit will "be deleted after August 31st, 2024", and so GOG players will need to go and manually check all their save files to ensure no loss of data in the cloud. Of course, those stored locally are fine, it's just a limit on what GOG will store up online for you.</p>
<p>As for why? GOG said: "As the size and number of games increase, so does the demand for Cloud Storage. These limits ensure that all players have access to sufficient and manageable space for their game progress, and that we keep the associated costs under control. By optimizing our storage allocation, we aim to continue providing a reliable and user-friendly platform for everyone."</p>
<p>To be clear though, they won't just nuke the entire thing for each game that hits over 200MB. They said they will "will remove save game files, starting from the oldest and stop when the remaining files fit the allocation limit". So as soon as it gets down to 200MB, they will stop (for each game).</p>
<p>You can check your cloud saves on your <a href="https://www.gog.com/account/cloud-saves/page/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG Account</a>.</p>
<p>In comparison to Steam, they have no specific hard limit for each game. Some games might have only a few MB, some can go up to multiple GBs. For example in my case Baldur's Gate 3 on Steam is using over 1GB, with nearly 1GB still left for it. While Vampire Survivors is only giving about 4MB, so it's quite dynamic.</p>

      <title>Check out the new trailer and demo for Megacopter: Blades of the Goddess</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Megacopter: Blades of the Goddess is an upcoming shoot 'em up inspired by the Strike series of games like Desert Strike, Jungle Strike and Urban Strike and it looks fantastic (and weird).</p>
<p>As a big fan of the classics, putting many hours into the Strike games in the 90s this looks like it was made for me. You don't have to wait long on it either! It's releasing June 21st, which I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/megacopter-blades-of-the-goddess-releases-in-june-inspired-by-classic-desert-strike/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">covered previously</a>, and with the release approaching there's not only a demo available on Steam for you to try but there's also a brand shiny new trailer to show it off:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SAWIY_xzhUE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6e8050d113f26ec3e611a8c2129f015f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SAWIY_xzhUE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Missions: Play a variety of mission types. Seek and destroy missions feature an escalating threat level as you penetrate enemy lines. Rescue missions allow you to save your comrades (choplifter style). Defense missions feature waves of enemies. Boss hunt missions feature a powerful enemy.</li>
<li>Environments: Take the fight to the Reptoids across 4 different biomes and dozens of missions as you look to defeat the Reptoid scum and bring sanity back to the Tri-state area!</li>
<li>Command the Weapons of Mortals: The Megacopter is a machine with huge guns, and an even bigger appetite for blood. Exchange Pizza Tokens at the armory, and unlock more guns, more firepower, and more…well….destruction.</li>
<li>Unlock the Power of AZ-TECH: The Blades of the Goddess demand blood, and blood you will deliver. Through (somewhat willing) Greg sacrifices, you can unlock the powers of the Goddess that lives within Megacopter. Choose the perfect AZ-TECH pairing for your mission loadouts and you’ll be cutting through Reptoids like a knife through butter.</li>
<li>Soundtrack: Original soundtrack by OGRE sound. These amazing retro tracks will get you in the mood to seek and destroy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Give it a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1228360/Megacopter_Blades_of_the_Goddess/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">try on Steam now</a>. It has Native Linux support!</p>

      <title>Enshrouded gets a major update and Steam Deck optimizations</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Enshrouded, the big open world survival and crafting game from Keen Games, just had the big Enshrouded: Melodies of the Mire update released. Should be good news for Steam Deck players.</p>
<p>Some of what's new includes a new area called The Blackmire that has new quests, gameplay challenges, new enemies and much more. There's also a big improvement to player progression, with individual multiplayer quests, so you can do them with or without friends while playing online. The game is also about to get a lot more musical too with the introduction of musical instruments, there's a new vanity system to customise your style, permission settings for servers, combat improvements and much more.</p>
<p>The update trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CvQNjoc0FkM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/295a6257361ccd92ee778d55de13a7d0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CvQNjoc0FkM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Main update highlights video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vhLz6WvusZI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e34cd14f0ad65fed99f1673b6d19e300.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vhLz6WvusZI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While it <em>did</em> already work on Steam Deck, the performance in a word - <em>sucked</em>. It was really bad in lots of areas, especially as you explored more and built more, it just wasn't good. Buried right at the bottom of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1203620/view/4176604868930473019" rel="noopener" target="_blank">patch notes</a> they mentioned "Enshrouded has been further optimized for the Steam Deck." which is great to see. Hopefully we will see more of that to come, but it is in Early Access so it's not finished.</p>
<p>Even if you play on desktop, optimisations for devices like Steam Deck should help improve performance overall.</p>
<p>However, there <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1203620/discussions/2/4336483289192489034/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">seems to be an issue</a> on desktop Linux with Mouse+Keyboard input that the developers are now investigating. A workaround posted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Enshrouded/comments/1d8wd60/comment/l79j7g0/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reddit</a> might work for you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes. Navigate to the game's directory, open your terminal emulator there and run <code class="inline-code">perl -pi -e 's/wine_get_version/frog_get_version/g' ./enshrouded.exe</code> (make sure you have Perl installed).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong>: the above should be solved in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1203620/view/4182235001955652948?l=english" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hotfix</a>.</em></p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203620/Enshrouded/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Honeykrisp is a new conformant Linux Vulkan driver for Apple M1</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Apple M1 support on Linux is about to take another leap forwards, with the introduction of the open source Honeykrisp Vulkan driver.</p>
<p>Announced <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/vk13-on-the-m1-in-1-month.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">in a blog post</a> from developer Alyssa Rosenzweig, this new driver was actually based on the open source NVK (NVIDIA Vulkan) driver from Faith Ekstrand. Showing once again the power of open source, to get a new driver going by re-using code.</p>
<p>From the blog post in Ekstrand's own words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All Vulkan drivers in Mesa trace their lineage to the Intel Vulkan driver and started by copying+pasting from it. My hope is that NVK will eventually become the driver that everyone copies and pastes from. To that end, I’m building NVK with all the best practices we’ve developed for Vulkan drivers over the last 7.5 years and trying to keep the code-base clean and well-organized.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that's exactly what Rosenzweig did, and it only took about a month to get it to the stage where it has reached Vulkan 1.3 conformance as <a href="https://www.khronos.org/conformance/adopters/conformant-products/vulkan#submission_780" rel="noopener" target="_blank">listed</a> on The Khronos Group website. It's not available for us normies yet, but <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/alyssa/mesa/-/tree/honeykrisp-20240506-2/src/asahi/vulkan?ref_type=heads" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the code</a> is up for developers to look at.</p>
<p>The next stage for the Honeykrisp driver is to hook up everything needed for DXVK and VKD3D-Proton, so then games will work via Wine / Proton on Apple M1 via Honeykrisp on <a href="https://asahilinux.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Asahi Linux</a>.</p>
<p>Awesome to see this!</p>

      <title>NVIDIA release 550.90.07 stable and 555.52.04 Beta drivers for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA has release two fresh driver updates for Linux this week. There's a new stable driver, and an update to the Beta series.</p>
<p>The first from yesterday is the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/drivers/details/226938/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">550.90.07 stable driver</a> with these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Temporarily disabled the GLX_EXT_buffer_age extension on Xwayland to work around a bug that could cause corruption.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause corruption when the GLX_EXT_buffer_age extension is used on X.org with PRIME render offloading.</li>
<li>Improved the ability of nvidia-modprobe to detect whether kernel modules are already loaded. This corrects an issue that prevented nvidia-persistenced from setting persistence mode on some systems.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause additional X screens to claim displays that should have been assigned to a prior X screen based on the given X configuration.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause the X server to crash when graphics applications requested single-buffered drawables while certain features (such as Vulkan sharpening) are enabled.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could lead to a kernel panic, due to a failure to release a spinlock under some conditions.</li>
<li>Fixed a race condition which could lead to crashes when Xid errors occur concurrently on multiple GPUs.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>With that being a stable driver, everyone should be fine to use it.</p>
<p>And then there's the new <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/drivers/details/227247/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">555.52.04 beta driver</a> for today, which follows on from the exciting <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/nvidia-555-42-02-beta-driver-out-bringing-wayland-explicit-sync/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">555.42.02 Beta driver</a> that gave us Wayland explicit sync from May. Here's the latest changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a segmentation fault when running multi-threaded NvFBC applications.</li>
<li>Temporarily disabled the GLX_EXT_buffer_age extension on Xwayland to work around a bug that could cause corruption.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause corruption when the GLX_EXT_buffer_age extension is used on X.org with PRIME render offloading.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause the X server to crash when graphics applications requested single-buffered drawables while certain features (such as Vulkan sharpening) are enabled.</li>

      <title>Steampunk auto-shooter Airships: Lost Flotilla demo expanded - get an exclusive airship</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Airships: Lost Flotilla is steadily building up to be one of my favourites in the auto-shooter bullet-heaven survivor genre. Now there's an expanded demo and I've got a special code for you.</p>
<p>To rewind a moment, what is it? Airships: Lost Flotilla is a steampunk autoshooter where you fight your way through waves of enemies on your way to a safe harbour. Destroy your foes, harvest wreckage and upgrade your ship. There's a crazy variety to the enemies, and some huge boss battles too.</p>
<p>So it's basically Vampire Survivors / Brotato with Airships from developer David Stark who also that the rather excellent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/342560/Airships_Conquer_the_Skies/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Airships: Conquer the Skies</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6545818201717596815gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6545818201717596815gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You start off with a basic ship layout, and as you take down enemies and collect the little gems they drop you'll get money to upgrade. This can be adding weapons, general buffs, getting companion ships to help out and loads more. You can load up some pretty amusing combinations and it can get quite challenging.</p>
<p>A brand new expanded demo has arrived bringing with it a brand new map feature with branching paths, making it a whole lot more interesting to play through. This overworld map allows you to pick where you go next with each location having different enemies, different rewards and upgrades and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9170904871717596693gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9170904871717596693gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Even better, there's a secret ship you can unlock and I've got the code for you. In the top right of the menu, you'll find a Magic Symbols button. Enter this into it to unlock the Corvette:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2731863451717595896gol1.png"/></p>
<p>The Corvette is hilariously fast and challenging to control and play with. Good fun.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2858150/Airships_Lost_Flotilla/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new demo on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>From broken parts to broken hearts - mend robots in AI Confidential</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Critical Wit recently revealed AI Confidential, a game where you take on the role of a RoboTechnician employed by AI megacorp where you'll be fixing up all sorts of strange robots as you fix up broken parts to broken hearts.</p>
<p>Given the rise of AI, and robots slowly taking actual jobs, this seems like quite a fitting game for the time. They're made to solve our problems, but it's our job to fix them. A never-ending cycle huh? At least technicians will never be out of a job.</p>
<p>They've released a first trailer which you can see below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LUEqaVVl_9s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a0b3de987285db4d81f63ed295aff07f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LUEqaVVl_9s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A unique, playful and intuitive emoji-driven dialog system.</li>
<li>An unforgettable cast of purpose-built patients to meet and help.</li>
<li>An array of environments in a solarpunk future to explore.</li>
<li>Classic adventure game inventory puzzles… minus the moon logic.</li>
<li>From hardware repair, to virus removal, assist your patients with invasive aplomb.</li>
<li>Decommission ‘lost causes,’ and return their cores to R&amp;D.</li>
</ul>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Robotic Rehabilitation in Four ‘Simple’ Steps</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> <em>The Owner, the Bot, &amp; the Boss</em> (<u>Case Briefing</u>)<br/>
Meet your purpose-built patient to get their perspective. Get marching orders from HQ, and a hot take from the broken bot’s owner.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Step 2:</strong> <em>Solarpunk Sleuthing</em> (<u>Explore &amp; Investigate</u>)<br/>
Uncover possible causes of malfunctions and misbehavior. Chat with other AI in the area for clues and leads.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Step 3:</strong> <em>Subjective Solutions</em> (<u>Diagnosis &amp; Treatment</u>)<br/>
Determine a diagnosis, and evaluate a possible treatment... or three. Execute the “best” option, or consider doing something… unsanctioned.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Step 4:</strong> <em>Rocks and Hard Places</em> (<u>Metanarrative Mindfulness</u>)<br/>
What’s best for the patient isn’t always what the customer or your company wants. Your decisions dictate the fates of your patients, relationships... and career.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the developers working on it mentioned on <a href="https://g33ks.coffee/@tiesselune/112563387889020114" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mastodon</a> how it will have Native Linux support, and is even a first-class citizen when it comes to platform support. Looks to be worth a follow.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2982490/AI_Confidential/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it along on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Deep Rock Galactic has a huge new season coming, and you can replay old seasons</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Deep Rock Galactic is by far, one of the best co-op games ever made. Ghost Ship Games are truly showing others how it's done with this upcoming season too. It's rated Steam Deck Playable (and it does work great) and it's pretty much flawless on desktop Linux with Proton. I've played it a lot, and so have plenty of people I know, it's an absolute gem not to be missed out on.</p>
<p>The new update coming with Season 05: Drilling Deeper just got a full preview, and it looks awesome. It includes a new higher difficulty mode, a new Performance Pass to unlock items, new types of missions, a new special event, new enemies like one that cloaks and stalks you, new weapon overclocks, new secondary objectives and more.</p>
<p>Full of new content to play through, take a look:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aNCFfpIzZU8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/138af99ddfb99b4ffd46db2de6124d3d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aNCFfpIzZU8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Truly showing how they're player-first, they're also adding something else that's exciting with the ability to play through previous seasons. So you'll be able to pick any season you want and activate it to play through it. Other players don't need to be in the same season to join you, and you'll each progress through your own season and gain access to the Performance Pass for that season to play through and unlock various items.</p>
<p>They've also replaced the "Disable Season Content" option with a season simply called Vanilla, which gives you no specific Performance Pass, and a "balanced chance to spawn Events and Warnings from all seasons.". Fantastic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You'll be able to play through the new season on June 13th.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tiny Glade from Pounce Light arrives later this year and there's now a demo available. It's worth checking out, if you like games to fully relax with that have no actual goals.</p>
<p>It's really really clever in how it's designed. It's just you and the land, with a whole bunch of tools to scribble all over the screen with various items and watch it all come to life, and eventually build up some big castle. Everything seamlessly connects like fancy Lego and it really is gorgeous.</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Gridless building chemistry, powered by real-time procedural generation. Draw a path through a building? A door pops up! Widen the path? The door becomes an archway. Raise the building? Columns and beams line up to support it.</li>
<li>The game adorns your builds with detail, making every creation beautiful. It carefully assembles every brick, pebble and plank on-the-fly, adapting to your whim.</li>
<li>Five different glades to build in, each with a unique mood.</li>
<li>A world that feels alive: ivy envelops your buildings, sheep waddle through your paths, sun sets with a dramatic burst of colour and fireflies light up the night.</li>
<li>Every action has an animated undo and redo. There are no wrong answers, and you can always change your mind.</li>
<li>Satisfying sounds and enchanting music. Just what you need to fully relax.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>About the developer: Pounce Light is a tiny Swedish indie studio consisting of two developers, Anastasia Opara and Tomasz Stachowiak. Between the two of them, the founders count over 15 years of industry experience (Embark Studios, Electronic Arts, Creative Assembly).

      <title>GE-Proton 9-6 (and 9-7) brings various upstream changes from Valve&#39;s Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A new release of the community-made compatibility layer GE-Proton version 9-6 is here, although nothing too exciting this time as it's pulling in upstream Proton changes from Valve.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's what's changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Persona 4 Golden video fixes have been re-added.</li>
<li>wine updated to latest bleeding edge.</li>
<li>dxvk updated to latest git.</li>
<li>vkd3d-proton updated to latest git.</li>
<li>upstream proton changes added.</li>
<li>upstream steamclient changes added.</li>
<li>upstream wineopenxr changes added.</li>
</ul>

<em>Pictured: Persona 4 Golden</em></p>
<p>As a reminder: GE-Proton is a community-built version of Proton, not supported by Valve, that often has fixes Valve can't distribute (sometimes for legal reasons, other times for more QA testing time). You should generally stick with Valve's normal Proton unless you need GE-Proton for specific fixes.</p>

      <title>Vampire Therapist is a unique dark comedy narrative adventure with a great voice cast</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Being a Vampire Therapist is not something that's high up on my wishlist of jobs, but it certainly sounds interesting and you can try out the fresh demo now. Created in conjunction with licensed therapists, you'll take on the role of Sam in this intriguing therapy 'em up.</p>
<p>"Vampire Therapist is a narrative adventure in the vein (get it) of What We Do in the Shadows, the horror works of Mel Brooks, Monty Python, and Horrible Histories where you play as a reformed bloodsucker helping other vampires find inner peace.</p>
<p>Take on the role of Sam, a former rootin’, tootin’ Wild West gunslinger who escaped his day-to-day of murder and mayhem and realized, after a hundred years or so, that there’s a whole lot more to unlife than blood, lace, and leather. Dragging himself from the quagmire of the Old West, Sam teams up with a 3000-year-old vampire living in Europe that’s willing to show him the therapy ropes."</p>

      <title>ZOTAC Zone is yet another AMD gaming handheld</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Every hardware vendor seems to want a go at making a handheld, and now its ZOTAC jumping in with the Zone.</p>
<p>Teased during Computex it will come with an AMD Ryzen 7 8840U (Zen 4) and AMD Radeon 870M graphics (RDNA 3). It will also come with 2-stage adjustable triggers, hall effect joysticks and triggers, a 1920x1080 7" AMOLED multi-touch 120Hz display, a front-facing camera and even dual trackpads.</p>
<p>Zotac <a href="https://x.com/ZOTAC/status/1797951762500141381" rel="noopener" target="_blank">shared</a> some images on X (formerly Twitter):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2027732771717503466gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2027732771717503466gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17331566231717503468gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17331566231717503468gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>It looks pretty big. And of course, it will come with Windows. So if you want to run it on Linux, you'll need to wait for drivers to be worked on and for the likes of ChimeraOS and Bazzite to get support ready for it.</p>
<p>“Ever since the establishment of the ZOTAC GAMING brand, we have strived to provide an unmatched gaming experience for enthusiasts worldwide,” Said Tony Wong, Chief Executive Officer of ZOTAC. “We have made considerable efforts to raise the bar with our debut handheld, tailor-made with competitive features for all gamers.”</p>
<p>Valve well and truly lit a fire under everyone didn't they with the Steam Deck and Steam Deck OLED? Handheld PCs for gaming are now really becoming a bigger mainstream thing. We also had the silly-named <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/only-three-months-after-the-claw-msi-reveal-the-new-msi-claw-8-ai-gaming-handheld/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MSI Claw 8 AI+</a> revealed recently too.</p>
<p>The ZOTAC Zone will launch in September priced <a href="https://www.geeknetic.es/Noticia/31877/ZOTAC-nos-ensena-su-GAME-ZONE-en-el-COMPUTEX-lanzamiento-previsto-para-septiembre-por-800-euros.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reportedly</a> around $800. So they're not even remotely trying to compete with the Steam Deck at that price. The price alone may be the biggest issue with it.</p>

      <title>Persist Online is a new MMORPG from the developer of the classic Tibia</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After almost 30 years, CipSoft, the veteran multiplayer game developer behind 1997’s Tibia, is back with another MMORPG: Persist Online. It's confirmed that it will support Linux, macOS and Windows - so everyone on PC can get involved in the fun.</p>
<p>There's no current release date yet as they're still building it but they plan various playtests, before an Early Access release and it will be free to play.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="sxzgFyMbVg0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c10d2c8947d1127ba7675e6447eeb2d9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/sxzgFyMbVg0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“The true charm of an MMORPG lies in the diverse interaction possibilities among players and the unpredictable stories that emerge from them. Decades of operating Tibia have continually shown us this," said Benjamin Zuckerer, Lead Product Manager. “It’s why we believe a good multiplayer game can only be created together with the community, and even before the Early Access period, we will regularly organize game tests.”</p>
<p>“Persist Online began as a hobby project and is the brainchild of two long-standing CipSoft employees. We just started developing the game we wanted to play ourselves. The core team now consists of 14 people and has access to all departments and the entire expertise of the company."</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Masses of Players and Zombies:</strong> Join forces with other survivors to keep the zombies at bay and take on mutated bosses in a sprawling open world. In this persistent online world, without instances, hundreds of players can enjoy (and survive) this harsh environment together.</li>
<li><strong>Friends, Foes, and Temporary Allies:</strong> Exercise caution against other players looking for some PvP action, or team up and form guilds to defend strategically important locations, amassing resources quicker. Friendly fire is also engaged, so look out for that, too!</li>
<li><strong>Boomsticks, Frying Pans, and Fishing Nets:</strong> Fend off foes (zombies or other players) with a variety of looted or crafted weapons, which can each be upgraded. Melee the undead with a sturdy frying pan, blast them to smithereens with a powerful shotgun, or put points into the fishing skill on the skill tree and give the fishing net the ability to paralyze enemies.</li>
<li><strong>An Unforgiving Open World:</strong> This world isn’t just big; it’s also big on details. Every building is accessible, and a dynamic day and night cycle can have a genuine impact on gameplay.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Roll the dice to attack enemies in Dice &amp; Fold, try the demo now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dice &amp; Fold is another upcoming game from Tinymice Entertainment and Rogue Duck Interactive, who are also involved in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/vertical-building-colony-sim-stellar-settlers-space-base-builder-hits-early-access/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Stellar Settlers: Space Base Builder</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/neoduel-backpack-monsters-blends-an-inventory-pvp-auto-battler-with-a-monster-fusing-twist/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NEODUEL: Backpack Monsters</a>.</p>
<p>The developers got in touch to mention Dice &amp; Fold, a turn-based dungeon crawler where your only way of attacking the enemy is by rolling dice. Roll dice to damage enemy cards to FOLD. Inspired by classic Solitaire, in a top-down table and enemies made out of cards, try to beat the dungeon with 20 unique classes. Build your deck, kill monsters.</p>
<p>Taking inspiration from Solitaire, Slay the Spire, Vampire Survivors and various classic table-top RPGs. I like the idea of this one, giving off a little <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/dicey-dungeons-reunion-is-a-huge-free-update-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dicey Dungeons</a> vibes too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="i7G41z_t8FU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dd0902b8f5de986fa78019aec491c436.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/i7G41z_t8FU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Definitely worth a look!</p>
<p>The developer also told me via email "All current games and future games we make will also target Linux and be tested on it." which is great to see.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2693930/Dice__Fold/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">demo for Dice &amp; Fold on Steam</a>. It's due out later this year.</p>

      <title>Only three months after the Claw, MSI reveal the new MSI Claw 8 AI+ gaming handheld</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One problem with a few handheld vendors is that they constantly spawn new models, and it seems like MSI are now doing the same with the MSI Claw 8 AI+ gaming handheld.</p>
<p>While most handheld vendors (like Valve with the Steam Deck) go for AMD, MSI with the Claw went for Intel. It didn't go particularly well, with a lot of reviews absolutely slating it. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24105991/msi-claw-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Verge</a> pulled no punches and said bluntly "The MSI Claw is an embarrassment".</p>
<p>So what are they doing? Well of course, just three months later they're announcing a whole new model with the MSI Claw 8 AI+ that's powered by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/intel-revealed-more-lunar-lake-processor-details-with-their-new-xe2-graphics/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Intel's Lunar Lake</a>. Yes, that's <em>really</em> its name. It has AI in the title, because clearly that's how you sell things now, everything <em>needs</em> to somehow mention AI.</p>
<p>From their very short <a href="https://www.msi.com/news/detail/MSI-Sparks-AI-Frenzy-at-COMPUTEX-2024-Grand-Opening-143713" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release</a> on it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MSI proudly introduces the Claw 8 AI+, the world's first gaming handheld powered by Intel® Core™ Ultra processors (codenamed “Lunar Lake”). This revolutionary device boasts an 8-inch FHD display, a Thunderbolt 4-supported USB-C port, enhanced LB/RB button feedback, increased battery capacity, and a lighter charger, making it the most powerful 8-inch gaming handheld on the market.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally from their <a href="https://www.msi.com/news/detail/MSI-Unveils-Next-Gen-AI--Gaming-and-Business---Productivity-Laptops-with-Latest-Processors-at-COMPUTEX-2024-143709" rel="noopener" target="_blank">other</a> press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to the next-gen processor's improved energy efficiency, MSI has actively listened to user feedback and upgraded several hardware specifications accordingly, such as adding an additional Thunderbolt 4-supported USB-C port, enhancing the tactile feel of the LB/RB buttons, increasing battery capacity, and replacing the charger with a lighter wall-mounted charger. Claw 8 AI+ is expected to be the most advanced 8-inch gaming handheld in the market. After the official release, a one-month free trial of Xbox Game Pass will be provided, allowing users to enjoy the most popular AAA games of the moment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They didn't include a price, expected release date or even any pictures of it in the short press note. So not exactly showing too much confidence in it. <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/msi-claw-8-ai-plus-first-look/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Digital Trends</a> did snap a few pics of it though:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18179259941717497863gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18179259941717497863gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Like most handhelds though, it will still ship with Windows 11. So you'll have to wait until the likes of ChimeraOS and Bazzite get the driver situation sorted if you wanted to test out Linux on it.</p>

      <title>Intel revealed more Lunar Lake processor details with their new Xe2 graphics</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Intel has provided more details on the upcoming Lunar Lake processors, which will come with an impressive sounding bump in graphical power. <em>Set to release sometime in Q3 2024.</em></p>
<p>From what details Intel provided they're claiming "60%" better battery life for these mobile processors in "real-life usages". Impressive if true, but just as exciting is the huge advancement of the graphics side with Xe2 which they claim will bring improved "gaming and graphics performance by 1.5x over the previous generation".</p>
<p>Intel also say you're likely to see "up to 40% lower system-on-chip power compared to the previous generation" as well, which is also mighty impressive there.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's an overview:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Compute Tile</strong> – A new compute tile contains the latest-generation Efficient-cores (E-cores) and Performance-cores (P-cores), both of which introduce new microarchitecture enhancements and together bring unprecedented x86 efficiency. Also housed on the compute tile are the new Xe2 graphics processing unit (GPU), neural processing unit (NPU 4) and image processing unit (IPU).
<ul>
<li><strong>Xe2 GPU</strong> – Brings more than 80% more gaming performance and more than five times the AI throughput over the previous generation, delivering more than 60 tera-operations per second (TOPS) New microarchitecture for the display and media engines delivers a best-in-class visual experience.</li>
<li><strong>NPU 4 </strong>– Delivers three times more TOPS over the most recent generation, up to 48 TOPs, to accelerate AI computations with impressively low power.</li>
<li><strong>IPU</strong> – Provides a great camera experience with reduced power.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Platform Controller Tile (PCT) </strong>– The PCT is where security and connectivity are integrated. Security components deliver a robust integrated security solution with built-in security engines designed to establish a solid foundation for system protection. The upgraded connectivity suite integrates Wi-Fi 7.0, Bluetooth 5.4, PCIe Gen5 and PCIe Gen4 ports, and ThunderboltTM 4 ports.</li>
<li><strong>Memory on Package</strong> – Enables fast access to data and reduces latency, decreasing the overall power consumption of the system.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The "Memory on Package" is quite a big one there. Basically, they've ditched separate RAM as it will be baked into the package itself directly. So you won't be able to upgrade the RAM, you get what it comes with. Hopefully future designs will make use of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/lpcamm2-upgradeable-ram-for-laptops-sounds-awesome/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the exciting LPCAMM2</a>.</p>

      <title>Kaspersky release a free Virus Removal Tool for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, this is interesting. Kaspersky have <a href="https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/blog/kvrt-for-linux/27662/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">released</a> KVRT (Kaspersky Virus Removal Tool), which is free to use to scan your systems for issues.</p>
<p>This is <em>not</em> an active virus scanner, it <em>doesn't</em> constantly run on your system. Only when you load it and tell it to scan. It also <em>doesn't</em> auto-update, you need to go and download it fresh from their website each time. Still, it's interesting to see such a big name jump into something like this for Linux don't you think? They say it can "detect both malware and adware, as well as legitimate programs that can be used for attacks".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18454173471717414718gol1.png"/><br/>
<em>It may look like a Windows application but that really is on Linux.</em></p>
<p>As they said in their blog post announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Modern-day cybercriminals aren’t ignoring Linux-based operating systems. Recently, we published a <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/cve-2024-3094-vulnerability-backdoor/50873/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">series</a> of <a href="https://securelist.com/xz-backdoor-story-part-1/112354/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posts</a> about <a href="https://securelist.com/xz-backdoor-story-part-2-social-engineering/112476/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">malicious code</a> in the open source set of utilities XZ Utils, which managed to find its way into several popular Linux builds; wrote about a <a href="https://securelist.com/dinodasrat-linux-implant/112284/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Linux implant</a> for the DinodasRAT malware — also known as XDealer; and warned about a backdoor in the <a href="https://securelist.com/backdoored-free-download-manager-linux-malware/110465/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Trojanized version of Free Download Manager</a>. Despite all this, the myth that Linux is mostly immune to cyberthreats persists: companies rarely devote funds to protecting machines running this operating system. Therefore, we’ve released a dedicated free product that allows you to check Linux computers for modern threats — Kaspersky Virus Removal Tool (KVRT) for Linux.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are your thoughts on this, and what do you use on your Linux desktop to keep it secure? Maybe it's time to give over some suggestions in the comments on that. </p>

      <title>The SaveTF2 campaign to get Valve to beat the Team Fortress 2 bots has begun</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/team-fortress-2-fans-have-launched-a-new-campaign-to-get-valve-to-save-it/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcing the SaveTF2 campaign recently</a>, today the actual campaign to get Valve to fix up Team Fortress 2 has properly begun.</p>
<p>The petition on their <a href="https://save.tf/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">campaign website</a> has now reached over 100,000 signatures, which the organisers say they will forward onto Valve directly to try and get their attention. On top of that, they're asking people today to use the "#SaveTF2" hashtag across social media to highlight the problems. It's already massing a whole lot of <a href="https://x.com/hashtag/SaveTF2?src=hashtag_click&amp;f=live" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posts on X</a> (formerly Twitter) about the issues people face trying to play it and has entered X's trending topics.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15478980841717410267gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15478980841717410267gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It has been a problem for a few years now, and while Valve has put out various updates, the bots as always fight back. The game appears to be full of not just aimbots, but according to the campaign website the bots also "abuse the in-game text and voice chats to spread the most vile hate speech imaginable, while simultaneously advertising their “bot immunity services” in an attempt to scam the players desperately looking for a solution" and… "They’ve used these same means to dox people’s personal information and broadcast it to the player-base against their will. Bot hosters have even gone so far as to commit actual crimes, such as using AI voice-modifiers to impersonate and slander non-consenting parties, launching persistent DDoS attacks, and have even swatted one of their most ardent critics".</p>
<p>You would think if the problem was that serious, that Valve would have put a bit more developer time on it by now. Although, they are still updating it now and then, like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/team-fortress-2-gets-64bit-support-released-plus-vulkan-for-linux-via-dxvk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the 64bit update recently</a>.</p>

      <title>Interview with OutOfTheBit on their cinematic platformer Nanuka: Secret of the Shattering Moon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>OutOfTheBit are currently working on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2810190/Nanuka_Secret_of_the_Shattering_Moon/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nanuka: Secret of the Shattering Moon</a>, a cinematic puzzle platformer after previously releasing the positively received <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1859580/Full_Void/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Full Void</a>.</p>
<p>Nanuka: Secret of the Shattering Moon looks great! Inspired by the Sicilian landscape, the journey begins on an island that, while initially portrayed as peaceful and picturesque, soon reveals a tale of magical abilities and a looming disaster that players must strive to avert. As the adventure and story progresses, the importance and acceptance of diverse races and beliefs will shine through preciously.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_DYwZOunu_8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c3d558236216ccc01add917eb195c6a5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_DYwZOunu_8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I had the chance to catch up with the team to shoot off some questions and here's what they said.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Could you tell us a little about the inspiration behind Nanuka: Secret of the Shattering Moon?</strong></p>
<p>"We’re all huge fans of the old-school game aesthetic. While Full Void was inspired by games like Flashback and Another World, Nanuka was more of a natural progression in its creation through team brainstorming sessions. That said, we're huge fans of the humor in the Monkey Island games, and Nanuka’s humor has definitely been influenced by those.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Tom—one of the artists working on the game along with Leo—is a great fan of cartoons like Tom &amp; Jerry and Looney Tunes. The goofiness of Nanuka has some traits inspired by those classic cartoons, adding a playful element to the game."</p>
<p><strong>Q: So what exactly is a "cinematic puzzle platformer", how would you say it's cinematic and different to other platformers?</strong></p>
<p>"A cinematic puzzle platformer is all about combining the platforming gameplay with a strong narrative and film-like presentation. What makes it cinematic are the custom animations and seamless transitions that create a movie-like experience. The story is intertwined into the scenes and animations, rather than just relying on text or dialogue.</p>
<p>In our games, we focus heavily on custom animations for characters' movements and interactions to bring the story to life. Each transition is designed to keep the player immersed, much like watching a film. This way, players are not just playing a game but experiencing a continuous and engaging story."</p>
<p><strong>Q: What lessons did you learn from your previous release Full Void?</strong></p>
<p>"The biggest lesson we learned from Full Void was the importance of refining our engine to handle the specific needs of a cinematic platformer. We developed a custom file format to store large animations using minimal memory, which was extremely important for achieving the visual quality we wanted without sacrificing performance.</p>
<p>Another key takeaway came from the experience we gained working together as a team. Developing Full Void helped us build trust and learn how to bring out the best in each other. We now have a great workflow that suits us perfectly, making our development process much smoother, quick and efficient."</p>
<p><strong>Q: Just how difficult is it to get noticed on stores like Steam now as a small team?</strong></p>
<p>"I think it’s difficult for any sized team. Because of the amount of content available, getting noticed on digital stores can be an uphill battle, but we believe that if your game is good it will always find its audience. Wishlisting on stores is incredibly important for all games, but especially indie games. I think Social Media presence and PR also help with getting more eyes on what you’ve created. TikTok seems to be a great tool for getting indie games in the eyes of players, but that in itself is its own art form."</p>
<p><strong>Q: How was your experience releasing on GOG compared with Steam?</strong></p>
<p>"Both platforms are extremely mature and have made releasing on their stores quite an easy task. Steam, with its massive user base and well-established ecosystem, provides significant visibility and community engagement opportunities. Their tools for developers, such as Steamworks, are robust and user-friendly, making it straightforward to manage releases, updates, and community interactions.</p>
<p>GOG, on the other hand, is known for its curated approach and strong focus on DRM-free games, which appeals to a niche but important audience. The process of releasing on GOG feels more personal, with their team providing direct support and feedback throughout the submission process. This can be especially beneficial for indie developers seeking a more tailored experience."</p>
<p><strong>Q: Any thoughts on the repeating mass layoffs in the AAA industry?</strong></p>
<p>"It's a very complex issue. It's been quite disheartening to witness the numerous layoffs and the closure of beloved studios like Tango Gameworks and PlayStation London Studio, among many others. In our opinion, one major factor is that the development costs for AAA games have become so high that it's increasingly difficult for publishers and console vendors to recoup their investments. Additionally, the current generation of consoles has probably not sold as well as hoped. On the upside, there's a resurgence in PC gaming, and the Steam Deck and similar devices are expanding rapidly, benefiting indie games as well. Nintendo is also rumoured to be working on the Switch 2. So, who knows? Things might turn around in the next few years."</p>
<p><strong>Q: With Valve's compatibility tool Proton, how do you feel about continuing Linux support?</strong></p>
<p>"Fair question! Proton is truly amazing and every single Windows-only game we tried so far has worked great on Linux thanks to Proton! Ali, our lead developer, is a big Linux fan and his development setup consists of a PC running Kubuntu. Our games work well with Proton but we prefer making a native port for Linux, that way our games run well on older hardware and are kinder on the battery."</p>
<p><strong>Q: Any thoughts on the Steam Deck? Are you fans?</strong></p>
<p>"The Steam Deck is a fantastic piece of hardware, and it’s been great to see a new kind of handheld come to the market, and bring a different experience comparative to the Switch. We’re fans of gaming, so any piece of hardware or digital storefront that enables gaming to be experienced by more people is never a bad thing. We are looking forward to seeing the evolution of the Steam Deck in future iterations, as well as the Switch 2, and the capabilities of both devices."</p>
