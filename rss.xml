      <title>Brotato 1.0 is out now and it&#39;s a damn good time</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Brotato is something just a little bit special isn't it? Blobfish have managed to craft something that really stands out in a sea of twin-stick bullet-hell vampire survivor-likes that keep flowing. <em>Note: this was a personal purchase.</em></p>
<p>What we have here is a timed wave-based survival bullet-hell where you pick your potato and have at it. Saying it's anything like Vampire Survivors just isn't doing it any real justice though. There are plenty of similarities here of course but it's still very much its own game. Mechanically simple with you picking a character (and there's quite a few), each with their own buffs and debuffs, and then just lasting as long as possible.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18064744201687726462gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18064744201687726462gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Very much a game to zone-out with. It doesn't take a lot of brain power, it's a perfect game for when you have a few minutes spare and perfect on the go with a Steam Deck too. Officially only available for Windows, it works perfectly with Proton on desktop Linux and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>You might think it doesn't take a long of brain power, and you could even say such a game is "turn your brain off fun" but actually — it's the opposite. Once you get a few waves in, it's tough and pure unhinged chaos. As you power up through the level-up system giving you buffs and new weapons, it trickles in many different types of enemies that will be constantly making you move. Brotato will make you sweat where there should be no sweat, your thumbs will ache like mad but there will be a big smile on your face. That is, until you die when you've really got a sweet setup.</p>
<p>Just today I fired it up for another "quick" run to double-check the release build was all good and ended up getting sucked into a full run again. I had such an awesome weapon set too with turrets everywhere, more turrets spawning constantly, and I thought I was close to immortality. But, it doesn't take long for a few stray enemy bullets and a couple of speedy creatures to end you if you're not careful.</p>
<p>It's hard to find a fault with it. The developer took a simple idea and kept on building on it and it's about as close to perfection as you can get for the simple mechanics it offers. So it's no surprise that it has an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam and it's currently the 99th best user-reviewed game on Steam of all time.</p>
<p>In the 1.0 release they added in 5 new elite enemies, 6 new characters, 7 new weapons, 6 new items and 12 new challenges. So even if you're one of the people who've already spent a good 100+ hours in it, you're going to find something new and fun in your next few runs.</p>
<p>Priced at only £3.99 it's an absolute steal at full price. An absolute gem and one of my favourites. I highly recommend checking it out so go <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental fixes up EA App, Grounded, The Witcher 3</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A rather nice looking Proton Experimental update went live on June 24th, so here's a run over what to expect on Steam Deck and Linux desktop. This is the version of Proton that Valve update regularly, before rolling out changes to the main versions of Proton. See <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">more about Proton here</a>.</p>
<p>For the June 24th update they list these as newly playable:</p>
<ul>
<li>21st Century Basketball.</li>
<li>Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath HD.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus these bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue with EA Desktop sometimes not launching after an update.</li>
<li>Fixed scrollbar in Final Fantasy XIV Online launcher.</li>
<li>Fixed Grounded not being playable on desktop.</li>
<li>Fixed The Witcher 3 showing the task bar after Alt+Tab on xfce with certain resolutions.</li>
<li>Fixed Dwarf Fortress SDL2 beta crashing on launch.</li>
<li>Fixed periodic stuttering in Street Fighter 6 when playing without internet for a longer time.</li>
</ul>
<p>A Proton 8.0 regression was solved for the debug console in Scrap Mechanic that should work again.</p>
<p>On top of that for desktop Linux users with NVIDIA GPUs the NVAPI was enabled for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Atomic Heart.</li>
<li>Baldur's Gate 3.</li>
<li>Demonologist.</li>
<li>Icarus.</li>

</ul>
<p>Full changelog can be <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">seen here</a>.</p>
<p>Good to see more desktop Linux improvements continue to land. Checking back on Grounded, I can confirm there's no longer a manual fix needed. With Proton Experimental up to date it will now launch fully and work, including the Xbox login as well. Screenshot below of it tested on Fedora KDE:</p>

      <title>Dros offers a captivating steampunk adventure with puzzles and quirky characters</title>
      <author>Etienne Mahler</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready to jump on into a decaying steampunk world full of puzzles, platform challenges, and quirky characters? Then Dros might be something for you.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uyL_ZoRYhf0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/67376d17f83d230da8e8a250bc3c4c07.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uyL_ZoRYhf0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Developed by emergeWorlds, Dros takes us through a decaying steampunk world filled with puzzles, platform challenges, and quirky characters.</p>
<p>In Dros, we embark on an exciting little adventure, assuming the roles of two different characters in a fantasy world. Our goal in Dros is to reach the top of a tower controlled by an evil alchemist. This alchemist has amassed an army of small slimy helpers, called Dros, thanks to his flute. However, for the Dros to act outside of glass and vials, they need a vessel, usually pots, pans, or special armor-like objects.</p>
<p>In the case of our two protagonists, the symbiosis consists of a slimy little creature named Little Dros and their human vessel, the bounty hunter Captain. Together, we navigate through a decaying steampunk universe where our survival depends on solving various puzzles, engaging in small combat encounters, and exploration.</p>
<p>The game revolves around the adventures of the two main characters, who possess different abilities that must be combined effectively. While Little Dros excels in agility and exploration, Captain is better at combat and handling larger objects.</p>
<p>With their complementary abilities, we must cleverly switch between the two characters to progress through the tower and overcome its many challenges. Neither the puzzles nor the battles are particularly difficult, but they sometimes require a good idea or some skill. Forgetting the tricks that Little Dros is capable of can make a puzzle quite tricky. Similarly, battles can quickly become intense if we completely ignore blocking with Captain or engage with multiple enemies simultaneously.</p>
<p>Since each character possesses unique strengths and weaknesses, we must skillfully utilize their abilities to overcome obstacles and uncover the secrets within the tower. Dros offers an intertwined narrative and introduces a diverse cast of strange and interesting characters. As we climb the tower, we engage in many conversations and discover the personal struggles and backstories of these quirky beings controlled and ruled by the alchemist.</p>
<p>The tower itself is a treasure trove of alchemical curiosities, with 40 levels filled with peculiar artifacts waiting to be discovered by us. We unravel the secrets of the tower, unlock diary entries, and expand our understanding of Dros' background story.</p>
<p>Visually, Dros is well-executed. The cute polygonal style and character designs are delightful to watch. This is particularly noticeable during conversations, where the characters are depicted in adorable 2D graphics. However, I find that the overall game graphics and character portraits don't quite match, but that's more a matter of personal taste, I guess. Taken individually, both styles are really appealing.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3437328651687690297gol14998.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3437328651687690297gol14998.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The game starts with a highly accessible tutorial that quickly familiarizes you with the basic controls and mechanics. It is easy to understand and serves as an introduction to the story as well.</p>
<p>The game gradually introduces some strategic elements. For example, Little Dros is capable of detecting wires and secret paths. Thanks to Little Dros, Captain can also heal using Prima, a kind of currency.</p>
<p>One nice feature of Dros is the compendium. It provides information about enemies and other elements of the game. The graphical presentation of this feature is visually appealing, with cute illustrations that enhance the game’s charm.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/498236881687690332gol14998.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/498236881687690332gol14998.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>At the end of each level, there is a summary of your performance, including the collected Prima, found red gemstones, and the time taken. The game is designed so that each level can be completed in just a few minutes, guaranteeing an entertaining experience and allowing for short sessions.</p>
<p>However, I can't help but feel that Dros missed an opportunity by not including a co-op mode. Considering the different abilities of Little Dros and Captain, this seems like a natural addition for a fun and engaging multiplayer experience. So, it's a bit of a letdown that it's strictly a single-player game, given that the game mechanics lend themselves well to cooperative play.</p>
<p>In the version I played, which included the tutorial and the first chapter, I had flawless performance on Linux Mint 21.1 with Proton Experimental, without requiring any additional adjustments. There were a few minor bugs, which I'll address shortly, but overall, the game ran smoothly.</p>
<p>Although Dros is an enchanting experience overall, there were a few minor issues I encountered. For instance, I accidentally got stuck behind a bucket once and had to restart the game. Likewise, I was also once stuck in the middle of a room. However, aside from those two bugs, there were no significant technical problems, and I’m confident those two can be resolved.</p>
<p>However, there was one small logical issue: in Dros, all the elevators seem to only go downward, despite our mission being to ascend the tower. This peculiar design decision raises some questions, but it doesn't detract from the overall fun of the game.</p>
<p>Dros will initially be released for PC, and the developer also plans to release the game for Nintendo Switch, PS5, and Xbox. The game will be available in multiple languages, including English, French, Italian, German, Spanish (European), Japanese, Korean, and Simplified Chinese.</p>
<p>You can follow the game on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1554650/DROS/" target="_blank">Steam</a> to get the latest updates.</p>

      <title>Wine 8.11 and vkd3d 1.8 are out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two bits of Wine news here for you as not only has the latest Wine development release been made with <a href="https://www.winehq.org/announce/8.11" target="_blank">Wine 8.11</a> but vkd3d 1.8 is out now too. Once a year a new stable release is made with the next being Wine 9.0, and Wine is just one part of what allows <a href="http://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a> to play some of the biggest games around on Linux desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>First up for Wine 8.11 here are the highlight changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>More mouse cursor clipping improvements.</li>
<li>Support for TLS alerts.</li>
<li>Increased available address space in WoW64 mode.</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For bug fixes they noted 26 in total affecting the likes of Starcraft II, Microsoft Office, ALT-TAB issues, Steam, Ubisoft Connect and various miscellaneous fixes.</p>

      <title>Vampire Survivors is getting a co-op mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Thought you were over your Vampire Survivors fix? Think again, they're <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1794680/view/3680050666264999366" target="_blank">adding</a> in a whole new local co-op mode for the entire game.</p>
<p>Releasing August 17th as a free update it will let 4 people play together either through your current game or you can start a new adventure for it. It will also let you easily swap between playing alone or with others between stages. So you will be able to play through all of the content with others if you choose. They also said clearly it will work on Steam Deck, so for people docking it to a TV or monitor it could be a whole lot of fun.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-j2budq0Qpo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f6c3fac23889a68c971fddc53dabb366.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-j2budq0Qpo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In their FAQ post on Steam they made it clear that it's not split-screen, you'll all be there together on one screen and there will be a few gameplay adjustments. You will share the level ups, so you will take it in turns to level up and there's also going to be "a few ways to sabotage each other". It's local co-op only but they did say Steam Remote Play Together will work with it. You won't be able to pick the same character either, each player has to be a different one.</p>
<p>More updates are planned after this too, they're not done with it yet.</p>
<p>Vampire Survivors was already chaos enough with one person, I can't imagine what it's like with others, going to have to try it out for myself.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>. It is Steam Deck Verified and works great on desktop Linux with Proton too. It does have a Native Linux version in Beta but it's not really clear what they plan to do with it there.</p>

      <title>Classic LucasArts games emulator DREAMM adds early Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want a way to play classic LucasArts games on Linux? While some ways already exist like ScummVM, another is <a href="https://aarongiles.com/dreamm/" target="_blank">DREAMM</a> and it now has early Linux support.</p>
<p>In the new 2.1b3 version currently in Beta it adds support for Indiana Jones and His Desktop Adventures, Mortimer and the Riddles of the Medallion, Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire, Star Wars: Yoda Stories, Outlaws, Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II, Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Mysteries of the Sith, Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine, Star Wars: X-Wing, Star Wars: TIE Fighter and Afterlife. That's all on top of adding initial Linux support.</p>
<p>Why use it over ScummVM? The developer explains in their <a href="https://aarongiles.com/dreamm/docs/#faq" target="_blank">FAQ</a> a number of reasons including a bigger scope to include more games and it runs the original SPUTM game engine code in an x86 emulator and so it's supposed to be more accurate to the original games - it's all about that classic feel.</p>
<p>It's not open source though unlike other similar projects, and the developer currently has no plans to open source it either. Also explained in their FAQ that currently they wish to work alone on it and they may use it somehow commercially in future.</p>
<p>You can read the latest release notes <a href="https://aarongiles.com/dreamm/beta/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

      <title>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1 confirmed for a Steam release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I have to admit I am a little bit excited by this. Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1 is now confirmed to be coming to Steam. So we could be playing classic Metal Gear on Linux desktop and Steam Deck with Proton very soon.</p>
<p>The collection will release on October 24th and include Metal Gear Solid (including VR / Special Missions), MGS 2: Sons of Liberty (HD Collection version) and MGS 3: Snake Eater (HD Collection version)) as the main games. Plus extras of Metal Gear, Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, Metal Gear (NES/FC version) and Snake's Revenge.</p>
<p>This was confirmed in an official video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mo_QG9_NXUc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0e93623763fb4c5944400400601caca4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mo_QG9_NXUc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I have such fond memories of playing Metal Gear Solid on the original PlayStation. Being able to play them easily (hopefully) thanks to Proton on my desktop or on the go with my Steam Deck is going to be pretty great.</p>
<p>Will you be picking it up?</p>

      <title>Linux Mint 21.2 gets a Beta release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Linux Mint 21.2 is getting close to release now with a Beta available for testing across their Cinnamon, MATE and Xfce desktop environments. Probably one of my favourite Linux distributions, because they've been going a long time now and have a real focus on the normal desktop user experience. </p>
<p>Linux Mint 21.2 comes with Cinnamon 5.8 / MATE 1.26 / Xfce 4.18, a Linux kernel 5.15 and an Ubuntu 22.04 package base with a plan to receive security updates until 2027. Until 2024 they will continue to use the same Ubuntu package base, so upgrades will be "trivial" to do.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21318270191687427845gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21318270191687427845gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of what's new includes the login screen supporting multiple keyboard layouts, touchpad support on the login screen, keyboard navigation improvements for the login screen, support for Wayland sessions and more general improvements to their login greeter.</p>
<p>Elsewhere you'll see a UI refresh for the Software Manager, along with it now able to feature Flatpaks. Their Pix photo viewer got a big upgrade based on a newer version of gThumb giving better performance, improved zoom controls, it supports more image formats, improved video playback and much more.</p>
<p>There's a few visual differences too with slight tweaks to their styling like new colour variants, two-tone icons, improved tooltips that look more consistent, titlebar buttons were realigned and changes to icons in icons in various apps.</p>
<p>Some other changes include the addition of XDG Desktop Portal support to XApp to provide better compatibility with Flatpaks and GNOME apps, a global Dark Mode setting, Cinnamon desktop got a new "styles" concept to let you better adjust the look and feel of the desktop, gesture support for window management / workspace management / tiling etc supported on touchpads, touchscreens and tablets, upgrades to their Warpinator file-sharing tool and various upgrades to all the included software.</p>
<p>You can read the full details for each here:</p>

      <title>Classic open source FPS Xonotic 0.8.6 released with new game modes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://xonotic.org/" target="_blank">Xonotic</a> 0.8.6 is an essential upgrade for anyone playing this classic free and open source arena shooter, due to a security issue but there's also plenty of new features and additions.</p>
<p>If you've never played it Xonotic is an arena-style first person shooter, with fast-paced movement and gameplay plus a wide array of weapons. It's completely free and has full Native Linux support. Developed as a fork of a previous game called Nexuiz.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10481503721687426438gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10481503721687426438gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The new release brings in two new official maps, a few tweaks to existing maps, performance optimizations, lots of bug fixes (and security fixes), a new "superbots" AI that are really tough to fight against, new moderation systems, upgrades to various visual effects and some new game modes that sound like a lot of fun.</p>
<p>New game modes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mayhem - Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch where players spawn with all weapons and full health / armour. Score is given 75% based on damage and 25% based on frags.</li>
<li>Survival - A few randomly selected players must frag all survivors, without being identified.</li>
<li>Team Keepaway - A team variant of the free for all, where points are awarded to the team in possession of a ball for each kill.</li>
</ul>

      <title>SDL 2.28.0 released and goes into maintenance mode, now focusing on SDL 3</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.libsdl.org/" target="_blank">SDL</a> (Simple DirectMedia Layer) is a cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware used by a great many companies and SDL 2 is now pretty much finished.</p>
<p>This software is used by Valve with Steam and Source 2, Unity game engine, tons of games, emulators and much more to provide easy cross-platform support for features noted above. It's a rather important thing for Linux gaming.</p>
<p>With the release of version <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-2.28.0" target="_blank">2.28.0</a>, there's plenty of bug fixes and these additional features added:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added SDL_HasWindowSurface() and SDL_DestroyWindowSurface() to switch between the window surface and rendering APIs</li>
<li>Added a display event SDL_DISPLAYEVENT_MOVED which is sent when the primary monitor changes or displays change position relative to each other</li>
<li>Added the hint SDL_HINT_ENABLE_SCREEN_KEYBOARD to control whether the on-screen keyboard should be shown when text input is active</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That's it for SDL 2 now though, as it's moving into maintenance mode since their focus has moved onto SDL 3. With the major new version in the works they're going to be making some huge changes like adding in a 3D GPU API, full support for high DPI displays and much more.</p>

      <title>Valve moving away from the Battle Pass in Dota 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/570/Dota_2/" target="_blank">Dota 2</a> comes up to the 10 year anniversary, Valve developers have put up a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/dota2/announcements/detail/6252732681186068105" target="_blank">blog post</a> going over some of their thoughts on the future.</p>
<p>The main point they're making in this self-reflection is how the Battle Pass has swallowed up so much of their time, and so much that could have been updates to the game was put into the Battle Pass instead in some form. This means they've had less time for other features for everyone and that "Most Dota players never buy a Battle Pass and never get any rewards from it" - which is <em>really</em> interesting to see them be so honest about it.</p>
<p>So what they ended up doing was taking away some developer resources from the Battle Pass, towards more main updates to the game which is what gave us the recent New Frontiers and patch 7.33 which they say wouldn't have happened if they were still going so hard on the Battle Pass.</p>
<p>Valve said they're going to now continue on this path, building a "wide variety of features and content for the game, delivered in different ways" but they will still ship various cosmetics over the year but they're aiming for bigger stuff for all Dota players to get.</p>
<p>Sounds like a sane idea overall. As they said "By freeing Dota's update and content cycle from the timing and structural constraints of the Battle Pass, we can go back to making content in the way we know best: by coming up with fun ideas of all scales and shapes, and exploring them with you".</p>
<hr/>
<p>I actually played a couple of games with a friend on the new map recently, and it was surprisingly a really great time. The map definitely feels a whole lot better now and the game works really great on Linux too.</p>

      <title>Pixel art RTS TFC: The Fertile Crescent adds in factions and dynamic music</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>TFC: The Fertile Crescent is a great fast-paced pixel-art take on an RTS, a little in the spirit of Age of Empires and similar games. The latest update is the biggest yet adding in a faction system.</p>
<p>Previously you always played as one single side but now you choose between The Assyrians, Babylonians and Egyptians. They have a unique look, unique technologies and each have a unique Wonder bonus too. It's a little different here as you pick your civilization <em>during</em> a game, not before it too, as you need to reach a certain level of progress. Not only that the developers also added in a new soundtrack, with each faction having their own and there's multiple tracks. The audio now reacts to the gameplay too so it's all a bit more dynamic.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rX0YOZw4G7A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7cabf0eeda41d0314eae5eadac64dd16.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rX0YOZw4G7A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's also a redesigned technology tree with space for more as they expand through Early Access, Wonders are now more important, with each having different levels of construction with different bonuses, there's an influence range circle for buildings, the start of adding in Steam Achievements and much <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1674820/view/3680043874849126394" target="_blank">more</a>.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1674820/TFC_The_Fertile_Crescent/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and it's 40% off until June 27th.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2460297851687261323gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2460297851687261323gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Highlights of what this event pack will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Childhood Education Events.</li>
<li>Visiting Universities for adult characters.</li>
<li>More Childhood Personality Events.</li>
<li>Hostage Events for foreign children placed at your court.</li>
<li>Child-rearing events with courtiers, including a new court position, the Wet-Nurse.</li>
<li>Child Regency Events for the training or usurping of rulers who have not reached adulthood.</li>
<li>Four New Music Tracks.</li>
</ul>
<p>A free update will release at the same time that includes the new hostage system, a new eccentric character trait, new event art and new animations for all players. The DLC will be priced at $4.99 / £4.29 / €4.99.</p>
<p>You can buy Crusader Kings III from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/crusader-kings-iii?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158310/Crusader_Kings_III/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>RetroDECK got a lot bigger and better for emulation on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://retrodeck.net/" target="_blank">RetroDECK</a> is just one of the ways you can set up your Steam Deck for emulation and their team recently put up a rather great sounding upgrade in v0.7.0b. During the Beta period their focus is on the Steam Deck but it will eventually expand fully onto desktop Linux too. Technically it works on desktop Linux but they say "the user experience might not be that great it could contain desktop specific bugs and other issues".</p>
<p>Giving you one of the easiest ways to get going it integrates with <a href="https://es-de.org/" target="_blank">EmulationStation Desktop Edition (ES-DE)</a>, so you get a nice beginner-friendly and pretty good looking interface with everything all in one.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12861535221687260276gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12861535221687260276gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Just some of what's new inside RetroDECK v0.7.0b include:</p>
<ul>
<li>New controller layout, that unifies hotkeys for all emulators where possible.</li>
<li>New system folder layout to make handing modding easier.</li>
<li>Their own configurator is now integrated inside ES-DE. Plus lots of upgrades to their configurator.</li>
<li>Updates ES-DE to the latest version.</li>
<li>Updates RetroArch and their emulator cores to latest versions.</li>
<li>Updates various other standalone emulators to their latest versions.</li>
<li>Adds Wii U support from CEMU.</li>
<li>Experimental multi-user support.</li>
<li>RetroDECK auto updates on launch (can be turned off).</li>
</ul>
<p>Full <a href="https://github.com/XargonWan/RetroDECK/wiki/Version-history%3A-Patch-Notes" target="_blank">patch notes here</a>.</p>
<p>You can install it directly from the Discover software centre in desktop mode, since it's available as a Flatpak on <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/net.retrodeck.retrodeck" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.</p>

      <title>Save your owner as a space-pup in shoot &#39;em up ProtoCorgi</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ProtoCorgi is a shoot 'em up with a difference. You're not a spaceship, you're not even a person, you're a dog on a quest to save their owner.</p>
<p>Here you play as Bullet, a cybernetic dog, off to save their owner who was kidnapped by a strange alien race that seems to want to rule the galaxy. As you fly through space you face off against various aliens, collect the usual power-ups and something about eating space-fruit to get a higher score. With 27 different weapon combinations, there's a fair amount of replay value there and it looks pretty sweet.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8n8OENUB-TQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/08931bbfee19c49490b9ee162a5c1535.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8n8OENUB-TQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Family friendly too, so perhaps a nice shoot 'em up for a slightly younger audience who are interested in gaming. Not everything is about those of us with greying hair huh? There's also a built in level editor, so you can make your own missions for you and others to play through.</p>
<p>One for retro fans too, looks like something that could have fit right at home on the Sega Mega Drive / Genesis.</p>
<p>Available with Linux support <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1039280/ProtoCorgi/" target="_blank">on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Get a free copy of Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition with Prime Gaming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Subscribe to Amazon Prime? Well you can get a free copy of Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition thanks to their partnership with <a href="http://gog.com" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>
<p>A good time to pick it up too considering Beamdog are many years later still upgrading the game. Just <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/many-years-later-neverwinter-nights-enhanced-edition-is-still-getting-better/" target="_blank">recently</a> it had an update adding in a new cartoon shader and lots of optimizations. It's still going strong! It has a Native Linux version available, that Beamdog have supported well too.</p>
<p>How to claim it? Go to <a href="https://gaming.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Prime Gaming</a>, login with your Amazon account and you'll see it in the list. You'll also need a GOG account as well of course. You have until July 19th to claim it. Since you'll be getting a copy on GOG, you don't need to keep your Prime subscription active - it's yours to keep.</p>
<p>If you also want an easy way to install GOG games on Linux, check out <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/" target="_blank">Heroic</a> or <a href="https://lutris.net/" target="_blank">Lutris</a>. Both work great on desktop Linux and Steam Deck and just make setting up games from GOG much simpler overall.</p>

<p>The game already had <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1647730" target="_blank">a Gold rating on ProtonDB</a> and runs well on desktop Linux, but it's nice to see that extra bit of assurance that it works as it should on the Deck.</p>

      <title>New Beta for Valheim adds in world modifiers letting you customize your game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's here in Beta! A big upgrade for Valheim to let you change how you can play it, so here's a run over what's new and improved. This was teased recently and comes after a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/valheim-gets-upgraded-to-improve-performance-and-fix-major-bugs/" target="_blank">stable update that improved performance</a>.</p>
<p>When you go to start a game, you now have access to World Modifiers where you can change various difficulty options. This includes no-cost building, passive enemies, amount of raids, death penalty, combat difficulty and more. So for people who want it much easier and close to a creative mode - you can now do it. Want it to be even more difficult? You can do that too.</p>

<p>This should make the game a whole lot more accessible for many different types of players, great to see. Hopefully it won't be too long before it's rolled out for everyone.</p>

      <title>Steam UI scaling should work even better in the latest Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Having Steam UI scaling issues? You may want to have a look at the Steam Client Beta that was released <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/6627657351330751106" target="_blank">June 15th</a> and see how you get on. Valve are constantly updating the Beta, and they only just <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/steam-overhauled-new-overlay-steam-deck-big-stable-update/" target="_blank">launched a major update</a> with the new Steam Overlay but they're right back to it on the Beta with fresh upgrades and fixes.</p>
<p>For the Linux client here's what they've added:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improved scaling for users running gnome.</li>
<li>Added an env var based override for scaling settings STEAM_FORCE_DESKTOPUI_SCALING=.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare crash when rendering an invalid texture.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented multiple DualShock 4 controllers from being connected at the same time.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So to use the env var, you could just run <code class="inline-code">STEAM_FORCE_DESKTOPUI_SCALING=1.5 steam</code> and have it bigger. Set it to whatever you want. As example here's how it would normally look on my 1440p monitor:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11588336111686912928gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11588336111686912928gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>And then with 1.5 scaling forced:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4488011631686912947gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4488011631686912947gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>And then with 2.0 forced scaling:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20842370191686912977gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20842370191686912977gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Seems to work really nicely, and you can set it to exactly what you want. Nice to see Valve put some more attention into this, as it can really help at different resolutions and for people with vision issues.</p>

      <title>Soulstone Survivors a great Vampire Survivor-like has a huge skill tree upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Soulstone Survivors is one of my favourite games in the spirit of Vampire Survivors, and it just got a lot bigger with the new Path of Ascension upgrade. While similar to VS in basic gameplay mechanics and the loop, it expanded on the idea in a few ways with more skill-based gameplay.</p>
<p>More about it: "Soulstone Survivors is an action roguelite where you slay hordes of foes and face titanic bosses while learning powerful skills to enhance your character. Play as a Void Hunter, and with the spoils of every match craft weapons, unlock new characters, upgrade your skill tree and equip new runes, all in your quest for godlike powers. With deep RPG mechanics intertwined with Roguelite elements, Soulstone Survivors offers a condensed, yet deep Action RPG experience"</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17081913591686911933gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17081913591686911933gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The latest upgrade to the game in Path of Ascension gives you a massively expanded skill tree with character-specific nodes to unlock, with lots of new types of effects and over 200 new nodes to progress through for the Barbarian, Pyromancer, Hound Master, Spellblade, Arcane Weaver, Sentinel, and Paladin. Other characters will get the same treatment in a future update.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6378639671686911988gol1.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6378639671686911988gol1.gif"/></a></p>
<p>With this there's also 7 new weapons, 14 new active skills, 21 new runes to customize character runs, new enemies to face and a new auto-aim feature to save your thumbs a bit. The auto-aim might be my favourite new addition to be honest, I love these style of games but when the action gets ridiculously heated, having to manually aim various skills ends up killing me…and my thumb.</p>
<p>Available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2066020/Soulstone_Survivors/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">on Steam</a> in Early Access.</p>
<p>You can see my previous Steam Deck gameplay below:</p>

<p>It runs great on desktop Linux too, no complaints there! It has Native Linux support and it seems to be supported well overall so one not to miss.</p>

      <title>Factorio adds controller support in experimental update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news for Steam Deck and gamepad fans, as official controller support is coming to Factorio and you can try it out right now. Released in <a href="https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=106660" target="_blank">experimental v1.1.83</a> they note you just need to change over the input method in the settings -&gt; controls menu. Then you will get proper gamepad controls and glyphs telling you what to do.</p>
<p>To access it on Steam simply go into the Properties -&gt; Betas menu and select at least version 1.1.83. You can also select to keep on the latest 1.1 experimental version if you wish.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4143860971686907984gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4143860971686907984gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17042827981686908066gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17042827981686908066gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Looking forward to kicking-back and relaxing some more with this. It's been a while since playing Factorio properly but gamepad support always makes me look at games again, it's so much nicer to relax with rather than feeling forced to sit at a desk after a long day.</p>
<p>Checking it today on Steam Deck the controls do seem to work quite well, although no doubt they'll be making improvements over time since this is only in the experimental build. Sometimes selecting the right building can be difficult when they're right next to each other but that's what testing is for right? Still getting used to it but after only a few minutes you can get pretty quick with the various binds.</p>
<p>Time to get started then…</p>

      <title>Removing non-Steam apps now cleans up on Steam Deck and Linux desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A change that Valve missed in the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/steam-overhauled-new-overlay-steam-deck-big-stable-update/" target="_blank">big recent upgrade</a> of the Steam client, is that on Linux systems either desktop or Steam Deck, removing non-Steam apps should now be cleaner.</p>
<p>Previously, if you added something into Steam that ended up making a shader cache and compatibility data, like running something with Proton, when you removed the shortcut from Steam it would leave everything behind. That should no longer be the case, as Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais mentioned on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1669489661507682305" target="_blank">Twitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Linux change we forgot to call out in the new client: removing non-Steam apps now properly removes all related files like shader caches and compatibility data (which would previously be left as 'other' storage space)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So people can eventually stop asking "What's taking up all my "Other" storage?!", which has been an ongoing problem since the Steam Deck's release and especially a problem on the 64GB Steam Deck model.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/906223661686906148gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/906223661686906148gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Even though Valve don't actually support non-Steam apps directly, it's nice to see them make steps to make the experience better.</p>

      <title>SNES JRPG inspired game Alterium Shift arrives July 6th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Inspired by SNES classics, the JRPG styled Alterium Shift plans to have an Early Access release land on July 6th and it's looking good.</p>
<p>More about it: "Embark on a retro-inspired adventure with Alterium Shift, a classic JRPG featuring immersive 2.5D graphics and pixel art combined with modern gameplay. Choose from three unique characters, each with their own skills and elemental powers to explore the living world of Alteria. Engage in turn-based combat and fun mini-games like fishing as you uncover the secrets of this magical land and shape the outcome of the story with your choices."</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="VkgBn6x6n0s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/59a6ff633afba23c2304d1c39534b665.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/VkgBn6x6n0s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With the Early Access release they said it's about 50% done. With a full release expected up until the end of 2023, or into 2024 if some parts like localisation and porting to other platforms take longer. The full version will have configurable controls, full world maps to walk across, a bestiary, more settings (like CRT effects), battle enhancements and just general gameplay improvements.</p>
<p>Looks quite fantastic, excited for this one.</p>
<p>You can try a demo <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1586990/Alterium_Shift/" target="_blank">right now on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>AMD reveals initial open source openSIL code to replace AGESA Firmware</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AMD is moving even further into open source, with their plans to have openSIL replace AGESA for their processors and they've now put up the initial open source code on <a href="https://github.com/openSIL/openSIL" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>It's only currently a proof of concept, to start working more in the open with the community. Their current plan is to have openSIL available properly in some form beginning 2026. AMD has been collaborating with the likes of 9elements, AMI, AWS, 3mdeb, Datacom, Google, Meta and Oxide on this.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10582878451686830924gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10582878451686830924gol1.png"/></a><em>Image Source - AMD</em></p>
<p>I'll leave the explanation up to AMD on this one from their <a href="http://community.amd.com/t5/business/empowering-the-industry-with-open-system-firmware-amd-opensil/ba-p/599644" target="_blank">blog post</a> back in April:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AMD believes one of the ways to attain an improved security posture is to open Silicon Initialization Firmware architecture, development, and validation to the open-source community. AMD is committed to open-source software and is now expanding into the various firmware domains with the re-architecture of its x86 AGESA FW stack - designed with UEFI as the host firmware that prevented scaling, to other host firmware solutions such as coreboot, oreboot, FortiBIOS, Project µ and others. A newer, open architecture that potentially allows for reduced attack surface, and perceivably infinite scalability is now available as a Proof-of-Concept, within the open-source community for evaluation, called the AMD openSIL – Open-Source Silicon Initialization Library.</p>
<p>AMD openSIL adheres to simple goals of an agnostic set of library functions written in an industry-standard language that can be statically linked to the host firmware without having to adhere to any host firmware protocols. AMD openSIL is designed to be scalable and simple to integrate, light weight, low chirp and transparent, potentially allowing for an improved security posture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like a nice win for open source and future system security with AMD CPUs.</p>

      <title>PAYDAY 2 devs to ensure it works with Proton on Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You may have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/overkill-drops-linux-support-for-payday-2/" target="_blank">seen the news</a> recently that Overkill decided to stop supporting and updating their Native Linux build of PAYDAY 2. Well, they're now saying they will ensure it works with Proton.</p>
<p>For Steam Deck players, you shouldn't need to do anything, as it defaults to the Windows version running in Proton anyway. For desktop Linux players, you'll just need to force Proton in the right click menu Properties -&gt; Compatibility section on the game.</p>
<p>Addressing some issues that have come up since the latest update including matchmaking problems, they included a section on the future of PAYDAY 2 running on Linux (and so Steam Deck too). Here's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/218620/view/3665414601842198623" target="_blank">what they said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Linux is a complicated beast. To get the game working on both native Linux and at the same time updating the older version of the diesel engine that PAYDAY 2 for Linux was using proved unfeasible. This was one of the things we spent the most time trying to solve, yet didn’t reach our goals in the end.<br/>
Linux players can still access the game using Proton, we’ll keep testing new updates with Proton to make sure it keeps working for the upcoming patches and releases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it's good news for people who don't care about what happens behind the Play button and just want to play their games. Support is what's important and they clearly say they're going to ensure it keeps working and will be testing it.</p>
<p>You could argue the issue wouldn't be a problem if they kept the Linux version on an up to date game engine, but there will be reasons why they haven't done this. We know that developers can see exactly how many players are in their games from each platform (Steam shows developers this), so they likely just saw there wasn't enough players using the Native Linux version to be worth ongoing support costs and upgrades.</p>
<p>I just tested it with Proton Experimental and it worked great.</p>

      <title>Steam gets overhauled with new overlay, Steam Deck big stable update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has now released the latest big update to the Steam client, which brings with it various UI updates and the new in-game Steam Overlay. This is the update they announced <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/huge-steam-beta-upgrade-with-new-overlay-screenshot-manager-more/" target="_blank">back in April</a>, with it being promoted from Beta to Stable.</p>
<p>While there's plenty of tweaks, Valve said the biggest changes aren't actually user-visible because they've changed "how we share code across the Steam Desktop Client, Big Picture mode, and Steam Deck" resulting in "quicker implementation and iteration of new features" and now much code is shared between them.</p>
<p>Some of what's new includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Various tweaks to the Steam App UI.</li>
<li>Richer notifications.</li>
<li>A whole new in-game overlay that lets you make notes, and pin windows on top of games.</li>
<li>Hardware acceleration for Linux and macOS.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an example of the new in-game overlay:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14414209981686825722gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14414209981686825722gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Really great update actually, the new overlay is many times more useful than the one before. The notes system is a good idea, and having it sync to your Steam account so you have it anywhere is really quite useful.</p>
<p>Check out Valve's overview video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="e8jv24NjOWQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/83f1ebf0e6e4ff6cfe1466fbe1fc1590.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/e8jv24NjOWQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Full Steam desktop app changes can be seen in their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/3687931965598906184" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Over on the Steam Deck, we finally have a fresh Stable Steam Client update as well, bundling together a whole lot of the tweaks and changes Valve has been putting out in Beta. Naturally, a lot of this is the same as what's found on desktop, since they are sharing code now but there's various specific Steam Deck tweaks like fixing the notorious issue of the Steam Deck claiming it cannot reach Steam servers when resuming from sleep. Most of it is bug fixing but there's also these additions and changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added support for notification types shown in the Desktop Client and Mobile app: Wishlist, Trade Offer, Steam Turn, Help Request, Major Sale, and Comment.</li>
<li>Added a bell icon to the header when there are new notifications, and a green indicator to new notifications in the notifications list.</li>
<li>Apply text filtering preferences in Guides in the Overlay.</li>
<li>Expand the hitbox of buttons in the footer to make them easier to click.</li>
<li>Improved performance of dual trackpad typing in the Virtual Keyboard.</li>
<li>Any button press will now cancel the Wake custom startup movie.</li>
<li>Changed game invitations to show the launch option dialog instead of using the first option in the list. If the user has selected an option and asked to remember it, that option will be used instead of showing the dialog.</li>
<li>Added support for Mouse4 (Back) as B button in the interface.</li>
<li>Search will now return tags in addition to games. You can search for categories like "Free to Play" or individual tags like "survival" or "zombies".</li>
<li>Enabled additional toast notifications that were previously only visible in Desktop mode.</li>
<li>Restored display of Special Offers in the What's New section of the home screen.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Total War: WARHAMMER III for Linux updated to v3.1</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After entirely skipping the 3.0 update for Linux, Feral Interactive has now upgraded their Linux port of Total War: WARHAMMER III to version 3.1. The 3.0 update originally released for Windows in April, with 3.1 landing in May. While it is nice to see we got the 3.1 update a bit quicker, two months between updates is not a good look if you're sticking to their Native build.</p>
<p>Main changes for 3.1 and 3.0 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chaos Dwarfs Endgame Crisis</li>
<li>Regiments of Renown IV</li>
<li>Bretonnia changes and rebalancing</li>
<li>Event notifications fixed</li>
<li>Forge of the Chaos Dwarfs</li>
<li>Mirror of Madness</li>
<li>Free Legendary Hero: Ulrika Magdova</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get an overview on what's changed in the two below videos:</p>

<p>This update also brings support for the Forge of the Chaos Dwarfs DLC.</p>
<p><em>Full patch notes can be found for <a href="https://www.totalwar.com/blog/tww3-update-300/" target="_blank">3.0 here</a> and <a href="https://www.totalwar.com/blog/tww3-update-310/" target="_blank">3.1 here</a>.</em></p>
<p>You can grab Total War: Warhammer III on <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/total-war-warhammer-iii?ref=gol" target="_blank">Fanatical</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/total-war-warhammer-iii?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142710/Total_War_WARHAMMER_III/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>ICYMI: seems like Feral won't be doing any more Linux ports, after <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/total-war-pharaoh-announced-linux-port-from-feral-interactive/" target="_blank">Total War: PHARAOH</a> was initially announced with Linux support Feral quickly clarified this was in fact wrong and they're only doing it for macOS.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA driver 535.54.03 stable rolls out for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA has today released their latest stable driver for Linux version <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/download/driverResults.aspx/205541/en-uk" target="_blank">535.54.03</a>, following on from their recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/nvidia-535-43-02-beta-for-linux-wayland-vulkan/" target="_blank">535.43.02 Beta driver in late May</a>.</p>
<p>Compared with the Beta, NVIDIA added in these extra bug fixes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused modesets to fail in some Wayland configurations.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused head-mounted displays (HMDs) to display black after a modeset.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented SLI Mosaic controls from being displayed in the nvidia-settings control panel when using GSP Firmware.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause image corruption when unbinding Vulkan sparse textures.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused head-mounted displays (HMDs) to display black after a modeset.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The rest of the changes are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added support for the VK_EXT_memory_priority, and VK_EXT_pageable_device_memory extensions for Turing+ GPUs.</li>
<li>Improved the performance of Minecraft Java Edition on RTX 3000 series GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed a memory leak in the NVIDIA GLX driver, as reported at: <a href="https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/222697" target="_blank">https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/222697</a></li>
<li>Added support for driving very high pixel clock mode timings such as 8K @ 60Hz. Please see the "MaxOneHardwareHead" X11 ModeValidation token in the README for details.</li>
<li>Extended Dynamic Boost support on notebooks to include older Renoir and Cezanne chipsets, in addition to Rembrandt and newer AMD chipsets.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused Vulkan X11 swapchain creation to fail on GPUs without a display engine when the VK_KHR_present_id extension is used.</li>
<li>Fixed console restore on legacy VGA consoles when using the NVIDIA Open GPU Kernel Modules.</li>
<li>Added nvoptix.bin to the driver package. This data file is used by the OptiX ray tracing engine library, libnvoptix.so.1.</li>
<li>Removed libnvidia-compiler.so.VERSION from the driver package. This functionality is now provided by other driver libraries.</li>
<li>Added power usage and power limits information to nvidia-settings PowerMizer page.</li>
<li>Updated NV_CTRL_GPU_POWER_SOURCE NV-CONTROL API to report undersized power source.</li>
<li>Add support for version 4 of the linux-dmabuf wayland protocol.</li>
<li>Added NV-CONTROL attributes NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_MULTIPLY_DIVIDE_MODE and NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_MULTIPLY_DIVIDE_VALUE to allow syncing a Quadro Sync II card to different House Sync signal rates. This feature requires firmware version 2.18 or later; to download the latest firmware version, please visit: <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/firmware/quadro-sync-firmware-driver/" target="_blank">https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/firmware/quadro-sync-firmware-driver/</a></li>
<li>Added support for the VK_KHR_video_queue, VK_KHR_video_decode_queue, VK_KHR_video_decode_h264 and VK_KHR_video_decode_h265 extensions.</li>
<li>Added an application profile to avoid performance problems in Xfce 4 when the OpenGL compositor backend is enabled along with G-SYNC.</li>
<li>Added support for suspend and resume when using GSP firmware.</li>
<li>Moved the nvidia-settings application icon into the 'hicolor' icon theme, which allows it to be customized by other icon themes selected in the desktop environment.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented PRIME render offload from working for Wayland applications when running on a system with an AMD iGPU.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented nvidia-installer from recording kernel log output to the installer log in some module loading failure paths.</li>
<li>Changed nvidia-installer to no longer use the $XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variable. XDG data files are now installed to a path specified by the --xdg-data-dir option, or /usr/share if not specified.</li>
<li>This fixes a problem when Flatpak is installed that caused the installer to place the nvidia-settings.desktop file in /root/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share/applications.</li>
<li>Changed the behavior of glXGetRefreshRateSGI() for non-integer refresh rates to round to the nearest whole number rather than truncating.</li>
<li>Changed the compression format of the .run installer package from xz to zstd. This results in a smaller compressed package, and faster decompression performance. A fallback zstd decompressor is embedded into the installer package for systems which do not already have a zstd decompression program installed.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused nvidia-installer to mistakenly unload some already loaded non-NVIDIA kernel modules.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which caused incorrect reporting of presentation times when using the VK_NV_present_barrier Vulkan extension.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can download it direct <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/download/driverResults.aspx/205541/en-uk" target="_blank">here</a>, or wait for your usual Linux distribution packaging updates. How and when you get it will depend on whatever distribution you're on.</p>
<p>Was there something you're happy to see added or fixed here? Are you waiting on NVIDIA fixing something else? Let me know in the comments.</p>

      <title>AMD GPUs to get Ray Tracing turned on for Mesa 23.2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The RADV driver in Mesa for AMD GPUs on Linux and Steam Deck is set to get Ray Tracing turned on by default for the upcoming Mesa 23.2 release.</p>
<p>Previously you could try it in certain titles, and there were ways to enable it manually but now you won't have to do anything as the code to turn it on has been <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/commit/374bd4e1bef25ba2aeef6016ac35b41df07f3a99" target="_blank">merged</a>. Once you upgrade to Mesa 23.2 after release (scheduled for August 2nd at the earliest) with an AMD GPU, you should find games able to use it.</p>
<p>This has been a long time coming, so it's really great to see Ray Tracing really getting into shape for those with an AMD GPU. It also means it will be doable on Steam Deck whenever Valve upgrade SteamOS to have the newer Mesa version, although it likely won't run too well there in many titles.</p>
<p>You can read more on the behind the scenes work from developer Friedrich Vock on <a href="https://pixelcluster.github.io/RADV-Raytracing-ON/" target="_blank">their blog post</a>.</p>
<p>What are you looking forward to trying with it?</p>

      <title>Upload VR Showcase bundle has some good picks for VR fans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have a fancy VR headset and fancy picking up some new games? The <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/upload-vr?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Upload VR Showcase Bundle</a> has some interesting titles worth a look. I'll list each title along with any expected compatibility thanks to <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a>, with each being a Steam link if you need to go get more info first.</p>
<p>Included in the bundle are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/916840/The_Walking_Dead_Saints__Sinners/" target="_blank">The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners</a> - ProtonDB Platinum.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1947500/The_Walking_Dead_Saints__Sinners__Chapter_2_Retribution/" target="_blank">The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners - Chapter 2: Retribution</a> - No Reports.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1481780/Dragon_Fist_VR_Kung_Fu/" target="_blank">Dragon Fist: VR Kung Fu</a> - One report note it works fine.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1079800/Pistol_Whip/" target="_blank">Pistol Whip</a> - ProtonDB Gold (worked great last I checked).</li>

</ul>
<p>See the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/upload-vr?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">full bundle here</a>.</p>
<p>Frustratingly, SteamVR is currently just not working for me on Fedora KDE 38. When I load SteamVR it gives this error and the headset just flashes at me with no game output:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3517784281686744032gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3517784281686744032gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>If anyone has any good tips to solve it I would love to read your thoughts in the comments as I want to get back into it with my Valve Index. Once the summer heat has died off a bit at least… Used to work well in games for the most part before this, but now I can't get it to work at all.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the most well-reviewed games on Steam from an indie developer and quite a tragic game, it's getting a Definitive Edition on July 18th.</p>
<p>What is it? "Lisa is a quirky side-scrolling RPG set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Beneath the charming and funny exterior is a world full of disgust and moral destruction. Players will learn what kind of person they are by being FORCED to make choices. These choices permanently effect the game play. If you want to save a party member from death, you will have to sacrifice the strength of your character. Whether it's taking a beating for them, or chopping off limbs, or some other inhuman way. You will learn that in this world being selfish and heartless is the only way to survive..."</p>
<p>The new version will bring remastered HD graphics, an updated UI, new quests, new boss battles, new secrets, bonus content and more. Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5yq25GLKuKI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/97b9dc309618ef4658105c373a3a4d73.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5yq25GLKuKI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A bigger list of what's to come:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>HD graphics and pixel-perfect int scaling.</li>
<li>120 FPS mode for PC and current-gen consoles.</li>
<li>Brand-new campfire conversations, allowing you to mourn the deaths of party members even more.</li>
<li>New enemy and boss fights.</li>
<li>New quests featuring never before seen battles and dialogue.</li>
<li>Brand-new stories with multiple endings.</li>
<li>Updated battle systems introducing new “Warlord Skills,” updated timed attacks and UI overhaul.</li>
<li>New border art overlays for wide-screen viewing.</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can buy it right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/335670/LISA_The_Painful/" target="_blank">now from Steam</a>. The Definitive Edition will be a free update. It has Native Linux support and Valve rated it as Steam Deck Playable.</p>

      <title>The Last of Us Part I upgraded and now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Last of Us Part I is finally getting to a level that's actually good, and the latest update is out now including bumping it up to Steam Deck <a href="https://twitter.com/naughty_dog/status/1668682177964556288" target="_blank">Verified</a> status.</p>
<p>Quite a surprise to see, considering multiple parts of the game previously on Steam Deck would drop pretty hard below 30FPS and it was not good to play. There were also issues I showcased in previous videos, where it would completely lock up the system.</p>
<p>So what have they done? For Steam Deck specifically here's the main changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Overall improvements to performance while playing on Steam Deck.</li>
<li>Addressed a memory leak issue that could cause crashes.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where certain button prompts would be misaligned.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where changing (Options &gt; Graphics &gt; Graphics Preset) could trigger an intense lighting effect.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where in-game HUD did not match Steam Deck Performance Overlay FPS value.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could occur during loading screens.</li>
<li>Effects Density now defaults to Very Low instead of Low.</li>
<li>[Lakeside Resort] Fixed a crash that could occur at the start of a cutscene.</li>
<li>[Pittsburgh] Fixed a crash that could occur at certain checkpoints.</li>
<li>[The Outskirts] Fixed an issue where locked FPS could make it difficult to move pushable objects.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally they also added in a very low graphics preset, a new AI quality setting and a new dynamic light quality setting - all of which add up to make it a better fit on Steam Deck thanks to more tweaks. So it's not surprising it was able to get Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>What does that result in? Have a look in my video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="k4t21Z28Vgc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9a77c987f41ea274a0006b961249a0dd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/k4t21Z28Vgc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As noted in the video, unfortunately, there are still locations that will end up causing the RAM use to spike up to about 14.1GB drop the FPS down to basically nothing and completely lock up the Steam Deck. So that issue isn't <em>yet</em> solved but it's also an issue in <em>multiple</em> other games. Not everyone sees it (which can cause some confusion) but for Steam Deck and bigger games, it's quite problematic when it happens. <a href="https://github.com/CryoByte33/steam-deck-utilities" target="_blank">CryoUtilities</a> can work around it in some cases but not always. I'm hoping SteamOS 3.5 will help this issue and will be testing when Valve drop it into Preview.</p>

      <title>Portal Reloaded - The Cooperative Update is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for one more run through the testing chambers? The free and very popular mod Portal Reloaded just recently had The Cooperative Update <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1255980/announcements/detail/3703693931382658082" target="_blank">release</a>.</p>
<p>The game already expanded on the Portal idea a fair bit giving you a triple portal gun, with the third portal being a time portal so it all got a bit wibbly wobbly…time-y wimey. With this latest update it goes a little further adding in the new co-op mode with 20 new testing chambers, co-op time travel mechanics, a new narrative, new music and a whole bunch of improvements to single-player too. They've also added Finnish, Italian and Ukrainian subtitle options now too.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DH7uT5JBAn0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a81cc08bcaa4faf9207bd6854adaab78.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DH7uT5JBAn0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Available to play on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1255980/Portal_Reloaded/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, free for owners of Portal 2.</p>
<p>If you've played this latest update be sure to let me know what you think!</p>

      <title>SMITE now works on Linux and Steam Deck in the latest update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 14/06/23</strong>: after some <em>more</em> testing, one thing I have found on Steam Deck is that you <em>can</em> use the built-in gamepad controls. However, they only work correctly in battles. The entire menu / lobby and god selection seems to not work with gamepad controls. So you can use touch screen, emulated mouse input or hold the STEAM button to activate mouse cursor. Seems this is a problem even on Windows going back <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/lmrwnd/controller_doesnt_work_on_main_menu_or_god_select/" target="_blank">years</a>. It does <em>not</em> have "Full controller support" as advertised on Steam, only Partial.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Titan Forge Games and Hi-Rez Studios have updated their popular MOBA game SMITE, and with it an improvement to allow it to now work on Linux with Easy Anti-Cheat.</p>
<p>After playing a couple of games myself today, I can confirm it is working very nicely on my Fedora KDE 38 desktop. No performance issues anywhere that I could see and no kicking due to anti-cheat. This change to the Linux support status was mentioned officially in the <a href="https://www.smitegame.com/news/the-season-of-souls-10-6-update-notes/" target="_blank">release notes</a>, where they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SMITE will now run on Linux systems – Special thanks to the SMITE community for helping with this. A group of players in the r/smite discord made a big impact on this change</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>So that's some great news for gamers on Linux!</em></p>
<p>However, when it comes to the Steam Deck, there it's a bit different. SMITE's controller support doesn't seem to work properly as far as I could see. Even on desktop Linux just to double-check, it didn't work right there either. So you'll need to use a Community Layout in Steam Input that sets keyboard and mouse controls up or make a layout it yourself. And make sure you keep it set to keyboard and mouse with the <em>in-game</em> settings, otherwise it gets confused and just doesn't seem to work when in a battle. Trying out the most upvoted "Xbox One Style Controls" on Steam Deck - it actually worked quite well.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19467179251686677332gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19467179251686677332gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>A bit annoying needing to learn the binds manually but doable certainly and after a few games once you get the controls down, it really does seem to work quite well on Steam Deck (and really smooth on Medium settings too). But hopefully the game developer can fix the issue, or perhaps Valve can with Proton to get controller support directly working. Given how many thumbs up the community layout has though, it's likely controller support is iffy on Windows too with so many using the custom layouts.</p>
<p>You can see some Steam Deck footage in my below video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZRjtQSAlpkc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/75e632d7853720cff0b4b5ce69b49c3f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZRjtQSAlpkc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On desktop Linux, apart from the controller issue, no other problems. Everything works as expected and performance was again very good. It felt perfectly natural to click and play so nothing to really report there.</p>
<p>SMITE can be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/386360/SMITE/" target="_blank">found on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Nova Roma is a new city-builder from the Kingdoms and Castles developer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kingdoms and Castles is a great city-builder but it seems Lion Shield want to do something a bit different, so they've revealed Nova Roma. It was announced at the PC Gaming Show.</p>
<p>Clearly building upon the work they did for Kingdoms and Castles, they're aiming a bit higher here with a whole bunch of new mechanics but it still looks a bit familiar. You will need to adapt to heavy rains that will causing flooding and damage, keep up with the needs of all your citizens through food and entertainment and even deal with the gods. If the gods aren't happy with you, then you might find they unleash punishment on you. With it being based on a Roman theme it will explore the cultural, political, and military trials of the era.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="st6OjBam4tQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ae79120405e3ce5ffb71a6744b0104f6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/st6OjBam4tQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Innovative new water mechanics that can be manipulated via infrastructure.</li>
<li>Complex supply chains requiring constant expansion into resource-rich countryside.</li>
<li>Population needs that range from food and finery to coliseums and games to keep the people entertained.</li>
<li>Intricate city management through laws, edicts, and a tech tree.</li>
<li>A new day/night cycle.</li>
<li>Confront the dangers of the world, whether it be barbarians, gods, or the jealous machinations of the old empire.</li>
<li>Bigger, better maps, better terrain sculpting, and much more!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“We’re honored to be working with Lion Shield on its next project,” says Tim Bender, CEO of Hooded Horse. “Kingdoms &amp; Castles is a gold standard in city-building games, and we’re excited to publish the Roman-themed successor.”</p>
<p>“We’re pleased to work with Hooded Horse on Nova Roma, “ says Pete Angstadt, Creative Director and co-founder at Lion Shield. “We're building on everything we learned making Kingdoms and Castles and hope to create the best ancient Roman-era city builder we can, set in a world informed by both history and mythology."</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2426530/Nova_Roma/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>. It should have Linux support just like their previous game.</p>

      <title>After eating up lots of game studios Embracer Group set to close a bunch</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ah yes, game industry consolidation is great isn't it. What could possibly go wrong when one company acquires a ton of others and then screws up?</p>
<p>Embracer Group are known for going on acquiring sprees and currently own the likes of THQ Nordic, Coffee Stain, Gearbox, Plaion (formerly Koch Media), Saber Group and all the studios they control like Flying Wild Hog, Warhorse Studios, 3D Realms, New World Interactive, Tripwire Interactive, Aspyr Media, Beamdog and the list just goes on and on and on. Their own <a href="https://embracer.com/about/" target="_blank">website</a> lists 850 IPs either owned or controlled.</p>
<p>Well, they're having a few problems. They announced in a <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q4-january-march-2023-net-sales-increased-by-79-to-sek-9356-million/" target="_blank">previous revenue report</a> that a "major strategic partnership that has been negotiated for seven months will not materialize", this deal included "USD 2 billion in contracted development revenue over a period of six years" - so it was a pretty huge hit to their plans.</p>
<p>Now less than a month later they're <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-announces-comprehensive-restructuring-program-with-immediate-implementation/" target="_blank">announcing</a> a "comprehensive restructuring program", that will see amongst other things the closing of various currently undisclosed studios and terminating various projects. In an <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/open-letter-by-embracer-group-ceo-on-restructuring-program/" target="_blank">open letter</a> the CEO Lars Wingefors mentioned their plan will "transform us from our current heavy-investment-mode to a highly cash-flow generative business this year".</p>

      <title>Noxious Weeds: Prologue is a farming themed Vampire Survivors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You retired and wanted to farm but evil creatures just won't leave you in peace, now you have to defend your farm with the help of some veggies. Noxious Weeds: Prologue is the latest take on the craze of Vampire Survivors. Inspired also by the likes of Brotato and Risk of Rain the developer says.</p>
<p>A Prologue is out now so you can try the idea free and I definitely like what I'm seeing here. Seeing evil Avocados running around firing bullets at me, while my little carrot minions fired back was quite amusing. That was funny enough but then giant evil speedy sunflowers start running around and it just keeps getting better.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resist waves of enemies through nights and days.</li>
<li>20 minutes play sessions</li>
<li>A variety of upgradeable Tools to wipe out the swarm once and for all. Your belt can carry a maximum of 6; your choices will change the outcome.</li>
<li>Rescue and team up with the cutest companions. Some will heal you, while others will fight at your side.</li>
<li>Collect the perfect crop combination to achieve game-breaking builds.</li>
<li>Accessibility. Tweak monsters' health, speed, and damage to better suit your play style.</li>
</ul>
<p>Prologue content</p>
<ul>
<li>16 Tools to choose from.</li>
<li>2 Playable characters.</li>
<li>46 Harvest items for incredible builds.</li>
<li>3 Different companions.</li>
<li>Spring season difficulty.</li>
<li>1 Character and 3 crops unlockable through Steam Achievements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It has a Native Linux build, although using OpenGL by default which crashed for me. However running it with "-force-vulkan" as launch option made it work perfectly. The developer is looking into it. <strong>Update</strong>: the developer is now using Vulkan by default.</p>

      <title>Valheim gets upgraded to improve performance and fix major bugs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Iron Gate have now released the latest <a href="https://valheim.com/news/patch-0-216-9/" target="_blank">update</a> to Valheim, their co-op open world survival game and it should be good for all players. This is not a content upgrade but rather a tech upgrade, aimed at just improving the overall experience.</p>
<p>They said it includes a lot of work on the underlying systems of the game, to improve game and network performance. You should also see improved loading times and smaller save file sizes. They said they "hope that these changes will be a significant improvement for some of you".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/417518311686580005gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/417518311686580005gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here's what's changed in patch 0.216.9:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Midsummer items enabled (Maypole &amp; Midsummer crown)</li>
<li>Many performance, memory and networking improvements for both new/unexplored and old/explored worlds</li>
<li>World save file size greatly reduced</li>
<li>Fixed endless loading of save manager when switching tabs too fast</li>
<li>World save files that are corrupt, have load errors or have missing meta files can now be restored from the most recent backup directly from within the Select World menu by pressing the "Start" button.</li>
<li>Save file stability &amp; issues fixed</li>

      <title>Klei Entertainment announced space survival game Dread Pilots</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I love pretty much everything Klei Entertainment make and Dread Pilots looks great, a space survival game where you're exploring a mysterious and hostile pocket universe called the Dread. From the creators of Don't Starve, Griftlands and Oxygen Not Included - you know it's likely to be good.</p>
<p>"The Dread is a pocket dimension somewhere between deep space and a nightmare. You face mutated, carnivorous plant life, mind-bending anomalies, living computers, fanatical cults, space vampires and more as you traverse its many regions in a desperate search for resources and allies. Explore dark infected caverns, soar past glistening technological landscapes, and navigate chaotic mineral fields, all animated in Klei Entertainment's signature hand-drawn 2D style."</p>
<p>Definitely feeling a fair bit of Sunless Seas / Sunless Skies in the gameplay here, check it out:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OEnKDOZMf8U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/66f92c3bbe447f3769f41e3aade82a59.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OEnKDOZMf8U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>When it comes to Native Linux support, in a reply on <a href="https://twitter.com/klei/status/1668003643700940800" target="_blank">Twitter</a> they mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like our other titles we'll explore that once we've got a bit farther on PC development to focus our development team, but exploring that is on our radar especially with growth of Steam Deck popularity. Too early to fully test and commit at the moment, but it will be explored!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll be following this along with great interest, hopefully either way it will work on Linux (and Steam Deck) at least with Proton there's a good chance regardless.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1766500/Dread_Pilots/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Unsettling first-person exploration game Interior Worlds gets a Linux version</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Interior Worlds is a strange and unsettling liminal spaces game that arms you with a mysterious camera. It's quite atmospheric and full of secrets to discover. They recently put up a Native Linux build which didn't initially work due to some missing bits (Unity being odd) but they've now managed to solve the issues and so it works out of the box.</p>
<p>"Welcome to Interior Worlds; an ambient and unsettling first-person exploration game where you'll dive into strange, yet familiar spaces. Temporary gaps and portals we cross at some point or another - now yearning for a closer look. A look that can only be seen properly through the lens of an SLR camera."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mSHPkTUvMSg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6d78c17789b60e22d9c1bc5ee85dc89a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mSHPkTUvMSg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Use your vintage and mysterious analog camera to capture stunning photographs of environmental anomalies throughout each space. Keep a sharp eye out while traversing the more... ominous locations.</li>
<li>Track and share your own in-game catalog of photos, timestamped and pre-filtered with subtle layers of maximum liminal crust.</li>
<li><strong><em>Ten unique thresholds to traverse</em></strong>. A roadside hotel, empty movie theater, dying mall, and many more. Every environment is hand-crafted in a loving throwback to late 90's and early 00's graphics.</li>
<li><strong><em>A multitude of ways to capture photos</em></strong>. Adjust zoom levels, increase/decrease lens focus, tilt left/right for a dutch angle, and more. Create perturbing compositions in hundreds of ways.</li>
<li><strong><em>Unparalleled interactivity</em></strong>. Activate vending machines, phones, sinks, televisions, or simply turn the lights on or off for a different photo-moment vibe.</li>
<li><strong><em>Immersive and unsettling soundscape</em></strong>. Melt into an eerie mix of low, rumbling drones and soft, stretched pads during the journey.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2207970/Interior_Worlds/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>. Also <a href="https://sodaraptor.itch.io/interior-worlds" target="_blank">itch.io</a> but I don't think that version is up to date.</p>

      <title>You&#39;ll be building your own dungeons in Quest Master</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Quest Master is an upcoming dungeon-designing sandbox adventure from Skydevilpalm, Julian Creutz and Apogee Entertainment.</p>
<p>This one will allow you to be creative, as it's as much about building dungeons as exploring them. Taking inspiration from retro 16-bit classic dungeon crawlers but giving it a modern edge. You'll be able to face various dungeons alone or with up to 3 friends in local co-op.</p>
<p>With the built in level creator you'll be able to make anything from simple dungeons to fully overworld connected quests. Making it as easy or difficult as you like, you'll be able to create "lava-filled caverns, mountainous overworlds, grassy forests, desert dunes, and more" and even create your own little narrative with NPCs and all sorts.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NX-J9kBKIs0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9be1deae6b76de04904790886dc16feb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NX-J9kBKIs0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“Quest Master hands over the controls to the players to make whatever they want,” said Julian Creutz, Lead Developer of Quest Master. “The possibilities are endless, and we can’t wait to see all kinds of wacky dungeons and full-blown adventures players are able to come up with.”</p>
<p>Sounds like one to watch!</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094070/Quest_Master/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>. It will have Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>eXtremeRate put up their Steam Deck custom shell for pre-order</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready to ship around the middle of June, eXtremeRate have now put up pre-orders for those of you brave enough to mod the entire shell of the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>The current models they're offering right now are Clear Atomic Purple $35.99, Clear Custom (no colouring) $35.99, White $45.99, Clear Slate Black $35.99 and Chameleon Purple Blue $45.99. Seems like they're quite reasonably priced and they sure do look great.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10304364021686310761gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10304364021686310761gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>A reminder though: it's not easy to do, and requires taking apart pretty much the whole of your Steam Deck. The guide over on <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Steam+Deck+Front+Shell+Replacement/149125" target="_blank">iFixit</a> shows just how long a process it is and they labelled it as "Difficult".</p>
<p>You can see them all on the <a href="https://extremerate.com/collections/steam-deck-shells" target="_blank">eXtremeRate website</a>.</p>
<p>The other company <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/a-fully-transparent-steam-deck-mod-seems-close-to-reality/" target="_blank">about to do it is JSAUX</a>, although we don't know when it will be sometime soon. Will you be picking one of these up to try and mod your Steam Deck?</p>

      <title>A Void Hope looks like a fun atmospheric adventure with a synthwave soundtrack</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Elden Pixels who made Alwa's Awakening and Alwa's Legacy have announced their next game, A Void Hope. An atmospheric puzzle adventure with a slick sounding synthwave soundtrack not to be missed.</p>
<p>"A Void Hope takes you on an atmospheric puzzle platforming adventure to find a cure for a collapsed city. Follow the story of a tormented couple as they try to decipher reality from nightmares and overcome the shadowy threats lurking in the dark."</p>
<p>Have to admit after watching the below trailer, I'm quite hyped by this one:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="D3K4n9FnXa0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e6bb2f527b486a4eecff846027430067.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/D3K4n9FnXa0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>Getting an almost Stranger Things vibe from it.</em></p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>An immersive experience - Solve puzzles, find items and progress through the story in this world brimming with mysterious ambiance.</li>
<li>Something lurks in the shadows - Crisp retro aesthetics combined with atmospheric lighting shows a world in darkness but with small slivers of hope.</li>
<li>Avoid combat, embrace exploration - Delve into an adventure filled with danger and make your way through the city avoiding the threats that come your way.</li>
<li>A haunting soundtrack - Composed by synthwave mastermind Waveshaper, an eerie and evocative landscape of music accompanies your every step.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A demo should be available for Steam Next Fest later this month. So be sure to check it out.</p>

      <title>Competitive party game Unspottable gets online play</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Unspottable was a lot of fun at release, giving you competitive hide and seek amongst the crowd gameplay but local multiplayer was pretty limiting. Now though, it has online play!</p>
<p>Had a lot of fun playing this with family but now perhaps more of you will have a look at it. The idea is simple, you each control a character that's the same as a bunch of wandering NPCs. It's the job of each play to figure out who is who, give them a little jab with their fist and hopefully get it correct - otherwise you'll need to quickly blend in with the crowd again. It's pretty chaotic and entertaining.</p>
<p>This big upgrade for the party game has a new trailer to celebrate online play:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZNkf4GFZ33c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dcae12c6b5c0e6d39a64464ad35317db.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZNkf4GFZ33c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Fun for everyone:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple controls: easy to learn, hard to master.</li>
<li>Competition based on observation rather than action.</li>
<li>Tutorial to explain game mechanics to first time players.</li>
<li>Fun feedback. Ragdoll / Endgame nicknames based on stats / Camera shakes / Funny animations and designs.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Competitive party game:</p>

      <title>Overkill drops Linux support for PAYDAY 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PAYDAY 2 came to Linux officially back in 2016 but as of today they've removed support for it, so it will no longer see updates on the Native Linux version.</p>
<p>They're also bringing the game to the Epic Games Store, although not exclusive, as it will remain on Steam and PAYDAY 3 will also be on Steam. As for why they're removing official Linux support they <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/218620/announcements/detail/3667665767271115729" target="_blank">said this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that Linux users will not receive this update or any following updates coming to PC. In addition, Linux players will be unable to matchmake with other PC clients following this update.<br/>
We tried to find a solution, but ultimately found it unfeasible due to the Linux version being on an older version of the PAYDAY 2 engine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It does, however, still work quite well with the Windows version via <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a> on desktop Linux <em>and</em> is Steam Deck Verified against the Windows version in Proton. So while it's a loss of support for their Native build, it's still fully playable on Linux.</p>
<p>We've seen this a few times over the years, due to a mixture of reasons but the ultimate reason is pretty much the same as always — Linux and Steam Deck together hold a less than <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">2% user share</a> on Steam. For many developers, right now, it's not worth the extra overhead to continue Native support until there's more of a market.</p>

      <title>Check out the new trailer for Cyber Knights: Flashpoint a squad-tactics heist RPG</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Currently in development from Trese Brothers who made Star Traders: Frontiers and Templar Battleforce, the upcoming Cyber Knights: Flashpoint looks exciting.</p>
<p>What is it? At it's core it's a fusion of turn-based tactical combat, with base building all about heists in a cyberpunk setting. Previously funded on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tresebrothers/cyber-knights" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, they're gearing up for a public demo in Steam Next Fest due later this month but to get you ready they've released a new trailer showing off all their work. As a big fan of anything resembling XCOM, I'm rather excited to get a chance to try this one finally.</p>

<li><strong>Power-Player Strategy</strong>: Balance factions, favors, reputation and more. Rivals, fixers, arms dealers and corporate big shots... who you work for, who you fail or betray, all of it can open and close opportunities for you. Watch your heat, and try to make sure more people owe you than the other way around.</li>
<li><strong>Endless Builds</strong>: Experiment with endless combinations of talents, multi-classing, cyberware, weapons and gear to build the perfect team.</li>

      <title>GuliKit reveal an upgraded anti-drift thumbstick module for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While the Steam Deck is a fantastic handheld devices, there's always going to be ways to make it better and GuliKit just revealed an upgraded version of their anti-drift thumbstick mod.</p>
<p>There's actually two different versions of the Steam Deck thumbsticks, and previously GuliKit had one for each but now they've combined them into one single unit. All you need to do is flick a little switch on the back of the new version, to point to which model your Steam Deck came with - nice.</p>
<p>On top of that GuliKit say this new version requires no soldering as it comes complete <em>and</em> it uses 50% less power compared to their previous version, so it sounds easier than ever to do the replacement.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7322363171686222321gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7322363171686222321gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For getting a bit longer life out of your Steam Deck with intense gaming sessions, this is one mod that seems like it may be really worth looking into.</p>
<p>You can read more about it on their <a href="https://www.gulikit.com/productinfo/1026071.html" target="_blank">product page</a>. No exact word yet on when they will be come available to order so keep an eye on their <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/stores/GULIkit/page/FB794F67-E7B2-4C62-BA0D-5A6F42CABC95" target="_blank">Amazon</a> page. Their <a href="https://twitter.com/GuliKitDesign/status/1666738962323447809" target="_blank">Twitter</a> account simply said they're "ready" and they don't do sales directly from their own website.</p>

      <title>Fantasy buddy-cop RPG &#39;My Familiar&#39; looks great with a demo up</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Up for trying out a new buddy-cop RPG? My Familiar has a fantastic art-style and really looks like something that could be a bit special.</p>
<p>With a lighthearted take this fantasy buddy cop RPG is set in a world filled full of trash, and everything looks like it's falling apart. The art style is really what suckered me in here though as it reminds me of some real classics. Going straight onto my ever-growing wishlist of games, and it seems like it might have pretty good sound-track to go with it if the trailer is anything to go by.</p>
<p>The trailer looks pretty wild:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="KP3cg_C9g8g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/635d9208e4e43ab241d9ccdd2ffcd89e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/KP3cg_C9g8g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>How the developer describes it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yo! Welcome to 'MY FAMILIAR'.<br/>
In this RPG, wake up as a fresh familiar on the mean streets of Wish City, where the denizens are dark and corruption is king...<br/>
Fight, flee, and aggressively rap your way through a vibrant inner city gauntlet, chock full of dysfunctional demons, in flashy, over the top, turn-based battles.<br/>
<br/>
Cast of 6 playable familiars include:<br/>
A self-loathing party fowl...<br/>
a disembodied diva...<br/>
a remorseless sausage thief...<br/>
a totally jacked, luchador duck...<br/>
a self-righteous robber-baroness...<br/>
and some sort of weird, purple rabbit/goblin/rat thing...<br/>
<br/>
Cool, I guess?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do love how developers on Steam can pretty much write anything as their description.</p>
<p>Try out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1502750/My_Familiar/" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a>. There's a Native Linux build available too.</p>

<p>The best way to play Minecraft on desktop Linux and Steam Deck, especially for modding, is with the Prism Launcher see <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/minecraft-on-steam-deck-guide-with-prism-launcher-and-gamepad-support/" target="_blank">my previous guide for setting it up on Steam Deck</a>. However, the <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download" target="_blank">official launcher</a> works quite well if you're not doing any modding. You might also want to know about a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/curseforge-and-bukkit-get-hit-with-malware-for-minecraft-mods/" target="_blank">recent security incident</a> for modding but anyone playing without mods are fine.</p>

      <title>Hearts of Iron IV: Arms Against Tyranny to focus on Scandinavia and Finland</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Scandinavia and Finland are a big focus in the newly announced Hearts of Iron IV: Arms Against Tyranny expansion releasing later this year.</p>
<p>Arms Against Tyranny is the latest immersion pack for Hearts of Iron IV, Paradox Interactive's best-selling grand strategy wargame about the years around World War II. In Arms Against Tyranny, you will encounter new alternate histories and National Focus Trees for the nations of Scandinavia and Finland, with a heavy emphasis on the Winter War and Finland's struggle against Soviet invasion. </p>
<p>Features of <em>Hearts of Iron IV: Arms Against Tyranny</em> include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Finnish National Focus Tree: </strong>Walk the diplomatic tightrope of a democratic nation trapped between threats, develop a capable defensive army, or pursue alternate historical paths of collaboration with the neighboring tyrants.</li>
<li><strong>New Swedish National Focus Tree: </strong>Resource rich and fiercely independent, Sweden can be the center of a unified Scandinavian resistance, or a game-changing ally in the ongoing battle of ideologies.</li>
<li><strong>New Danish and Norwegian Focus Trees: </strong>With the benefit of hindsight, can you prepare these small nations for the storm of war that is about to wash upon their shores?</li>
<li><strong>Military Industrial Organizations: </strong>Customize your armaments industry by encouraging national corporations to specialize in the types of weapons and technology you desire for your armed forces.</li>
<li><strong>International Arms Market: </strong>Become the quartermaster of the world by selling arms and equipment to the warring nations, receiving civilian factory capacity in return.</li>
<li><strong>And more: </strong>New unit art, 10 new songs, customization of Special Forces units and greater divisional specialization.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can get a good look at all the improvements coming in their <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/arms-against-tyranny-historical-finland.1588882/" target="_blank">new developer diary</a>. As always it will be accompanied by a free upgrade for all players named Stella Polaris. They're not giving out an exact date anywhere I can see on when it will be released as this is just the initial reveal.</p>
<p>Hearts of Iron IV also just celebrated its 7th anniversary, and clearly it's still going strong with it regularly seeing over 40,000 players on at a time each day making it one of the most popular Paradox games.</p>
<p>You can buy Hearts of Iron IV on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/hearts-of-iron-iv-cadet-edition?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/394360/Hearts_of_Iron_IV/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>GOG made it simpler to publish on their store, plus their Pride Month celebration</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="http://gog.com" target="_blank">GOG</a> announced today they've taken a step towards making it easier to get games onto their store, and more clear on what they won't accept.</p>
<p>They've launched <a href="https://www.gog.com/submit-your-game" target="_blank">a new form</a> for developers and publishers of all kind to fill out, who wish to have their games released onto GOG. Over email they told me the entire process is simplified, with it offering up "more context and focusing on the most important aspects to ensure our team gets all the necessary information from the get go".</p>
<p>Historically, GOG has been a little odd in what they accepted and denied to be placed onto their store, I've seen various Twitter posts from developers over the years frustrated on it when GOG denied their game for no real reason. GOG is still much more curated versus the likes of Steam but perhaps this is set to change a little.</p>
<p>Additionally, the GOG team have put up a <a href="https://www.gog.com/blog/benefits-of-releasing-your-game-on-gog-a-guide-for-indie-game-developers/" target="_blank">dedicated page</a> going over what they say are the benefits of releasing on GOG.</p>
<p>You can see the types of games GOG say they won't accept <a href="https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/11382878039197-Releasing-your-game-on-GOG-FAQ?product=gog" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>In other GOG news they're also doing their own thing for Pride Month, and a little differently this time too. Instead of just one game collection, they've <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/2023_gog_pride_month_collection" target="_blank">made an entire page</a> to highlight games across various categories including Masculine romance representation, Female romance representation, Featuring transgender characters and more.</p>
<p>GOG's Summer Sale will also begin at the end of the week.</p>

      <title>Roguelite vehicle combat game REDLINE CROOKS is pure chaos </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>REDLINE CROOKS from developer Alexander Golke is a top-down 2D roguelite about smashing vehicles into more vehicles. It's pure unfiltered chaos and I love the idea.</p>
<p>Combining together elements of a roguelite with completely ridiculous vehicle speed, it allows you to charge through entire walls of the map to then smash into other vehicles to build up a score and money for upgrades. Mechanically it's seriously over the top but once you've played a few minutes of it, the idea really comes into its own. You'll face all sorts, there's even tanks.</p>
<p>Have a look at the trailer to see how crazy it is:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4XI7-cCOPdE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/55bb6e933281cdf09ded787012b1d5c0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4XI7-cCOPdE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Pick one out of 9 playable convicts, each with distinct playstyles and character-specific upgrades.</li>
<li>Use the Boost to reach dangerously high speeds and blast through walls and enemies alike at the cost of your health.</li>
<li>Slam, blow up, launch, ram or otherwise destroy anyone looking to get you back behind bars, and be rewarded with cash and health.</li>
<li>Build an arsenal of powerful upgrades purchasable from the ever-trustworthy shopkeeper - there are over 100 items for you to mix and match, making every run unique.</li>
<li>Perform well to rank up, ramping up both the difficulty and the rewards you get using a God Hand-inspired difficulty scaling system.</li>
<li>Master the intricate mechanics and make it to the top of the online leaderboard, or just have a good time in this easy to play, hard to master experience.</li>
<li>Jam out to an awesome, original digital-fusion soundtrack by <em>father p</em>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That's going right onto my wishlist. The demo worked great on my desktop Fedora KDE 38 install too. On my Steam Deck it was pretty much a perfect experience there too, this could be an ideal game for Steam Deck fans to play on the go that will keep the battery going for a while too because it's really easy on the system.</p>
<p>My favourite is easily the character that drives what looks like a forklift, that can pick up other cars and throw them around. As shown in the below gif, which was actually taken from my testing of it on Steam Deck:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/398593091686143449gol1.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/398593091686143449gol1.gif"/></a><br/>
<em>Glorious</em>!</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 8-4 is out now with game fixes and other upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton8-4" target="_blank">GE-Proton 8-4</a> is the latest release of the community-made compatibility layer for Steam Deck and desktop Linux gaming. Here's what's new and changed.</p>
<p>Usual reminder: this is the version of Proton made and supported by the community, for the times where it <em>may</em> work better than the official Valve Proton, but it comes with less testing and may have its own issues. You don't often actually need it. See more in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">my Steam Play and Proton guide</a>.</p>

<li>protonfixes: fix for Alter Ego (Thanks marianoag)</li>
<li>protonfixes: remove no longer needed fall guys easyanticheat_x64.so workaround (Thanks Corben)</li>
<li>added fix for northstar launch arguement not working (Thanks Jan <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/pull/6555" target="_blank">ValveSoftware#6555</a>)</li>

<li>updated dxvk to latest git</li>
<li>updated vkd3d-proton to latest git</li>
<li>updated dxvk-nvapi to latest release</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>While the Fall Guys fix was removed, there's still this note about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Notes: On Fall Guys when the Epic Online Services installer is running on a clean prefix, you must hit cancel on step 2/2, otherwise Fall Guys will tell you the game is missing files and force you to exit.</p>
</blockquote>

      <title>Bullet hell game Survivors of the Dawn features mini campaign, text events</title>
      <author>Etienne Mahler</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><em>“Embark on a glorious odyssey where survival depends on tactically combining diverse weapon classes to annihilate the hordes. Beware of your choices traveling through the stars, the next combat can determine your destiny.”</em></p>
<p>Survivors of the Dawn – a game I stumbled upon by chance on Twitter – can best be described as a classic bullet hell or horde survival game.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="S10wcDdE_Kg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3ccafecd14a1ef7c3b47f36c9433e675.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/S10wcDdE_Kg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's important to note that what you’ll read and see here is not the finished game or even a demo, but an early playtest version currently provided by the developer for free. The game is currently in version 0.3, so in its alpha stage. I've tried the game on Linux Mint 21.1 with Proton Experimental and the Steam Deck without any tinkering, despite no official Linux support.</p>
<p>Survivors of the Dawn comes from the small studio indieGiant in Turkey. Like many other games of its kind, Survivors of the Dawn follows the typical gameplay loop of slaying monsters, levelling up, and slaying even more monsters... until we eventually run out of steam or hit points.</p>
<p>Despite sounding simple and familiar so far (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/a-genre-is-born-horde-games/" target="_blank">like many other horde bullet hell games</a>), Survivors of the Dawn brings a few fresh ideas that could set it apart from its competitors.</p>
<p>What's already in Survivors of the Dawn?</p>
<p>Like most other games of its kind, Survivors of the Dawn is about purely our survival from hordes of monsters. It doesn't really have a story – and I'm uncertain if the game will ever have one. However, in this type of game, the story doesn't play a major role, so I'll skip that part and talk about the gameplay instead.</p>
<p>As for the core gameplay, the playtest version currently only features one main weapon, a shotgun, which is a bit disappointing. So, I hope the developer upgrades this aspect before the game enters early access in July, as planned. </p>
<p>And yes, according to the Steam page, the current version of the game is just a glimpse of what's planned for Survivors of the Dawn. The developer intends to add more content over time, including additional weapon classes, synergies between power ups, randomly generated sectors, playable characters, and extra game modes. Currently, there is only one mode, but a second survival mode is already visible in the main menu.</p>
<p>Besides the initial main weapon, there are some interesting upgrades we can select and improve as we level up. These include a small striker drone as a companion, which constantly takes care of our enemies and becomes powerful at higher levels, exploding kamikaze spiders, rocket and grenade launchers, orbiting laser barriers, and lightsabers à la Star Wars.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12321016281686118041gol14998.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12321016281686118041gol14998.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>And, if you already thought our protagonist looks a bit like a Stormtrooper from Star Wars, I agree – that was my first thought too.</p>
<p>Despite these obvious design inspirations – as well as gameplay inspirations from Vampire Survivors and Slay The Spire – Survivors of the Dawn also brings a few unique ideas that I haven't seen in other games of the genre.</p>
<p>The game features a kind of mini-campaign consisting of individual levels connected through a space map. We move forward with our spaceship and choose the next level, small text events, or a shop. The text events grant us either advantages like additional credits or disadvantages like starting with half of our hit points. It's unclear how much these text events contribute to a story, though.</p>
<p>In the current playtest version of the game, the campaign map is still relatively simple, but I spoke to the developer on Twitter, and he mentioned plans to expand it in the future. I really hope he does because I find this feature quite cool. Not only does the map create a sense of connected missions, but progress between individual missions also carries over. That means the weapons and upgrades we obtained in one level will carry over to the next one – and the same goes for the upgrades bought in the shop, of course.</p>
<p>Until the full version of the game is released, I hope some points will be improved. For example, currently it's quite difficult to regenerate hit points. There is a power-up between missions that allows us to regenerate hit points when we deal damage at the cost of 70% of our hit points, but it's not very effective. Besides that power-up, there are small green orbs on the map, but they are so rare that even with extreme caution, I hardly obtained any.</p>
<p>The overall difficulty of the game is acceptable. Although I initially found it somewhat easy, I haven't managed to complete the boss level entirely yet.</p>
<p>Currently, Survivors of the Dawn doesn't have controller support, but the developer stated that it will be added. This also means that the game isn't really playable on the Steam Deck at the moment.</p>
<p>However, I still took a look at the game on the Steam Deck, and it runs quite well already. In fact, despite the lack of controller support, you can already move around, but there is no way to control the crosshair except through the touchpad. Nevertheless, at this point, I would assume that Survivors of the Dawn will be playable on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21306752021686117919gol14998.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21306752021686117919gol14998.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The official demo is expected to be released on Steam no later than June 16, with the early access version coming in July. I can't provide exact information about the price of the game during early access presently, but I think it will be reasonable.</p>
<p>If you're interested in trying the game yourself, you can find the game on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2285630/Survivors_of_the_Dawn/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. There, you can either sign up for the ongoing playtest or, if you're reading this later, download the demo or the full game.</p>

      <title>CurseForge and Bukkit get hit with malware for Minecraft mods</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just a bit of a PSA here for anyone diving into Minecraft modding, as recently there's been a problem on both CurseForge and Bukkit with malware.</p>
<p>There's been a lot of reports on this and the situation has been moving pretty quickly, but for now you should stay away from downloading any Minecraft mods from both platforms. The issue affects both Windows and Linux.</p>
<p>From the report on <a href="https://hackmd.io/B46EYzKXSfWSF35DeCZz9A" target="_blank">hackmd</a> and the <a href="https://prismlauncher.org/news/cf-compromised-alert/" target="_blank">Prism Launcher</a> post that references it, it seems a bunch of compromised accounts were used to update quite a number of popular mods to insert malicious files. According to the report the issue goes back multiple months, so it's not exactly clear just how wide-spread it truly is and work is ongoing by many people to figure it all out.</p>
<p>This malware seems to work across multiple stages, and both links above show you how you can check to see if you've been affected, which needs you to go hunting in a few places because it will make new files and folders on your system. However, if you were using the Prism Launcher via Flatpak on Linux the malware likely would have failed to work due to the sandboxing. Either way, checking is a good idea.</p>
<p><em>For a good place to download mods you can look to <a href="https://modrinth.com/" target="_blank">Modrinth</a> and the <a href="https://prismlauncher.org/" target="_blank">Prism Launcher</a>.</em></p>

      <title>Amnesia: The Bunker is stressful horror done the right way</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Amnesia: The Bunker is the latest in a series of horror games from Frictional Games, one that feels a lot like Alien: Isolation with a WW1 theme. Definitely not a game for the faint of heart — like me. Wow, this was a stressful game to play. Note: key provided by Evolve.</p>
<p>The main game, aside from the intro, is set in a mysterious bunker during the first World War. The intro is really just a quick way to show you the controls but it's nicely done and really sets up the rest of the game, before you're told on-screen that you're now on your own and you awaken in The Bunker.</p>
<p>Here, something clearly terrible has happened (aside from the war setting of course), with no one left and the exit blocked your main objective is to get out alive by hopefully finding a way to blow a hole through some rubble. Easier said than done though, because you're being hunted by…something.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5V3Si-MbUao"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5389650448fde66defc478ad109d782f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5V3Si-MbUao" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For anyone who has played a game from Frictional Games before, you'll feel right at home. Poor choice of words probably, nothing about The Bunker is even remotely <em>homely</em>. Mechanically it has all the familiar bits like pulling open cabinets, drawers, picking up objects and throwing them, carefully opening doors and peaking around as you panic and run back in and lock the door because you heard a noise. Yup, it's a Frictional Amnesia game that's for sure. There's plenty of tweaks and upgrades they've included here though for The Bunker, with a fair bit more you can experiment with and some destruction to be had too.</p>
<p>Currently, I <em>cannot</em> recommend it on <em>Steam Deck </em>though. While it does perform well with a 40Hz lock with some tweaked settings, it has a rather glaring and immersion breaking graphical glitch with your left hand. Something you see constantly too, with glitches moving all over the hand it's just really off-putting. Your eyes just get drawn to it and it's annoying. Once that is fixed though, it would be an easy recommendation to buy and play there. I'm not entirely clear if it's a Proton bug, a game issue or an AMD GPU driver bug with Mesa but until that's solved, I would wait.</p>
<p>Valve actually gave it a Steam Deck "Playable" rating officially noting this problem and yes, it's playable, but I wouldn't say good enough with such a clear graphical glitch in your face for most of the game. Once I see it's solved, I'll let you know.</p>
<p>For <em>desktop</em> Linux though tested on Fedora KDE 38, at least with NVIDIA and Proton Experimental, the experience has been great. Performance is not an issue at all, apart from some loading bumps when going into specific sections it was an almost entirely silky-smooth 60FPS on max settings. You won't get any more than 60FPS right now either, as the game has a max locked FPS option of 60.</p>
<p>What's interesting here is the generator system. You <em>can</em> light up pretty much the entire bunker with a generator, which quickly becomes your new best friend. The problem is, it's very thirsty and will drink through fuel very quickly. So you need to be resourceful in finding enough fuel to power it up and get what you want done before it craps out on you - again. Especially so as your little wind-up hand-light is pretty rubbish because <em>of course it is</em>. Your torch is also very loud to wind it up because <em>of course it is</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2300098921686079406gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2300098921686079406gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The amount of times my torch ran out while I was in a room trying to figure out what to do, and as I began pulling the wire to power it up only to hear some crawling and growling, and nearly jumped out of my chair I've honestly lost count. The tension and foreboding atmosphere is so thick I could sit and hide inside it. This feeling of dread and panic only increases when you accidentally set off a trap, or catch a glimpse of the creature. On top of that there's minor tremors too, which really keeps that feeling of unease going even in quiet moments.</p>
<p>At one point the creature came at me when I made just a tiny bit too much noise, so I threw a grenade at it and somehow also set off a fire strap behind me and just my luck - the grenade completely missed. I was officially trapped between two horrifying ends. Death number…I don't even know anymore.</p>
<p>Everything about it is tense. Even when going through areas you already know, because you just never know when the noise you make is too much and where this <em>thing</em> will appear from. Certainly doesn't help with the manual save system, because I was often creeping back to it.</p>
<p>I like that you're actually given something resembling an arsenal here, so you're not entirely helpless, just <em>mostly </em>helpless. You have a gun, although ammo is limited and it won't kill the creature, only delay your probable demise. You have grenades, fuel that you can do some interesting things with, meat to try and get its attention and more. Death isn't the end here too, as long as you have a good recent save, just a setback on your path to freedom. The key is to be a quiet as possible, that gun and anything else noisy is a last resort.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8184642541686080419gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8184642541686080419gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>One thing I ended up doing is constantly barricading myself into a room I wanted to search — <em>and</em> covering up any holes. Just for that tiny extra peace of mind that it might have a little bit of a struggle to get to me, giving me a chance to get away. This is another part of what I love about Frictional and their physics and what makes The Bunker interesting, that you can move around various objects (and often you <em>need</em> to) as well using objects combined together or thrown around to break stuff to help you get somewhere.</p>
<p>As you go through it, you'll find all sorts of notes and photographs to collect. This is where you will gradually piece together the events leading up to where you are now. I won't go into all the details of course, because <em>spoilers</em>, but it's pretty easy to understand about digging big tunnels and unearthing something horrible. While the setting, theme and visuals are all quite fantastic and no complaints there, this game isn't really about the story at all it's the journey and how many different ways you can die trying to escape.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18872953411686081299gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18872953411686081299gol1.jpg"/></a><em>A little shot I like to call "nope".</em></p>
<p>I really can't see a reason <em>not</em> to suggest you pick it up if you're after a new horror experience on desktop. This is where I spent 99% of my time with it and there it really was an experience I won't be forgetting any time soon. The constant panic I felt, as I walked through dimly lit and often completely dark corridors in a very claustrophobic environment — yeah, that's going to stick with me. For Steam Deck, sit on it until the graphical glitch is solved.</p>
<p>I played most of it with bright sunlight (aside from replaying for some screenshots here), and it was still terrifying me and making me jump constantly. I'm not built for these types of games but I still somehow enjoy them. Apparently I just enjoy inflicting emotional pain on myself and if you do too then go grab it. For the absolute best experience put on some headphones, and dim the lights.</p>
<p><em>Once again Frictional have proven they know how to do horror.</em></p>

      <title>A fully transparent Steam Deck mod is on the way</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We've had transparent backplates for the Steam Deck for a while now but what about the front? Well, they're on the way from two different companies.</p>
<p>Firstly, <a href="https://jsaux.com/" target="_blank">JSAUX</a>, who make the most popular transparent backplates (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/jsaux-makes-more-steam-deck-backplate-colours-available/" target="_blank">I showed off one here</a>) are working on their own fully transparent case for the Steam Deck. From speaking to JSAUX they told me this will be available in Krystal, Purple and Brown and they told me the backplate has a new design too as they've added new ventilation and improved the heat sink as well. Their first teaser posted to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/JSAUX/comments/13y957e/jsaux_updates_and_future_plans/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> can be seen below:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13191305301685959562gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13191305301685959562gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>In that same post, JSAUX also teased they're coming up with "several" new RGB-related stuff to make your Steam Deck look even more wild. So I'm very curious to see what they're cooking up, especially as I thought their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/the-omnicase-2-from-jsaux-is-a-quality-usb-c-hub-worth-grabbing/" target="_blank">OmniCase 2 Pro</a> was fantastic.</p>
<p>On top of that, JSAUX just today showed off and sent me over a little teaser clip of what they will look like:</p>
<div class="ckeditor-html5-video" style="text-align: center;">
<video controls="controls" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8350911171686068639gol1.mp4"></video>
</div>
<p>Looks really nice! Glad to see they've looked to improve the backplate at the same time.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The other is <a href="https://extremerate.com/" target="_blank">eXtremeRate</a>, another company that makes various gaming accessories. They've begun teasing their own full shell for the Steam Deck, including transparent options but we don't know much more than what they showed in a brief GIF on <a href="https://twitter.com/ExtremeRate/status/1664649958606372867" target="_blank">Twitter</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6176038981685959433gol1.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6176038981685959433gol1.gif"/></a></p>
<p>I wouldn't mind grabbing some backplates from eXtremeRate when they're available, to compare with what JSAUX have, especially since eXtremeRate don't seem to have the heat sink on the back which can get quite hot on the JSAUX versions.</p>
<p>Just a reminder: if you're going to take apart your Steam Deck - make sure you take out your Micro SD card. Don't snap it like me and many others ended up doing at some point. It's really easy to forget - so try not to, or you'll be sad and out of pocket.</p>
<p>The main issue here is that changing the frontplate is pretty intense, as you need to take the whole thing apart. Not something that's particularly easy and even iFixit note it down as "Difficult" to do in <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Steam+Deck+Front+Shell+Replacement/149125" target="_blank">their guide</a>. There's a fair amount you could mess up but still, no doubt many will go for it because it looks awesome.</p>

      <title>Dead Cells hits over 10 million sales</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Something that not many indie titles are able to do, Dead Cells has now managed to hit over 10 million sales and still going strong. This news was shared in a press release yesterday June 5th, via Tinsley PR.</p>
<p>It's not really a surprise though, Dead Cells is an absolutely magnificent game that keeps you coming back for more. It's had tons of free content upgrades, available on many platforms and a few DLC that have all been quite well received too. There's been updates from small additions to crossovers from other games and even the recent Return to Castlevania DLC which had plenty of positive reviews.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9448492901686057811gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9448492901686057811gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>From the press release: "Following the success of Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania, Evil Empire has been exploring the path forward for the title as a whole. With years of successful updates and expansions behind it after taking over live ops of Dead Cells in 2019, the studio is tinkering with its time-tested methodology, experimenting with ideas for future updates and new ways for fans to enjoy one of their favorite roguelikes."</p>
<p>Sounds like there's plenty more to come for Dead Cells…</p>
<p>Originally developed by Motion Twin, the studio has basically split into two with Evil Empire an off-shoot of people from Motion Twin but the two work closely together.</p>
<p>You can buy Dead Cells from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/dead-cells?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/dead_cells?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/588650/Dead_Cells/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified with the Native Linux version too.</p>

      <title>Sandtrix is Tetris with sand - delightful, free and renamed after a DMCA</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have a few minutes to kill here and there? Sandtrix could be what you need. It's free, has a Linux version and got the attention of Tetris Holding, LLC under the previous name Setris so it got a DMCA takedown but now it's <em>back</em>. But for how long?</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2181415511686056406gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2181415511686056406gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The original page on itch.io for Setris is gone and just has a link to the <a href="https://itch.io/takedowns/2073998" target="_blank">copyright complaint</a> from Tetris Holdings, because the Setris name was so similar (and it noted the use of a "Russian Folk Song Registered Trademark") on top of that. So the developer has renamed it to Sandtrix and <a href="https://mslivo.itch.io/sandtrix" target="_blank">put it back up</a>. I wasn't even aware of it until now thanks to the DMCA so it's actually given it a bit of a boost.</p>
<p>Quite a fun spin on the basic idea of falling blocks. They come down in the usual shapes, but when they hit the bottom or some sand already there, they crumble into pieces. You need to cover an entire row from left to right in one colour to have it vanish and up your score. Really sweet to kill a few minutes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9759396161686056939gol1.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9759396161686056939gol1.gif"/></a></p>
<p>Head to the <a href="https://mslivo.itch.io/sandtrix" target="_blank">itch.io page</a> to check it out.</p>
<p>Looking around it probably got the attention of Tetris Holding because Kotaku and RPS both covered it recently when it was called Setris. So they must have people constantly looking around for anything resembling Tetris to strike.</p>

      <title>Transform creatures into tools in puzzle-platformer Transmogrify now with Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Released originally back in April, Transmogrify is a puzzle-platformer where you play as Chris — a janitor stranded at Future Perfect Labs where strange and deadly specimens have breached containment and overrun the facility. To help you get through it, you have access to the experimental Transmogrify device, which allows you to transform living creatures into tools and structures to get through various puzzles and platforming and hopefully escape the lab.</p>
<p>Just recently the developer added Native Linux support to the game, check the trailer below for more:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="oufdFenPFpk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/552950b2085589840482db6c4494321a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/oufdFenPFpk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Platform and puzzle your way through 75 levels across 4 unique worlds as Chris, the "courageous" janitor!</li>
<li>Overcome the bizarre experiments of Perfect Future Labs - and trust us, they get weird.</li>
<li>Solve the mystery of the emergency laboratory lockdown alongside your newfound AI companion, Grace.</li>
<li>Get that classic Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo feel with beautiful graphics, a unique mechanic, and a killer soundtrack.</li>
<li>Jump straight into the action - no long, drawn-out tutorials in this laboratory.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking about the idea behind the game the developer said: "Transmogrify was conceived in the 2015 Ludum Dare game jam with the theme of ‘Unconventional Weapon’. A user on Twitter posted an added challenge of making the weapon non-lethal. I wanted to make something that felt different than the standard run-and-gun. We want players to feel smart as they teach themselves to solve puzzles, and discover new ways to do so. We want them to feel empowered as they act on their environment in different ways and to emphasize with Grace’s plight as the story unfolds within this facility."</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/740310/Transmogrify/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental fixes up Halo MCC, Ubisoft Connect, Creativerse</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released an update to Proton Experimental, bringing with it a few nice fixes for issues in various games so here's a run over what's changed.</p>
<p>This update was released June 6th as Valve continue to roll out upgrades to Proton Experimental first, before they merge them into the main Proton 8.0-x releases.</p>
<p>For newly supported games they're listing The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, not that I imagine many people are bothered by it with it being one of the worst releases this year. The more interesting changes are elsewhere that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed flipped videos in Secret of Mana and other titles.</li>
<li>Fixed Call of Duty 2 hanging when loading maps.</li>
<li>Fixed Creativerse hanging while exiting from a local game.</li>
<li>Fixed Ubisoft Connect intermittently having an invisible window.</li>
<li>Fixed a few Proton 8.0 regressions:
<ul>
<li>DJMAX RESPECT V is playable again.</li>
<li>Halo: The Master Chief Collection menus no longer are broken.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Full changelog can be <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">seen here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How to change your Proton version:</strong></p>
<p>Steam Deck:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a game in your Library and head to the little cog icon on the right.</li>
<li>Click Properties, then Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>On a Linux desktop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right click a game, go to Properties.</li>
<li>Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>

      <title>Diablo 4 on Steam Deck is quite magnificent (and desktop Linux too!)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://diablo4.blizzard.com/en-gb/" target="_blank">Diablo 4</a> is just about to release for everyone, and after blasting through the Early Access I've been thoroughly impressed by how it runs on Steam Deck and desktop Linux.</p>
<p>Firstly, if you need to know how to install Battle Net on either Steam Deck or desktop Linux, I've covered multiple ways before. You can install it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/heres-how-to-run-diablo-4-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">directly using Proton</a> (no need for GE-Proton now though, just Proton Experimental is fine) or you can use the newer way with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/get-battlenet-ea-epic-games-and-more-on-steam-deck-the-easy-way/" target="_blank">the NonSteamLauncher script</a>. You could also try it through <a href="https://lutris.net/" target="_blank">Lutris</a>.</p>
<p>By default it will give you Low details but if you bump it up to Medium a little, lock it to 40FPS and turn on FSR 2 quality, you get a game that looks good and performs to a consistent level. Their FSR 2 implementation seems to be pretty great, and the reduced power drain will let you play for longer.</p>
<p>Here's a video and some thoughts on Steam Deck along with my settings:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="j1jNbeM4Dlg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/19c29f927ec48ccf0ab75f7abda4786d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/j1jNbeM4Dlg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Overall, it's an impressive show for performance and a lot of fun to play through. Nice to see another huge release working nearly to perfection on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Naturally I've been testing it on desktop Linux too where it also works. One issue I did have, was opening the map for the first time on desktop caused the game to lock up. Reloading and this wasn't a problem. Through repeated testing, it only seemed to happen the very first time. Apart from that, everything else on desktop with my NVIDIA 2080 Ti works as expected and I've been seeing over 100FPS at 2560x1440 in busy town areas, and much higher out in the open world. Overall, it seems to be great.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15733941331685983983gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15733941331685983983gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Diablo 4 on Fedora KDE 38</em></p>
<p>Are you going to pick up Diablo 4? Or have you been playing during Early Access? Let me know in the comments your thoughts on the latest in the series.</p>

      <title>Quasimorph is a brutal sci-fi extraction roguelike</title>
      <author>anewson</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Quasimorph is a classic turn-based roguelike with an 'extraction' twist: you deploy into each mission with your clone, level up and collect equipment, then finish the mission to extract with your clone and loot.</p>
<p>It's a fantastic mechanic to add to the roguelike genre and makes for a natural metaprogression while preserving the brutality of classic roguelike games. Equip your high-level clone with all your best equipment only to make a mistake and die? Say goodbye to your gear and your clone. This, combined with other modern roguelike mechanics and an excellent visual aesthetic makes Quasimorph one to keep your eye on. The prologue is available for<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2347110/Quasimorph_End_of_Dream/" target="_blank"> free on steam</a>, and runs flawlessly via Proton.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19009664191685908212gol1142.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19009664191685908212gol1142.gif"/></a></p>
<p>Quasimorph takes inspiration from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/625960/Stoneshard/" target="_blank">Stoneshard</a> with a pain system that applies debuffs on damage received, body-part-specific damage, detailed character and enemy sprites that portray different armour and weapons, and light crafting and equipment maintenance mechanics. Be forewarned: also like Stoneshard, the game is <em>hard</em>.</p>
<p>Visually, the game is a treat with great lighting effects and colourful maps. There are also excellent visual details: spent shell casings fly out of weapons and stay on the floor, walking over a bloodied corpse will have you trailing blood all over the place, doors and cover crumple under heavy fire, and empty loot containers look distinct from full ones.</p>
<p>Another excellent mechanic is the hunger system. Rather than simply being a passive requirement to occasionally eat food, your fullness acts as your energy store which you can use to take more actions per turn or regenerate health.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9908929661685908212gol1142.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9908929661685908212gol1142.gif"/></a></p>
<p></p>
<p>The story of the game also seems intriguing. You play a private military corp hired to find and extract the research data from a corporation that has just lost its war with your contractee (a particularly violently hostile takeover, your dispatcher notes).</p>
<p>Specifically, your employer is interested in extracting anything relating to "quasimorphosis," a technology relating to teleportation. It doesn't take long before you begin to discover some ugly truths about this research. Indeed, you'll realize something is off right in the first mission when you shoot a scientist only to have a skinless creature jump out of his corpse and hurtle towards you on all fours.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5182892341685908211gol1142.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5182892341685908211gol1142.gif"/></a></p>
<p>The game isn't perfect; there are still some missing quality of life features like rebindable keys, simpler ways to interact with the UI, and some much needed features (shortcut for changing stance, splitting inventory stacks, and a force-move option to, for example, step on a corpse instead of looting it). The crafting system also fairly sparse, with around a dozen recipes available.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20622178571685908573gol1142.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20622178571685908573gol1142.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The release date for Quasimorph is unknown. Due to Western sanctions (the development team Magnum Scriptum is based in Russia) the game is in something of a release limbo where the devs are unable to charge money for their game, but continue actively working on it.</p>
<p>An interesting side note: the devs refer to these sanctions (which are seriously impacting them) as "humanistic" in the steam forums, which likely gives you an inkling into their stance on the war in Ukraine. Trying the prologue is a great way to support this team and this game.</p>
<p>You can download the prologue<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2347110/Quasimorph_End_of_Dream/" target="_blank"> free on Steam</a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2059170/Quasimorph/" target="_blank">wishlist</a> the full game.</p>

      <title>Canonical planning an immutable desktop version of Ubuntu</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This could be very interesting and exciting. Canonical has confirmed they're working towards an immutable version of Ubuntu for desktop users based on all the work they've done with Ubuntu Core.</p>
<p>Mentioned initially in a comment on <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2023/05/cups-snap-ubuntu-23-10#comment-6196766355" target="_blank">OMGUbuntu</a> with a target for the next LTS (long term support) release, later a full <a href="https://ubuntu.com/blog/ubuntu-core-an-immutable-linux-desktop" target="_blank">blog post</a> was put up on the official Ubuntu website going into more detail on their thoughts and plans. Don't worry though, the normal Ubuntu releases aren't going anywhere.</p>
<p>For those who don't follow what an immutable OS even is: in simple terms it keeps the main operating system as read-only, which is supposed to make it more stable, secure and easier to update with all your applications isolated from it with some sort of container system. So think like SteamOS on Steam Deck, Fedora Silverblue or Ubuntu Core and even Google's Chrome OS.</p>
<p>From the blog post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Behind the scenes, the Canonical team has been actively exploring the benefits of Ubuntu Core beyond the realm of IoT, most notably in the context of developers and daily users.</p>
<p>The properties inherent to Ubuntu Core such as secure boot, recovery states and hardware backed encryption would bring significant improvements to the security posture of a user’s PC.</p>
<p>It also introduces the concept of modularity to the user experience, where users may experiment with alternative desktop environment snaps while remaining on a highly stable, signed and secure LTS base.</p>
<p>The use of snap channels also brings into the play the concept of ‘rolling’ certain elements of the distribution. Gamers, for example, might opt-in to a kernel channel that ships the latest NVIDIA drivers as soon as they are available, in the same way the Ubuntu Desktop team did for Mesa as part of our work on the Steam snap.</p>
<p>However, this level of stability and security comes with trade-offs for developers and tinkerers, restricting modification of the base OS in favour of a ‘just works’ experience. For developers who see their device as a platform for open source development, the solution is container-based environments similar to the LXD based Crostini. For tinkerers, the classic Ubuntu images would remain their preferred route to enable full control of (and responsibility for) their system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While Ubuntu Core is meant for IoT OS for embedded devices, this is something different to give desktop users a potential taste of things to come. With the rise of more applications coming to the likes of Snap and Flatpak, this does make some sense and I think <a href="https://www.ypsidanger.com/the-distribution-model-is-changing/" target="_blank">Jorge Castro's blog</a> on how Linux distributions are changing is also a good read for what's to come.</p>
<p>Canonical has been expanding Snaps now for a while with the likes of the stable <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/ubuntu-2304-is-out-now-with-gnome-44-and-a-stable-steam-snap/" target="_blank">Steam snap for Ubuntu 23.04</a>, the upcoming <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2023/05/cups-snap-ubuntu-23-10" target="_blank">CUPS</a> Snap and naturally plenty more to come.</p>
<p>How do you feel about an immutable version of Ubuntu with lots of Snap packages?</p>

      <title>NonSteamLaunchers adds support for the Minecraft Launcher and lots of bug fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The really interesting project NonSteamLaunchers to get all sorts of third-party launchers on Steam Deck like Battle.net, EA, Epic Games and more has now added support for Minecraft Launcher and fixed a lot of problems.</p>
<p>A project <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/get-battlenet-ea-epic-games-and-more-on-steam-deck-the-easy-way/" target="_blank">I recently showed off</a>, because it can really simplify and speed up the process of installing all these various launchers directly with Proton and automatically add their shortcuts into Steam.</p>
<p>Since I last covered it there's been a few new releases, one of which included a contribution I made to make it work properly on desktop Linux too. As of the latest release they've also added support for Minecraft Launcher (for Java and Dungeons), fixed various bugs, optimized the code, improved compatibility across the board, added support for the Glyph launcher, added a new logo and many other small adjustments to make it work better.</p>
<p>My previous video on it if you missed it:</p>

      <title>dbrand bring out a universal mount for Steam Deck Killswitch</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you have the Killswitch case for your Steam Deck? Well dbrand have come up with their own universal mount so you can strap anything you want to the back of it.</p>
<p>It's equal parts fancy as it is simple. Fancy because it gives you a pretty cool (and slightly ridiculous) Valve to click into your Killswitch case, and the rest is just a simple strap that goes into it so you can hook up anything that will be able to fit into the strap. Seems like a pretty good idea.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9929168741685960060gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9929168741685960060gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You can find the strap on <a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/grip/steam-deck-cases?caseless=&amp;killswitch_umm_black" target="_blank">their store</a> available in Red pictured above or plain black costing $14.95.</p>
<p>Additionally, dbrand are now hiring and they announced it in the most dbrand possible way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the past year or so, we've had exactly one fear: Gabe Newell successfully infiltrating our knife-proof super fortress to exact revenge. A ridiculously specific fear, to be sure, but we've got some history. You see, we'd accidentally kidnapped him during the development of Project Killswitch. After his escape, our only recourse was to build the aforementioned super fortress. As an added precautionary measure, we've poured enormous sums of money into preparations for Gabe's inevitable assault - specifically, by assembling a knife collection to rival his own. During a recent meeting about Project Killswitch, our worst fear became a reality. Gabe Newell appeared before us, armed to the teeth with an assortment of blades. We had no time to prepare - it was as though he'd manifested out of thin air. In a moment of panic, we sacrificed the nearest scientist to appease Gabe's bloodlust. He was visibly confused. Turns out, he'd simply come to eliminate us for dethroning him as the world's leading knife connoisseur. To make a long story short, we gifted all of our blades to Gabe to make the problem go away. Incidentally, we're also short one expendible scientist. If you're looking for a job, <a href="https://careers.dbrand.com/" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They're not the first to do this though. There's also the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/your-steam-deck-deserves-a-deckmate/" target="_blank">wonderful Deckmate</a> that allows you to stick anything to it, and JSAUX also have <a href="https://jsaux.com/products/modcase-for-steam-deck-pc0104" target="_blank">ModCase</a> that has a strap as well.</p>

      <title>Try the demo of Lueur and the Dim Settlers, a minimalist and relaxing survival builder</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a minimalist art style and a more casual setting, Lueur and the Dim Settlers is a genuine little delight to play for those after a city-builder with survival elements but there's a more relaxed game mode too. Mentioned <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/lueur/" target="_blank">here on GOL recently</a>, there's now a demo available for you to give it a try and I think this one is truly worth some of your time. </p>
<p>After leaving Ubisoft, developer Darenn Keller has created something rather unique that sucked me right in straight away. Everything you do in Lueur is based on the tile system and there's many different types of tiles from forests to seas. Some may contain treasure, animals to farm and all sorts to discover as you go. You start off with only a small amount of tiles actually explored and as you expand, you don't know really what you're going to find so it has some fun exploration and mystery to it too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12548784291685957969gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12548784291685957969gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Most tiles can be built upon and various buildings have adjacency bonuses too, so you're always thinking about how to best build up your city. In the survival mode it's pretty important too, since resources are constantly an issue and the timer is ever-ticking. Placing wheat fields next to a windmill would boost your food output for example, and so surrounding it with fields would be best but then you might not have space, so you might even need to demolish things you've already built. </p>
<p>My favourite feature are the little mini-games though. Say you need a quick bit of extra food or wood - so you find a tile with forest or animals, and do a little mini-game to collect the resources. Like the storms that come along to spread darkness, it's like a mini space-shooter where you're trying to defend against bullets coming down directly inside the little tile.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13273311531685958215gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13273311531685958215gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's a seriously clever idea just to make things a little bit different and quirky. I love it. The game will just keep surprising you as you play through and this is only the demo, it really does build up the excitement and intrigue for the full game that's now moving up quite a number of places on my wishlist.</p>
<p>The main thing is that it's not particularly long, or difficult. Even the survival mode is still pretty relaxed with the timer, events and exploration. The demo has one playable level available to play in three different modes, they estimate it will give you about 3 hours play time to finish it all and beat the challenges.</p>
<p>You can see their previous video to explain it better below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xCB-JrcixkM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8d3d44738be07ae9ffa7ffc1239181d2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xCB-JrcixkM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It has full Native Linux support built with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> and supports Steam Deck too. </p>
<p>You can try the demo on <a href="https://darenn.itch.io/lueur-and-the-dim-settlers" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2308630/Lueur_and_the_Dim_Settlers/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://system76.com/" target="_blank">System76</a> are the company behind the popular Pop!_OS Linux distribution, plus various laptops and desktops and now they're expanding once again. <em>Their Pop!_OS is in<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/linux-hits-a-multi-year-high-for-user-share-on-steam-thanks-to-steam-deck/" target="_blank"> the top list for Linux</a> users on Steam.</em></p>
<p>For starters, they're going to be bringing out their own custom PC case for DIY builders. Carl Richell, the CEO and Founder, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@carlrichell@fosstodon.org/110471188327819605" target="_blank">mentioned on Mastodon</a> their new case is called the Nebula and it's set to arrive later this month for anyone who wanted a case inspired by their in-house custom-built Thelio desktop line. Here's what it looks like currently:</p>

      <title>Halls of Torment hits over 70K sales in the first week</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a nice little indie success story for you! Halls of Torment from Chasing Carrots launched on May 24th into Early Access with Native Linux support and it works great on Steam Deck. They've announced that their launch week was pretty great!</p>
<p>Writing on <a href="https://twitter.com/aayph/status/1664192884990509056" target="_blank">Twitter</a> one of their team mentioned that they've had over 70,000 sales, 22,000 daily active users (with around 1,390 of those on Steam Deck) and over 29% of people played it over 10 hours. Great to see that even with so many games releasing on Steam all the time, with nearly 7,000 already this year, that we can see such a success so early for smaller games like this.</p>
<p>You can see my original <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/halls-of-torment-is-out-in-early-access-a-great-fusion-of-diablo-and-vampire-survivors/" target="_blank">release article here</a> and my video below:</p>

<p>After some recent weirdness where March saw a big drop, the Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/?platform=combined" target="_blank">May 2023</a> is now showing the Linux share at a multi-year high.</p>
<p>Checking back over <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">our Steam Tracker</a> where we're keeping tabs on it over time, we've not seen the Linux user share being as high as it is right now in at least 6 years. The Linux user share is now on 1.47% with macOS on 2.39% and Windows at 96.14%,</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15843983561685710785gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15843983561685710785gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>When filtering the results over to just Linux here's the current most popular distributions for Steam gaming:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 25.32% + 2.55%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 9.99% + 0.20%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS 64 bit 9.72% - 1.12%</li>
<li>Freedesktop.org SDK 22.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 7.27% - 0.34%</li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 5.79% - 0.46%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 21.1 64 bit 5.46% + 0.49%</li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 3.53% - 0.33%</li>
<li>Other 32.92% - 0.98%</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of absolute numbers we can take an educated guess here based on the last time Valve gave out their monthly active users, which they said was 132 million back in March 2022. So based on that 1.47% it would mean around 1,940,400 estimated monthly active users for Linux. However, Valve did <em>not</em> give out the number for the past year, and we know Steam is growing all the time, so in reality it's probably <em>much</em> higher.</p>

      <title>itch.io is hosting another big Queer Games Bundle for Pride Month</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's LGBT Pride Month which means there's another big bundle of games available in the Queer Games Bundle now on itch.io. Featuring 466 different items from 293 creators it's filled full with games, physical games, assets, soundtracks and more.</p>
<p>From the bundle page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we had the budget of an AAA game, we could give every solo developer in this bundle a livable wage multiple times over for a year and every single team a massive funding boost. Imagine what the developers and artists in this bundle could create a year from now if they weren’t worried about starving or how to pay their rent this month.</p>
<p>Purchasing the Queer Games Bundle is a direct action that you can take right now to support queer people in a life-changing way, and in exchange, you get over 450 amazing, heartfelt, fun, and radical games and artworks. </p>
<p>Help nurture our diverse queer arts community, fund the creation of the next great game you love, and find your new favorite game by purchasing the bundle today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's two different versions you can support the creators with the <a href="https://itch.io/b/1812/queer-games-bundle-2023" target="_blank">main bundle</a> and a <a href="https://itch.io/b/1813/queer-games-bundle-2023-pay-what-you-can-edition" target="_blank">PWYW bundle</a> ($10 minimum) for people who can afford less but still wish to grab it.</p>
<p>With this being the third year they've done the bundle, last year they managed to raise over $200K for all the creators involved across the two bundles.</p>

      <title>AirJet from Frore Systems could be great cooling for a Steam Deck 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If there's one thing I truly want from a Steam Deck 2 aside from the usual performance related upgrades, it would be better cooling and less noise. Perhaps the new AirJet from Frore Systems is what Valve could use.</p>
<p>What is it? According to Frore Systems the AirJet is a "fully self-contained active heat sink module, which is silent, thin, and light". This was revealed a little while ago at CES but interest in it is heating up again now, as they've <a href="https://www.froresystems.com/media-room/the-worlds-first-mini-pc-to-feature-airjet-r-launched-at-computex-2023" target="_blank">revealed</a> the first system coming with it in the ZOTAC ZBOX PI430AJ.</p>
<p>They're targeting many different types of devices including handheld gaming like the Steam Deck. Quite an exciting idea to have more space for other things since it's so small, a smaller slot would be needed for the intake and vent so less of your snack crumbs and dust would get in, reduced heat and being a whole lot quieter overall too. Although, it would push prices a bit no doubt.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental update fixes &#34;many&#34; games on Steam Deck and desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has put out a small update to Proton Experimental, which should fix many games due to a <em>regression</em> that was hiding away. With this release they've updated the included version of DXVK, which is what does the Direct 3D 9 / 10 / 11 to Vulkan translation for Windows games on Steam Deck and desktop Linux.</p>
<p>The changelog notes that it specifically fixes <em>Blazblue Centralfication</em> and <em>Kung-Fu Strike - The Warriors Rise</em> but they also mentioned a vague "many other games". It's one of those bugs their developers know would have hit numerous games but those are what they've re-tested and had reported working properly again. So if you saw a game that had some issues recently appear with Proton Experimental updates, time to check again.</p>
<p>Bugs that affect many titles is one of the fun parts of a translation layer like Proton, even a small change can potentially affect hundreds of games.</p>
<p>You can see the changelog <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How to change your Proton version:</strong></p>
<p>Steam Deck:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a game in your Library and head to the little cog icon on the right.</li>
<li>Click Properties, then Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>On a Linux desktop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right click a game, go to Properties.</li>
<li>Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>

      <title>Steam Deck OS update brings graphics driver fixes - ready up for SteamOS 3.5</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has now released two small graphics driver updates for Steam Deck OS (SteamOS) <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3702568031445749185" target="_blank">3.4.8</a>, which means the Preview update channel is now ready for a big update to drop.</p>
<p>The updates included in 3.4.8 are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Updated graphics driver with a fix for a GPU crash in Splitgate.</li>
<li>Updated the graphics driver with performance improvements for STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>These were left in the Preview channel for a while but now the Preview channel is <em>empty</em>, meaning the update many have been waiting for could be readying to drop into Preview real soon. We also haven't seen a major stable update in some time but Valve are constantly updating the Beta with client-side changes that eventually they will bundle into a stable update too.</p>
<p>SteamOS 3.5 is going to bring with it quite a lot including a Linux kernel upgrade, likely an updated KDE Plasma desktop version, more graphics driver upgrades, various additions to Gaming Mode like Soundtrack support and Screen Colour settings (teased in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyAmFvLdYbg" target="_blank">one of my videos</a>), adjustments to the performance overlay and no doubt plenty more.</p>
<p>Even Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais is doing a tiny little tease on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1664081074300022785" target="_blank">Twitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is out in Stable now, so Preview is nice and empty. 👀</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are you hoping that the new SteamOS upgrade brings with it?</p>

      <title>Physics be damned, go build some crazy stuff in Poly Bridge 3</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dry Cactus have now released Poly Bridge 3, the latest in their multi-million selling physics-based bridge-building puzzle game series and it looks to be the wildest yet. As before, it comes with full Native Linux support.</p>
<p>The idea and the levels often look simple. Just build a bridge, to get vehicles over to the other side. However, it quickly throws in plenty of annoyances that will make you craft some of the most insane death-trap bridges ever made that would make an architect cry. "Suspension bridges, draw-bridges, multi-level bridges, crazy almost-bridges, bridges, bridges, bridges!" — as the developer says.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="e5tSnAh3P14"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2d7a96d57bfba549daefdbfe626b721d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/e5tSnAh3P14" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Feature Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Campaign - Explore the new Open World Campaign with a dozen worlds and 100+ new levels. Jumps, Hydraulics, ‘Normal’ Bridges, and more giving you hours of gameplay to enjoy! Take a flying leap in Vaulting Towers or flex those hydraulic muscles in Bifrost Bend!</li>
<li>Sandbox - Let your engineering creativity flow with no restrictions in Sandbox mode, allowing you to push your bridge building skills to the limit. Challenge your friends and the community by designing intricate levels and publish them online for everyone to enjoy.</li>
<li>Community - Explore virtually infinite content and challenges designed by the community in the Steam Workshop. See what bridge designs other players come up with and show off your own in the Gallery. Challenge yourself and others by competing for the top spots in the cut-throat leaderboards and histograms.</li>
<li>Custom Physics - Our custom physics engine gives total control, reliability, and accuracy to your bridges. Sleep easy at night knowing your bridges will perform consistently every time!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's plenty that's new in this latest release, other than over 100 levels of puzzles to build your way through. There's improved modding support, decoration objects, the ability to create all sorts for it from vehicles to random additional shapes to place throughout levels. In terms of gameplay there's now some that have "build zones" where the challenge is to build in a more confined space, new foundation materials for super-strong bridges (but they're expensive…) and pre-built materials to bring with you for a helping hand or even an additional obstacle.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1850160/Poly_Bridge_3/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>New Stars is a slimmed down quicker Stellaris-like strategy sim</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need your 4x space fix but find the likes of Stellaris just a bit too long? Perhaps keep an eye on the upcoming release of New Stars. It will have full Native Linux support at release.</p>
<p>"New Stars is a galactic 4X grand strategy game. Stranded on a new colony, and the last of your kind, you must advance your empire, from within and without. Go head-to-head with alien empires and build the greatest empire to survive the test of time, or be the last remaining in the galaxy to succeed."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/414831521685547637gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/414831521685547637gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Speaking to the developer asking them why someone would go for this game rather than an established name, this is what they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1) Relatively fast-paced - Each games last a few hours on average.<br/>
2) Straightforward mechanics - (Should be) Easy to learn with a new tutorial system.<br/>
3) Graphics - galaxy has improved since screenshots, with optimization for low-end devices.<br/>
4) UI - unique with elements inspired from a wide range of games.<br/>
<br/>
There are similarities to Stellaris, such as the fleet management and fleets in general, however the gameplay, mechanics, and pacing is a lot different. Civilization and Stellaris were originally the main inspirations for the game, but New Stars is it's own game.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Highlighted Features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customize your empire from world preferences, different ideologies with their own bonuses, hundreds of empire icons and more. Customize a unique galaxy based on your chosen settings. There are five different galaxy sizes to choose from.</li>
<li>Unique empires, species, and clans exist within a customizable and procedurally generated galaxy with limitless possibilities, and thousands of unique planets, stars and worlds. Some planets have valuable resources that can be collected.</li>
<li>Explore star systems and discover new secrets of the galaxy, and find clues to your lost home. Discoveries such as white dwarfs, ancient ruins, lost ships, and much more can be found between the abyss. Some planets have hidden features that increase their value.</li>
<li>Expand your empire across new stars to new frontiers, and build strong colonies that will power your galactic economy. Collect natural resources from planets and stars using starhubs. Beware of pesky barbaric clans that may plunder your resources for their own gain.</li>
<li>Merge ships into one fleet, and combine them against your adversaries. Defend against attacks by upgrading starbases, or fortifying your colonies. Research new ship types or advanced military capabilities to get an edge over your alien foes.</li>
<li>Declare wars, trade resources, make agreements, declare friendships, share intel, forge powerful alliances, and much more. Some empires may be openly hostile or require appeasing, others may be cooperative, and some may be integrated into your empire.</li>
<li>Construct modular starships from unlocked modules, and turrets. Unlock larger ships and more powerful ship types, sections, turrets, and more. There are almost limitless combinations to meet your empire's needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Their latest progress report video can be seen on it below:</p>

      <title>The OmniCase 2 from JSAUX is a quality USB-C hub worth grabbing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A while ago hardware accessory maker JSAUX sent over the OmniCase 2 Pro, and it's a great USB-C hub worth grabbing if you need some extra ports for a Steam Deck, a desktop, laptop or anything in between.</p>
<p>This isn't a typical Steam Deck focused accessory from JSAUX that they've become known for over the last year, instead it has a wide target of anyone who needs the ports. However, they are doing a special Steam Deck stand just for it along with a laptop stand as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11263710001685544918gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11263710001685544918gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You can pick between two models of either the OmniCase 2 or the OmniCase 2 Pro, with the difference being that the Pro model has Display Port, an extra HDMI port and an extra USB-C port although the Pro model also has one less USB-A. So it really all depends on what ports your after to hook up some more devices.</p>
<p>It's all about the insides. Giving you space to store the wires, and storing any little cards you might need when on the go. The lid just pulls off and slots back on with low-powered magnets, same with the stand for the Steam Deck and also the laptop stand as well.<a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14106806221685544931gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14106806221685544931gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>With my time spent primarily using it on Steam Deck, it's been a perfect experience. I absolutely cannot fault this device. As a USB Hub, it does exactly the job you want it to while also being small enough to stick in your pocket and walk away with it to set up again somewhere else easily.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16905059371685544835gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>This is actually the device I've been using exclusively for all my recent Steam Deck videos and footage, and it hasn't let me down at all over the last few weeks.</p>
<p>It sure is sturdy too - it's built like a mini-tank. If you drop it on your foot, that's going to hurt and it will laugh at you. Don't ask me how I know that. Probably the best build quality of anything JSAUX has sent over so far. There's really not a whole lot else to say - you get what's advertised and it's just plain and simply great.</p>
<p>Cost is the important question though of course and the normal price is about £49 for the OmniCase 2 and about £65 for the OmniCase 2 Pro. You can bundle it with different extras like the stands for more.</p>
<p>An easy recommendation from me for anyone in the market for such a device. It has come in very hand over here. A very tidy little device. You can find it <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jsaux/omnicase-2-the-usb-c-hub-for-gamers-and-digital-nomads" target="_blank">on Kickstarter</a> where it's already proving quite popular gathering close to £20K in funding in the first hour.</p>
<p>If you do go for it, you can expect to see it arrive August onwards.</p>
