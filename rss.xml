<p>As for what performance to expect these below are from AMD's own slides in comparison to the RX 7900 GRE:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7948243951740750316gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7948243951740750316gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2434064461740750317gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2434064461740750317gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13919872471740750317gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13919872471740750317gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16900471511740750318gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16900471511740750318gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For FSR 4, AMD said to expect 30+ games supported immediately at launch including: Marvel Rivals, Smite 2, Space Marine 2, Spider-Man Remastered, Spider-Man Miles Morales and Spider-Man 2, Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West, God of War Ragnorok, The Last of Us Part 1 and more. AMD said to expect over 75 titles to add FSR 4 support during 2025.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11034823831740742968gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11034823831740742968gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2969886801740742969gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2969886801740742969gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's a shame you have to upgrade your whole GPU for the full benefit of FSR 4 though, as the quality of it does look pretty impressive based on the bits they've shown. AMD have made seriously great progress on FSR since it was first released, and this does look like quite a big overall enhancement to their tech on both quality and performance.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3105069551740743275gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3105069551740743275gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4202375431740743276gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4202375431740743276gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>AMD FSR 4 Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Available exclusively on AMD Radeon™ RX 9000 Series graphics cards, AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition™ adds a new easy-to-use AMD FidelityFX™ Super Resolution 4 (AMD FSR 4) Upgrade feature that helps maximize performance at maximum quality in over 30 games at launch, with 75 coming later this year. AMD FSR 4 delivers a substantial image quality improvement over AMD FSR 3.1 upscaling, with the new ML-based algorithm helping to improve temporal stability, better preserve detail, and reduce ghosting.</li>
<li>Utilizing features already built into the AMD FidelityFX™ API added when game developers integrate AMD FSR 3.1 into their games, AMD FSR 4 enables an easy upgrade for supported FSR 3.1 games and can be combined with existing in-game AMD FSR 3.1 advanced frame-generation and AMD Radeon™ Anti-Lag 2 for ultra-smooth, ultra-responsive gaming at incredible frame rates on AMD Radeon RX 9070 Series graphics cards.</li>
<li>The new ML-accelerated AMD FSR 4 upscaling algorithm is trained using high-quality ground truth game data on AMD Instinct™ Accelerators and uses the hardware-accelerated FP8 Wave Matrix Multiply Accumulate (WMMA) feature of the AMD RDNA™ 4 architecture to ensure maximum upscaling quality while still providing a substantial game performance boost.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And of course during the event there was plenty of <em>AI this AI that</em> talk.</p>
<p>You can see the full video announcement from AMD below:</p>

      <title>HASTE: Broken Worlds is a speedrunning Sonic-like platformer from Landfall with a demo up now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gotta go fast? Landfall, developer of Totally Accurate Battle Simulator and Clustertruck, have released a demo for HASTE: Broken Worlds that's worth a look.</p>
<p>It's a speedrunning platformer, with a feel that I can only describe as being Sonic-like. The main mechanic (apart from running, obviously) is that you need to build up an energy meter by landing as perfectly as possible. As you run you will auto-launch yourself into the air from any little hill, and then it's your job to time your button pressing to send yourself flying downwards to land nicely to build up your energy.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1849222331740747124gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - HASTE: Broken Worlds Demo on Linux</em></p>
<p>With your energy built up, you can then use your special ability to jump on a sort-of hover-board to build up more speed and distance while in the air. The game is made up of procedural worlds, so you never quite know what sort of area you're going to be running around, which will keeps you on your toes.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="voVRktkV62A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c5cd8585f57397f8c299bdcdf8a5dffb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/voVRktkV62A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The progression in it is a bit similar to various roguelites with you speeding through each level, to then pick a path on a map to progress through each shard (shards being their worlds). It also sprinkles in upgrades for you to pick between a few giving you various extras. So with the procedural worlds, the progression and the upgrades it's a highly replayable game even in the demo.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Third-person high-speed running gameplay.</li>
<li>10 Shards, each featuring a collection of procedurally generated levels that must be completed without fail to advance to the next Shard.</li>
<li>Items and Challenge levels that let you customize your build for each attempt to clear a Shard.</li>
<li>Spectacular biomes and different bosses to discover.</li>
<li>A story to explore and a lovable cast of characters to befriend.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The demo was released as part of Steam Next Fest and there's a Native Linux version available. On Steam, the developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1796470/discussions/0/595142122210928693/#c595142122210940090" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noted</a> they plan to get it Steam Deck Verified too.</p>
<p>Definitely a demo worth trying out. Only one issue on my Desktop is that every time I alt+tab it quits, but apart from that it really runs great and is quite entertaining to run through it. Performance is great though and it has an absolutely banging soundtrack to go with it.</p>

      <title>Civilization VII updates roadmap revealed - new update and DLC due out on March 4</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>2K and Firaxis have revealed the updates roadmap for Civilization VII, along with dates on when to expect some of it and we're set for some big changes. It's been a tough launch for them with thoroughly mixed ratings from players. Hopefully the updates will improve things for everyone.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The first update v1.1.0 is due March 4th that will have these highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Natural Wonder to discover: Bermuda Triangle (free to all players).</li>
<li>Additional UI adjustments, polish, and addressing of reported issues.</li>
<li>Significant changes to the Modern Age's Cultural Legacy Path and Victory; AI leaders will also be better at completing a Cultural Victory (so expect fewer Explorer Unit stacks!).</li>
<li>Now able to convert Holy Cities in the Exploration Age. Note that when players create their own Missionary Units, they will always follow the player’s chosen Religion.</li>
<li>Naval Units will be able to disperse Coastal Independent Powers.</li>
<li>Balance pass on several Mementos.</li>
<li>Refinements to the Army Unpacking action.</li>
<li>Addressing reported issues with multiplayer and adding friends with a 2K Account.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the same time the Crossroads of the World Collection - Part 1 DLC will also release. Things includes the new leader Ada Lovelace, the new civs Great Britain (Modern Age) and Carthage (Antiquity Age), and the Natural Wonder Pack including four new Natural Wonders: Machapuchare, Mount Fuji, Vihren, and Vinicunca.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9135914921740744208gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The next update after v1.1.1 will be due March 25 and the highlights are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Additional UI improvements and refinements; specifics will be shared later with the Update 1.1.1 Notes
	<ul>
<li><em>Note: Ongoing improvements to the User Interface continues to be a top priority for the development team. The updates being introduced on March 25 are just one part of a much larger plan that aims to improve the UI over the next several months. </em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scouting and Settling improvements for AI, including less aggressive “forward” settling by AI</li>
<li>Adding Quick Move functionality</li>
<li>Adding the ability to customize the names of Commanders and Cities</li>
<li>Renaming the existing maps to be "Start Position: Balanced," which will be the default Start Position setting for multiplayer games</li>
<li>Adding a new Start Position of "Standard," where the landforms on maps are less predictable, closer to how map generation works in <em>Civ VI</em></li>
<li>Adding an optional Restart button that rerolls the player’s map generation now that these less predictable start positions are possible</li>
<li>New Natural Wonder: Mount Everest (free to all players)</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Again here another DLC will release with the second half of the paid Crossroads of the World Collection. After that, they're not giving any dates. But some of what to expect includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ongoing UI improvements.</li>
<li>Adding a “One More Turn” button that will let you continue playing past the end of the Modern Age.</li>
<li>Implementing Auto-Explore.</li>
<li>New map sizes (all platforms except Nintendo Switch).</li>
<li>New Resource types and adjustments to map resource allocation.</li>
<li>Teams support in multiplayer.</li>
<li>Hot Seat local multiplayer.</li>
<li>Research Queuing.</li>
<li>Mod tools and Steam Workshop support.</li>
<li>Additional game setup customization options.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Split Fiction from Hazelight Studios and EA gets Steam Deck Verified and no EA app needed</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The co-op adventure Split Fiction from Hazelight Studios (It Takes Two) and EA releases March 6th, and the good news is that it will be easy to play on Linux / Steam Deck.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2001120/view/500565775095959232" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> has been posted to Steam to confirm that it's been Steam Deck Verified, and it will be a fully Native Steam game, so no EA app will be needed for it either. This is great news, because the EA app and various other publisher launchers can be a serious nuisance on Linux platforms that play Windows games via Proton.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">In the post they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steam Deck Verified</p>
<p>For starters, we’re happy to announce that Split Fiction will be Steam Native and Steam Deck verified! Similar to It Takes Two, Split Fiction will not require the EA app either, meaning you’ll be able to play the game using just the Steam Client on PC, no other application needed. You will be able to easily send game invites and join your friends on Steam directly through the Steam Friends List system, allowing you to get into the chaotic action quicker. Please note, however, that you’ll need a free EA account if you want to connect with a friend who’s playing on a different platform through crossplay, such as Xbox or PlayStation consoles.</p>
<p>Whether you’re at home or on the go, you will be able to transport yourself into the world of Mio and Zoe’s mind-boggling adventure as Split Fiction is Verified on Valve’s Steam Deck handheld device, giving you even more options to take advantage of Split Fiction supporting crossplay. You will also be able to take advantage of the Steam Cloud Save functionality, meaning you can play on your PC, save and close the game, then carry on where you left off on your Steam Deck and vice versa! We’re excited to see all the unexpected locations the community will end up playing Split Fiction at launch and beyond.</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">They also listed a few accessibility options that will be available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subtitles with optional backgrounds.</li>
<li>Closed captioning.</li>
<li>Skippable checkpoints for sections players may get stuck at.</li>
<li>Toggleable option to replace button mash prompts/analogue stick spinning/stick wiggling prompts with more simplified inputs.</li>
<li>Adjustable damage modifiers to reduce the amount of damage enemies inflict on the player.</li>
<li>Persistent aim dot.</li>
<li>Ability to swap the left and right analogue sticks.</li>
<li>Remappable input controls, allowing custom inputs.</li>
<li>Adjustable camera sensitivity.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm just really happy to see more bigger budget split-screen games like this. Even better when it's playable on Linux platforms thanks to Valve's Proton.</p>

      <title>Linux GPU Configuration Tool (LACT) upgrades NVIDIA clockspeed configuration</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you want to fully control your GPU on Linux you may want to check out the latest update to Linux GPU Configuration Tool (LACT), which brings in various new features. Version 0.7.1 was released on February 27th.</p>
<p>Main changes in this release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Updated clockspeed configuration on Nvidia GPUs. Clockspeeds are now configurable per-pstate, and are displayed as an offset value. Note: existing clockspeed settings will get reset to default.</li>
<li>LACT now detects GPU device changes, automatically picking up added or removed devices without requiring a service restart. While this is not a very common scenario, it is useful for certain use cases such as reloading the driver or dynamically reattaching a GPU.</li>
<li>Minor info reporting improvements, such as showing resizeable bar support on Nvidia and Intel.</li>
<li>Custom p-states are now only applied when actually configured in the UI. This can help with custom clock settings not applying when using a custom performance level on RDNA3 GPUs.</li>
<li>Graphs window no longer causes system lag on some setups.</li>
<li>Process and gamemode listener fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I have to admit, I never really mess with pretty much any GPU / CPU stuff at all. I generally stick with stock everything to not cause any potential issues. However, I really like the layout of this and how it gives you an easy readout of everything. Here's how it looks on my AMD GPU:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2241669101740740595gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2241669101740740595gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1755122731740740596gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1755122731740740596gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Do you use it? Let me know what you think in the comments.</p>

      <title>The California Fire Relief Bundle is live on itch.io</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Necrosoft Games have organised a big California Fire Relief Bundle that's hosted on itch.io. Your chance to get a whole load of games while supporting relief efforts.</p>
<p>From the bundle page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Southern California has been hit by an incredibly destructive wildfire which is tracking to become the most destructive in California history. More than 18,000 structures have been leveled or damaged and 29 people have died with more than 30 still missing.</p>
<p>The affected neighborhoods include a diverse swath of California residents, from the rich to the poor to the unhoused. 37,728 acres burned between the Palisades and Eaton fires alone. 150,000 people had to be evacuated.</p>
<p>Hundreds of game and tabletop game developers have gotten together to create this bundle in support of easing this pain. All proceeds, minus processing fees, go to <a href="https://www.coreresponse.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">CORE</a> (Community Organized Relief Effort), a Los Angeles-based organization which offers direct monetary support to survivors of the fires, and supports projects for fire resilience in affected areas (and potential disaster zones). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's $10 minimum and there's some really fun stuff included. The bundle minimum price is lower than the historic low for TUNIC, a wonderful game that's included so this is a genuinely good deal regardless.</p>

      <title>EA just open sourced Command &amp; Conquer, Red Alert, Renegade and Generals</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I can't quite believe it either. Command &amp; Conquer, Red Alert, Command &amp; Conquer Renegade and Command &amp; Conquer Generals (inc. Zero Hour) have their code officially open sourced.</p>
<p>This is how it should be done. When a game is old enough, open source it so the community can keep it alive and learn from and perhaps even improve them. Looking over them they're all under the GPL3 license. However, there are some additional terms added like EA not granting any "trademark or publicity rights", you don't get the right to use "Command &amp; Conquer" or any other trademark for example.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">EA did more than just open sourcing their older titles though. They've also enabled Steam Workshop support for:</p>
<ul>
<li>C&amp;C Renegade</li>
<li>C&amp;C Generals &amp; Zero Hour</li>
<li>C&amp;C 3 Tiberium Wars and Kane’s Wrath</li>
<li>C&amp;C Red Alert 3 &amp; Uprising</li>
<li>C&amp;C 4 Tiberian Twilight</li>
</ul>
<p>They also launched a new video going over some rare gameplay footage from the early development of C&amp;C Renegade and C&amp;C Generals:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qN2gryZYz6g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/617610065f927cb354f8439f9580a97e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qN2gryZYz6g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">All of them are now on GitHub:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/CnC_Tiberian_Dawn" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/electronicarts/CnC_Tiberian_Dawn</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/CnC_Red_Alert" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/electronicarts/CnC_Red_Alert</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/CnC_Renegade" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/electronicarts/CnC_Renegade</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/CnC_Generals_Zero_Hour" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/electronicarts/CnC_Generals_Zero_Hour</a></li>
</ul>
<p>To do this EA worked with Luke "CCHyper" Feenan, who they said was "part of our Community Council for the C&amp;C Remastered Collection, and was involved in bringing the C&amp;C Ultimate Collection to Steam back in March 2024". You can see the full message from EA and Feenan in a post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2229890/view/502818210084553731" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>To mark 10 years this indie game changes price every hour to London&#39;s temperature</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>As far as publicity stunts and indie dev anniversary celebrations go, this is both clever and quite amusing. The puzzle game <strong>A Good Snowman Is Hard To Build</strong> from Alan Hazelden / Draknek &amp; Friends will change price every hour on <a href="https://draknek.itch.io/a-good-snowman" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">itch.io</a>. <em>Not on other stores though, as only itch supports doing this.</em></p>
<p>What Hazelden <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/draknek.bsky.social/post/3lj66gnc3fb2t" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">called</a> "pay what the temperature is", the price is being set based on the current temperature in London (UK). The developer is pulling the data from <a href="https://openweathermap.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">OpenWeather</a>, and then changing the price to match on the <a href="http://draknek.itch.io/a-good-snowman" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">itch.io page</a>. As of the last reading the temperature was 9.9°C and so it's priced at $9.99.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uWJIkfiKmQk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fbba1ebfbc83101347d30720da31fa8d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uWJIkfiKmQk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some bits of the FAQ are also quite funny:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Why are you doing this?</strong></p>
<p>Introducing this as a permanent price model is our really stupid way of celebrating the game's 10 year anniversary.</p>
<p><strong>What if the temperature is below 0°C?</strong></p>
<p>Ha ha, nice try. The game will be free.</p>
<p><strong>I use Fahrenheit though!</strong></p>
<p>Okay, if you insist. 9.9°C is 49.82°F, so you can set the payment amount to $49.82 in the checkout process.</p>
<p><strong>I use Kelvin though!</strong></p>
<p>We greatly appreciate your generosity! 9.9°C is 283.05°K, so you can set the payment amount to $283.05 in the checkout process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You don't get a Steam key though, as they don't want them to end up being "resold on dodgy second-hand marketplaces that we don't want to support".</p>
<p>Great game too, according to our previous contributor flesk <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2015/02/adorable-sokobanlike-puzzler-a-good-snowman-is-hard-to-build-released-today-a-musthave-for-puzzle-enthusiasts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">who said</a> it's "without a doubt the most charming puzzle game I have ever played".</p>

      <title>Metro devs 4A Games Ukraine rebrand as Reburn and reveal futuristic sci-fi shooter La Quimera</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>La Quimera is an upcoming story-driven FPS set in dystopian future Latin America. Developed by Reburn, formerly known as 4A Games Ukraine. As a big fan of the Metro series, I'm keen to seen what a bunch of their team can do with this new setting.</p>
<p>The setting blends together Latin American folklore with highly advanced weaponry and technology. It will be playable solo or with up to two friends in co-op (three players). Check out the announcement trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8u_qFKhoB8c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1a07a2a96f54d6f10877271cea15a762.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8u_qFKhoB8c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Reburn have a talented team, making me all the more excited about it. They have over 100 developers whose past work includes gameplay design, art, sound engineering, programming, and more from across the entire Metro series as well as the original S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Oleksandr Kostiuk serves as project lead on La Quimera. CEO and founder Dmytro Lymar has worked in games since 2006, and previously served as director and CEO of 4A Games Ukraine.</p>
<p>From the press release: “Reburn is proud to introduce La Quimera, which draws upon our success crafting narrative-driven shooter games for the Metro series,” said Dmytro Lymar, founder and CEO of Reburn. “We look forward to sharing this mysterious new world with players and hope they revel in suiting up to join the fight.”</p>

      <title>Promise Mascot Agency releases April 10 and is &#34;Steam Deck Ready&#34; with a demo up</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Promise Mascot Agency from Kaizen Game Works is confirmed for launch on April 10th, and the good news for Steam Deck / Linux players is that it should work great with the developer noting it's "Steam Deck Ready".</p>
<p>More about it: "From the creators of Paradise Killer comes a mind-bending open-world narrative adventure mascot management simulator where mascots are more than just symbols - they’re unpredictable forces of nature! Step into the chaos, unravel the conspiracies, drive a tiny truck and try to keep it all together in Promise Mascot Agency!"</p>
<p>You can try it out yourself right now during Steam Next Fest and it's definitely worth a look. Check out the new release date trailer that went up yesterday:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bwTNI-MKKPE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1e7e5a1f8a9f34895031f150ad80dab4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bwTNI-MKKPE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As for the Steam Deck support? According to the developer it's looking good! So good in fact that "Playing Promise Mascot Agency on Steam Deck rules so hard!". Now that's what I like to hear.</p>
<p>Here's what they put in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2585830/view/501692310177710901" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We play Promise Mascot Agency on Steam Deck a lot, and we're happy to report that it works wonderfully!<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3068952161740669033gol1.jpg"><br/>
<br/>
It works without any tuning as we detect you're running on Deck and automatically set the graphics options to what we've found give the best results for visual fidelity, frame rate and battery life. A suite of graphics options are included for you to tweak as well.<br/>
<br/>
Some of us play handheld, and some docked with Bluetooth controllers. It rules!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for all of your support and interest in the game!</img></p>

      <title>NVIDIA stable driver 570.124.04 released for Linux with VRR for multiple displays and various bug fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Following on from the 570.86.16 Beta that was released on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/nvidia-beta-driver-570-86-16-released-with-vrr-for-multiple-displays-and-lots-of-improvements/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">January 30th</a>, NVIDIA have today put up a new stable driver release with 570.124.04. As a reminder following a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/nvidia-release-new-gpu-driver-updates-for-linux-and-windows-after-announcing-security-issues/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent security bulletin</a>, you'll want to ensure you're up to date.</p>
<p>Since the 570.86.16 Beta release these are the <strong>new</strong> changes for the stable driver:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that could prevent displays from being restored correctly when resuming from suspend on some systems with multiple displays.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression which stopped VRR from working on HDMI displays.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue which caused stuttering and performance issues when scrolling windows in Wayland with GSP firmware enabled.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that resulted in corruption or application crashes when using PRIME render offloading between two NVIDIA GPUs with modeset=1 enabled in nvidia-drm.</li>
<li>Added a new kernel module parameter, 'conceal_vrr_caps', to the nvidia-modeset kernel module. This parameter may be used to enable usage of features on some displays such as ULMB (Ultra Low Motion Blur) which are incompatible with VRR. See the "Direct Rendering Manager Kernel Modesetting" (DRM KMS) chapter of the README for further information.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>To save you a click and for those who didn't try the Beta, all these below are also included in 570.124.04 that were first released via the 570.86.16 Beta:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused the nvidia-settings control panel to crash when querying VRR attributes on some monitors.</li>
<li>Updated the nvidia-settings control panel to use NVML rather than NV-CONTROL to control GPU clocks and fan speed. This allows related functionality to work when using Wayland, where the NV-CONTROL X extension is not available. Note that as a result, some operations which were previously available to unprivileged users, due to the privileges of the X server, may now require elevated privileges.</li>
<li>Added support for VRR on systems with multiple displays.</li>
<li>Added an application profile to improve performance on Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</li>
<li>Added an application profile to resolve a corruption issue on Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Assassin's Creed Mirage.</li>
<li>Implemented support for the VK_KHR_incremental_present extension.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause some Vulkan applications to crash when responding to window resize events.</li>
<li>Updated GPU overclocking control to be available by default in nvidia-settings, for GPU boards that support programmable clock control. Previously, this was only available when bit 3 was set in the "Coolbits" X config option.</li>
<li>Disabled a power saving feature on Ada and above generation GPUs for surfaces allocated with the DRM Dumb-Buffers API, for example, when using a DRM fbdev. The power saving feature could cause black screens for DRM Dumb-Buffers which use front buffer rendering instead of KMS flips.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause some multi-threaded OpenGL applications, for example Civilization 6, to crash when running on Xwayland.</li>
<li>Added support for querying Dynamic Boost status via the 'power' file in /proc/driver/nvidia/gpus/*.</li>
<li>Enabled 32 bit compatibility support for the NVIDIA GBM backend.</li>
<li>Added a new kernel module parameter, 'conceal_vrr_caps', to the nvidia-modeset kernel module. This parameter may be used to enable usage of features on some displays such as ULMB (Ultra Low Motion Blur) which are incompatible with VRR. See the "Direct Rendering Manager Kernel Modesetting" (DRM KMS) chapter of the README for further information.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause games to crash when the "PROTON_ENABLE_NGX_UPDATER" environment variable was set to a value of "1".</li>
<li>Added /usr/share/nvidia/files.d/sandboxutils-filelist.json which lists all the driver files used by container runtime environments such as nvidia-container-toolkit and enroot.</li>
<li>Added support for the systemd suspend-then-hibernate method of system sleep. This feature requires systemd version 248 or newer.</li>
<li>Enabled the nvidia-drm fbdev=1 option by default. When supported by the kernel and the nvidia-drm modeset=1 option is enabled, nvidia-drm will replace the system's framebuffer console with one driven by DRM.<br/>
	This feature can be disabled by setting fbdev=0.</li>
<li>Implemented a feature that allows low latency display interrupts to be serviced even when the system is under heavy contention. This is especially useful for reducing stutter when using virtual reality.<br/>
	This feature is experimental and disabled by default.<br/>
	This feature can be enabled by loading nvidia.ko with the `NVreg_RegistryDwords=RMIntrLockingMode=1` kernel module parameter.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug, introduced in 555.58, where some DVI outputs would not work with HDMI monitors.</li>
<li>In Linux kernel 6.11, drm_fbdev_generic was renamed to drm_fbdev_ttm. Use drm_fbdev_ttm when present to keep supporting direct framebuffer access needed for Wayland compositors to present content on newer kernels.</li>
<li>In linux-next commit 446d0f4849b1, output_poll_changed is removed from struct drm_mode_config_funcs. Do not implement the function pointer member when not present to ensure the driver can compile with newer kernels. The driver now supports enumerating modes on hotplug events through the DRM fbdev API.</li>
<li>In linux-next commit 446d0f4849b1, intended to be included in Linux kernel 6.12, output_poll_changed is removed from struct drm_mode_config_funcs. Do not implement the function pointer member when not present to ensure the driver can compile with newer kernels. Populating modes for DRM connectors during hotplug events will not be supported with r535 and kernels containing the relevant commit.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause external displays to become frozen until the next modeset when using PRIME Display Offloading with the NVIDIA dGPU acting as the display offload sink.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Fallen Aces the crime noir FPS is now Steam Deck Verified with the Wheels of Steel update </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fallen Aces from Trey Powell, Jason Bond and New Blood Interactive looks awesome and now it should be even better. With the Wheels of Steel update there's been a few bits added, overhauled and now it's Steam Deck Verified too. If you're after an FPS that's a bit different then this is one to stick into your wishlist.</p>
<p>What is it? "The A.C.E.S, watchful guardians of Switchblade City, are being taken down, one by one. Now it's up to one man, with two fists, to get to the bottom of it all. Fallen Aces is a crime noir FPS that plays right out of the '90s and looks like it's right outta the comics."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13549989861740659411gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The big thing included in this update are the remade vehicle assets across the whole game so they should look a lot better. But there's plenty of smaller bits to it like new Tommy Gun animations, new punch and automatic pistol sound effects, improved enemy path calculations (plus other enemy character fixes) and lots of bug fixes. My favourite change though is that you can throw enemy bodies through breakable doors — sounds fun.</p>
<p>Additionally, for Steam Deck players, it's a good one too as it's now Steam Deck Verified! They've updated it to make some UI elements bigger, there's better controller navigation in some places, improved sliders and more.</p>
<p>Plenty more to come with Episode 2 "all storyboarded out and into production" but before that they're going to add in a Level Editor and Steam Workshop support.</p>

      <title>Valve updates the Steam Daily Deals program and gives some stats</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have done a little adjustment to the display of Steam Daily Deals to show more games. They also now give developers some more stats, and gave us all a bit of an overview.</p>
<p>For gamers the only real difference here is that they're bumping up the display from four to six games in total in the special offers section. The name is also a little deceptive, since it's not just a single day as the deals often run for quite a bit longer, which Valve said "We found that many of the platform effects of a game running a discount, particularly a featured discount such as the Daily Deal, causes a lot of additional visibility, buzz, and lift in sales for days following the initial day. Extending the discount to run for a week makes the promotion accessible to more players and allows the game to benefit from higher visibility on Top Sellers and other charts throughout Steam."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13069639071740651605gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Giving us some stats and background on it during 2024 they highlighted these points:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>2,843 games from 1,160 different developers and publishers were featured in Daily Deals.</li>
<li>These games came from developers in 68 different countries around the world.</li>
<li>Each game featured as a Daily Deal typically gets over 10 Million impressions on the Steam store during the one-day promotion.</li>
<li>Each Daily Deal spot can be focused on a single game, or can lead to a multi-game sale event. The largest multi-game sale event was the Czech &amp; Slovak Games Week, which featured 277 games from developers located in that region.</li>
<li>The range of revenue generated from the Daily Deal featuring is broad and depends on a lot of factors such as the age of the game, the discount percentage, the interest in the game, and so forth. We've seen games earn anywhere from ~$10,000 to $2,000,000.</li>
<li>87% of Daily Deals in 2024 were for games that had never previously been featured as a Daily Deal. Some were new releases while others were titles that we were now able to highlight as a result of the updates to our program.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For developers they've added a new post-promotion recap on the Steamworks dashboard, so developers can see how it did at a glance. There's also a new daily deal history section for developers to look back on.</p>
<p>How exactly do Valve decide what games to actually show to us all? Valve said they've refined it over time and they use a "prioritization algorithm", which is based on what you've played to match you up with the current games running a promotion. So you might see a list of deals that are different to others.  You'll see your daily deal picks across the Steam homepage as well as the tag / genre pages too.</p>
<p>Of course all the sales are available on the dedicated <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/specials" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">sales page</a> at any time.</p>

      <title>WB close F.E.A.R. and Shadow of Mordor dev Monolith Productions and other studios</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seriously tough times in the gaming industry, with even more publishers pulling back and closing studios. Now Warner Bros. have confirmed they've closed multiple studios.</p>
<p>First reported by Jason Schreier (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lizk5skwps2d" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>) of Bloomberg, and then later confirmed in an email to <a href="https://kotaku.com/monolith-productions-wonder-woman-multiversus-cancel-wb-1851766400" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Kotaku</a>. WB have closed Monolith Productions, Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games San Diego. These developers between them were responsible for creating F.E.A.R., Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, Middle-earth: Shadow of War, MultiVersus and many more.</p>
<p>The statement sent to Kotaku:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have had to make some very difficult decisions to structure our development studios and investments around building the best games possible with our key franchises -– Harry Potter, Mortal Kombat, DC and Game of Thrones. After careful consideration, we are closing three of our development studios – Monolith Productions, Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games San Diego. This is a strategic change in direction and not a reflection of these teams or the talent that consists within them.</p>
<p>The development of Monolith’s Wonder Woman videogame will not move forward. Our hope was to give players and fans the highest quality experience possible for the iconic character, and unfortunately this is no longer possible within our strategic priorities. This is another tough decision, as we recognize Monolith’s storied history of delivering epic fan experiences through amazing games. We greatly admire the passion of the three teams and thank every employee for their contributions. As difficult as today is, we remain focused on and excited about getting back to producing high-quality games for our passionate fans and developed by our world class studios and getting our Games business back to profitability and growth in 2025 and beyond.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Especially frustrating for gamers, because the really fun nemesis system from Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is patented and it seems WB are now doing nothing with it since the Wonder Woman game was cancelled that was reportedly going to use it. According to <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20160279522A1/en" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Google Patents</a>, WB own the patent until 2036.</p>
<p>Hopefully the people affected will find something again soon. There's been far too much of this happening over the last few years. It's ridiculous. So much knowledge being lost in the process. Developers and publishers can't expect to keep ever increasing their revenue, while losing a lot of the knowledge from the people actually responsible for doing the work.</p>

      <title>Valve&#39;s in-development Deadlock gets a huge map overhaul</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve's upcoming MOBA shooter Deadlock has received one of the biggest updates to date, which includes a big overhaul to the map that makes it a bit less complicated. While it's in development access is still locked behind invites.</p>
<p>Before this update there were four separate lanes to ride on the rails and battle through, with one of them being ripped out. Valve have redesigned a lot of the map to bring it down to three lanes, and I think they're onto something here. It's a bit more streamlined, less overwhelming and a bit quicker on the action thanks to it. The game is still pretty deep but a bit less crazy now.</p>
<p>The map layout change includes changes to "visuals, building layouts, pathways, neutral camps, air vents, breakables, powerup buffs, juke spots, mid boss" and so on. There's also a new Explore Map feature, so you can just run around the map to learn it now — very useful.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18527574251740579118gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Another major change is to some of the progression. Much like with Dota 2, you needed to get a last-hit in order to get the full benefit. This has been removed from Deadlock. Now the AI troopers will generate Soul Orbs for XP and currency as long as you're nearby, although you still need to shoot them to get the extras. Additionally, gaining souls from kills now has a visual effect of them flying towards you.</p>
<p>Various other technical additions in the update include support for DLSS, they upgraded FSR2 to AMD's new FSR3 temporal upscaler, Valve enabled NVIDIA Reflex and AMD Anti-Lag 2.0 for reduced latency, various netcode improvements and there's a lot of general smaller gameplay changes too. There's even a bunch of improvements for controller players to make it feel better. </p>
<p>See more in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1422450/view/530965072572320687" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update notes</a>. Hopefully it's not too far off becoming more open so anyone can just jump in and play.</p>

      <title>Dune: Awakening looks like it may be playable on Steam Deck - benchmark tested</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dune: Awakening is releasing May 20th from Funcom, and surprisingly it looks like it may actually be playable on the Steam Deck. That is, unless Funcom decide to put in some anti-cheat that blocks Linux. There's currently no anti-cheat mentioned on the Steam page. <em>I did email Funcom about any anti-cheat, and they haven't yet replied.</em></p>
<p>A benchmark mode has been made available for the upcoming MMO, so I gave it a test-run on an LCD Steam Deck to see how it went and the results actually surprised me. As long as you're not expecting a constant 60FPS and don't mind running on low details, you might be okay here.</p>
<p>First up testing on Low with FSR3 set to <u>Ultra Performance</u> resulted in all sections giving above 50FPS on average:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17065616361740575262gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17065616361740575262gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Changing over FSR3 to <u>Performance</u> still gave over 40FPS on average in all sections:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21043532121740575619gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21043532121740575619gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Also see how it went when setting FSR3 to <u>Balanced</u>. It's still getting averages above 40FPS in all parts:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1145948611740576003gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1145948611740576003gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>The real concern are the <em>minimums</em> though, which in all cases shows drops below 30FPS. It just depends how often it will dip in the full game.</p>
<p>I wouldn't recommend Frame Generation either. For a lot of games on Steam Deck it will bring up the overall FPS, but it destroys the Frame Timings making it a mess. Frame Generation is generally only good if the game is already able to perform to at least 60FPS.</p>
<p>If you actually locked it down to 30FPS, this might actually give a reasonable experience if you're wanting to play the brand new MMO on Steam Deck when it releases. It remains to be seen how the rest of the game fares though but this is at least somewhat promising from the benchmark.</p>

      <title>The Wipeout-like racer BallisticNG gets Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>That's another game with the green tick that you might want to pick up. BallisticNG is a Wipeout, Rollcage and Jet Moto inspired racer that's genuinely good. With the still in-development updates, it's now Steam Deck Verified. It also has Native Linux support.</p>
<p>For the best experience on Steam Deck though you do need to opt-in to the "development" Beta on Steam. This does highlight a bit of a flaw in Valve's Deck Verified rating system, as it already shows as Deck Verified on the Steam page despite needing the Beta.</p>
<p>As the developer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/473770/view/525335573256211983" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> on Steam "1.4 Dev 6" brings quite a lot of work. There's a lot of UI updates that went into this, with developer Neognosis noting how they've been "addressing feedback from both the community and Valve through the Steam Deck verification process". There's new standardized input prompt positions, campaign info pages are now tabs making understanding it easier, there's a controller events system, fixes to controller assignment, larger text sizing in some places and more.</p>
<p>Their most recent proper trailer is below:</p>

<p>Nice to see so many developers making their games better on Steam Deck, with a lot of the benefits just making the games better overall.</p>

      <title>X.Org X server and Xwayland have 8 more security vulnerabilities revealed</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You should probably keep an eye on your software updater, as the X.Org X server and Xwayland have more security vulnerabilities that have been announced.</p>
<p>The security advisory was <a href="https://lists.x.org/archives/xorg/2025-February/061894.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> to the xorg-announce mailing list on Tuesday, 25th February from developer Olivier Fourdan. A few hours later xorg-server v21.1.16 and xwayland v24.1.6 were released to deal with all of the reported issues. Hopefully distributions will get the updates in quickly.</p>
<p>Here's the listed issues:</p>
<p>CVE-2025-26594: Use-after-free of the root cursor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The root cursor is referenced in the xserver as a global variable. If a client manages to free the root cursor, the internal reference points to freed memory and causes a use-after-free.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CVE-2025-26595: Buffer overflow in XkbVModMaskText().</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The code in XkbVModMaskText() allocates a fixed sized buffer on the stack and copies the names of the virtual modifiers to that buffer.</p>
<p>The code however fails to check the bounds of the buffer correctly and would copy the data regardless of the size, which may lead to a buffer overflow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CVE-2025-26596: Heap overflow in XkbWriteKeySyms().</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The computation of the length in XkbSizeKeySyms() differs from what is actually written in XkbWriteKeySyms(), which may lead to a heap based buffer overflow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CVE-2025-26597: Buffer overflow in XkbChangeTypesOfKey().</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If XkbChangeTypesOfKey() is called with 0 group, it will resize the key symbols table to 0 but leave the key actions unchanged.<br/>
<br/>
If later, the same function is called with a non-zero value of groups, this will cause a buffer overflow because the key actions are of the wrong size.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CVE-2025-26598: Out-of-bounds write in CreatePointerBarrierClient().</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The function GetBarrierDevice() searches for the pointer device based on its device id and returns the matching value, or supposedly NULL if no match was found.<br/>
<br/>
However the code will return the last element of the list if no matching device id was found which can lead to out of bounds memory access.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CVE-2025-26599: Use of uninitialized pointer in compRedirectWindow().</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The function compCheckRedirect() may fail if it cannot allocate the backing pixmap. In that case, compRedirectWindow() will return a BadAlloc error without the validation of the window tree marked just before, which leaves the validate data partly initialized, and the use of an uninitialized pointer later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CVE-2025-26600: Use-after-free in PlayReleasedEvents().</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a device is removed while still frozen, the events queued for that device remain while the device itself is freed and replaying the events will cause a use after free.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CVE-2025-26601: Use-after-free in SyncInitTrigger().</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When changing an alarm, the values of the change mask are evaluated one after the other, changing the trigger values as requested and eventually, SyncInitTrigger() is called. If one of the changes triggers an error, the function will return early, not adding the new sync object. This can be used to cause a use after free when the alarm eventually<br/>
triggers.</p>

      <title>Fortune Avenue is a hyped-up fast-paced chaotic spin on Monopoly</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fortune Avenue is Monopoly but not as you know it. A hyped-up and colourful spin on the classic game, with a rather different way to play and it's highly competitive. Developed by Binogure Studio in <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot</a> on Linux, the same developer behind City Game Studio.</p>
<p>If you've ever played Monopoly you'll understand the basics. You each pick a character and move around the board, building up your collection of properties. Fortune Avenue is far more chaotic though with you all voting on various rules throughout the game, and you can even buy-up someone else's property if you have the monies for it. There's a fair amount of random events that happen during each game to keep you on your toes too, there's always something going on to keep you interested.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12758179531740566819gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Giving you the ability to buy-out others is quite fun, and frustrating at the same time. Nothing is safe in Fortune Avenue, especially when you get to spin the wheel of fortune, and end up with a card that allows you to free up any city to remove a building. You can really mess with others in it.</p>
<p>There's a demo available for Steam Next Fest that's definitely worth checking out. With Native Linux support it works great. I think Fortune Avenue could end up being a favourite, especially as we don't see a lot of board-game styled titles like this and it's a genuinely fun twist on a classic.</p>
<p>Valve have also rated it Steam Deck Verified as of the latest updates to it. Nice to see that ahead of release.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Dynamic Board Elements: From melting ice floes to bustling airports, every corner of the board holds a surprise.</li>
<li>Strategic Rule Voting: Every 12 dice rolls, players vote on new rules that can drastically alter the game's dynamics.</li>
<li>Speed Up Mechanism: A helicopter targets the poorest players, ensuring a fast-paced game that minimizes frustration.</li>
<li>Elimination Bonus: Gain a $100K bonus for each player you eliminate, adding a competitive edge.</li>
<li>Anti-Cheat Measures: With physics-based dice and wheel of fortune, plus advanced obfuscation and VAC, the integrity of the game is maintained.</li>
<li>Rich Multiplayer Experience: Peer-to-peer connectivity with a robust recovery mechanism ensures seamless gameplay.</li>
<li>Diverse Game Pieces and Boards: Choose from 12 unique pieces and explore 4 different themed boards.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Maze Mice feels like Pac-Man and Survivor-like Bullet Heavens had a baby</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Survivor-like bullet heavens are are all the rage right now from Vampire Survivors to Brotato and everything in between. Maze Mice answers the question no one asked: what if it was like Pac-Man?</p>
<p>Saying Pac-Man and the bullet heaven survivor games had a baby here really is the most accurate way I could describe it, and after spending a bunch of time with the demo I am absolutely hooked on the idea. Made by TrampolineTales in <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot</a>, the same developer who gave us the excellent Luck be a Landlord.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8690193901740566021gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Much like the Pac, you go through a little maze picking up orbs along the way while trying to avoid cats (you're a mouse). In true survivor-like style these orbs give you experience to level up, and then pick some abilities. These abilities can give you all sorts of powers like auto-firing projectiles, leaving a path of fire behind you to take down some cats and more.</p>
<p>It has a time-stop mechanic too, so there's absolutely no rush, it's surprisingly chill. Nothing moves until you do.</p>
<p>Try out the Steam Next Fest Demo it's well worth your time.</p>

      <title>Framework announce the Framework Desktop, Framework Laptop 12 and upgraded Framework Laptop 13</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Framework continue doing some really impressive stuff with their modular approach to hardware, and they just had a big event to reveal the Framework Desktop, Framework Laptop 12 and an upgraded Framework Laptop 13.</p>
<p>An especially interesting event for Linux fans too, with Framework founder Nirav Patel giving their Linux compatibility a shout-out on stage at the event on how they "design deliberately for Linux compatibility". Linux support was mentioned multiple times during the event, and in the Desktop segment there was even a direct shout-out for Bazzite and Playtron with both of them having demos at the event too. According to Patel, 2025 is "truly the year of the Linux gaming desktop".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20107925681740563510gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The upgraded Framework Laptop 13 brings with it AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series, a revamped thermal system, a new keyboard and there's also new Bezel and Expansion Card colour options. They said that "any Framework Laptop 13 owner, going all the way back to the original 11th Gen Intel Core version in 2021, can pick up the new modules and upgrade". This is expected to ship in April.</p>
<p>Another fun one is the newly announced Framework Laptop 12. This is a convertible (foldable) touchscreen notebook, that takes the repairability and upgradability they're known for and puts it all into a smaller lower-cost device. This is expected to ship mid-2025.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18864005401740563554gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>One I'm very interested in though is the Framework Desktop. A really small Mini-ITX desktop powered by AMD Ryzen AI Max processors. Desktops are <em>already</em> modular though but they said how they wanted to "make this space as accessible as we possibly can by building a desktop that is simultaneously small and simple and incredibly powerful and customizable". More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Framework Desktop’s Ryzen AI Max-powered Mainboard is a standard Mini-ITX form factor with ATX headers, a PCIe x4 slot, and a broad set of rear I/O (including 2x USB4, 2x DisplayPort, HDMI, and 5Gbit Ethernet), so you can drop it into your own case if you prefer. We developed a semi-custom 400W power supply with FSP in a standard Flex ATX form factor. We use standard 120mm CPU fans with a thermal system co-developed with Cooler Master and Noctua, and you can choose to bring your own fan as well if you prefer. We enabled two PCIe NVME M.2 2280 slots for up to 16TB of storage and Wi-Fi 7 through an RZ717 Wi-Fi module.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Plenty of customization is enabled on the desktop too along with a carrying handle to move it around, as it really is small. They even make use of their Expansion Card system from Framework Laptops, with two slots on the front of it available for front port customization. A downside here is that the LPDDR5x is soldered on, as working with AMD they said how they "ultimately determined that it wasn’t technically feasible to land modular memory at high throughput with the 256-bit memory bus". Not cheap though, starting at £1,135 for the AMD Ryzen AI Max 385 model with 32GB RAM and that's <em>without</em> storage or a CPU fan. First shipments expected early Q3 2025.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck Folio is a slim protective travel cover that doubles up as a stand</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's a lot of different stands and protective cases for the Steam Deck, all with their own unique selling point and the Steam Deck Folio looks like another interesting option. Coming soon to Kickstarter, one of the designers involved emailed over details about it.</p>
<p>Compatible with the LCD and OLED Steam Deck it covers up and protects the screen, locks the sticks in place and can double up as a stand as well. It's really slim so it doesn't take up much room at all, which is great for space conscious travellers. It even fits inside Valve's travel case for that extra bit of protection and still fits into a dock while attached.</p>
<p>I did have a concern about the attachment system since it uses magnets, and we've seen big issues with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/project-killswitch-sales-suspended-as-the-kickstand-messed-with-the-steam-deck-fan/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">magnets messing with the Steam Deck fans</a> (and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/stop-mixing-magnets-with-the-steam-deck-or-face-fan-and-temperature-troubles/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">another</a>) in the past. Remembering those issues, I spoke to their team about it and they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In regards to magnets, the Dbrand Project Killswitch placed powerful magnets very near to the central fan hub itself.</p>
<p>The magnets used in the Steam Deck Folio are positioned so as to not interfere with the fan.<br/>
We have performed practical testing and magnetic field strength analysis on Steam Decks with both Delta and Huaying fans without issue.</p>
<p>In addition we will continue to perform more testing as we move through the development process, if the Kickstarter is successful.</p>

      <title>Simple GOG client for Linux, Minigalaxy v1.3.2 released with improved game installs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you prefer to buy your games for Linux on <a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>, there's a fresh update to Minigalaxy, the open source simple GOG client.</p>
<p>Compared with the likes of Lutris and Heroic Games Launcher that bundle lots of features and different stores, Minigalaxy has a singular focus — getting your <a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> games simply and easily on Linux. Either Native Linux games or Windows games with Wine.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5098355631740487620gol1.png"/></p>
<p>The major changes in Minigalaxy version 1.3.2 include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Completely reworked windows wine installation. This should solve a lot of problems with failing game installs. Innoextract (if installed) is only used to detect and configure the installation language. (thanks to GB609)</li>
<li>Variables and arguments in game settings can now contain blanks when quoted shell-style (thanks to GB609)</li>
<li>Minigalaxy will now create working Desktop Shortcuts for wine games (thanks to GB609)</li>
<li>Fix games with binaries in a directory not launching in some cases</li>
<li>Minor UI change in the dialog for third-party logins (thanks to GB609)</li>
<li>Desktop shortcuts created by Minigalaxy will now be updated with environment and launch argument changes from the game's property dialog when OK is clicked (thanks to GB609)</li>
<li>Clean-up and fixes of the code used for grid and list style library views (thanks to GB609)</li>
<li>Desktop shortcuts for windows games can now have icons, if gog provides them in the game info api 'images' section (thanks to GB609)</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in download_manager that prevents correct resume of downloads with 50%+ progress after restart (thanks to GB609)</li>
<li>Make sure all translations are included in releases</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see the project has picked up another developer, GB609, who did a lot of work for this release.</p>

      <title>Happy three years to the Steam Deck - the Linux gaming machine that changed everything</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's been <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/steam-deck-initial-review/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">three years today</a> since Valve released the Steam Deck. Not only has Valve shown how incredible Linux actually can be as a gaming platform, but they really kicked the industry into gear on PC gaming handhelds.</p>
<p>What a success it's been! Selling multiple millions, although we don't know the exact number since Valve don't really like to talk in such specifics. And we're closing in on 18,000 games rated at least Playable (although the rating system is a bit off at times), that's a whole lot of gaming you can do from the comfort of your couch, on the bus, the toilet — wherever.</p>
<p>During this time Valve have released <strong>14</strong> major updates to Proton, the compatibility layer that runs Windows games on Linux systems like SteamOS / Steam Deck. Going from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/proton-7-easy-anti-cheat-improvements-more-games-for-linux-a-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 7.0-1</a> in February 2022 just before the Steam Deck release up to the latest <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-4</a> in December 2024. The progress on game compatibility has been impressive (although anti-cheat is still a real problem). That's only counting numbered Proton updates too, there's plenty more that have gone into Proton Experimental and Proton Hotfix in between. <em>If you're confused on the different Proton versions <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">be sure to read my guide</a>.</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">We've seen some huge updates to SteamOS Linux during this time too. Going back through all the updates since the original release we've seen Valve add the likes of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Per-app performance profiles.</li>
<li>HDR, VRR and display colour settings.</li>
<li>Game recording.</li>
<li>A lock screen for security.</li>
<li>Refresh rate switcher.</li>
<li>A window switcher for when games have multiple windows (like launchers remaining open).</li>
<li>Night Mode.</li>
<li>Enabled customization of the performance overlay.</li>
<li>An improved Offline Mode (it used to require a reboot).</li>
<li>Major version updates to the KDE Plasma Desktop Mode.</li>
<li>Improvements for docking the Steam Deck like display interface scaling.</li>
<li>Various performance improvements and GPU driver upgrades.</li>
<li>Support for Bluetooth A2DP and BAP profiles.</li>
<li>Mura Compensation.</li>
<li>Added support for some HDMI CEC features to their official Dock.</li>
<li>Added overclocking controls on Steam Deck LCD.</li>
<li>+ so much more.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's just me cherry-picking additions in some big SteamOS updates, we've also seen some huge upgrades to the Steam Client as a whole too, a lot of which the Steam Deck has also benefited from. You certainly can't say Valve have been sitting around - they're always doing <em>something</em>. Who can also forget the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/steam-deck-oled-is-just-pure-joy-the-definitive-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Deck OLED release</a>, Valve's definitive edition of the handheld with <em><strong>masses</strong></em> of improvements.</p>
<p>With Valve showing the way, we've seen an explosion in the number of different PC gaming handhelds too. Previously limited to smaller high-priced vendors, it's all become a lot more accessible. Valve <em>proved</em> there's a market for it. While others have been chasing refreshes with improved specifications, and at times ludicrous prices, the Steam Deck has soldiered on to be more of a dedicated platform. We've seen the ASUS ROG Ally and ASUS ROG Ally X, Lenovo Legion Go and Lenovo Legion Go S, Acer Nitro Blaze 7, 8 and 11, ZOTAC Zone, MSI Claw A1M and the MSI Claw 8 AI+. <em>That's on top of the constant refreshes from other smaller vendors.</em></p>
<p>One day hopefully we will see another Steam Machine / Steam Console. I had some thoughts on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/what-valve-would-need-to-do-to-make-a-steam-console-a-success/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">what Valve could do to make such a thing a success this time</a>. I'm also especially looking forward to the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">upcoming public Beta of SteamOS 3</a> to see what people and other hardware vendors do with it.</p>
<p><strong>Happy Steam Deck Day everyone.</strong></p>

      <title>SteamDB now lets you filter out Steam games with AI Generation</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you don't want Steam games that have AI Generation in them, you might want to check out the new filter on SteamDB. Making it a bit easier to get rid of them from your searches. <em>ICYMI: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/indie-devs-have-begun-adding-a-no-generative-ai-stamp-to-their-store-pages/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Indie devs have begun adding a no generative AI stamp to their store pages</a>.</em></p>
<p>This new filter depends on the AI disclosures that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/valve-announces-new-rules-for-games-with-ai-content-on-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve require</a> developers to put on their Steam pages, so it's only as accurate as the developers who actually fill it out accurately.</p>
<p>On any of the lists on SteamDB, you need to open the "Filter by user tags" sidebar section and enter in "AI Content Disclosed" and then either pick to have them or not. Example shot below of the <a href="https://steamdb.info/sales/event/714486390316859705/?displayOnly=Demo&amp;sort=online_desc&amp;tagid=-1368160" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB Steam Next Fest page</a> filtered to just demos, and no AI content:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14328770431740479113gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14328770431740479113gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Hopefully Valve directly will soon add a proper filter to Steam for this. But until then, the community site <a href="https://steamdb.info/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> keeps showing how useful it can be.</p>
<p>Activision also recently (finally) admitted it uses AI for Call of Duty, with the Call of Duty <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1938090/Call_of_Duty/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> page now having an AI content disclosure that reads "Our team uses generative AI tools to help develop some in game assets". Players have spotted a few places where it was likely used for cosmetics like some loading screens and player calling cards but Activision haven't specified where it's used. If the likes of Activision can't get away from disclosing it on Steam, hopefully Valve will keep ensuring more developers list it properly.</p>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 Classic is coming to Steam thanks to Valve adding TF2 to the Source SDK</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Team Fortress 2 Classic, a mod that aims to re-imagine the early post-launch era of Team Fortress 2, will be released on Steam.</p>
<p>Recently we had the news that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/team-fortress-2-major-update-released-and-source-available-for-modders-via-the-source-sdk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve had effectively made Team Fortress 2 "Source Available"</a>, as it's now part of the Source SDK. In the announcement Valve said developers would be able to release their mods on Steam, and so it's happening. A new Team Fortress 2 Classic Steam page has been put up, although there's no date listed on it other than 2025.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8893674131740477792gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>More about it from the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Team Fortress 2 Classic</strong> is a mod for Team Fortress 2 that re-imagines the early post-launch era — circa 2008 to 2009 — of the original game. Starting from there, we've added quality-of-life features, remade and reworked scrapped content, and built onto it with full-size updates in homage to TF2's timeless style and tone.</p>
<p><strong>NEW-OLD FEATURES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Meet the Civilian, a brand-new special class based on the legacy Team Fortress Classic character, and deliver him mostly-unharmed to the objective in VIP mode.</li>
<li>Use TF2 prerelease-inspired weapons like the Nailgun, the Dynamite Pack, and the Tranquilizer Gun, all redesigned from the ground up to feel right at home with what's already there.</li>
<li>Go on a rampage in Four-Team matches, where GRN and YLW bring their unique (yet strangely identical) brand of violence to Arena, King of the Hill, and more.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NEW-NEW FEATURES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Exclusive new gamemodes, including Domination, Territorial Domination, and VIP Race — all playable on professional-quality official maps, with more yet to come.</li>
<li>Jump pads, flak cannons, bricks, chains wrapped around your fists; made-in-house weapons that go beyond mere sidegrades, and dramatically change how you play the game.</li>
<li>Extensive modding support, allowing players to customize the look of their game, and allowing servers to host advanced custom weapon packs and maps.</li>
<li>A whole host of visual enhancements, including improved textures, models, mapping features, and restored toon-style shading that was mostly absent in the retail release.</li>
<li>A chicken, or so we're led to believe.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developers of the mod likely have to port over their changes to the newer SDK, so it may still be a while until the Steam release is available.</p>

      <title>Seriously clever twin-stick shooter Windowkill adds Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Windowkill is a twin-stick shooter where the game window itself is constantly closing in on you. A really clever idea, and a game I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/windowkill-is-a-clever-multi-window-twin-stick-shooter-that-moves-around-your-screen/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">had a lot of fun with previously</a> and now it has improved Steam Deck support too.</p>
<p>In the 1 year anniversary update that's now available, the developer mentioned it's now Steam Deck Verified, with Valve giving it the rating on February 11th on the Native Linux version (made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot</a>).</p>
<p>New feature highlight for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2726450/view/501691675000703296" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update 4.0.5</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added custom asset refresh button
	<ul>
<li>This will reload custom asset files in the current tab, without needing to reload the game</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added "now playing" popup when shuffle is enabled
	<ul>
<li>Includes a toggle option to disable</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added "drag aid windows by center" option
	<ul>
<li>When enabled, this allows moving peer and drain without needing to click on the titlebar</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added new menu window to "friend"
	<ul>
<li>This allows toggling visibility, changing colors, and quitting to the title</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added a new audio visualization background type, and example background "thump"</li>
<li>Added challenge run icon to the in-game UI</li>
<li>Added "UI text scale" option</li>
<li>Added new "steamdeck" window theme</li>
<li>Added Steam Deck-specific controller input icons</li>
<li>Added silly anniversary-only crown change</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you've not seen it before the trailer is below:</p>

<p>I was curious how this would actually look on Steam Deck. As when you think about it, this game was really designed for a desktop PC. The whole idea of having multiple windows like that is not something you would see with how you usually interact with the Steam Deck in Gaming Mode.</p>
<p>So I gave it a fresh spin today to see how it was done and actually — it's still just as <em>brilliant</em> on Steam Deck. The window mechanic with how it's implemented works really well here too, even with the smaller screen.</p>

<p>Worth picking up for sure, it's challenging but a lot of fun.</p>

      <title>The Talos Principle: Reawakened launches in April with a demo live</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the best puzzle games ever returns! Croteam and Devolver Digital have announced The Talos Principle: Reawakened is set for launch on April 10, and there's a demo you can try out right now too as part of Steam Next Fest. <em>You'll need Proton to play this one on Linux.</em></p>
<p>The demo at least won't be leaving when Next Fest ends, as they've said it will be up until release. Remade with Unreal Engine 5, hopefully the performance on this one won't be problematic like a lot of recent UE games are (although Epic Games are making steps to help). This version of the game also includes a powerful in-game editor for modders.</p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Talos Principle: Reawakened introduces new content, enhanced gameplay, and a gorgeously upgraded presentation. Relive the critically acclaimed expansion Road to Gehenna and dive into an all-new chapter, In the Beginning. Discover the story of Alexandra Drennan as she faces profound existential questions while orchestrating the Simulation's first critical test, challenging players to think deeply about the human condition.</p>

      <title>Steam Next Fest - February 2025 is live with tons of demos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has launched Steam Next Fest, another good opportunity for you to jump in and test some upcoming games that runs through until March 3rd. You'll be able to download demos, watch developer livestreams and more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FS4oFuM8zGw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/83f72d88494d48fedfc1d266efa6ca27.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FS4oFuM8zGw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Thanks to Valve's Proton, most of the demos should run on Linux without you even needing to check. Unless they have some kernel-level anti-cheat forced on them or other strange Windows behaviour not implemented in Proton yet.</p>
<p>Personally, I was quite excited for <strong>Mecha BREAK</strong> but the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/anti-cheat-stops-mecha-break-running-on-desktop-linux-but-works-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat is problematic</a> with how it blocks Desktop Linux. Although it does allow people to play on Steam Deck. <strong>RoadCraft</strong> is another I was excited about but it's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/sadly-the-roadcraft-demo-is-currently-broken-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sadly broken across Steam Deck and Desktop Linux</a>.</p>
<p>Another I checked out early was <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1811340/Spray_Paint_Simulator/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Spray Paint Simulator</a></strong>. It's like the direct opposite of PowerWash Simulator and worked perfectly with the latest <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-4</a>. Instead of cleaning up you're preparing with tape and papering over things you don't want painted, to then make a big mess everywhere. Something about it is just <em>incredibly</em> therapeutic and I want more of it — a lot more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3388142281740411083gol1.jpg"><br/>
<em>Pictured - Spray Paint Simulator on Linux</em></img></p>
<p>At the complete opposite end of the genre spectrum is <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3351700/The_First_Berserker_Khazan_Demo/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The First Berserker</a></strong>, a hardcore action RPG souls-like. It's a lot more demanding of your attention and the demo runs <em>beautifully</em> too. So much so that it's gained a Very Positive user rating on Steam. This is not usually a genre I would go for but the visuals and the world really do look great, and it's impressive from a performance look as well with it being silky smooth. Definitely worth a shot if you're in the mood for some sword swinging with good visuals.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5602857951740412531gol1.jpg"/><br/>

<p>Another shout out for <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3265960/Adventures_of_a_Cat_in_Space/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Adventures of a Cat in Space</a></strong> (Native Linux) because it's really sweet. If you love point and click adventures, it's one for you. Just don't blame me if the theme song gets stuck in your head. It randomly pops into mine at least once a day since testing out the demo <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/adventures-of-a-cat-in-space-is-an-upcoming-musical-adventure-starring-arthur-darvill/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously</a>.</p>

<em>Pictured - Adventures of a Cat in Space (from the Steam page)</em></p>
<p>Being a big fan of the original extreme sports game Descenders, I think <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2375530/Descenders_Next/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Descenders Next</a></strong> could turn out to be another great one. This time with the addition of a few different board sports in addition to bikes, it's a whole lot bigger and better. So far it runs great on Linux too (and they just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2375530/view/750515187597967691" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> a release date with it getting Steam Deck Verified). <em>They <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2375530/discussions/0/597393615056061535/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">need to fix</a> the demo launch options right now though.</em></p>

<p>Another pick for those who like things a bit more chill is <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2355150/Mudborne_Frog_Management_Sim/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Mudborne: Frog Management Sim</a></strong> (Native Linux). A game about running around capturing and breeding frogs. From the developer of beekeeping sim APICO, this is high up on my list of wants.</p>

<p>I personally find these big events more than a little overwhelming. I fear I'm missing out on so much because masses of developers choose to only have their demos up for such a limited amount of time. I'll continue highlighting games and demos during the event, just like I do every day if there's some I spot that are particularly interesting. Check out the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/Demo/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Demo article tag</a> for any previous and future coverage.</p>
<p>Be sure to also join us on <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Discord</a> to easily share more games you find.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Next Fest</a>. The event runs through until March 3rd.</p>

      <title>Sadly the RoadCraft demo is currently broken on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>At least on AMD systems like Steam Deck and my Desktop Linux install, it seems like the demo of RoadCraft from Saber Interactive / Focus Entertainment is quite broken. Shame, as this is one of the games I am currently most excited about from the team behind the popular SnowRunner.</p>
<p>On my Desktop Linux install (Kubuntu 24.10) tested across Proton 9 and Proton Experimental, it will completely lock up my system when trying to enter into a mission. This has been tested numerous times now and it just doesn't work. It could well be a RADV Mesa driver bug, I don't have an NVIDIA system to test.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck also has a similar problem, although it's more graceful where it will crash and quit back to the Steam Library.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1004374181740419964gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I've <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/8474" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted a bug report with Valve</a> including some logs, so hopefully a resolution can be found. For now, it appears this one is a no-go, but at least with the demo we've been able to catch the issue before the full launch which is due May 20th so it's not far off.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck SteamOS 3.6.22 brings a fix for pre-compiled shader downloads</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve just released a tiny SteamOS 3.6.22 "Volcanic Activity" Beta for Steam Deck, which includes a fix for a rather annoying issue. You need to be in either the <em>Beta</em> or <em>Preview</em> update channels to receive this update before it's rolled out for everyone.</p>
<p>The only <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/519706073503894113?snr=2___" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">listed</a> change is "Fixed a recent regression where pre-compiled shaders wouldn't be downloaded", an issue I saw reported by quite a few people across various social media channels. Nice to see it sorted.</p>
<p>This follows on from the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/steam-deck-steamos-3-6-21-released-fixing-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-eyes-and-security-bugs/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.6.21 stable update released earlier in February</a>, which fixed some security issues and Indiana Jones eye rendering. If you missed it Valve also <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/proton-hotfix-updated-to-fix-marvel-rivals-and-indiana-jones-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">updated Proton Hotfix to fix Marvel Rivals and Indiana Jones</a> on Steam Deck / Linux.</p>
<p>I must admit, every time I see a SteamOS update I get a little excited that it might finally be the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">public SteamOS 3 Beta that Valve have been planning</a>. Hopefully that will come soonish.</p>

      <title>Anti-cheat stops Mecha BREAK running on Desktop Linux but works on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here we go again. One game I was excited about was the upcoming Mecha BREAK, which currently has a playtest demo on Steam but they've added in anti-cheat.</p>
<p>Specifically it's using the Kernel Level "Anti-Cheat Expert (ACE)" as noted on the Steam page for the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2870990/Mecha_BREAK_Demo/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">demo</a>. On Desktop Linux the launcher can appear, but the game will <em>not</em> actually load at all. The Start button can be clicked in the launcher, and it acts like it's going to load but after a while it will go back to saying Start. Nothing actually loads up apart from the launcher. <em>After getting the launcher to load once, it then wouldn't load up again after.</em></p>
<p>However, they are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2452280/view/503943474819629074" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">planning</a> Steam Deck support where they said: "Mecha BREAK is not yet fully optimized for Steam Deck. We're actively working on improvements to ensure smoother gameplay in the future". Right now, it <em>does</em> actually load up on Steam Deck, go in-game and is fully playable.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21225575111740407062gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21225575111740407062gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Mecha BREAK on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12252002101740407963gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12252002101740407963gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12678129341740407964gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12678129341740407964gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Mecha BREAK on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>On Steam Deck with the default settings it runs at an <em>acceptable</em> 30FPS out of the box and does actually feel pretty good in the combat without any tweaks needed. Numerous parts of the UI are too small though, especially the button icons, and due to the FSR the visuals can be a little on the blurry side due to the lower resolution.</p>
<p>Apart from that though, the gameplay is genuinely good fun. No issues going through the whole tutorial (picture above), and then playing online with others as well (pictured below).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17729914671740408775gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17729914671740408775gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Mecha BREAK on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>Back to the other side though: the desktop Linux problem seems like the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/delta-force-developer-mentions-they-will-look-at-supporting-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">same issue with Delta Force</a> which also uses Anti-Cheat Expert (ACE). It appears to approve the Steam Deck hardware directly, which is why it works there but doesn't work on desktop Linux.</p>
<p>This separation of desktop Linux and Steam Deck will end up quite problematic in the long-run, if a better solution isn't found. Especially with more devices coming with SteamOS like the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/lenovo-legion-go-s-with-valves-steamos-is-official-expected-to-launch-in-may/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lenovo Legion Go S</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve planning a public SteamOS 3 Beta</a> for people to try on other handhelds. Seems like we may need to add a Steam Deck only tag to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat compatibility page</a> if this continues.</p>

      <title>Evolution sim Thrive adds radioactive chunks, environmental tolerances and thermosynthesis</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The open source and cross-platform evolution sim Thrive has added in some even more advanced gameplay elements, making it a whole lot more interesting. Survival is very much the name of the game here, evolution is a tough business and you start off at the bottom. Much like the classic Spore from EA, the microscopic stage is full of features. But they're still working on the later game.</p>
<p>Some big new features have been added in Thrive 0.8.1 including environmental tolerances, meaning you need to adapt to different conditions across the planet. There's new radiation-eating cells, be wary of the green lights, it's pretty — but may be deadly. You can adapt to eat away at the radioactive chunks though. There's even a new full thermosynthesis implementation meaning you can use temperature to generate energy, although this feature is only in non-LAWK (life as we know it) games which you can pick when you start a new game.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1wqj45ZsTmk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d83994640f92276a6cf474574f55f6ce.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1wqj45ZsTmk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some other new bits in this release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added microbe background blur and enabled distortion effect by default.</li>
<li>Added an option to select between the different fullscreen modes supported by Godot Engine. When using exclusive fullscreen mode this fixes a one pixel border problem on Windows.</li>
<li>Late multicellular was split into its own full stage: Macroscopic.</li>
<li>Implemented multicellular organism statistics panel.</li>
<li>Various improvements to auto-evo to allow it to evolve new organelles / upgrades. And improved the microbe AI to be able to use newer features of the game.</li>
<li>Fixes to the organelle suggestions feature to make it not suggest the nucleus too early.</li>
<li>Improved cell image generation to make it less likely for the images to be cutoff.</li>
<li>Tutorial and Thriveopedia tips page improvements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>How fun is it? Right now, that's difficult to answer. It's a somewhat complicated game, it takes quite a while to learn and since the game evolves with you it's quite different every time. That, and every update brings in major new additions to it. Thoroughly interesting though and it has some really unique ideas, and more depth than pretty much any other evolution sim I've ever seen.</p>

      <title>Indie devs have begun adding a no generative AI stamp to their store pages</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AI this, AI that - you can't go anywhere without something trying to force AI on you. Usually a company trying to get you to buy into what they've wasted billions on. So indie devs have begun fighting back with their No Gen AI Seal.</p>
<p>There's an increasing amount of developers using some form of AI generation from small developers to the AAA lot that I keep spotting recently, and so you might want to pick some out that are actually 100% human made. While Steam (being the easiest example) does have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/valve-announces-new-rules-for-games-with-ai-content-on-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">newer rules around AI disclosures</a>, these are buried at the bottom of store pages and can be pretty easy to miss.</p>
<p>One way would be for developers to put a big badge on a store page to show off their human side, and that's exactly what some indie developers have chosen to start doing.</p>
<p>Announced by Alex Kanaris-Sotiriou of Polygon Treehouse (Mythwrecked &amp; Röki) on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kanaratron.bsky.social/post/3li7t5wpc7s2l" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, they've launched the free to use <a href="https://www.polygon-treehouse.com/no-gen-ai-seal" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">No Gen AI Seal</a> available via the Polygon Treehouse website. Writing about why it can be problematic the website states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Generative AI is a technology that can create pictures, movies, audio (music or voice action) and writing using artificial intelligence. The issue is that these generative technologies are trained on existing works by human artists who have not given their permission, or been compensated, for their work being utilised. Essentially their work has been stolen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The seal looks like this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3681015101740399006gol1.png"/></p>
<p>You can see it on the store pages for the likes of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2000210/Mythwrecked_Ambrosia_Island/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Mythwrecked: Ambrosia Island</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1226670/Rosewater/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Rosewater</a> and more in the sidebar.</p>
<p>Perhaps in future we might see stores add specific filters to select "No Gen AI". It's clearly a growing market though, which is what pushed Valve to add their new disclosure rules, and we're likely to see a whole lot more games use generative AI as time goes on. It's going to get more messy and confusing for consumers as time goes on, at least until the ridiculous bubble finally bursts.</p>
<p>There's a lot of silliness going around like how <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/phil-spencer-of-microsoft-gaming-thinks-generative-ai-will-help-game-preservation/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Phil Spencer of Microsoft Gaming thinks generative AI will help game preservation</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/take-two-ceo-believes-ai-will-actually-increase-employment-and-productivity/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Take-Two CEO believing AI will increase employment and productivity</a>. Going by the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/gdc-2025-survey-shows-pc-game-development-growing-with-lots-interested-in-valves-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest 2025 GDC Survey</a> there's clearly a lot of developers concerned about it and plenty working in companies currently using it.</p>

      <title>The tactical FPS &#39;Due Process&#39; anti-cheat now supports Linux - plus it has a huge discount</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Due Process from developer Giant Enemy Crab uses Easy Anti-Cheat that previously blocked Linux (and so Steam Deck too), but they've now enabled Linux players to jump in. Commenting on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dueprocess/comments/1ivk6cg/comment/me67czg/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Reddit</a> a developer directly mentioned "We pushed an update to the servers yesterday that should allow Linux users using Proton to connect".</p>
<p>The game just recently had a big update too, and it has a 94% discount on Steam until March 5, so this seems like the perfect time to jump in and play.</p>
<p>See the most recent update trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="oHi8G6iXFg0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1df80afd7421c417751e743fd1ca8ff5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/oHi8G6iXFg0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Due Process is a tactical FPS about planning and teamwork that rewards communication with teammates, allows players to draw a "playbook" directly onto the map during the planning phases, and presents a novel situation each play session thanks to a bounty of procedurally generated, hand-curated maps.</p>
<p>Fresh maps make Due Process great. Levels are built in-house via a procedurally assisted level generation process and are delivered weekly via steam update, which means you won't be playing on the same stale level. Our level designers edit each level before it goes out and are constantly trying new concepts.</p>
<p>Teamwork starts with a goal. Discuss your strategy over voice chat, and use the planning phase to draw up a plan of attack. Deploy your assets wisely over the course of three rounds, as anything fielded from your armory won't come back if destroyed or lost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They're also doing an AMA (Ask me anything) on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dueprocess/comments/1iwrr6g/due_process_ama_with_jett_and_tetra_at_6pm_gmt/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Reddit</a> today at 9PM UTC.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Linux anti-cheat compatibility page</a> was updated to list it.</p>

      <title>Feed the demons, don&#39;t fight them in the deckbuilder Hungry Horrors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you love deck-builders? Hungry Horrors is quite an inventive take on the genre where instead of fighting them, you cook for them! <em>Another one made with <a href="https://godotengine.org" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot</a>.</em></p>
<p>Your deck of cards are built up from various recipes you learn, giving you access to throw various meals at the horrors that await you. For each creature you need to fill them up to satisfy them, before they get too close to slay you and then you're back in the kitchen.</p>
<p>There's some fun game mechanics here like certain foods causing creatures to crave something, and if you manage to get them to eat what they crave you'll get a bonus. It's a race against turns though, as they will gradually step closer towards you. Much like Slay the Spire, it will tell you what the enemy creature plans to do on the next turn, giving you a chance to prepare.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="jOV7f-G-pic"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d05fb4aa35856a8a8603b56025eafe78.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/jOV7f-G-pic" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's not just the creatures that get hungry though, you do too. You have to balance their hunger bar with your own as you progress through each battle. So your meal cards can also be used on your own character, as well as the enemy, but feeding yourself stops you feeding them in the same turn. Certain creatures really like certain dishes too, which you'll learn as you play through to get bonuses.</p>
<p>Really fun idea. Lots to enjoy about it. Looking forward to seeing this one expand.</p>
<p>There's an early Alpha available on the itch store. Can also be tested in the browser.</p>

      <title>Morrowind game engine OpenMW gearing up for a huge new 0.49 release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Currently in the Release Candidate stage, Morrowind open source game engine OpenMW is getting ready for a huge new release. OpenMW is cross-platform and enables you to play Morrowind nicely on modern systems, with plenty of enhancements.</p>
<p>Their team recently put up an <a href="https://openmw.org/2025/openmw-0-49-0-rc-bringing-you-up-to-speed/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> to go over some details noting how it's the "largest release yet, having been in development since August 2022". One of the big changes they noted is to combat mechanics as they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>0.49.0 makes some large steps towards making melee combat reimplementation accurate to Morrowind. Importantly, it moves melee target evaluation from the point of impact to the moment of weapon release. This is necessary to ensure the correct audiovisual feedback for missed hits.<br/>
We do not intend to meaningfully overhaul or redesign the classical experience of Morrowind, and we believe it would best be handled by mods from the community. It is currently planned for combat dehardcoding to be a focus in 0.5X releases, which would allow scripts to overhaul it, and for certain combat AI changes to be introduced to further ensure melee combat remains as (not very) challenging as in Morrowind.<br/>
An important detail to note, however: in RC4 and later builds, like in 0.48.0, the target must be within weapon reach upon impact for the hit to be successful. This means that dodging attacks by quickly backing away from the opponent remains possible even if the hit is evaluated as a success upon weapon release. This is consistent with Morrowind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other changes can be checked out via the growing <a href="https://github.com/OpenMW/openmw/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a> on their GitHub page which is really quite long. There's a lot of bug fixes but some exciting new features too. Here's just a few of the new bits coming in OpenMW 0.49:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infinite fall failsafe.</li>
<li>Shader-based water ripples.</li>
<li>Rain and snow collisions.</li>
<li>Animation blending - smooth animation transitions with modding support.</li>
<li>Playing music via Lua scripts and many more Lua modding improvements like a Factions API, Save Game API, Sounds API, NPC AI settings via Lua and more.</li>
<li>Specular lighting from point light sources.</li>
<li>Launcher improvements.</li>
<li>Support high-resolution cursor textures.</li>
<li>Support for non-adaptive VSync.</li>
<li>Controller binding for tab for menu navigation.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Neverwinter Nights Enhanced Edition gets a sequel DLC and it looks like Neverwinter Nights 2 Enhanced Edition is on the way</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition from Beamdog just got a brand new sequel story DLC, and it also seems we're getting Neverwinter Nights 2 Enhanced Edition from Aspyr Media.</p>
<p>Neverwinter Nights 2 Enhanced Edition got listed on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2738630/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> recently, and while it hasn't yet seen an announcement, the EULA as shown on SteamDB mentions Aspyr Media. So we'll have to keep our eyes peeled for an announcement on that one.</p>
<p>Back to the original Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition from Beamdog, they teamed up with developer Luke Scull (author and lead designer of Tyrants of the Moonsea) to create Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition Doom of Icewind Dale, a full official continuation of the classic.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3255336871740390265gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>An expansive DLC with 10-15+ hours of gameplay</li>
<li>Navigate the world map to explore 14 areas in Icewind Dale including Icewind Pass, the Dwarven Valley, and the Reghed Glacier. Visit several of the famed Ten Towns!</li>
<li>Recruit from 5 different companions for your party, including returning characters from the original Wailing Death campaign as well as Tyrants of the Moonsea</li>
<li>14 new monsters to face off against, including new creature portraits</li>
<li>16 new music tracks and 24 new ambient area tracks bring Icewind Dale to life in all its majestic beauty</li>
<li>An official sequel to the Original Campaign that also ties in with the Shadows of Undrentide, Hordes of the Underdark, and Ossian Studios’ campaigns</li>
</ul>

      <title>Proton Hotfix updated to fix Marvel Rivals and Indiana Jones on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have released a fresh update to the special Proton Hotfix version. This fixes up issues on Steam Deck / Linux across Marvel Rivals and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. If you're confused on all the different Proton versions <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">see my guide for more info</a>.</p>
<p>Writing on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/plagman.bsky.social" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais said across two posts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Proton Hotfix has been deployed to address the crash on startup with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on the latest update.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And also:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Proton Hotfix has been deployed earlier today to address the intermittent stutter issue with Marvel Rivals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see that Valve can get moving so quickly on issues in popular games. Hopefully with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS rolling out to more devices</a> we'll see developers test their updates more often instead of things getting broken like this.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/875175781740230253gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Marvel Rivals</em></p>
<p>If you have any Proton compatibility manually selected for them in the Properties on Steam, you can just unselect them to let Proton Hotfix be picked up for them automatically which Valve have now set as the default for both games.</p>
<p>Want to know how to change Proton versions? I also have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-change-the-proton-version-on-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a guide available for that</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

<p>At release players in Among Us 3D will be able to play with those across  Meta Quest, Steam VR, PlayStation VR 2, and PICO. The VR version is actually going to get a rebrand to just Among Us 3D along with bringing a new in-game currency to expand the customization options and support ongoing expansions to the content.</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">From the press release:</p>
<p>"With Among Us 3D, we're excited to bring the first-person perspective to an even wider audience," said Ryan Hall, Project Director at Schell Games. "By uniting VR and PC players, we’re opening up even more ways to brutally betray your friends—your whole crew can get in on the fun!"</p>
<p>"The launch of Among Us VR gave players the chance to step inside the game, bringing an entirely new level of suspense and hilarity to the social deduction experience,” said Victoria Tran, Community Director at Innersloth. “This crossplay feature strengthens our amazing community, making it easier than ever for players to team up—or backstab each other—regardless of their platform."</p>

      <title>What to claim from Prime Gaming, February 21st edition - plenty for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's the up to date list of games available on Amazon Prime Gaming for February 21st, and what compatibility you can expect for Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck. <em>ICYMI: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/amazons-previous-vp-of-prime-gaming-said-they-tried-everything-to-disrupt-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Amazon's previous VP of Prime Gaming said they "tried everything" to disrupt Steam</a>.</em></p>

      <title>Playstation 2 Emulator PCSX2 enables Wayland by default</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For people who enjoy seeing improvements for emulation on Linux, and for Wayland support - the Playstation 2 Emulator PCSX2 has now enabled support for it by default.</p>
<p>Earlier this month I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/ps2-emulator-emulator-pcsx2-should-get-wayland-support-in-the-coming-months/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">shared the news</a> that they were working towards it, after previously stopping it being the default due to lots of issues. With the latest code that's been <a href="https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/pull/12333" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">merged</a>, it is now enabled by default for an upcoming release.</p>
<p>They have also filed a <a href="https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-133919" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">bug</a> with upstream Qt "Wayland rendering bug when using native windows on GNOME/Weston". Hopefully that will also be solved in a future Qt release.</p>
<p>Great for continued game preservation on modern Linux. You can see more about the emulator on the <a href="https://pcsx2.net/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">official site</a>.</p>

      <title>Playtron GameOS Alpha 3 brings the &#39;GameLAB&#39; tool for game configuration and remote management</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Playtron, the company attempting to build a Linux gaming distribution to take on Valve, Microsoft and others have released GameOS Alpha 3 with a bunch of new features. This includes a new fancy open source tool named GameLAB.<em> It was originally called PlaytronOS but they've now settled on calling it GameOS.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder: the idea of PlayTron's GameOS is to bring a Linux-powered system that runs games from Epic Games Store, GOG.com, Steam and more directly out of the box. </p>
<p>The major changes in Alpha 3 include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>New &amp; Updated Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>GameLAB
	<ul>
<li>A new program for Linux, macOS, and Windows</li>
<li>Remotely manage a Playtron device for power users</li>
<li>Configure and submit custom launch configurations</li>
<li>Configure and submit custom controller input configurations</li>
<li>Requires Playtron GameOS Alpha 3 or newer on the remote Playtron device</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improved Steam support
	<ul>
<li>Full Cloud Saves support</li>
<li>More reliable game downloads</li>
<li>Faster and more reliable steam game launching</li>
<li>More reliable offline support for Steam</li>
<li>QR code login using the Steam app on Android or iOS</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Touchscreen support</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Non-Steam Deck touchscreen controls are not completely supported</li>
<li>Progress bar does not work when updating</li>
<li>ASUS ROG Ally is not receiving inputs from the touchscreen</li>
<li>Some Steam games fail to download at 100% progress with error code 57</li>
<li>Sometimes Playtron GameOS will boot into a black screen when using slow storage media</li>
<li>Steam Cloud Saves can get corrupted</li>
<li>Steam Cloud Saves have no conflict resolution</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking over email, Luke Short, Director of Linux Engineering at Playtron gave a little more detail about this new <a href="https://github.com/playtron-os/gamelab" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GameLAB</a> tool and their plans for it. Luke Short said it "revolves around community submissions" and that it's "similar to Lutris in how you can create custom installation scripts". In the short-term they want to get their fixes put back into protonfixes, so GE-Proton and the like can benefit from it directly. Long-term they want to "make all of our fixes easily accessible to everyone. Possibly with a conversion tool between different providers (protonfixes, Heroic Games Launcher, Lutris, Phoenicis, etc.)".</p>
<p>The only device currently planned to ship with it is the weird crypto device <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/the-first-handheld-to-use-playtronos-is-some-web3-thing-the-suiplay0x1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SuiPlay0x1</a>, but there's hints that something else may be on the table soon. I'll be keeping an eye on it.</p>

      <title>My favourite comedy dungeon crawler Lucky Tower Ultimate just got a big content update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The update simply called "Content" brings a whole lot of extras to Lucky Tower Ultimate, my current favourite dungeon crawler that keeps on making me laugh.</p>
<p>It's a truly silly game that will keep you coming back for more. It's equal parts frustrating as it is funny though, like any good dungeon crawler it can be a challenge but it's all the stupid interactions that really sell it. There's so many surprising things that can happen and they just keep expanding on it. It's Steam Deck Verified (and does work great) and works just fine on Desktop Linux with Proton.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8883893751740139064gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Update 2: Content was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1700270/view/497187708384314044" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">released</a> Wednesday, adding in various content from community votes including these major additions to the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>The Pipefitter</h3>
A team of industrious sisters in the village that let you carry more tower items outside. Once you help build an elaborate chute system, you will have a slot in each segment of the tower that you can use for one item. That item will be transported to the next segment in the current run. Once the item is outside, it can be bought in the village at the pipefitter.<br/>
<h3>The Bard</h3>
You’ll meet a Bard in the village who needs new instruments to impress the townsfolk… who currently hate their music. Fascinated with the musical wonders that you carried outside, the Bard will enter the tower once you’ve fulfilled their quest (to disastrous results). You will then be able to loot their corpse in the tower, which will be located in a random place every run. The corpse contains a new instrument and other useful items.<br/>
<h3>Snowy &amp; Puffles</h3>
This trap is inspired by one from the original Lucky Tower web game. At the end of a room, you’ll discover three doors with names above them. When you choose one of them and enter a small chamber, the door closes behind you and you’ll face whatever is in it. It might be a harmless snail, a peasant companion, or a tough enemy. You can deduce the room’s contents by the name above the door, which will be combined from a pool of possibilities.<br/>
<h3>The Pipes</h3>
The tower's sewer system becomes all the more visible with this trap. Unfortunately, the tower has such horrible plumbing that, from time to time, these pipes shake and…<br/>
1. Unleash a poisonous cloud into the air<br/>
2. There's also a chance they are clogged by slime, which will drop from the pipes instead<br/>
3. Or they do nothing (lucky you)<br/>
<h3>Bear Trap + Rake</h3>
<p>What's more slapstick than a rake handle to the face or a bear trap? These will be placed randomly in rooms just like mouse traps, but both have their own little twist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You'll also get over 270 new voice lines, new unique rooms, new items to find, new architecture to see all over the tower, you can buy a beard from The Barber, new achievements and so on. It really is a big update to the game, and I've had a blast again attempting to run through to spot some of the new stuff. Really great game to relax with.</p>
<p>One not to sit on, a seriously easy recommendation to pick up.</p>

      <title>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle gets DLSS 4 and FSR 3.1 but breaks on Steam Deck / Linux with Mesa</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle just got a major update with some fancy new features, but it seems like it's now broken on Linux with AMD GPUs using Mesa like Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Reports have begun appearing on Valve's Proton <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/8292" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> report tracker, with a Mesa RADV driver <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/12652" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">bug report</a> now open, but Valve developer Samuel Pitoiset mentioned "This is indeed a game bug, it passes through a pNext chain loop for the physical device creation..." and so it seems the game itself may need to be fixed this time before it will work again.</p>
<p>Going by reports it still works on NVIDA GPUs on Linux.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6751200331740136452gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>As for the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2677660/view/502817574909640811" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">patch</a> contents it added NVIDIA DLSS 4, AMD FSR 3.1 with Frame Generation, Intel XESS 1.4 and support for Path Tracing to supported Intel and AMD GPUs. Plus numerous game bug fixes.</p>
<p>Hopefully we'll see a resolution for Linux systems soon. Would be good to see since AMD FSR 3.1 could make it perform a fair bit better on the likes of the Steam Deck. Especially since Valve fixed the graphical bug with characters eyes <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/steam-deck-steamos-3-6-21-released-fixing-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-eyes-and-security-bugs/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">in a recent SteamOS update</a>.</p>

      <title>Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 is now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Surprisingly, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 has been given the Steam Deck Verified checkmark by Valve, after the latest patch was released with more updates planned. Valve verified it against the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a>.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">A third patch was released today with various improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Release Notes (1.218.0.0)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated NVIDIA Streamline SDK to version 2.7.2.</li>
<li>Fixes for various visual bugs in cinematics on ultra-wide monitors.</li>
<li>Various visual bug fixes related to reflections.</li>
<li>Various visual bug fixes related to ray-traced shadows.</li>
<li>Various fixes for low quality texture assets.</li>
<li>Various user interface bug fixes and improvements</li>
<li>When opening the Suits menu, the list will now always scroll to the selected suit.</li>
<li>'Pull' Quick Time Events now work when Space or Left Mouse Button are assigned to Jump or Dodge.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could occur during 'Graffiti in Trouble' with text language set to Spanish.</li>
<li>Various stability improvements and optimizations.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer also <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2651280/eventcomments/597393274090583972?snr=2_9_100015_#c597393274090584835" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed</a> in a Steam post that they are "actively working on more updates with additional bug fixes and performance optimizations".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21170869761740071679gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I've yet to play it myself, so I can't comment on if it deserves the rating or not. However, I've seen a lot of talk about it across social media, with the initial release being full of issues across Desktop and Steam Deck but it seems like these first few patches have really cleaned it up. At least from various recent reports I've seen it can <em>mostly</em> stay around 30FPS, which is generally the floor Valve go for with Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Have you played it on Deck? Let me know if you agree with the rating in the comments, especially after this latest patch.</p>

      <title>A year later, Palworld hits 32m players while continuing to fight off Nintendo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's been a little bit over a year now since Palworld arrived in Early Access, with developer Pocketpair announcing how well it's done along with another patch out now. ICYMI: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/palworld-developer-pocketpair-launches-pocketpair-publishing/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pocketpair recently launched Pocketpair Publishing</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/en-palworld.pocketpair.jp/post/3lijyufslqk25" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> the Palworld account revealed "It's been a year since Palworld was released, and thanks to you our fans, Palworld has surpassed over 32 million players across all platforms! (Steam, Xbox, PS5)". A truly incredible number but not particularly surprising given all the attention on it, especially with the ongoing lawsuit with Nintendo / The Pokémon Company.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13809198951740057969gol1.jpg"/></p>

<br/>
We're currently working to correct the issue.<br/>
<br/>
We apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your continued support of Palworld.</p>

<p>Whatever happens with the lawsuit, it's going to be one for the history books given how Nintendo's patents cover a fair amount of features that quite a number of other games either use or use something very similar. Pocketpair <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/palworld-dev-details-the-patents-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-for/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously gave more info</a> on some of the patents involved. Nintendo also continue to fight for getting more patents approved in the US, so this lawsuit <em>could</em> eventually go multi-national.</p>

      <title>Phil Spencer of Microsoft Gaming thinks generative AI will help game preservation</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Microsoft recently announced Muse, "a generative AI model of a video game that can generate game visuals, controller actions, or both". And somehow, Phil Spencer of Microsoft Gaming thinks it will help game preservation.</p>
<p>Speaking in a video that has been set as unlisted (hidden) on YouTube, but included in their Xbox <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/02/19/muse-ai-xbox-empowering-creators-and-players/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>, Phil Spencer of Microsoft Gaming goes off talking about how this somehow might magically help game preservation. No, I don't know how it would either, that's not how it works. Getting a generative AI to hallucinate games is not really preserving anything.</p>
<p>Anyway here's what Spencer said: "I'll tell you one of the things that I get excited about. You know, one of the things we care a lot about at Xbox is game preservation. And I think about an opportunity to have models learn about older games, games that were maybe tied to unique pieces of hardware where that engine on that hardware, is kind of time will erode the amount of hardware that's out there that can actually play a game. But you can imagine a world where from gameplay data and video, that a model could learn old games and really make them portable to any platform where these models could run."</p>
<p>Continuing Spencer said: "We've talked about game preservation as an activity for us. These models and their ability to learn completely how a game plays, without the necessity of the original engine running on the original hardware opens up a ton of opportunity."</p>
<p>The video can be viewed below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="c15vxDHJ2lU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7667ea3ae23bbd1c1f888efa1d2c012c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/c15vxDHJ2lU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>At some point, this whole "AI everything" thing will come crashing down. But until then, we will see more and more executives dreaming up things that won't happen. Game preservation is absolutely vital, and there's so many ways to do it correctly, but getting an AI to dream one up that it thinks is accurate is definitely not it.</p>
<p>You can also read more about Muse in the Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/introducing-muse-our-first-generative-ai-model-designed-for-gameplay-ideation/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>.</p>

      <title>The OBS Studio versus Fedora drama seems to have calmed down - no more legal threats</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/fedora-threatened-with-legal-action-from-obs-studio-due-to-their-flatpak-packaging/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Recently I highlighted a fight</a> that had broken out between the OBS Studio team and the Fedora Linux developers. The issue was centred around the Fedora Flatpak of OBS Studio but it seems to have calmed down now.</p>
<p>Things got pretty messy with the legal threat from the OBS Studio team, but thankfully it appears to be mostly solved down thanks to the two camps coming together to discuss it properly.</p>
<p>OBS Studio team member Joel Bethke <a href="https://gitlab.com/fedora/sigs/flatpak/fedora-flatpaks/-/issues/39#note_2354562186" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">said</a> in the ticket on GitLab:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As an update to everyone following, I had a meeting today with the Flatpak SIG and Fedora Project Leader, which was a very good conversation. We discussed the issues, how we got here, and what next steps are. For anyone not interested in the specific details, the OBS Project is no longer requesting a removal of IP or rebrand of the OBS Studio application provided by Fedora Flatpaks.</p>
<p>This issue should be used for tracking of the other specific, technical issues, that the Fedora Flatpak does still have, which I will address below.</p>
<p>From our perspective, there were two key points that we feel are the most important to address:</p>
<ul>
<li>The issue with the Qt runtime having regression</li>
<li>The issue of not knowing where to report bugs for what is a downstream package</li>
</ul>
<p>For the first bullet, this should be resolved with the update to the latest runtime, which includes Qt 6.8.2 that has the fixes for those regressions in it.</p>
<p>For the second, this is obviously a much larger issue to tackle, especially for a project as large as Fedora. We had some very good discussion on how this might be accomplished in the medium-long term, but don't consider it a blocker at this point. We plan to stay engaged and offer our perspective as an upstream project.</p>
<p>In addition to those two previously blocking issues, we discussed a handful of other problems with the Fedora Flatpak. I'll keep the details high level in the interest of brevity on this update:</p>
<ul>
<li>OBS Studio running on Mesa LLLVM pipe instead of with hardware acceleration (i.e. the GPU)</li>
<li>X11 Fallback leading to OBS crashing</li>
<li>VLC Plugin not behaving as expected in the sandbox, needs testing</li>
<li>Shipping of third-party plugins in the Fedora Flatpak</li>
</ul>
<p>The discussion was positive and they are actively working to resolve those issues as well, which should hopefully only affect a small number of users.</p>
<p>I would like to give a final thank you to Yaakov and the FPL for taking the time to talk to us today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see a resolution!</p>

      <title>Take a trip through an indie dev brain in Terry&#39;s Other Games from Terry Cavanagh</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A name you might know from the likes of Dicey Dungeons, Super Hexagon and VVVVVV. This is not a single game but a collection of various experiments done by Terry Cavanagh over many years.</p>
<p>What's in it? There's a lot of smaller "messier" games, some made in a weekend, joke games and more. But there's also some more "substantial" games too. This is just an interesting look behind the mind of an indie developer who has been making games for a very long time.</p>
<p>Check out the launch trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0qnv5XR-HlU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7d043a2a28ab6cf58d14bbb4fb3f771f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0qnv5XR-HlU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Writing in a <a href="https://distractionware.com/blog/2025/02/out-now-terrys-other-games/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> Cavanagh said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A big shout out to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jdbaudi.bsky.social" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Justo</a> for coming on to this weird project with me and helping me make it a reality, and to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/terrycavanaghgames.com/post/3lihdo6f7ok2v" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Dav999</a> for helping me to localize everything into more than 20 languages. Putting this thing together has been a huge undertaking, and I am so happy with how it turned out.</p>
<p>One of the big inspirations for this project was the <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/The_Calvin_and_Hobbes_Tenth_Anniversary/xtiMQXCLdJEC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=0&amp;kptab=getbook" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Calvin and Hobbes 10th Anniversary</a> collection, which I read as a teenager, and which really made an impact on me. Here is this guy, you know, Bill, he makes so-called lowbrow art, comics for newspapers – but the book is full of little stories about what he was interested in, about what was going on with his career as he was making the comics, about experiments that didn’t work out and how he came up with his world and his different characters. I found that so inspiring, and still do.</p>
<p>I don’t know if I’ve succeeded, but I tried to put a little bit of that into this; less museum exhibition and more designer’s notebook. I hope there are some things in here that surprise and delight and inspire. &lt;3</p>
<p>Right. Time to go make some new games!</p>

<p>The huge hit deck-builder Monster Train is getting a sequel, with Monster Train 2 getting an announcement and demo in the same day so you can try it early. I know quite a fan fans of the first game, so hopefully this one is just as good. The first worked great on Linux with Proton too!</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>

      <title>There&#39;s been a flood in the Wandering Waters update for Dota 2 </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Valve continue building up their next MOBA with Deadlock, their current Dota 2 is still as popular as ever and the Wandering Waters update for Dota 2 sounds pretty awesome.</p>
<p>As expected from a major update the patch notes are ridiculously long, as it seems to touch on so many different areas of the game. If you haven't played for quite some time (like me), prepare to re-learn a whole lot of it. From a changed map to gameplay features, there's a lot that's new.</p>
<p>The biggest change being the map which is a lot wetter. There's been a bit of a flood and so the water that was a sort of diving-line in the map has expanded and reshaped the battlefield. This comes with new gameplay features like faster movement when running with the current, slowing you if you run against it and a new amphibious creep type that evolves during the match.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19996480331740048346gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Dota 2 has also introduced Madstone, a new resource to craft specialised Neutral Items. Clearing out a Neutral Camp will you give 2 and 1 to a random ally. Saving them up for a while and you can then use them to craft your fully personalized items: an Artifact that gives your item new abilities, and an Enchantment that gives it passive stat/attribute bonuses.</p>
<p>There's various other quality of life additions like a timer to see when Roshan will return, marking items to sell as soon as you're alive again, new item effects to help you see which hero is the source of it, a backpack grace period giving you six seconds to pull newly acquired items out and more.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Other gameplay features were also tweaked like Lifesteal. It no longer has various ways of working, instead Valve made it a much more standard ability making it easier to understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lifesteal applies to physical damage from attacks and is reduced by 40% when damaging non-heroes.</li>
<li>Spell Lifesteal now applies to physical damage from spells and magical damage from spells or attacks and is reduced by 80% when damaging non-heroes.</li>
<li>Neither Lifesteal nor Spell Lifesteal applies to pure damage.</li>
</ul>
<p>I genuinely think I'm going to have to get back into Dota 2, for real this time, it all sounds awesome.</p>

<p>For those of you who want a stable experience, you would usually want to wait for the first update point release with at least Mesa 25.0.1. Here's a reminder of their currently planned release schedule:</p>
<ul>
<li>2025-03-05 - 25.0.1</li>
<li>2025-03-19 - 25.0.2</li>
<li>2025-04-02 - 25.0.3</li>
<li>2025-04-16 - 25.0.4</li>
<li>2025-04-30 - 25.0.5</li>
<li>2025-05-14 - 25.0.6</li>
<li>2025-05-28 - 25.0.7 (last planned)</li>
</ul>
<p>The next major feature release with Mesa 25.1 is due sometime around May 7th, if it's deemed stable enough.</p>

      <title>Amazon&#39;s previous VP of Prime Gaming said they &#34;tried everything&#34; to disrupt Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Everything except making a store people wanted to use? Ethan Evans, who was previously Vice President of Prime Gaming at Amazon, has a short retrospective of trying to take on Steam.</p>
<p>It's a typical <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ethanevansvp_as-vp-of-prime-gaming-at-amazon-we-failed-activity-7295834479036702720-cDmX/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">LinkedIn post</a> that doesn't exactly go into a whole lot of detail, but it's still interesting to get just a little behind the scenes from people who worked at companies that thought they could dethrone Steam. In the post Evans notes how "we failed multiple times to disrupt the game platform Steam" despite being "250x bigger" and how they "tried everything".</p>
<p>Evans continued noting "We acquired Reflexive Entertainment (a small PC game store) and tried to scale it. It went nowhere" and then after buying Twitch and trying a store there assuming people would use it because they watch livestreams, they were also wrong. Then it comes to the cloud gaming platform Luna, which also appears to not be going particularly well, noting how along with Stadia from Google that "Neither gained significant traction".</p>
<p>Why the failures? Evans said "The mistake was that we underestimated what made consumers use Steam. It was a store, a social network, a library, and a trophy case all in one. And it worked well".</p>
<p><em>It's not just Amazon though.</em></p>
<p>When you think about the Epic Games Store, and how they're trying to compete with constant free game giveaways, they're pretty much coasting on the revenue from the likes of Fortnite, and it shows you truly how difficult it is to move people away from what they like and what they're used to.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-games-store-2024-year-in-review" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Epic's 2024 Year in Review</a> they might show off some fancy numbers in multiple places with an increase in total spending from users, but they had an 18% cut in third-party PC game spending on the Epic Store. Looking back to <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-games-store-2023-year-in-review" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">2023</a>, they had a 13% cut in third-party PC game spending, so it's actually getting <em>worse</em>.</p>
<p>If you want to compete in an established market, against a company that's massive and (on the whole) quite well liked, you have to have something better to offer in some way. Just being big doesn't mean you'll be a success.</p>

      <title>Even with the incredible launch Marvel Rivals developer NetEase sends US staff packing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Game didn't sell enough? Staff cuts. Game did incredible! Staff cuts. It seems there's just no winning for some people as Marvel Rivals developer NetEase sends US staff packing.</p>
<p>Some initial reports out there made it out to be seemingly bigger than it is, but no matter how you want to cut it, the developer of a huge hit game has shed some staff responsible for helping it succeed.</p>
<p>First coming in from a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7297672154060361729/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on LinkedIn from Thaddeus Sasser, a Game Director based in the US for NetEase who said in a post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is such a weird industry...<br/>
<br/>
My stellar, talented team just helped deliver an incredibly successful new franchise in Marvel Rivals for NetEase Games...<br/>
<br/>
...and were just laid off!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Level designer Garry McGee also confirmed it in their own LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7297717165019803649/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello, hello! As the old saying goes, “All good things must come to an end.” My team recently helped develop and launch Marvel Rivals, which turned out to be a bigger hit than any of us expected! Unfortunately my team was also laid off. Strange times all across the industry indeed.</p>

<em>Pictured - Marvel Rivals</em></p>
<p>For some added context: in their official Discord server, the Community Manager has been responding to a bunch of users concerned about it:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4904128381739960798gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4904128381739960798gol1.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>Also in a statement to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/just-couldnt-dodge-that-big-boot-i-guess-no-matter-how-big-the-success-of-the-gig-marvel-rivals-developers-in-the-us-say-netease-just-laid-off-their-whole-team/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">PC Gamer</a>, NetEase confirmed the layoffs noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We recently made the difficult decision to adjust Marvel Rivals’ development team structure for organizational reasons and to optimize development efficiency for the game. This resulted in a reduction of a design team based in Seattle that is part of a larger global design function in support of Marvel Rivals. We appreciate the hard work and dedication of those affected and will be treating them confidentially and respectfully with recognition for their individual contributions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally NetEase said they remain committed to the game with their development team in China.</p>

      <title>Valve use a little code from Godot for Half-Life 2, Counter-Strike: Source, Day of Defeat: Source, Team Fortress 2</title>

<p>Bicubic lightmap support was first introduced in the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/half-life-2-free-to-keep-until-november-18th-episodes-one-two-now-included-with-a-huge-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Half-Life 2: 20th Anniversary Update</a>, and then rolled out yesterday for various Valve classics like Team Fortress 2, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/counter-strike-source-and-day-of-defeat-source-get-major-updates-with-64bit-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Counter-Strike: Source and Day of Defeat: Source</a> and others as part of all their big updates.</p>

<p>Just a fun little detail I thought you might like to know. Valve do a lot with open source, the most notable being their compatibility layer Proton to run Windows games on Linux / SteamOS / Steam Deck.</p>
<p><em>Minor update 20/02/25: adjusted the title from "pinch" to "use" to not give the wrong impression for all the people that don't read past a headline these days.</em></p>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 major update released and source available for modders via the Source SDK</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It wasn't just <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/counter-strike-source-and-day-of-defeat-source-get-major-updates-with-64bit-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Counter-Strike: Source and Day of Defeat: Source</a> that received big updates today, as Valve also published a new update for Team Fortress 2 along with updating the Source SDK to include TF2! This is a big one for modders, since you now have the source available for TF2!</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=238809" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> on the official TF2 website, having the Source SDK updated to include "all the Team Fortress 2 client and server game code" means modders can do a whole lot with it. This includes building entire conversions, which can be released on Steam. This SDK is under a "non-commercial basis" so everything made with it must be free. Valve included a little word on TF2 items though:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Players have a lot of investment in their TF2 inventories, and Steam Workshop contributors have created of a lot of that content. The majority of items in the game now are thanks to the hard work of the TF2 community. To respect that, we're asking TF2 mod makers continue to respect that connection, and to not make mods that have the purpose of trying to profit off Workshop contributors' efforts. We're hoping that many mods will continue to allow players access their TF2 inventory, if this makes sense for the mod.</p>

<p>About it: "Broken Shell is a cute and cozy adventure game follows the love story of two little hermit crabs searching for a new home. Despite human interference in their habitat, they face challenges leading to their separation. Embark on adventures, meet new friends, and assist diverse characters, all through solving puzzles and mini-games, a combination of humorous narrative events within a heartfelt romantic drama without a single word."</p>

<p>The game is currently <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/foggystudio/broken-shell-a-cute-and-cozy-hand-drawn-puzzle-adventure/description" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">crowdfunding on Kickstarter</a>, with Linux being a clear target for support. They only have a small €8,000 goal, which is rather small, but they said that's to "bring Broken Shell to life at the highest possible quality and ensure it becomes the heartfelt experience we’ve envisioned" with it being self-funded until now. They're expecting it to be ready for release in October 2025.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>With AI (and specifically AI generation) being a hot topic right now, it seems like quite a fitting game for the times. The developers filled out their AI disclosure on Steam too, which makes it clear it's all quite on-point for the theme of the game. They only use AI for a very specific feature, which seems to fit in well with the overall subject of the game itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FACEMINER is a concept-driven game that directly engages with the ethics of AI. For thematic purposes, the game features faces which have been generated by a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) trained on the FFHQ dataset, a research dataset released by NVIDIA that is the backbone of many real-world facial recognition applications. Per NVIDIA, only images under permissive licenses were collected.<br/>
<br/>
The 'AI training' in this game is fictional and has been simulated for entertainment purposes. The game can be interpreted as a critique of AI specifically relating to the ecological impact of mass data hoarding, surveillance concerns, and way it is used to compound corporate power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer, Wristwork, is an independent studio committed to crafting experimental, short form interactive media and games. This is their first commercial game.</p>

      <title>OCCT for stress-testing comes to Linux and Steam Deck, with a Steam release planned</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>OCCT has long been a popular tool for PC stability and performance testing on Windows, and now it's officially been made available for Linux in Alpha, including Steam Deck support too.</p>
<p>With the new Linux version in Alpha, it's not fully ready for everyone just yet, it's also only available to their Patreon supporters via a direct download for Linux / Steam Deck. In the announcement the developers mentioned they're even planning a Steam release of the tool, although there's no release date for that just yet.</p>
<p>Why they say it's a game changer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For years, Linux users have struggled with reliable stress-testing solutions for CPUs and GPUs. With OCCT now available on Linux, testing hardware stability has never been easier.</p>
<p><strong>Easy Installation</strong> – Just download, make the file executable, and you're ready to go. No complex dependencies required.</p>
<p><strong>Same Powerful Features as Windows</strong> – The Linux version includes all the core functionalities of OCCT, from CPU and GPU stress tests to power supply diagnostics.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect for Server Environments</strong> – IT professionals can now utilize OCCT to validate hardware performance on Linux-based systems.</p>
<p><strong>Allow for bootable diagnostics</strong> – No more OS corruption, just run Linux from a Live DVD/USB setup and test your settings!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out their video on it below:</p>

<p>It's fantastic to see more regular software add in Linux support. Thanks to Valve picking Linux (SteamOS) for the Steam Deck, we've seen a really nice boost to all areas of Linux over the last few years. And with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS readying for more devices</a>, I expect this support to continue.</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer Part 46: Bursting Bubbles</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-45-free-as-in-beer/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Part 45: Free as in Beer</a></strong></p>
<p>Unlike when building a retro Windows computer which gives you certain milestone releases to target, the incremental nature of Linux leaves it more difficult to settle on which version you wish to run, even if you have decided on a distribution. I opted to use Red Hat Linux 7.3 Valhalla for largely two reasons: the decent 3D support it offers for my ATI Rage 128 Pro graphics card, and it still being on the right side of the glibc 2.3 boundary after which Loki Software titles will start to break.</p>
<p>Thanks to this I have had my fair share of success in running games released up to around 2004 or so, but after that I do begin to encounter more issues with binary compatibility. The true strength of Linux has always been in source compatibility however, and by leaning into this fact you can still find means and ways of getting newer games and software to launch, even if they were released well after the heyday of your chosen Linux version.</p>
<p>If you are given access to a source tarball with requirements already in line with your build environment, then this can often be as easy as just typing "make" and letting the magic happen. When playing with software from the future this often fails to be the case though, with new libraries being introduced and newer versions of existing libraries being demanded. At least when using an RPM based distribution such as Red Hat Linux, this is where source RPMs can become incredibly useful.</p>
<p>Not only do they give you all the benefits of package management such as proper dependency resolution, but by using source RPMs I have been able to version bump existing system libraries and even install new ones to those packaged for later Red Hat and Fedora releases, all without breaking compatibility elsewhere. Your mileage of course may vary, and a certain discretion is required, but one success I have had was in upgrading SDL to the version found in Red Hat Linux 8.0 Psyche.</p>
<p>My main interest was in trying to get SDL Mixer reliant games with MIDI music to utilize my hardware synthesizer, a feature in later SDL versions that I sadly still have not gotten to work, but in upgrading SDL I was also able to finally build and then play the 1.0.0 version of <em>Frozen Bubble</em> outside of a live Knoppix environment. To do this I needed to grab the SDL-1.2.4-5.src.rpm, SDL_image-1.2.2-3.src.rpm, SDL_mixer-1.2.4-5.src.rpm, and SDL_net-1.2.4-3.src.rpm files from the Red Hat archives.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19663923531739822760gol6.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19663923531739822760gol6.png"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11438794101739822761gol6.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11438794101739822761gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>To build and install a source RPM on Red Hat Linux 7.3 you need to use the "rpm --rebuild" command followed by the name of the package files in question, which if successful will generate regular binary RPM packages in the /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386 directory. Assuming there are no conflicts you can then use these to install or update your software, although in this case I did need to ensure that the SDL and SDL-devel packages were installed first in order to respect the depedency chain.</p>
<p>Building SDL also required nasm to be installed as a dependency, and the <em>Frozen Bubble</em> source RPM package that I used also needed the desktop-file-utils-0.2-1.i386.rpm package to be installed, all of which was communicated by the package manager saving me any guesswork. The main stumbling block I always had when trying to build <em>Frozen Bubble</em> in the past was perl-SDL, but with the newer version of SDL installed, I was at last able build a perl-SDL source RPM without incident.</p>
<p>The Enet library served a similar role in blocking my ability to compile the final release of <em>Cube</em>, but by grabbing a source RPM from when it was included with Fedora 7 Moonshine I was at last able to get it to build. Overall performance is weaker than in the earlier release I covered, as while <em>Cube</em> remains playable it dips into uncomfortable frame rates far more often. I do feel the game plays smoother at 32-bit colours, as I found with <em>Unreal Tournament</em>, but the difference here was marginal.</p>
<p>In accomplishing this I corrected what were two of my greatest failures in getting newer releases of games to run, but I was not able to redress everything. Newer versions of ClanLib are built with X.org rather than XFree86 in mind, meaning I was unable to get later versions of <em>Trophy</em> to work for instance. Attempts at using later <em>Kobo Deluxe</em> source RPM packages also just produced the same errors related to GL detection that I got when I tried to build them with the source tarballs.</p>
<p>Now that I have the binary RPM packages created for Red Hat Linux 7.3 Valhalla I can just distribute them to save anyone else the trouble, but there are lessons to be learned here for anyone trying to run new software on legacy RPM based distributions; source RPMs for Mandrake and its descendants are not compatible with Red Hat however, and Debian and derivatives possess their own separate ways of handling package sources. Time to tackle a different challenge, and look back in time instead.</p>

      <title>Is This Seat Taken? is a thoroughly charming puzzle game about swapping seats</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a demo now available, Is This Seat Taken? is a wonderfully charming idea for a logic puzzle game about picking up people and putting them in the right seat. The idea is simple and brilliantly executed, at least going by the demo I've played which has a Native Linux version available.</p>
<p>Across various different settings including cars, busses, diners and more you get given a set of characters with different needs and it's up to you to pick them up and drop them onto a seat that will be suitable for them. Some want a window seat, others want to sit next to a particular character, another might want to sit alone — and then there's the unwashed smelly people that will cause other problems with multiple people not wanting to sit near them and so on. </p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="V5Nw0qzomec"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dc6f0b3424a7db12bf346b96a80a560c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/V5Nw0qzomec" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The demo contains the first city of the full game giving you 5 different levels and 1 special level to play. It's a really inventive take on a puzzle game with some charming visuals. Another demo thoroughly worth checking out. Loved it. Really want to get my hands on the full game and play it through now and the Linux build worked perfectly.</p>
<p>Hopefully it gets a little more challenging as the levels go on in the full game though, as the demo was reasonably easy.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Play seating matchmaker to please picky characters.</li>
<li>Discover each character’s unique traits—relatable, outlandish, and everything in between.</li>
<li>Piece together satisfying puzzles with no timers or leaderboards.</li>
<li>Unlock fun new scenarios as you progress—from bus rides to banquets!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Now you can get a real-life Deep Rock Galactic mug for all your beer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a bit of fluff for you today: fans of Deep Rock Galactic are in for a treat, as you can now grab an officially licensed beer mug and they sure do look fancy. With it you'll be able to give cheers in style for rock, stone and Karl.</p>
<p>They're technically not available <em>yet</em>, since it's going through a crowdfunding campaign. Against a €250,000 goal though, it's smashed through it like a dwarf through rock and at time of writing has amassed €583,000 in loot from nearly 4,000 wannabe dwarves. Certainly not cheap, but this kind of custom merch never is, at a minimum it's €55 (about £46) just to get one of them.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0NpxMY9KAdI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/491f57141af8ffb83c2f10a1f70f3036.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0NpxMY9KAdI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>According to the campaign they're as tough as the dwarves themselves. They say all the mugs will be safe for dishwashers and microwaves, along with them being suitable for hot drinks too along with being "tested to meet EU and FDA standards". You probably shouldn't go throwing them around though.</p>
<p>There's some extras you can add in too like themed coasters, a special bottle opener, a bar mat and more.</p>
<p>With Deep Rock Galactic being one of my favourite co-op games, I'm itching to grab one of these…</p>

      <title>AI is everywhere in AI Confidential and it&#39;s your job to fix up all the robots - check out the demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In a world where Artificial Intelligence is everywhere, you work for an AI megacorp and you're the one sent around to people's homes to fix up all their problems. A setting that is steadily becoming all that much closer to reality.</p>
<p>A first-person story-driven adventure game, one that may leave you thinking. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/from-broken-parts-to-broken-hearts-mend-robots-in-ai-confidential/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">A game I wrote about back in June 2024</a>, as the premise of it and the way you interact certainly seemed interesting. Doing away with textual conversations, instead relying on emotions. The developer has put up a public demo now with Linux support that they said "represents ~7 months of active development time" from their small four person team.</p>
<p>Original trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LUEqaVVl_9s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a0b3de987285db4d81f63ed295aff07f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LUEqaVVl_9s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What you get in the demo is only a small slice of what to expect of course, but this little introduction case is certainly a curious one. You're dealing with a dog caretaker assistant robot that's a bit broken, which seems to be a mixture of both broken hardware and an AI acting rather suspicious. There's some really good voice acting in this that really helps to sell the experience, complete with the ridiculously annoying client that sounds like an over-excited livestreamer.</p>
<p>You get the clear feeling pretty early on something isn't right here, as the little robot companion is acting <em>really</em> strangely and you quickly put the pieces together to figure out what happened. The conversation system is a fun unique point in it, giving you no right or wrong answers, just going based on your own feel for it.</p>
<p>A demo definitely worth jumping in. The developers do note it has "Adult language and some mature themes".</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Things get weird real fast in SUPER DEBT, a new bullet-hell dungeon crawler from developer zagawee, who also made Garbanzo Quest. On <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zachisagardner.bsky.social/post/3li6454kvv22a" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> the developer said: "what if: Balatro, But Everything Is Trying To Kill You". I'll admit, that was enough to hook me in to give it a go.</p>
<p>A demo is available on Steam with Native Linux support, and the developer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2105910/view/4507632124228043201" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> it has full Steam Deck support, they've done "many 100% playthroughs on the Steam Deck and I can confidently say that it runs great without any special configuration".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qBCM_bP2k0U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a447e0f6d778545ca8f31fb8fc71854b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qBCM_bP2k0U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

The upcoming PC release is "the full PC package" they said with "new content, original soundtrack, in-world events like traders, prestige system for endless replayability, difficulty modes, cloud saving and more…".</p>

      <title>Check out the demo for Replicube an open-ended programming puzzle game from Walaber</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From Walaber Entertainment who made Parking Garage Rally Circuit and JellyCar Worlds, their next game is Replicube. There's a demo now available to try and it looks really interesting and it's another they're making with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot</a>, and it has Native Linux support too.</p>
<p>Replicube is an open-ended programming puzzle game about writing code to replicate 3D voxel-based objects. The developer said they took what they liked about writing shaders, and turned it into a game. Here you solve puzzles, pursue leaderboard glory, or just make art to share with the in-game community.</p>
<p>Check out their introduction trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_k_IZhIu_BU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/40d7287474f80e5b7520e36b68426982.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_k_IZhIu_BU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While it's a puzzle game, it's also a tool that can export into common formats to add into other 3D creation tools. You can also use it to generate images and animations.</p>

      <title>Luanti (formerly Minetest) v5.11 out now with an in-game settings menu and better server browser</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Luanti (formerly Minetest) has a new release out, which finally adds an in-game settings menu so you don't have to quit your current game to adjust things. Something missing that was definitely felt from it.</p>
<p>Even with the settings menu now in-game, not every setting supports live changes, they said some may still require you to reconnect. Hopefully over time they can reduce the amount of settings that require you to do that.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14271114931739791849gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14271114931739791849gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For people on devices with touchscreens, there's also a new layout editor so you can setup the controls how you want.</p>
<p>When going to join an online game, the server list has also been improved. They've added in 4 new buttons allowing you to open the server’s website, view its mod list, see which players are online, and manage your favourites. You can also now filter server searches by game, mod and player.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12752375871739791960gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12752375871739791960gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Other additions / changes include:</p>

<li>Mods can override the default fonts</li>
<li><strong>Clients’ <code class="inline-code">version_string</code> is now available</strong> in <code class="inline-code">core.get_player_information()</code>, with <code class="inline-code">core.protocol_versions</code> added to verify available client features (<a href="https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/15708" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#15708</a>).</li>

      <title>A whole lot of people picked up a shovel for A Game About Digging A Hole</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A Game About Digging A Hole has a very simple idea, everything about it is in the name, and yet it managed to pull a whole lot of people in. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/please-dont-distract-me-im-trying-to-dig-a-big-hole-over-here/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">As I said in my previous article</a>, it works great with Proton, and really does suck you in to get to the bottom of the hole.</p>
<p>They've announced it crossed over 250,000 sales in the space of a single week. For any smaller developer, that's pretty incredible really. Especially nice for them since it was just a small side-project. Seems we all can't shake that primal urge to dig.</p>
<p>More about it: "A Game About Digging A Hole challenges you to dig a hole in your newly purchased house. On your way down, collect resources to sell and upgrade equipment to dig deeper and take garden excavation to a new level! But beware! With every spadeful you take, you start to uncover a mysterious secret, and the deeper you dig, the closer you get to the truth. But take your time, as there is no rush and no rules. Just you, your spade and a great underground adventure!"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="P-Ys4PRZxsw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1c397b11f8932023861734122cb0968a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/P-Ys4PRZxsw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It also has a Very Positive rating on Steam from over 5,000 user reviews. According to their PR team it was a hit across social media too including "over 5 million views on TikTok, 2.2 million views on YouTube Shorts, and a jaw-dropping 14.5 million views on Instagram reels".</p>
<p>Seems they plan some updates to the game with the first now available adding in:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>FOV slider – You can now adjust the field of view.</li>
<li>Motion blur toggle – Turn it off if you prefer a clearer image.</li>
<li>Russian &amp; Italian localization fixes.</li>
</ul>

      <title>The beautiful diorama builder Tiny Glade adds controller support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After previously making some <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/popular-diorama-builder-tiny-glade-is-getting-better-steam-deck-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">improvements for Steam Deck</a>, developer Pounce Light have now implemented more proper controller support for Tiny Glade. Now even more people will be able to enjoy it, as controller support will make it a lot more accessible.</p>
<p>Said in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2198150/view/511824321138655283" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>: "While not great for vitamin D, the darkness does align with productive game development. We've finished conjuring the ancient incantations of Steam Input, infused the magicks of VDFs and action glyphs into Tiny Glade, and the tickbox of "Controller Support" is now officially ticked! Thanks to everyone who helped us test the beta".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13864514401739788197gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>More info from the post on what's been done:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What's there</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All the menus and UIs can now be navigated using controllers: DPad/Left Joystick, A/B, L1/R1.</li>
<li>The same is also true for the keyboard: Arrow keys, Enter/Esc, PgDown/PgUp.</li>
<li>There's now two action sets in Steam Input: one for gameplay, and one for the menu.</li>
<li>Action sets expose a whole bunch of extra controls useful for custom layouts.</li>
<li>Tutorials/input hints in the game show controller glyphs.</li>
<li>The game will dynamically detect any connected controllers, and seamlessly read input from all of them and/or keyboard + mouse.</li>
<li>On Steam Deck, the folder icon in photo mode now shows an info screen for where to find screenshots in SteamOS's menus.</li>
<li>There's now a "Controller Bindings" button in the Controls menu (only shows if you have a controller connected).</li>
<li>Ditto for key bindings; they have been moved to their own sub-screen.</li>
<li>You can now draw walls &amp; fences by clicking and moving <em>the camera</em> instead of the cursor.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What's not there yet</strong></p>
There's a few things that we'll address in future patches:

<ul>
<li>There's a bunch of new strings that we haven't yet localized to other languages.</li>
<li>If you change the toolbar alignment in settings, you'll need to restart the game, or controller mapping will be all borked.</li>
<li>Our graphics driver warning/information screen doesn't support controllers yet.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They're hoping to get the game bumped up to a Steam Deck Verified status.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck update gets a small battery life boost with the Frame Limiter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a new Steam Deck Beta Client update for February 14th, showing the love to battery life with a little extra juice. You need to be on the Preview / Beta channel to receive the update for testing.</p>
<p>Here's what's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/518579539928940547" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changed</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an error on the Downloads page when a Free to Play game is removed during installation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced polling rate while the Steam Frame Limiter is active to save additional power. This can save up to 6% on battery life when running at 30fps in a low-power game like HL2.</li>
<li>Fixed an error on the virtual menu settings when bound to gyro.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Great to see the Steam Deck just keeps on improving so many things years after release. That's one of the benefits of the Steam Deck compared with other hardware, Valve just keep on pushing out those updates.</p>

      <title>SteamOS-like Bazzite Linux has some nice growth thanks to great handheld PC support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's no need to wait on Valve releasing SteamOS 3 for everyone thanks to Bazzite. Some really impressive work continues to go into it, and it appears they're enjoying some nice overall growth.</p>
<p>Writing in a post on the Bazzite Discourse forum, developer Jorge O. Castro made a post titled "<a href="https://universal-blue.discourse.group/t/just-how-many-of-us-are-there/6852/1" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Just how many of us are there?</a>" that went over some fun details, with comparisons to a few other Linux builds like Fedora Silverblue and Fedora Kinoite. One thing is clear from it — Bazzite is steadily increasing in popularity with over 25,000 systems active using it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7924869381739553313gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Heck, Bazzite even <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/marvel-rivals-gets-a-low-quality-ui-fix-for-bazzite-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">got a shout out in a recent Marvel Rival's patch note</a>. More and more are taking notice of Linux for gaming, thanks to how actually easy it is to get going now. And a lot of it, of course, thanks to Valve with the Steam Deck making it truly accessible to millions of gamers.

      <title>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater releases in August</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>KONAMI announced that Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is going to be launching on August 28th, with pre-orders now live. Another that was announced during the PlayStation State of Play recently and the mini-game from the original is returning too.</p>
<p>With pre-orders live it's another that's doing Advanced Access for the more expensive edition of the game. This allows you to play 48 hours earlier than the standard edition.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="KflwVzVIk_o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4d2da3a3a943788422c6f0e009cf9877.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/KflwVzVIk_o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In addition to giving Advanced Access the Digital Deluxe Edition also gives you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>●Sneaking DLC Pack<br/>
・Uniform: Battle Dress (PW ver.)<br/>
・Uniform: Sneaking Suit (PW ver.)<br/>
・Uniform: Crocodile Suit<br/>
・Uniform: Naked Woodland<br/>
・Uniform: Naked Ammunition Belt<br/>
・Uniform: Gold<br/>
・Face: Glasses<br/>
・Face: Sunglasses<br/>
・Equipment: Kerotan Mask<br/>
・Equipment: GA-KO Mask<br/>
<br/>
Bonus Content<br/>
・Uniform: White Tuxedo<br/>
*This content is also obtainable through in-game progress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the Steam release they also confirmed the Snake vs. Monkey minigame from the original is back, where you have to capture a group of mischievous monkeys. </p>
<p>In the PlayStation <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/12/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-releases-august-28-2025-on-ps5/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> they also confirmed the game will feature both a "New Style" third-person view, and a "Legacy Style" top-down view "to recreate the look and feel of the original game".</p>
<p>This is another that I expect may be a bit too much for the Steam Deck, with it powered by Unreal Engine 5. Hopefully overall though at least on Desktop Linux it should be okay with Valve's Proton. I'm thoroughly looking forward to it, actually skipping over it from the Master Collection Version to wait for this.</p>

      <title>Open source non-profit platform Codeberg &#34;suffering from hate campaigns due to far-right forces&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://codeberg.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Codeberg</a> are a "non-profit, community-led effort that provides Git hosting and other services for free and open source projects" and they've recently had a major problem from what they say are far-right forces engaging in a hate campaign.</p>
<p>Entering my email early on Wednesday morning was something that made me raise my eyebrows. I get a lot of emails, often from various projects I'm tracking across various instances of Git. This one definitely wasn't normal though, coming from a repository on Codeberg named "truth" from a user "truth". The issue subject line from the email I won't repeat, but it was clear racial hatred. Inside the email the issue had a whole bunch of people tagged, myself included.</p>
<p>Later that afternoon, an official email from Codeberg came in to apologise and linked to their <a href="https://blog.codeberg.org/we-stay-strong-against-hate-and-hatred.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Codeberg say they're "currently suffering from hate campaigns due to far-right forces, and so are our users", with the target being "several projects advocating tolerance and equal rights" that have been subjected to "hate attacks, such as massive spam of abusive messages in their issue trackers". The attackers took advantage of Codeberg's notification system, that enabled people to create a repository, make an issue and then tag anyone in it notifying them generating an email.</p>
<p>According to Codeberg they have "blocked access to the used functionality and deleted the user accounts" but "they managed to generate a large amount of notification emails already".</p>
<p>Thankfully this hasn't deterred Codeberg from their mostly volunteer-led mission. And they end the announcement with a note about how they will "not be discouraged in our fight against far-right ideologies". They've also been working on securing funding from <a href="https://nlnet.nl/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">NLnet</a> for more moderation tooling.</p>
<p>I'll take this moment to remind people that I, and GamingOnLinux, take a very firm stance against any kind of hatred. It won't stand in the comments, and I won't put up with it in any attached community like our <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Discord</a>. It's a real shame the lengths some people will go to when spreading hate.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>TRX, the Tomb Raider I &amp; II: Community Edition open source re-implementation project, has continued advancing and a fresh release of both are out now. With the Tomb Raider II side adding Linux support.</p>
<p>While the Tomb Raider I-III Remastered collection does exist, this project works with the originals and enhances them. You do need to own the games to run through TRX. You can grab them from <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/tomb_raider_123" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=Core%20Design" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>The latest release of <a href="https://github.com/LostArtefacts/TRX/releases/tag/tr2-0.9" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">TR2X 0.9</a> is out now, which amongst other things includes "Linux builds and toolchain" support, so you can run it natively on Linux and benefit from all the improvements. Going by the <a href="https://github.com/LostArtefacts/TRX/tree/develop/docs/tr2" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">status page</a> they say "TR2X is finished with the decompilation and is now able to run without the original game .exe. The focus is now to clean up the code base and enrich the game with new enhancements and features". The update also includes a pause dialog, a photo mode feature, support for animated sprites and more.</p>

      <title>A workaround for Final Fantasy VII Rebirth on Linux with NVIDIA GPUs has been found</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Final Fantasy VII Rebirth can work on Linux with AMD GPUs (like Steam Deck), the situation with NVIDIA GPUs has been messy. Open source to the rescue though, again.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/8408#issuecomment-2657340142" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Commenting</a> on the official Valve Proton GitHub, VKD3D-Proton developer Hans-Kristian Arntzen revealed another project — <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/pyroveil" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Pyroveil</a>. From the GitHub it says it's "a Vulkan layer that can automatically replace shaders or roundtrip them via SPIRV-Cross -&gt; glslang. This can create SPIR-V that is more compatible with NVIDIA drivers in particular".</p>
<p>Multiple user reports show it enables the game to render correctly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14268485861739527229gol1.jpg"/><br/>

<p>It may not be perfect, with some users still reporting other issues, but at least now NVIDIA GPU owners on Linux can get this game to actually work until NVIDIA solve the driver issues directly. And with this new open source Pyroveil project, perhaps we might see less NVIDIA issues in future for gaming on Linux.</p>

      <title>Fedora threatened with legal action from OBS Studio due to their Flatpak packaging</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If there's one thing you can always count on in the Linux world it's that packaging can be a nightmare. The OBS Studio team are not happy with the Fedora folks due to Flatpak problems and threatened legal action.</p>
<p>Like with traditional distribution packages (RPM, DEB, etc), distros can also run their own Flatpak repositories, instead of using Flathub. This is what Fedora does by default, they have their own Fedora Flatpaks, where they often repackage various software. To note: the OBS Studio on Flathub, is an official OBS package.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago Joel Bethke of the OBS Studio team put up an <a href="https://gitlab.com/fedora/sigs/flatpak/fedora-flatpaks/-/issues/39" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">issue</a> on the Fedora Flatpaks GitLab titled "Broken OBS Studio Flatpak presented as official package" that said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://src.fedoraproject.org/flatpaks/obs-studio" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">unofficial OBS Studio Flatpak</a> on Fedora Flatpaks is, seemingly, poorly packaged and broken, leading to users complaining upstream thinking they are being served the official package. There are several examples of this being the case outside of OBS Studio as well, and many users who are unhappy with Fedora Flatpaks being pushed with no or unclear options to opt-out.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-software/-/issues/2754" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-software/-/issues/2754</a></li>
<li><a href="https://pagure.io/fedora-workstation/issue/463" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://pagure.io/fedora-workstation/issue/463</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We would like to request that this package is either removed, or made clear that it is a third party package. It should not be upstream's responsibility to ensure downstream packages are working, especially when they overwrite official packages.</p>
<p>I would also like some sort of explanation on why someone thought it was a good idea to take a Flatpak that was working perfectly fine, break it, and publish it at a higher priority to our official builds. We spend an enormous amount of effort on our official Flatpak published to Flathub to ensure everything is working as well as it can be.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This led to a <a href="https://pagure.io/fedora-workstation/issue/463" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">issue</a> being filed on Fedora Workstation titled "Deprioritize or remove Fedora Flatpaks, and prioritize Flathub in GNOME Software". The issue noted receiving complaints from upstream developers, like the OBS Studio team. With lots of discussion going on about changing the order of how Fedora presents packages between Fedora Flatpaks, Flathub and RPMs. Inside the comments, there's a fair bit of disagreement between Fedora / Red Hat and the OBS Studio team.</p>
<p>Then on the 12th of February, Bethke escalated things with a <a href="https://gitlab.com/fedora/sigs/flatpak/fedora-flatpaks/-/issues/39#note_2344970813" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reply</a> on the original ticket:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since it's clear that Fedora does not have any interest in a rational discussion at this point, and has decided to resort to name-calling, we are now considering the Fedora Flatpaks distribution of OBS Studio a hostile fork.</p>
<p>This is a formal request to remove all of our branding, including but not limited to, our name, our logo, any additional IP belonging to the OBS Project, from your distribution.</p>
<p>Failure to comply may result in further legal action taken. We expect a response within the next 7 business days (By Friday, February 21st, 2025).</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since then the Fedora team have <a href="https://src.fedoraproject.org/flatpaks/obs-studio/c/aa78e92a7e68e795b9554bc8dd3b48204be58357?branch=stable" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">updated</a> their Flatpak of OBS Studio to an "end of life" status, and eventually it looks like it will be removed, so things seem to be moving into a direction that should appease the OBS Studio team.</p>
<p>A messy situation but hopefully one some lessons can be learned from.</p>
