      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer Part 45: Free as in Beer</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-44-the-legend-of-kobo/" target="_blank">Part 44: The Legend of Kobo</a></strong></p>
<p>For a time the term "multimedia" was one of the hottest buzzwords in the computer software industry. Although this boom would begin to recede with the bursting of the dot-com bubble, a number of individuals and firms staked both their futures and careers on the creation of bespoke interactive experiences, often in the service of marketing more established businesses and brands. Enter Lost Boys, an outfit based in the Netherlands intent on doing exactly that.</p>
<p>Their most lucrative client was the Dutch brewer Dommelsch, for whom Lost Boys created a number of on brand sports games which were once distributed for free on the Dommelsch website. One of these was <em>Roll'm Up</em>, a pinball game first distributed in 1997 for Microsoft Windows. Lost Boys themselves would then release <em>Roll'm Up</em> standalone, bringing it over to MacOS, Linux, and even BeOS to highlight the cross platform nature of their Lost Platform multimedia framework.</p>
<p>To install <em>Roll'm Up</em> I utilized the RPM package created by Australian Linux columnist John Murray, who largely seems to have taken over the hosting of the game after the Lost Boys website was taken down around 2002. Where this game excels is in the confidence of its presentation, with boisterous sound effects being matched up with smooth and colourful animations. When put against the popular X windows games of the day, <em>Roll'm Up</em> certainly was a shock to the senses.</p>
<p>The Lost Platform even boasts support for integrated video playback, as demonstrated by a short film playable by selecting the about screen. Bear in mind that <em>Roll'm Up</em> predates the arrival of the SMPEG library, which became Loki Software's solution for playing video clips in their games. Even as late as 2002 video playback could still prove a sore spot under Linux, with BioWare having to forgo Bink video support in their initial Linux port of <em>Neverwinter Nights</em>.</p>
<p>More than anything else, <em>Roll'm Up</em> offered up a reasonable surrogate for any recent Linux converts who still found themselves itching to play a round of <em>3D Pinball for Windows - Space Cadet</em>, the pinball table first created by Maxis which was included with several releases of Microsoft Windows. Curiously enough that game would later be ported over to Linux in 2021 by the process of decompliation and reverse engineering, and today is even playable from within your web browser.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16637601281736798605gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16637601281736798605gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10123018851736798606gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10123018851736798606gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Was there anything else like it for Linux? A few free software alternatives do exist, but they all have their own caveats. The best of these by far is <em>Emilia Pinball</em>, a full 3D engine which allowed for the creation of a handful of pinball tables which even boasts support for hardware acceleration through OpenGL. I was unable to get the 0.3.1 version of <em>Emilia Pinball</em> to build for me from the source tarball, but I was able to install it by rebuilding a source RPM package created for Fedora Core instead.</p>
<p>This release included two tables, although more would be added in later years, with the project still seeing the occasional burst of activity. Also worth noting is <em>Spinball</em>, a finalist from the CS 248 2000 Video Game Competition, in addition to the half baked effort that was <em>Linball</em>, and finally a pinball table created for use with the Crystal Space 3D engine. None of these provide the fantastic level of polish that <em>Roll'm Up</em> offers, allowing the game to still stay relevant for many years after its initial release.</p>
<p>What has not aged as well is the game's function as an advertisement. As well as the expected prominence of the sponsor's brand and product, included was even a system where players could accrue "Dommelsch points" that could be exchanged for the purchase of actual beer from the brewery. While now just being a broken system in the game, the ability to acquire alcohol through a free piece of software does raise eyebrows, especially since I know it got into the hands of children.</p>
<p><em>Roll'm Up</em> also once sported an online high score table which has since been taken down, but an archive of the "Hall of Fame" from June 2001 shows that the top spot was held by one Alexander Babych, who managed to achieve an eye watering score of 894016643 along with 681142181 Dommelsch points. <em>Roll'm Up</em> also features a local multiplayer mode, where as many as four players get to take sequential turns competing for the greatest score.</p>
<p>It is a shame that Lost Boys were never able to uncouple their efforts even more, as I cannot help but feel that the games would shine even brighter if allowed to be taken on their own. Lost Boys would at least later find more honest work, with them creating educational software for the Anne Frank House as well as the Maritime Museum in Rotterdam, along with a few other corporate clients, before the eventual closure of the studio. If only there was a way to disrupt the flow of time.</p>

      <title>DXVK v2.5.3 released with more improvements for Windows games on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Philip Rebohle has released DXVK version 2.5.3 bringing more improvements for this tool that translates Direct3D 8 / 9 / 10 / 11 to Vulkan. <em>DXVK is included as part of Valve's Proton.</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">This release includes a tweak for people using it on Windows too. As noted in the changelog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to address feedback regarding issues with variable refresh rate displays, performance and HDR, exclusive full-screen mode was reintroduced as an option. It remains <strong>disabled</strong> by default, but users can enable it by setting <code class="inline-code">dxvk.allowFse = True</code> in the <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/wiki/Configuration" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">configuration file</a>.</p>
<p>As usual, this option has no effect on non-Windows platforms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why would someone use it on Windows? Especially for older games, it can end up giving a nice performance increase on modern hardware. Don't you just love open source? Everyone can benefit!</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Apart from that here's all the general fixes and improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fixed a regression that would cause severe rendering issues in many D3D8 and D3D9 games that use fixed-function rendering.</strong> (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4533" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4533</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed invalid shader code generation for certain rare texture operations in D3D11. This fixes a potential crash in <strong>TopSpin 2k25</strong>. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4576" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4576</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed a potential issue with handling <code class="inline-code">NaN</code> tessellation factors in D3D11 hull shaders.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with D3D9 shader validation that would cause valid shader code to be rejected in some situations.

<li><strong>Far Cry 5</strong>: Worked around an issue that would cause terrain to be invisible on Intel GPUs. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4604" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4604</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Next</strong>: Fixed a shader-related issue that would cause flickering objects on some drivers. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4603" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4603</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Max Payne 3</strong>: Enabled strict float emulation to work around broken rendering in D3D9 mode. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4611" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4611</a>)</li>
<li><strong>The Hurricane of the Varstray -Collateral hazard-</strong>: Enabled 60 FPS limit to work around game issues when running in windowed mode.

      <title>Minecraft gets new pigs, wildflowers and ambient features in the latest Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mojang have released the first Snapshot (a Beta) of the next Minecraft update, and with it there's a bunch of new features included for explorers.</p>
<p>Snapshot 25w02a includes <em>two</em> new Pig variants for cold and warm areas. It's just a bit of fluff to make animals from different biomes stand out a bit more but still cute. Who doesn't love piggies?</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8584837861736782580gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I quite like the new ambient features they've added in this Snapshot too including falling leaves, leaf litter (decorative block) and wildflowers. The Mojang devs said: "On your next expeditions into forests, dark forests, and wooded badlands, listen out for the crunch of leaves underfoot. Leaf litter makes a rustling sound when you walk through it and can be used to decorate other blocks. In meadows, birch forests, and old growth birch forests, you will instead find wildflowers. These yellow and white flowers can be crafted into dye and have four growth stages that speed up with bonemeal. Place them at different angles to have your builds bloom in different patterns!</p>
<p>On top of that, all the trees in the Overworld will also have matching leaf particles falling from them. "</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4442064761736782852gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4442064761736782852gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14359702661736782854gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14359702661736782854gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><em>The world should at least feel that little bit more alive.</em></p>
<p>Additionally the Lodestone is getting a simpler recipe to help you find your way home.</p>
<p>See the full <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-25w02a" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a> for more.</p>
<p>I'm really happy to see Minecraft continue to evolve and expand. Microsoft seem to have mostly left Mojang to continue building it as they please with some fun stuff being added over the last few years. And with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/mojang-give-an-update-on-the-future-of-minecraft-development/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changes to how they will do updates</a>, we should hopefully see additions more often now.</p>

      <title>DEFICIT is an exciting looking new FPS with chaotic close-quarters combat</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer ITEM42 recently announced DEFICIT and it's not often I feel I really need a game after seeing a trailer but DEFICIT looks juicy. Not a whole lot has been revealed just yet since it's a fresh announcement. But you will need Proton to play it on Linux, SteamOS and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Designation:</strong> [Carrie]. <strong>Location:</strong> [Project Sidereal]. </p>
<p><strong>Assignment:</strong> under the instruction of your shady benefactor known only as <strong>[The Client]</strong>, you must steal the <strong>[Interpolator]</strong> and use it to escape the sprawling research labs of Project Sidereal.</p>
<p><strong>Project Sidereal</strong> is housed within <strong>Hadrian's Wall</strong>, a maze of concrete warrens and liminal installations policed by the seasoned officers of the <strong>Oversight Taskforce</strong>. </p>
<p>Sneak past them, turn their defensive systems against them or take them head-on: the best path through the manifold dangers of Project Sidereal is yours to choose. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the announcement trailer from January 10th:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_t0WFYYBe1A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/01de99782c67c727fee3c3165040c4fb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_t0WFYYBe1A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Single-player campaign FPS with an emphasis on chaotic close-quarters combat, creatively lethal tools and environmental havoc</li>
<li>Exploration: take the direct route or find the path less travelled through the warrens of Hadrian's Wall</li>
<li>Open wormholes to terrifying frontier realities on valid surfaces to navigate otherwise impassable liminal spaces</li>
<li>Face a medley of adversaries: haphazard Oversight Officers, ruthlessly precise Servitor mechanoids and frangible UAVs</li>
<li>Hammers, screwdrivers, paintcans, bricks, batons, pistols, SMGs: any item makes for a tremendous weapon in the hands of a skilled freelancer</li>
</ul>

      <title>NTSYNC driver for improving Windows games on Linux with Wine / Proton should finally land in Linux kernel 6.14</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After waiting quite a while on it and some rewrites, it looks like the NTSYNC driver code to help Windows games running on Linux will be pulled in and enabled in the Linux kernel. </p>
<p>Developer Elizabeth Figura posted version 7 of the <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20241213193511.457338-1-zfigura@codeweavers.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">kernel patch</a> back in December 2024. As a reminder, here's how they explained it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Wine project emulates the Windows API in user space. One particular part of that API, namely the NT synchronization primitives, have historically been implemented via RPC to a dedicated "kernel" process. However, more recent applications use these APIs more strenuously, and the overhead of RPC has become a bottleneck.</p>
<p>The NT synchronization APIs are too complex to implement on top of existing primitives without sacrificing correctness. Certain operations, such as NtPulseEvent() or the "wait-for-all" mode of NtWaitForMultipleObjects(), require direct control over the underlying wait queue, and implementing a wait queue sufficiently robust for Wine in user space is not possible. This proposed driver, therefore, implements the problematic interfaces directly in the Linux kernel.</p>
<p>This driver was presented at Linux Plumbers Conference 2023. For those further interested in the history of synchronization in Wine and past attempts to solve this problem in user space, a recording of the presentation can be viewed here:</p>

<p></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The performance uplift when using this versus the current upstream Wine <em>could</em> be pretty significant in some games. As Figura noted from the earlier patches, which are from different people on different hardware:</p>

<p>Something to note is that this is aimed at replacing earlier solutions of esync and fsync, which did already improve performance, but this being in the kernel will give the improvements for everyone including eventually plain Wine as well as Valve's Proton.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.14-NTSYNC-Driver-Ready" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Phoronix</a> noted that they expect it will arrive in Linux kernel version 6.14 due out sometime in March. Going by other developer comments, it certainly seem like it will finally land.</p>

      <title>Icewind Dale 2 completable in Infinity Engine remake GemRB, plus Baldur&#39;s Gate II: Enhanced Edition now playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GemRB is a game engine remake of Infinity Engine used in games like Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, Icewind Dale, Baldur's Gate 2: Shadows of Amn and Icewind Dale 2.</p>
<p>The developers behind this open source community project just released GemRB 0.9.4 noting that "It brings two exciting major developments. First, for the first time ever, one is now able to play Icewind Dale 2 from start to end. That marks the last original game to reach this status. BG2EE support has been experimental and is not yet ready for wide use, but as of this release it is now playable enough to welcome testers and power users to bug hunting adventures (manually set GameType to bg2ee). Besides that the release features several improvements to pathfinding, audio and ease-of-use for other projects."</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Own a PlayStation and someone is hogging the TV? Stream it to another device like a Steam Deck or Desktop PC with the cross-platform open source chiaki-ng project. I used to use this a fair bit with my now-retired PlayStation 4 and it really is a fantastic project.</p>

      <title>NonSteamLaunchers tool for installing popular game stores working on better Desktop Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NonSteamLaunchers gained popularity as one of the go-to solutions for installing more stores directly on Steam Deck, and the latest release has begun to improve how it works on normal Desktop Linux too.</p>
<p>It works for the likes of Amazon Games, Battle.net, EA App, Epic Games, GOG Galaxy, Rockstar Games Launcher, Ubisoft Connect and plenty more.</p>
<p>In the v3.9.9 release the developer noted they're "Slowly working towards better compatability for different distros" and the latest changes in that regards sound pretty good including:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-<strong>Slowly working towards better compatability for different distros</strong>: Added some dependency checks for the bash script so that certain distros can know what they need for the NonSteamLaunchers.sh to run. Just simply Zenity, Steam, curl, wget etc. It isnt much but could help, i am still researching and looking to add more compatibility in this area.</p>
<p>-<strong>Fixed UMU shortcuts</strong>: for some reason, UMU shortcuts werent being built correctly since the last update and adding the compat tool and extra commands when they werent supposed to, this has seemingly been fixed now. I reccomend highly that you delete your UMU shortcuts made by NSL and let NSL remake them again! Be sure to open up the Desktop Version and Stop and Restart the scanner.</p>
<p>-<strong>Added Desktop Notifications</strong>: Desktop now has notifications with Icons whenever anything is added to steam!! Neat! This will help in whether knowing anything is added, i should have added this sooner!</p>
<p>-<strong>Added HoYoPlay to the Scanner</strong>: should get your HoYoPlay games, similar to battle.net</p>
<p>-<strong>Added VK Play to the Scanner</strong>: Still needs some work, but you can now scan for your VK Play Games for the most part. Still working on this to make it better but feel free to try!</p>
<p>-<strong>Fixed some logic in the Plugin Updater</strong>: The Desktop Version allows you to also update or install the decky plugin version. Some of the logic was wonky but has now been fixed. It shouldnt update or prompt you unless you need it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Steam Deck plugin for Decky Loader also had some improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-<strong>Reorganized the Decky Plugin</strong>: The Plugin can now know what launchers are installed and are indicated by red and green lights, ive also made pages so that way the list doesnt become long for the launchers and the streaming sites as i continue to add more launchers and websites.</p>
<p>-<strong>Added VK Play to the Plugin and it scanner</strong>: You can now install VK Play straight from the plugin along with with using its scanner for your VKPlay games. This still may need some work but for most games its working.</p>
<p>-<strong>Added HoYoPlay to the scanner</strong>: You can now scan or your HoYoPlay games in the plugin version! yay! Genshin Impact and ZZZ now have their own shorcuts lol :). Its similiar to battle.net because i want you to be able to know if there is an update for their games since they update alot.</p>
<p>-<strong>Fixed UMU shortcuts</strong>: as above, for some reason, UMU shortcuts werent being built correctly since the last update and adding the compat tool and extra commands when they werent supposed to, this has seemingly been fixed now. I reccomend highly that you delete your UMU shortcuts made by NSL and let NSL remake them again! Delete your shorcuts and run the manual scan or auto scan!</p>
<p>-<strong>Also fixed some logic in the NSLPlugin.desktop</strong>: this file was also a bit wonky so i updated its logic, hopefully in both instances they will now allow you to update correctly. If you are absolutely unable to update the plugin for any reason, simple delete the plugin from decky loader and re-run the NSLPlugin.desktop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the Steam Deck plugin, it seems you still need to manually download it since the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/nonsteamlaunchers-gets-booted-from-steam-deck-plugin-store-decky-loader/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">developers between Decky Loader and NonSteamLaunchers previously had a falling out</a>.</p>

      <title>Even with SteamOS coming to more systems Bazzite has no plans to go anywhere</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We recently had the exciting news that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve plans to expand SteamOS onto more devices</a>, starting with supporting more handhelds, which caused plenty of people to be curious about the future of the popular SteamOS-like <a href="https://bazzite.gg/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bazzite</a> Linux.</p>
<p>A lot of people have been waiting for Valve to release SteamOS properly to try Linux because they've seen how good it is on Steam Deck, so it's great to see that begin to be answered. Part of what made Bazzite so popular though is that it's an easy to use SteamOS-like while people were waiting on SteamOS.</p>
<p>The founder of Bazzite, Kyle Gospodnetich, took to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bazzite/comments/1hwqad5/psa_bazzite_isnt_going_anywhere/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Reddit</a> to assure people it's not going anywhere:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been getting asked this a lot so I just wanted to drop a pin to help squash any speculation here.</p>
<p>The Bazzite team is extremely excited for the upcoming expanded launch of Steam OS. Obviously, none of us would be here if not for Valve lighting the way. That being said, we strongly believe Bazzite has a continued role to fill in a post-Steam OS future. A desktop release of Steam OS appears to still be a long way away, and handheld support is almost surely going to be focused on partnered devices first and foremost, and not on the breadth of devices we support today.</p>
<p>Additionally, the first builds of Bazzite were designed for the Steam Deck, which of course runs Steam OS. Bazzite was born out of supporting users with Steam OS in the Steam Deck Discord, and is designed to make up for some of the shortcomings of Steam OS, such as immutability preventing package installs when needed, lack of printing, lack of secure boot, lack of drive encryption, and so on. We also ship a number of helpers and extra packages to make non-Steam gaming easier and faster to get up and running, and are in a position to more quickly work with the community on improvements -- all of which will continue to differentiate us.</p>
<p>It's also important to note that Bazzite is a project and a delivery mechanism, not a product. Developers and users alike can fork, contribute to, and expand Bazzite. This is what makes us Cloud Native and what we're trying to push for the Linux desktop.</p>
<p>We will continue to build Bazzite out long into the future. Thank you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, there you have it, the future of Bazzite continues to be bright. So you can use it without worries.</p>

      <title>Prime Gaming January 11th 2025 edition round-up for Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>A little later than I planned, but here's the up to date list of games available on Amazon Prime Gaming, and what compatibility you can expect for Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck. Each week Prime Gaming, part of what you get with a subscription to Amazon Prime, add and remove various games you can claim to <u>keep</u>.</p>
<p>I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"/> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play. Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now.</p>
<p>Here's the current list as of January 11th, 2025:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Face your Destiny!<br/>
<br/>
In Andergast, whose inhabitants are considered to be notoriously superstitious, King Efferdan awaits a state visit from high-ranking dignitaries. For centuries the kingdom has been at odds with neighboring Nostria, but now first steps are being undertaken toward a lasting peace. But a plague of crows troubles the king, for the birds are acting with unusual aggressiveness, even attacking humans. Moreover, there are those among the citizens of Andergast who swear that the crows are bringing them dark nightmares. As the belligerent creatures infiltrate even the castle itself, the king seeks a skilled bird catcher - an opportunity for young Geron to prove that the reputation for ill luck that has followed him since childhood is undeserved. Following an audience with the king, the prestigious task is assigned to him. However, not only does his task prove unexpectedly difficult, but it also turns out to be the first step of the greatest adventure of his life, which will lead him to the borders of the charted lands of Aventuria and beyond.<br/>

      <title>Thoroughly charming adventure game The Night of the Rabbit added Linux / Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Night of the Rabbit from Daedalic Entertainment originally released in 2013 and has some pretty glowing reviews, and recently Daedalic gave it a proper Native Linux / Steam Deck version too. Bit of a surprise to see, especially with the Linux version coming with the first update to the game since 2013.</p>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And, just today, another patch went up to fix various issues.</p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lose yourself in a tale of magic and wonder, where anything is possible and where nothing is quite as it seems: join young Jerry and follow a peculiar white rabbit to the wondrous realm of Mousewood, a land where critters can speak and where mystery abounds.<br/>
<br/>
It is here that Jerry’s dream of being a magician comes true, though a haunting, sinister force casts a long shadow over the forest. Someone offers the residents of Mousewood a deal of their lifetime - tickets to the greatest magic show that the world has ever seen. But the price is steep, as they'll have to stake their most precious possessions and also their lives.<br/>
<br/>
As the shadows grow deeper, the residents of Mousewood have only Jerry to turn to. On an adventure full of laughter and tears, joy and fear, the young boy will face the ultimate trial, leaving behind the world he once knew, and his childhood, too, will become a thing of the past.</p>
<p><strong>Key Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Story-driven exploration/adventure: The Night of the Rabbit was conceived, written and designed by Matthias Kempke, who believes that games design is all about creating new worlds to be explored by players.</li>
<li>Multi-layered story: it starts out in a light-hearted and funny way, but soon shift to a dramatic and thought-provoking tone over the 20 hours of gameplay.</li>
<li>Original character and world design: the animal people who populate the game were originally developed in short stories written by game creator; these stories are included as the in-game bonuses.</li>
</ul>

      <title>VKD3D-Proton bug fix v2.14.1 released for Direct3D 12 to Vulkan translation</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>VKD3D-Proton, the tool that Valve's compatibility layer Proton uses to translate Microsoft Direct3D 12 to Vulkan, has a new bug-fix release out now.</p>
<p>From the release notes for <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/tag/v2.14.1" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">v2.14.1</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a bug-fix release which resolves some regressions introduced in 2.14.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix a crash on start-up which affected GPUs without sparse support. E.g. Intel iGPU or Turnip.<br/>
	Crash could happen even if that GPU was the secondary GPU on the system.</li>
<li>Fix a memory allocation issue affecting NVK.</li>
<li>Fix a CPU performance regression issue affecting Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered on NVIDIA GPUs.<br/>
	This fix might improve CPU performance in other games too, but unverified.</li>
<li>Not a regression fix, but add a <code class="inline-code">no_upload_hvv</code> workaround for Arma Reforger to workaround weird asset loading behavior.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8521167911736520544gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em></p>
<p>The update will eventually land in Proton Experimental and then a stable Proton version, if it's not already in Experimental yet.</p>
<hr/>
<p>If you're curious on how to upgrade, you <em>don't</em> actually need to do anything. Valve's official Proton and GE-Proton use VKD3D-Proton directly, and so they both pull in updates in their new releases. However, for those who like to live on the <em>wild</em> side, you <em>can</em> upgrade the VKD3D-Proton version in Proton yourself. Do it at your own risk.</p>
<p>To do so you can just overwrite the existing VKD3D-Proton files with the release download of the latest VKD3D-Proton. You can find your Proton install <em>somewhere</em> like this (depending on your Steam Library drives):</p>
<p>For Proton 9 and Proton Experimental:</p>
<p><code>path-to-your/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Proton x.x/files</code></p>
<p>Proton 8 and below:</p>
<p><code>path-to-your/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Proton x.x/dist</code></p>
<p><em>Where x.x is whatever Proton version installed you wish to give a new VKD3D-Proton.</em></p>
<p>Inside there you will see "lib" and "lib64", for 32bit and 64bit. Inside each of those, there's a "wine" folder and inside there is a "vkd3d-proton" folder and that's where you replace the d3d12.dll files with new versions. If you mess anything up, one way to ensure it gets reinstalled cleanly is just to remove the "/dist" or "/files" folder and verify the files in Steam.</p>

      <title>Mecha Comet looks like a fun little modular Linux handheld</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another handheld! Although not a gaming handheld like you may have been thinking. The Mecha Comet is a small handheld modular Linux computer around the size of a phone. For GamingOnLinux readers who love tinkering, it looks like quite a fun little device.</p>
<p>Powered by Mechanix OS (Debian Linux based) it has an interesting modular snap-on front-face that allows you to change the inputs on the device. Extensions for the front include a gamepad, keyboard and GPIO (general-purpose input/output) for you to make your own.</p>

<p>I don't have any need at all for it, but it's another device like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/funded-in-5-minutes-the-open-source-modular-mini-computer-pilet-is-on-kickstarter/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Pilet</a> that I just kind-of <em>want</em> to have.</p>

<p>For the operating system you get full access to Debian packages, and of course people can port it over to whatever distro they like. Their team said their Mechanix Shell is built in rust and supports GPU rendering on Wayland, plus they built an open source UI framework to build on top of their shell. The hardware is designed to be easy to repair and extend too.</p>

      <title>System76&#39;s COSMIC Alpha 5 is here with a new media player, VRR improvements and lots of fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hardware vendor System76 continue building up their new Linux desktop environment, COSMIC, with a fifth alpha now available for testing. Their Rust-based desktop environment is primarily being made for their own Linux distribution Pop!_OS, but with proper support for users on other distributions too.</p>
<p>The first big addition is the new COSMIC Media Player that's now the default, which uses Vulkan for rendering and VAAPI for decoding (where available) for efficient video playback. Cycling through apps via Alt+Tab will go through in the order they were last active, there's improvements to Variable Refresh Rate (VRR), a new User Settings page and you can open links in the COSMIC Terminal.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7170840511736510029gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7170840511736510029gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - COSMIC Alpha 5: showing user settings, video player and Firefox.</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Various other improvements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>New files can now be saved to a new folder.</li>
<li>Ability to rename files using file search.</li>
<li>Show Hidden Files toggle no longer resets after selecting Show Details.</li>
<li>The calendar applet now reflects time zone changes.</li>
<li>Added libnvidia-egl-wayland1 to prevent Steam hanging and XWayland performance.</li>
<li>Support for Linux kernel 6.12.</li>
<li>Lots of bug fixes.</li>

      <title>Terry Cavanagh dev of VVVVVV / Super Hexagon announced a collection of experimental games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Terry's Other Games is coming in February, pulling together a bunch of games Cavanagh has developed over the last 20 years or so updated for modern platforms. Cavanagh previously developed VVVVVV, Super Hexagon and my favourite Dicey Dungeons.</p>
<p>What you get is a little look behind the curtain of various ideas. Some big, some small and plenty of weird.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LArYzU3FqPQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f85662e5ede5f6cb38ca9b7504f167a3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LArYzU3FqPQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello there! I'm Terry Cavanagh, and I'm a game designer. Maybe you've played some of my games before? I made the C64-inspired gravity-flipping platformer VVVVVV, the minimal action game Super Hexagon, and the dice placement dungeon crawler Dicey Dungeons.</p>
<p>Those are my commercial releases. But I've been making games since I was a kid, and along the way I've worked on a lot of stuff! Most of these games are very hard to get running nowadays, even some of the ones that are only a few years old - computers change and things slowly break.</p>
<p>Making these other games has always been a really important part of how I work, and they include some of my very favourite projects. So I decided to bring some of the best of them together in one big easy-to-play collection, as "Terry's Other Games"! It's a little window into what making indie games has been like for me, from where I started to where I am now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could be fun if you like your more experimental stuff.</p>

      <title>Google and The Linux Foundation team up for &#39;Supporters of Chromium-based Browsers&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Google together with The Linux Foundation have announced Supporters of Chromium-based Browsers, a new initiative to fund future development of the entire Chromium ecosystem. It already has a few big names joining in including Google, Meta, Microsoft and Opera.</p>
<p>"With the launch of the Supporters of Chromium-Based Browsers, we are taking another step forward in empowering the open source community," said Jim Zemlin, executive director of the Linux Foundation. "This project will provide much-needed funding and development support for open development of projects within the Chromium ecosystem."</p>
<p>The idea is to provide what they call a "neutral space" where various industry leaders and developers can work together to support various Chromium related projects and collaborate. The Linux Foundation say it will follow an "open governance model" that they've successfully established with other initiatives.</p>
<p>According to Google, their developers accounted for around 94% of Chromium code commits in 2024. They have "no intention of reducing this investment" but the initiative will help contribute "towards the health of the Chromium ecosystem and financially support a community of developers who want to contribute to the project, encouraging widespread support and continued technological progress for Chromium embedders".</p>
<p>What they're not saying though is that Google have likely done this partnership due to the US Department of Justice (DOJ)'s <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp81ppr3l9go" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">demands</a> for Google to sell off Chrome. A decision on which is supposed to be reached by the Summer this year. This is quite probably a step towards uncoupling the future of Chrome and Chromium from being a mostly-Google thing in preparation for whatever happens there.</p>
<p>Considering how Chrome has close to 70% of the browser market globally (Statcounter), along with the Chromium Embedded Framework being everywhere, this is a good thing no matter what in my opinion to have more companies and people get a proper say in the future of the web.</p>

      <title>Sid Meier&#39;s Civilization VII is Steam Deck Verified with the Linux version ahead of release on February 11</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Quite a nice surprise! Sid Meier's Civilization VII from Firaxis Games / 2K has been given the green tick of approval from Valve, as it's now <img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Steam Deck Verified ahead of release.</p>
<p>This verification was done on the Native Linux version too, so we're looking good to go for the February 11th release. Or, February 6th, if you have Advanced Access from one of the more expensive editions.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15557439461736447708gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The developers have been giving out quite a lot more detail on it recently through various first-look videos and deeper dive blog-style posts. Like the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1295660/view/508443269496045927" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Diplomacy, Influence, &amp; Trade post</a> on January 8th where it all sounds really interesting. The changes to the Diplomacy mechanic compared with the previous iteration sounds fun, which is less about what you can offer and more about your overall relationship with a new Influence currency. You get various actions that require this Influence currency including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Endeavors</strong>: These are mutually beneficial actions between two empires. For example, you can initiate a "Research Collaboration" request, giving both players Science per turn.</li>
<li><strong>Sanctions</strong>: These are negative actions against another empire. If you choose to "Hinder Military Production," you decrease the other player's military production output (and incur a Relationship penalty).</li>
<li><strong>Treaties</strong>: Longer-lasting decisions that have utility, such as a treaty to have "Open Borders" or to "Improve Trade Relations."</li>
<li><strong>Espionage</strong>: High-risk, high-reward actions that give you a bonus or inflict a negative effect on another empire, with a chance for your actions to be revealed. Getting caught engaging in espionage reduces your relation with your target and decreases how much Influence you earn for a time. An example of this is to "Steal Technology."</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a lot of detail on the ins and outs of it that's worth a read!</p>
<p><em>If you don't hear from me after February 11th, I've probably got sucked a bit too much into Civilization VII.</em></p>
<p>Will you be picking it up? Have you pre-ordered? Let me know in the comments.</p>

      <title>Razer announced the Razer Handheld Dock Chroma for your Steam Deck, ROG Ally, Legion Go and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems like making a dock for handheld gaming PCs is now some rite of passage for accessory and hardware vendors, as even Razer have jumped in now with the aptly named Razer Handheld Dock Chroma.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">It even has quite a reasonable price, especially when compared with the official Steam Deck Dock from Valve, but there's plenty others about that are much cheaper. For $79.99 / €89.99 you'll get:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>6-in-1 Connectivity:</strong> Equipped with a gigabit ethernet port, multiple USB connections, and HDMI out, enabling a comprehensive gaming setup.</li>
<li><strong>100W Power Passthrough:</strong> Designed to charge devices quickly, keeping them ready for action at any moment.</li>
<li><strong>Rugged </strong><strong>Portable Design:</strong> Constructed from durable aluminum, the dock is foldable for easy transportation.</li>
<li><strong>Razer Chroma RGB Lighting:</strong> Features customizable RGB lighting options for added flair.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19974971561736432592gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19974971561736432592gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17121808031736432593gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17121808031736432593gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The backing stand hinge is adjustable on the angle and can fold right down making it quite portable, and the RGB lighting is customizable via a dedicated hardware button so no need for extra software.</p>
<p>My main concern is the cooling situation, that high stand <em>might</em> get in the way of fan intakes, hopefully they've thought of that though. I remember some earlier docks I tried with the Steam Deck covered a lot of the intake. Other than that, looks quite nice!</p>
<p>It releases January 30th.</p>

      <title>Can 2025 please be the year more games add Text and UI Scaling</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I get it, you worked hard for hours and days and weeks on your incredibly cool-looking interface for your game. You made it so all the text perfectly lines up everywhere and picked a slick looking font, but it's all too darn small.</p>
<p>Even worse when it's some pixel font. Again, I get it, I do understand the <em>why</em>. You think it looks cool and it fits in with the theme of the game, and yes it does <em>look</em> cool but not only is it small but it becomes pretty <em>terrible</em> to actually read.</p>
<p>So, I am begging you, all of you game developers making something, can we set 2025 as the year you truly think about and actually add in some text and interface scaling? And if you use a pixel style font, <em>always</em> include an alternative clear font.</p>
<p>It's bad enough when some games text is so small I'm physically pulling myself closer to my PC monitor, which I'm already quite close to, but massively worse when playing on a smaller handheld screen. From the Steam Deck to the ASUS ROG Ally and all the others, it's a big problem. Made even worse when you decide to dock your handheld to a TV or monitor (or a living room PC), where you're expecting to sit back and relax a bit, I can't read a damn thing in a lot of games when doing that.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17328879551736431676gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Game devs, I'm <em>begging</em> you, please add text and interface scaling into your games.</p>
<p>While we're at it, if your game interface has transparency on it, please (begging you again) add an option to remove this with a solid background. I want to be able to read all the cool stuff your teams worked hard on, stop making it even more difficult again.</p>
<p>Sure, my eyesight is not exactly the best, but I do religiously wear my glasses and with them on I do have rather clear vision (and I do regular check-ups to ensure my glasses are correct too — I like to see in HD). This is a <em>huge</em> accessibility problem in gaming. Think about this too: add into it the ageing population, with more and more older folks continuing to play games, this situation is only going to get worse as the years go on.</p>
<p>It's something I hope more game reviewers focus on too, or at least actually mention in every review if a game has any scaling, something that seems to be quite rarely mentioned. At least players can begin to make more informed decisions. Heck, it would be lovely if stores (hi Valve / Steam) had a way to show if a game has accessibility options for developers to fill out. Things like that would really be ideal, and put more of a focus on it for developers to actually think about it more too.</p>

      <title>Freejam studio closing with Robocraft and Robocraft 2 shutting down</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>End of an era for another game studio, as Freejam - developers of Robocraft and the in-development Robocraft 2 - are closing and so both games will also be shut down.</p>
<p>Robocraft is a online PvP battle arena where you customize vehicles and build them block-by-block. It was quite popular when it originally released but over the years the players numbers saw a steady decline. Since mid-2020 it saw less than 1,000 concurrent players max each day and only continued to lose players.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19528115681736424197gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Robocraft</em></p>
<p>The announcement was shared in their <a href="https://discord.com/channels/194767680849313792/194767680849313792/1326527159862300717" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Discord</a>, here's what they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s with a heavy heart that we have to tell you all that we’re ceasing production on Robocraft 2 and closing Freejam as a studio. With the current market conditions and the server costs required to keep a game like RC2 running, we’re simply unable to launch or sustain development. We will spend some time sunsetting both Robocraft 1 and 2, as well as Cardlife over the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Freejam has been a family to all of us, and you have been part of that. Your feedback and thoughts have always driven us forward, but beyond this, the community’s passion is a massive part of what has made working at Freejam such a pleasure.</p>
<p>We especially want to recognise all of the Admins and Moderators who have helped us over the years, ensuring that the community and the game is a welcome place for everyone. Your time, energy, support and so, so much patience has made a world of difference.</p>
<p>From all of us at Freejam, thank you so much for joining us on this journey.</p>

      <title>Bazzite the popular SteamOS-like Linux gets expanded NVIDIA support in Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're wanting something similar to SteamOS right now that has much wider hardware support for your gaming handhelds like the Lenovo Legion Go, ASUS ROG Ally, GPD, Ayaneo or even your laptop / desktop then Bazzite is likely one of the best choices.</p>
<p>And now for desktop / laptop users with NVIDIA GPUs, you can try out the latest Bazzite Beta which finally includes expanded support for the Steam Deck-like Gaming Mode (which uses Steam's newer Big Picture Mode).</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Noted in an <a href="https://universal-blue.discourse.group/t/new-bazzite-deck-nvidia-images/6139" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> Bazzite creator Kyle Gospodnetich mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As of today, bazzite-deck-nvidia is now available as a beta thanks to improvements in the latest Nvidia drivers. While this is very clearly not a stable experience everyone should jump on, this should at least give our users something to play with and a tool to help report the remaining bugs to Nvidia.</p>
<p>Some important caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most bugs present here cannot be fixed by us, please do not report them to us if they’re already known issues. See our Discord and/or GitHub issue tracker.</li>
<li>This will not allow Nvidia eGPUs on handhelds. Due to issues caused by installing the Nvidia drivers this support most likely won’t come until NVK is ready to replace the proprietary driver.</li>
<li>Only nvidia-open will be supported by these images. That means no GTX 9xx or 10xx support.</li>
<li>If the UI is laggy, go into desktop mode and open steam settings in the desktop client and make sure <code class="inline-code">Enable GPU accelerated rendering in web views</code> is enabled in the interface settings (enabling this can cause graphical glitches in the steam UI in desktop, Big Picture Mode and gamemode), then return to gamemode.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm seriously tempted to acquire another handheld just so I can test stuff like Bazzite on it. I don't want to mess with the SteamOS install on my Steam Deck since it's properly official and supported. Perhaps I should look into one.</p>

      <title>Raspberry Pi 5 gets a 16GB model now on sale</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Raspberry Pi 5 has expanded with a new 16GB edition joining the 2GB, 4GB and 8GB models for those who need that extra bit of room. Ready for you to run more intensive applications, games and Linux distributions.</p>
<p>It's available for around $120 / £114.90 depending on where you buy it from.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15878670771736421814gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Talking a little on why they did this model now:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re continually surprised by the uses that people find for our hardware. Many of these fit into 8GB (or even 2GB) of SDRAM, but the threefold step up in performance between Raspberry Pi 4 and Raspberry Pi 5 opens up use cases like large language models and computational fluid dynamics, which benefit from having more storage per core. And while Raspberry Pi OS has been tuned to have low base memory requirements, heavyweight distributions like Ubuntu benefit from additional memory capacity for desktop use cases.</p>
<p>The optimised D0 stepping of the Broadcom BCM2712 application processor includes support for memories larger than 8GB. And our friends at Micron were able to offer us a single package containing eight of their 16Gbit LPDDR4X die, making a 16GB product feasible for the first time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally they've announced the new Carbon Removal Credits system, where you can pay $4 giving you "the option to mitigate the emissions associated with the manufacture and disposal of a modern Raspberry Pi" which they're doing in partnership with <a href="https://un-do.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">UNDO</a>.</p>

      <title>Maze Mice from the dev of Luck Be a Landlord blends maze-running, time-freezing and bullet heaven together</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>TrampolineTales developer of the popular Luck be a Landlord slot machine deck-builder just announced Maze Mice and it really sounds unique.</p>
<p>You've played maze-runners before, and no doubt a good few bullet heaven games that spawned from Vampire Survivors and games that stop time until you move right? Well, this combines all of them together. If you're after something quite different, that allows you to go at your own pace thanks to the time-stopping, this one might be for you.</p>
<p>“Following Luck Be a Landlord, I hope players will rejoin me on this new adventure with Maze Mice,” said Dan DiIorio, lead developer and founder of TrampolineTales. “I wanted to make a new kind of roguelike bullet heaven that stayed both familiar and welcoming. The cat-and-mouse chase keeps things recognizable, and the time-stopping twist equalizes the playing field for all players!”</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wQaFUv0UADI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5003cd2df48c877eb819e574d38f4a98.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wQaFUv0UADI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Navigate the labyrinthian nooks and crannies of a once-cozy attic as a tiny mouse while staying one paw ahead of ferocious felines. Luckily, in this attic, time only moves when you move! Stand still to stop time, giving the resilient rodent ample opportunity to sketch the safest route ahead. Hoard precious upgrades hidden around each winding twist and turn to stay alive. </p>
<p>Scramble toward safety and collect upgrade dots to gain experience and unlock powerful upgrades. Bundle up in a Tiny Sweater for extra health, turn on the Vacuum to attract nearby items (cheese, please!), and gobble up Popcorn to temporarily avoid damage. Deploy Flame Trails, Knitting Needles, Hairballs, and other pesky provisions to send cats screeching! </p>
<p>Stay nimble to maneuver through the attic’s tricky side entrances, plotting the perfect path to the nearest dots. Escape the clutching claws of different kinds of felines, including curious Chasers and ghostly Phasers. Survive the chaos with tiny whiskers intact, or get caught and take a trip to the Big Mouse House in the sky.</p>
<p>Unlock permanent upgrades and add an adorable array of animal characters to the roster, including mice, rabbits, and guinea pigs, each with their own starting upgrades. Dash through a retro, top-down pixelated world rife with charming details and sway to the sounds of a tail-swishing soundtrack from Vincent Colavita, composer of Luck be a Landlord.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not particularly sold on the art style but like a lot of games I've played over the last few years, the gameplay might be enough to sucker me in for some hours.</p>
<p>Maze Mice will be available on Steam sometime in 2025. Languages supported include: English, French, Italian, German, Spanish - Spain, Danish, Portuguese - Brazil, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Spanish - Latin America, Traditional Chinese, Portuguese - Portugal, Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai, and Arabic. </p>

      <title>OrangePi Neo gaming handheld with Manjaro Linux now due out in Q1 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While announcements on the OrangePi Neo gaming handheld that will ship with Manjaro Linux have been a bit quiet lately, it's still coming and they've updated their launch plan for it to be available in Q1 2025.</p>
<p>The Manjaro Linux team haven't been doing big standalone progress announcements, but they have been regularly updating a dedicated post on their Discourse Forum.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2152255881736346854gol1.png"/></p>
<p>The latest <a href="https://forum.manjaro.org/t/development-q-a-orangepi-neo-01/156450/85" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reply</a> from Manjaro Linux Project Lead, Philip Müller, was posted <em>early</em> December 2024 noting these hardware tasks are currently being worked on:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>To confirm the heat dissipation components,</li>
<li>Adjusted and optimized screen and other components are assembled into the whole machine for verification and confirmation,</li>
<li>Plan to change the thin glass cover plate,</li>
<li>Complete machine to be assembled, verification test,</li>
<li>The structure of the partially modified mold is to be verified.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://forum.manjaro.org/t/development-q-a-orangepi-neo-01/156450" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">main post</a> was also updated at the <em>end</em> of December 2024 to note it's planned to ship globally, sometime in "Q1 2025", so we should see it before the end of March 2025. Müller also added to the post to note the last few weeks of 2024 they were expecting to see these improvements to the unit from their hardware partners at OrangePi:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Update the battery to support 1C fast charging. The battery will still be 50Wh.</li>
<li>A new power adapter to support 1C fast charging will be added.</li>
<li>Optimize sound quality and sound volume of the Speakers</li>
<li>Further optimizations to overall thermal design of the device. This will include:
	<ul>
<li>optimizing the structure to ensure better heat dissipation.</li>
<li>lower FAN noise.</li>
<li>cooler surface temperatures on touchscreen and chassis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>On the software side Müller noted lots of work was going into optimising KDE Plasma 6.2 for the OrangePi Neo, along with various code being upstreamed to the Linux kernel.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Current expected pricing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Base Model 7840u 16GB / 512GB will be 499$ or 4099 CNY.</li>
<li>Base Model 8840u 16GB / 512GB will be 599$ or 4499 CNY.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://neo.manjaro.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">official page</a> for it is a bit outdated, as it doesn't even list the 8840u model yet.</p>
<p>What compatibility to expect from it? Well it's a Linux device so it will run games in a similar way to the Steam Deck. Either Native Linux games, or Windows games via Valve's compatibility layer <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>
<p>Along with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/lenovo-legion-go-s-with-valves-steamos-is-official-expected-to-launch-in-may/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lenovo Legion Go S with SteamOS</a>, and Valve announcing an <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">upcoming SteamOS Beta for more handhelds</a>, it's a busy year for Linux gaming.</p>

      <title>Funded in 5 minutes - the open source modular mini computer &#39;Pilet&#39; is on Kickstarter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Funded within 5 minutes, soulscircuit are clearly onto a winner here with their upcoming Pilet open source modular mini computers powered by the Raspberry Pi 5.</p>
<p>Something I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/i-will-admit-i-had-a-nerdgasm-at-the-portable-pilet-mini-consoles-from-soulscircuit/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">covered here on GamingOnLinux back in early December</a>, because they really do look like a lot of fun. Even though I have no need, I really want one! Coming in two different form factors there's the Pilet 5 and Pilet 7. They both share similar internals, it's mainly about the screen size for what you wish to do with it. The Pilet 5 is more like an all-in-one PC console while the Pilet 7 is more like a tablet.</p>
<p>As they explain: "Pilet is a retro-futuristic, open-source mini-computer powered by the Raspberry Pi 5. With 7-hour battery life and fully modifiable hardware and software, it's built for tinkerers, creatives, learners, and coders who want total freedom. Escape the limitations of closed devices and locked-down systems and bring the fun back into computing."</p>
<p>Check out their video on it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Xe-sZGGoloA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/19d8d13c9d16f0341903630a4e684e92.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Xe-sZGGoloA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Raspberry Pi 5: Pilet is powered by the latest Raspberry Pi 5, bringing performance boost alongside advanced features like PCIe and NVMe support.</li>
<li>Long battery-life: With a seven-hour battery life, you're free to take your Raspberry Pi projects anywhere, no longer bound to the desk.</li>
<li>Open Source: Unlike modern iOS/Android tablets and computers that are closed and offer no room for hardware customization, Pilet runs on open-source hardware and software, giving you full control. After launch, we’ll release full schematics, PCB files, CAD files, and source code—giving you the freedom to tweak and modify both the hardware and software.</li>
<li>Simple, Practical Design: We've embraced the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle to minimize unnecessary complexity. No extra drivers or hardware hassles—just straightforward, 3D-printable, and fully customizable components.</li>
<li>Modularity: Pilet’s modular design encourages creativity. You can design and build your own modules, whether it's for cameras, sensors, or actuators. We’re also working on modules like LTE and NVMe.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Have a look on the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/soulscircuit/pilet-opensource-modular-portable-mini-computer/description" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign</a>. At time of writing the campaign is fully funded and is pulling in funds rapidly approaching £100K. The minimum pledge for the hardware is about £162 which gets you the Pilet 7, or about £173 for the Pilet 5.</p>

      <title>Deadlock from Valve drops fixed two-week update cycle to move onto larger updates</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While developers at Valve continue building up the invite-only Deadlock, their next-generation MOBA, they're changing up how they do updates for the game.</p>
<p>In an announcement in the official Discord a developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As we start 2025 we are going to be adjusting our update schedule to help improve our development process. While it was very helpful for us in the beginning, we've found that our fixed two-week cycle has made it more difficult for us to iterate on certain types of changes internally, as well as sometimes not giving enough time for the changes themselves to settle externally before the next update came around.</p>
<p>Going forward, major patches will no longer be on a fixed schedule. These patches will be larger than before, albeit a little bit more spaced out, and hotfixes will continue to be released as needed. We look forward to fleshing out the game in the new year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems like a perfectly sane idea. Having such a short set schedule must have been pretty limiting for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2696217871736338600gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Deadlock</em></p>
<p>Hopefully at some point during 2025 we'll see Deadlock get a proper public release. As right now you still need to be invited by someone who already has access on Steam. Even so, it's still doing really well with a peak of 18,389 concurrent players in the last 24 hours.</p>

      <title>Heroes of Might and Magic II open source game engine fheroes2 v1.1.5 released</title>
      <author>fheroes2</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dear supporters of the fheroes2 project and fans of Heroes of Might and Magic II! We are excited to announce the release of the latest version of the fheroes2 engine - <a href="https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2/releases/tag/1.1.5" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>1.1.5</strong></a>! This update introduces a variety of exciting changes and new content. Let's dive into the details!<br/>
<br/>
The last release includes important changes to the game’s <strong>passability rules</strong>. The team has fixed several places where passability was incorrectly set for certain objects. These improvements bring the logic even closer to the original game and may even unblock specific scenarios during gameplay. <em>Please note: to apply these changes, you’ll need to start a new game on the same map.</em></p>
<p>We constantly improve the overall gaming experience. In this release, we have added a small but valuable feature for map creators and touchscreen users: <strong>Virtual Numpad support</strong>. You can now input desired numbers without having to endlessly click on arrows - making the process much smoother and more intuitive.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16895362751736336909gol1.png"/></p>
<p>This update also brings enhancements to the <strong>AI</strong>. We have improved the AI's castle reinforcement logic, the logic for <strong>monsters evading attacks</strong>, refined the <strong>retreat behavior for archers</strong>, and fixed an issue with incorrectly estimated attack values for hypnotized monsters. These incremental improvements make the <strong>AI</strong> smarter without compromising performance or logic.<br/>
<br/>
The team has added the ability to <strong>edit multiple Adventure Map action objects</strong> in the Editor. This includes editing <strong>spells</strong> in Shrines and Pyramids, configuring <strong>resource amounts</strong>, and selecting which <strong>skills</strong> appear in the Witch's Hut. These improvements give map makers much greater control, enabling them to create unique maps tailored to their vision.</p>
<p><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3651093731736336927gol1.png"/><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12939051281736336937gol1.png"/><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9630347431736336959gol1.png"/><br/>

As we look to the future, we are laying the groundwork for a major expansion. With the help of an artist, this release introduces a <strong>new variants</strong> of the <strong>Lean-To</strong> object, <strong>Stone Liths</strong> and <strong>Observation Towers</strong> marking the beginning of new content additions. Adding more variety to these objects allows map makers to craft maps with distinctive landscapes and reduces repetitive object usage, enhancing overall creativity.</p>

      <title>Monster Hunter Wilds will have two more open Beta test dates in February</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Giving you a chance to see how well Monster Hunter Wilds will run on your Steam Deck or Desktop Linux system, there's going to be two more open Beta tests during February.</p>
<p>This new Beta will keep everything from the first which includes Character Creation, Story Trial and a Doshaguma Hunt. But it will also add in hunting for a returning monster from the series Gypceros. They say other new content will be revealed later. For participating you'll be gifted an "Open Beta Test Bonus Pendant" and a "OBT 2 Bonus Item Pack". You can even use save data from the first open Beta. Don't expect progress to carry over to the full game though.</p>
<p>Announced today the dates are (times are approximate and may change):</p>
<ul>
<li>February 6th 2025 7:00pm - February 9th, 2025 6:59 pm (Pacific Time)</li>
<li>February 13th, 2025 7:00 pm - February 16th, 2025 6:59 pm (Pacific Time)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>In UTC time they start 3am the following day (Feb 7th, Feb 14th).</em></p>

      <title>SMITE 2 gets a free to play launch date for January</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Titan Forge Games have announced that SMITE 2 is going free to play on January 14, after their paid-for Early Access period comes to a close. The game will still be in Early Access just open for everyone. It currently has a Steam Deck Playable rating, and appears to work well on Desktop Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The announcement was short and to the point simply noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SMITE 2 is going FREE TO PLAY on January 14!</p>
<ul>
<li>45 Gods</li>
<li>Joust &amp; Duel</li>
<li>Assault Alpha</li>
<li>and SO MUCH MORE!</li>
</ul>
<p>Mark your calendars and get ready to enter into the next era of the Battleground of the Gods!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would have thought they would be making a bigger splash about it, not even a new trailer or anything. It probably hasn't hit the level the publisher Hi-Rez Studios was hoping for. It only usually regularly seeing around 1,600 concurrent players, which is tiny for a MOBA. Perhaps the free to play release will see it surge.</p>
<p>Most recent update trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="T_2R-P53Yfs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e74a281e958d06cf2c9bb8e1e4aa52b7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/T_2R-P53Yfs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it: "SMITE 2 is the easiest MOBA to start playing, with features like auto-build and auto-level so you focus on fighting. But the full depth of MOBA gameplay awaits, letting you find your own path to victory across item building, map control, tactical brilliance, or simply outplaying your foes. Compete in a variety of game modes, including Ranked, where you’ll climb the leaderboards and become a true god in the SMITE 2 community."</p>

      <title>Challenging Chess-like roguelike Passant will have full Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Passant: A Chess Roguelike is an upcoming Chess-like roguelike that will challenge your brain, and it's going to have full Steam Deck support at release.</p>
<p>This is definitely not normal Chess by any sense of the word normal. The rules can be twisted in your favour and special unique pieces can be used to change the whole game. In Passant you build your board by earning powerful pieces with unique rules, items to change the tide of battle, and badges which can synergise with your board to deliver victory. Beat match after match of increasing difficulty until you can beat the final boss and become a grandmaster.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="KddOdIhA6WA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/adc70579c637613137572ce533e9ac3b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/KddOdIhA6WA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Writing in an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/3353100/announcements/detail/523079515133445215" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> on Steam the developer said: "This is an announcement that Passant will fully support the Steam Deck. I've built the game from the ground up to work on the steam deck and controllers and I've been mainly testing the game this way."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">How it expands Chess:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unique pieces, such as the Archbishop, Dragon Knight, Dragon King and more!</li>
<li>Rule changes, such as Atomic Chess, Reflecting Bishops and Zombie Pawns.</li>
<li>Items that can be used once to give you an advantage, such as freezing a piece, demoting a piece to a pawn, or promoting one of yours to a queen!</li>
</ul>
<p>It makes use of the open source Fairy-Stockfish chess variant engine to ensure you get a good challenge.</p>

      <title>Horse Runner DX is a wholesome endless-runner where you play as a herd of different horses</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Taking elements from the likes of Alto's Adventure, BIT.TRIP RUNNER, Dino Run, Canabalt and others we have a new wholesome looking endless-runner with a twist in Horse Runner DX. Made with MonoGame, it has Native Linux support and fully supports the Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>Here you're not just controlling on character, but a herd that you build up as you go. Each of them acts like an extra life for you and they all have different power-ups that will change your run. It's a pretty clever little casual game. And worth a look if you're after something a bit more laid-back.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mG9NP7nMlhk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1e19ad15a77b2f5f9e11bd065289ad2f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mG9NP7nMlhk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking about Steam Deck support the developer said: "The game has been extensively tested on the Steam Deck, runs perfectly and looks simply beautiful on the deck's screen. The graphics are pixel-perfect and run at a stable 60 FPS. Input via the integrated Steam Deck Controller is wonderfully responsive. All input methods are also supported on the Steam Deck, and you can switch between them at any time while playing."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Simple &amp; Tight Controls - The simple one-button controls are super accessible and let you perform perfectly timed jumps. You control the lead horse, all other horses follow you automatically.</li>
<li>Herd-Building - After each level, choose an additional horse to join your herd. Each horse functions like an extra life and has a specific power-up that changes the gameplay.</li>
<li>Tricky Challenges - Complete challenges to earn rewards and push your platforming and strategy skills to the limit. At first the challenges are simple and easy to complete, later ones require good planning.</li>
<li>Cute Pixel Art Graphics - Feel like you're back in the old days - with honest, straightforward gameplay, colorful, sharp pixel graphics, and if you want, even the look of an old TV.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I wasn't particularly sold on the idea originally myself. However, this is definitely a don't knock it until you've tried it type of game. </p>
<p>A demo is available on Steam.</p>

      <title>Valve confirms a public beta of SteamOS is coming as &#39;SteamOS expands beyond Steam Deck&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the announcement of the<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/lenovo-legion-go-s-with-valves-steamos-is-official-expected-to-launch-in-may/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Lenovo Legion Go S as the first third-party SteamOS device</a>, Valve have now <em>officially</em> announced that SteamOS Linux is expanding beyond the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Exciting times ahead, as a great many people have been wanting Valve to finally release a proper SteamOS Linux download. And so, Valve will answer the calls, with a Beta.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8447743031736277232gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>As Valve said in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/529834914570306831" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With Lenovo's announcement at CES 2025 of the Lenovo Legion Go S, we are pleased to share that their "Powered by SteamOS" model is the first handheld officially licensed to ship with Valve's SteamOS. We built this operating system to provide a seamless user experience optimized for gaming, while retaining access to the power and flexibility of a PC. SteamOS is the same operating system we run on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Deck</a>, and the team is making updates to ensure it fully supports the Lenovo Legion Go S and provides the same seamless experience customers expect.</p>
<p>In addition, the same work that we are doing to support the Lenovo Legion Go S will improve compatibility with other handhelds. Ahead of Legion Go S shipping, <strong>we will be shipping a beta of SteamOS which should improve the experience on other handhelds</strong><strong>, and users can download and test this themselves</strong>. And of course we'll continue adding support and improving the experience with future releases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Emphasis ours.</em></p>
<p><strong>Update 21:05</strong>: after publishing, Valve tweaked the above quoted text (I've corrected the quote). It <em>originally</em> said "we will be shipping a beta of SteamOS which should improve the experience on other <strong>devices</strong>" but they've now changed the ending to say "other <strong>handhelds</strong>". <em>Clearly right now they're trying to keep expectations a little in check.</em></p>
<p>The rest of the post is an FAQ with details most people who have a followed SteamOS, Linux and the Steam Deck will already know. Like how you have a full desktop mode where you can install anything — including other stores.</p>
<p>People have long joked about the "Year of the Linux Desktop", and while this might not be it exactly, 2025 is truly shaping up to be a really transformative year for Linux gaming as a whole. There's a great many Linux distributions out there, some a bit similar to SteamOS (like the popular Bazzite), but having Valve put out SteamOS themselves is sure to hook a few more people in to try it out. Now we just need that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/new-steam-controller-2-and-vr-controller-designs-got-leaked/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Controller 2</a> to appear…</p>
<p>If you missed it, we also have the announcement that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/geforce-now-is-getting-full-steam-deck-support-with-a-native-app/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GeForce NOW is getting full Steam Deck support with a native app</a>, hopefully one that's not locked to the Deck, so all SteamOS installs can make proper use of it.</p>
<p>Now I'm even more hopeful that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/steamos-moving-from-steam-deck-to-more-handhelds-gives-me-hope-for-better-anti-cheat-compatibility/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the anti-cheat problem will get corrected</a> so games will stop blocking Linux platforms. Remember to follow <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our new anti-cheat page</a> for compatibility. It will also be interesting to see how the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Linux user share on Steam</a> changes over time with this.</p>
<p>Valve also did a tiny <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> Experimental update today (January 7th) that includes a one-line fix that doesn't need a whole article: "Fixed Killsquad freezing on character selection screen". Seems like a lot more people are about to find out just how good Proton is at running Windows games on Linux systems soon.</p>
<p>Be sure to follow our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/SteamOS/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS tag</a> (there's an RSS feed on all tags too!) to keep up with the latest.</p>

      <title>Lenovo Legion Go S with Valve&#39;s SteamOS is official, expected to launch in May</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lenovo have lifted the lid on the world's first officially licensed handheld powered by SteamOS, the Lenovo Legion Go S, which should arrive in May. There's two versions of it: one shipping with SteamOS that's cheaper and one with Windows 11 and you will be able to pick between a few different configurations (eventually anyway).</p>
<p>Here it is:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8365987261736266722gol1.png"/></p>
<p>With multiple configurations available you'll get the choice between processors too. Either the AMD Ryzen Z2 Go processor (they say it's exclusive to Lenovo) or the AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor. The Z2 Go is <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/amd-reveal-ryzen-9950x3d-and-9900x3d-fire-range-hx3d-for-mobile-ryzen-z2-for-handheld-pcs-rdna-4-and-fsr-4/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">part of what AMD announced at CES 2025</a>.</p>

<p>Lenovo did not confirm yet what exact specifications the initial SteamOS model will ship with, at least not in their main public press material.</p>
<p>From the press release: “Lenovo’s vision for gaming has always been to deliver the most powerful and innovative technology, empowering gamers to play their way at their best. With groundbreaking devices like the Legion Go S, the world’s first officially licensed handheld powered by SteamOS™, and our redesigned Legion Pro laptops featuring stunning OLED displays, we’re redefining what gaming experiences can be,” said Jun Ouyang, Lenovo’s Senior Vice President and General Manager of the Consumer Segment, Intelligent Devices Group. “These innovations are designed with competitive gamers and gaming students in mind, providing the performance, adaptability, and versatility needed to excel both in the game and in academic fields like STEM. By combining cutting-edge hardware, gamer-focused AI-powered software, and new form factors, Lenovo Legion is empowering the next generation of gamers to push boundaries and achieve their goals.”</p>
<p>The Windows version of it will be available this month (January) with a starting price of $729.99, with additional configurations coming in May starting at $599.99. The SteamOS version is due in May with a starting price of $499.99.</p>
<p>Valve spoke to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The Verge</a> giving some other details like Lenovo being the only current SteamOS partner, and there's no other third-party SteamOS devices in the works right now. And a new SteamOS Beta is apparently coming that <em>might</em> work on other handhelds. <strong>Update</strong>: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve officially announced a SteamOS Beta is coming</a>!</p>
<p><a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/catalog/legion-go-s" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">dbrand</a> have already jumped in to announce accessories for the Legion Go S as well like the Killswitch case.</p>

<em>Pictured - Legion Go S Killswitch, dbrand</em></p>
<p>What do you think? Will you be picking one up?</p>
<p>Showing compatible games is going to be an interesting hurdle though. No information has been given on how they plan to handle that, as the Deck Verified system will have plenty that wouldn't apply to this device, and in some cases this new SteamOS device may have issues the Steam Deck does not. I've reached out to Valve and Lenovo to see if they can share anything.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Lenovo had various other announcements like a prototype next-generation Lenovo Legion Go, the one with detachable controllers. They said the final production details are "still being refined" on that. Currently the <em>Prototype</em> "features up to the new AMD Ryzen™ Z2 Extreme processor with RDNA™ 3.5 graphics and up to 32GB of 7500Mhz LPDDR5X RAM, as well as a native landscape 8.8" 16:10 144Hz 500nit OLED PureSight touch display with Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) support".</p>
<p>The Prototype for the Lenovo Legion Go 2 also has some other refinements like rounded Lenovo Legion TrueStrike controllers with a circular D-pad. Along with "up to 2TB of SSD storage and a 74Whr battery".</p>

      <title>The latest Tails of Iron 2 trailer looks awesome showing off magic and monsters</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter is really looking awesome, and there's a new trailer out to show off various magic and monsters in the world. It's planned to release on January 28th with Native Linux and Steam Deck support (it's already Deck Verified!).</p>
<p>Developed by indie team Odd Bug Studio from the UK, it builds on top of the much loved original from 2021 with a whole lot of new gameplay mechanics, a fresh story and brutal combat.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="tXEE6ciU1Y4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6042dd68a120af02735b9253cca69d06.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/tXEE6ciU1Y4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Jack Bennett, Lead Designer and Co-Founder, Odd Bug Studio, said, “We’ve been excitedly waiting to share the news for a while that spellcasting is coming to the Ratdom in Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter. Mastering the brutal combat of sword and spear against ferocious opposition is something fans of the original game were accustomed to, so for the follow-up we really wanted to introduce another layer of in-the-moment combat options for players to command and use against Arlo’s foes. The ‘Elementa’ magics of the gods, coupled with the addition of traps, gives players that extra layer to consider, and more.”</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explore a vast, wintry kingdom:</strong> Fully narrated by RPG legend Doug Cockle <em>(The Witcher </em>franchise, <em>Alan Wake 2</em>, <em>Baldur’s Gate 3)</em> prepare to embark on an epic adventure across the northern realm and biomes of the Ratdom; an expansive, frost-bitten land on the brink of all-out war.</li>
<li><strong>Hunt down giant beasts: </strong>Track down and defeat 15 legendary beasts of the Ratdom’s northern frontier and be rewarded with rare resources with which to craft devastating equipment. But be warned, these colossal creatures won’t go down without a fight… and then some.</li>
<li><strong>Unleash the power of gods: </strong>Unlock the power of the four deities and unleash their powerful ‘Elementa’ spells in combat; harness the magics of fire, poison, ice,and electric upon the damned malevolent Dark Wings!</li>
<li><strong>Master challenging combat: </strong> Face down the Dark Wing threat in deadly battles; let the devilish bats taste steel of blade and spear, or attack at range with bolts and arrows… and set elemental traps against these marauding foes <em>(and adjust the difficulty at any point if it’s getting *too* much of a challenge – we won’t judge!)</em></li>
<li><strong>Improved base building: </strong>Construct and upgrade the devastated Rat fortress of Winter’s Edge to gain access to more powerful items from the smithy, tastier meals at the kitchen, a wider range of powerful traps from the shoppe, and more!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Acer announced the new Nitro Blaze 8 and massive Switch-like Nitro Blaze 11 gaming handhelds</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's raining gaming handhelds lately. Acer have now announced the New Nitro Blaze 8 and Nitro Blaze 11. Don't expect SteamOS / Linux on them though, sadly they're shipping with Windows 11. Never say never though, with Valve expanding SteamOS perhaps we may see Acer jump on board in future too.</p>
<p>This is not their first though, with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/acer-enter-the-handheld-pc-gaming-race-with-the-nitro-blaze-7/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nitro Blaze 7 being announced last year</a>. Seems they saw enough interest to keep going, which is good to see for more competition.</p>
<p>The Acer Nitro Blaze 8 will have a 8.8" WQXGA touch panel with a resolution of 2560 x 1600 and 144Hz refresh rate, along with a AMD Ryzen 7 8840HS processor / AMD Radeon 780M graphics. For storage you get "up to" 2TB NVMe SSD and 16GB LPDDR5X memory at 7500MT/s. It has USB4, Type-C, and USB 3.2 ports, plus Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8067736091736254288gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Acer say it will be available "in North America in Q2, starting at USD 899, and in EMEA in Q2, starting at EUR 999".</p>
<p>Hilariously though, they're really pushing what's classed as handheld and portable with the Acer Nitro Blaze 11. This has a 10.95" WQXGA touchscreen with a 2560 x 1600 resolution, 120Hz refresh rate. It's a <em>big</em> one and looks somewhat ridiculous to hold. It also has the AMD Ryzen™ 7 8840HS processor / AMD Radeon 780M graphics, 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM at 7500MT/s and "up to" 2TB NVMe SSD. Plus again USB4, Type-C, USB 3.2 ports, Wi-Fi 6E, and Bluetooth 5.3.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11814230381736253966gol1.png"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Acer Nitro Blaze 11</em></p>
<p>Acer say it will be available "in North America in Q2, starting at USD 1,099, and in EMEA in Q2, starting at EUR 1,199".</p>
<p>As big as the Nitro 11 is, it could still make quite a nice gaming unit when you're travelling around if you have space to put the screen down on something. I cannot imagine trying to hold that up for long. Not a fan of the lines they've put on the controllers either, looks a bit silly really. But I guess they have to try and stand out and appeal to "the gamers" somehow huh.</p>

      <title>Horizon Zero Dawn and Helldivers 2 are getting movies plus a Ghost of Tsushima anime is coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sony have also had their keynote speech now at CES 2025, and for fans of their games the good news is that there's more of them coming to the big screen.</p>
<p>They've announced that Ghost of Tsushima is getting an anime, which is going to be based on the online Legends mode. This will be a partnership with Crunchyroll (which Sony own) and Aniplex. </p>
<p>More exciting news (for me) is that they've also announced Sony Pictures are doing a Helldivers 2 movie, plus Columbia Pictures and PlayStation Productions are "at the early stages" of developing a Horizon Zero Dawn movie.</p>
<p>Also announced is that the Until Dawn movie will release April 25th, with it being confirmed this is a new story and doesn't follow the game, just takes elements from it. They are still related though, with actor Peter Stormare reprising his role as Dr. Hill.</p>
<p>Additionally, The Last of Us - Season 2 is out in April.</p>
<p>See the full highlights in the below video:</p>

      <title>Steam / Steam Deck Beta update brings improvements for Startup Animations, Steam Input and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve updated the Steam Client for Desktop and Steam Deck with a new Beta release, so here's what you need to know. It's basically the same across both system types, since it's a Steam Client update.</p>
<p>Here's all that's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed empty tooltips sometimes showing up as little boxes.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Big Picture</strong>
<ul>
<li>Improved the display of the startup animations on 16:9 and ultra-wide monitor resolutions.</li>
<li>Fixed the display of the Triangle/Cross glyphs for the PlayStation DualShock controller on some Virtual Keyboard skins where they didn't display.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Linux</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed turning off external gamepads connected via BT via the controller chord and after the inactivity timeout.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Steam Input</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Wireless HORIPAD for Steam could wake up OLED Steam Decks when they suspend while the device is connected via BT.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where hitting down in the Keyboard section of the Choose Binding screen could switch to the gamepad tab.</li>
<li>Fixed some cases where bindings were removed for grip or share buttons on devices.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Source: <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/523079515133445114?snr=2___" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Valve</a></p>
<p>It's interesting to see the startup animation improvements, likely another step towards better support of running Steam / SteamOS on more handheld devices that we expect to see launching with or updating with support for SteamOS this year.</p>
<p>Also nice to see Valve fix the Wireless HORIPAD for Steam problem, so you shouldn't need to do <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/wireless-horipad-for-steam-gets-a-firmware-fix-for-the-steam-deck-oled/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the firmware update</a> I reported on now if Valve fixed it directly.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA announce &#39;Blackwell&#39; GeForce RTX 50 Series, DLSS 4 and brings AI to Shaders with RTX Neural Shaders</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA had some pretty big announcements at CES 2025 for gamers and game developers, like the announcement of the new 'Blackwell' GeForce RTX 50 Series, DLSS 4 and bringing AI to Shaders. There was also <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/geforce-now-is-getting-full-steam-deck-support-with-a-native-app/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Steam Deck getting full GeForce NOW support</a>.</p>
<p>“Blackwell, the engine of AI, has arrived for PC gamers, developers and creatives,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Fusing AI-driven neural rendering and ray tracing, Blackwell is the most significant computer graphics innovation since we introduced programmable shading 25 years ago.”</p>

<p>The GeForce RTX 5090 GPU ($1,999) and the GeForce RTX 5080 GPU ($999) will be available on January 30th. While the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti GPU ($749) and GeForce RTX 5070 GPU ($549) will be available sometime in February.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss4-multi-frame-generation-ai-innovations/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">DLSS 4</a> was also announced bringing Multi Frame Generation to "boost frame rates by using AI to generate up to three frames per rendered frame". Additionally it introduces "the graphics industry’s first real-time application of the transformer model architecture" to "provide greater stability, reduced ghosting, higher details and enhanced anti-aliasing in game scene" that will be supported on GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs.</p>
<p>There's also <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/reflex-2-even-lower-latency-gameplay-with-frame-warp/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">NVIDIA Reflex 2</a> that brings "Frame Warp" to further reduce latency in games by "updating a rendered frame based on the latest mouse input just before it is sent to the display" which NVIDIA claim can "reduce latency by up to 75%".</p>
<p>Something else that's pretty big and could be quite exciting for both gamers and developers is <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-rtx-neural-rendering-introduces-next-era-of-ai-powered-graphics-innovation/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">RTX Neural Shaders</a>, "which bring small neural networks into programmable shaders" that includes these:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>RTX Neural Texture Compression</strong> uses AI to compress thousands of textures in less than a minute. Their neural representations are stored or accessed in real time or loaded directly into memory without further modification. The neurally compressed textures save up to 7x more VRAM or system memory than traditional block compressed textures at the same visual quality.</li>
<li><strong>RTX Neural Materials</strong> uses AI to compress complex shader code typically reserved for offline materials and built with multiple layers such as porcelain and silk. The material processing is up to 5x faster, making it possible to render film-quality assets at game-ready frame rates.</li>
<li><strong>RTX Neural Radiance Cache</strong> uses AI to learn multi-bounce indirect lighting to infer an infinite amount of bounces after the initial one to two bounces from path traced rays. This offers better path traced indirect lighting and performance versus path traced lighting without a radiance cache. NRC is now available through the RTX Global Illumination SDK, and will be available soon through RTX Remix and Portal with RTX.</li>
</ul>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After NVIDIA previously released a Beta script to setup GeForce NOW on Steam Deck, they're about to make it a whole lot better with a proper native app for full Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>NVIDIA said: "The streaming experience with GeForce NOW looks stunning, whichever way Steam Deck users want to play — whether that’s in handheld mode for HDR-quality graphics, connected to a monitor for up to 1440p 120 fps HDR or hooked up to a TV for big-screen streaming at up to 4K 60 HDR. GeForce NOW members can take advantage of RTX ON with the Steam Deck for photorealistic gameplay on supported titles, as well as HDR10 and SDR10 when connected to a compatible display for richer, more accurate color gradients."</p>

<p>Hopefully this won't be limited to the Steam Deck specifically. Making a native app means Linux, so unless they have something directly in the app that checks directly for a Steam Deck, it <em>should</em> work on desktop Linux too. And with more SteamOS devices coming, it's likely in preparation for that too as NVIDIA want in.</p>
<p>No date has been given other than later this year.</p>

<p>Their next-generation RDNA 4 graphics architecture and the AI-powered FSR 4 also got a <em>very</em> brief mention, with a guest from Microsoft where it was announced FSR 4 would be coming to Call of Duty Black ops 6 later this year. That was basically all that was said during the keynote about both RNDA 4 and FSR 4. FSR 4 has a "machine learning-based model in its algorithm".</p>
<p>Also coming soon will be the Radeon RX 9070 XT and Radeon RX 9070 with no specifications currently being given. It <em>appears</em> that FSR 4 will only be supported on RDNA 4 as AMD say it was "developed for RDNA 4". AMD are only previewing it during CES, so expect eventual proper details on RDNA 4 and FSR 4 later. AMD say RNDA 4 features "powerful AI engines and revamped 3rd generation raytracing accelerators".</p>

<p>After that of course it all went into AI, where AMD claimed "AI is the new electricity" (yes, that was really said) along with various other AI applications. Here they also found the time between gushing about AI AI AI to announce some more AI focused processors too. This includes the Ryzen AI Max and Ryzen AI Max PRO Series (Strix Halo), Ryzen AI 300 and Ryzen AI 300 PRO Series (Strix Point) and finally the Ryzen 200 and Ryzen 200 PRO Series (Krackan Point).</p>

<p>Not actually mentioned at all during the Keynote, but available in their public press material, they also announced the Ryzen Z2 for gaming handhelds. Before getting too excited though, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/there-is-no-amd-z2-steam-deck-model-coming-valve/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve already confirmed no Steam Deck 2 with the Z2</a> as AMD's preview press material claimed it was coming to a Steam Deck.</p>
<p>AMD said systems powered by Ryzen Z2 processors are expected to be available starting in Q1 2025. AMD say these are designed to "bring console-class gaming to the palm of customers’ hands" featuring up to 8 Zen 5 CPU cores and RDNA 3.5 architecture-powered graphics .</p>

      <title>Intel &#39;very committed&#39; to their discrete graphics cards, Core Ultra 200HX and H Series CPUs announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Intel have presented their Keynote at CES 2025, to announce their newest CPUs along with assuring everyone their continuing with the dedicated graphics card business.</p>
<p>For the graphics cards, Michelle Johnston Holthaus, the interim co-CEO of Intel and CEO of Intel Products, mentioned "I get this question a lot. We are very committed to the discrete graphics market and we will continue to make strategic investments in this direction."</p>
<p>That wording leaves a little room for interpretation of course, as "strategic investments" could mean many things. The Intel Arc Arc B580 is already out and the Intel Arc B570 releases next week (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/intel-announced-their-arc-b-series-gpus-and-xess-2-the-day-after-ceo-pat-gelsinger-retires/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">as previously covered</a>).</p>
<p>As for their newest CPUs today they announced the Intel Core Ultra 200HX and H Series mobile processors. From the press release: "Our Intel Core Ultra 200HX and H series processors are built for the next generation of creators and gamers," said Josh Newman, vice president of the Client Computing Group and general manager of Product Marketing and Management at Intel. "With breakthrough compute and graphics performance, efficiency and AI capabilities, these processors will push the entire laptop experience to new heights."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Up to 24 cores – eight Performance-cores (P-cores) and 16 Efficient-cores (E-cores) – for HX-series and up to 16 cores – six P-cores, eight E-cores and two low-power E-cores – for H-series, based on Intel’s latest core architecture. These new processors give gamers, creators and professionals the computing power they need for gaming and creating on the go – including up to 41% better multi-thread (MT) performance for Intel Core Ultra 200HX series compared to prior-gen HX-series processors.</li>
<li>The Intel Core Ultra 200H series features Intel® Arc™ graphics with up to eight Intel Xe cores featuring Intel® Xe Matrix Extensions (XMX) for AI acceleration – providing up to 22% better gaming performance compared with prior gen H-series processors. Across the entire platform these processors deliver up to 99 TOPS (trillion operations per second) when using the graphics processing unit (GPU), central processing unit (CPU) and neural processing unit (NPU).</li>
<li>The Intel Core Ultra 200HX series processor is Intel’s first mobile enthusiast AI PC with a built-in NPU, providing 13 TOPS.</li>
<li>The Intel Core Ultra 200HX series processor provides the latest in bandwidth and connectivity, with as many as 48 total PCIe lanes (including PCIe 4.0 and 5.0) to connect the latest discrete GPUs and storage.</li>
<li>Packaging improvements result in a 33% smaller processor package overall, enabling new premium thin-and-light designs without compromising on performance.</li>
</ul>

      <title>SteamOS moving from Steam Deck to more handhelds gives me hope for better anti-cheat compatibility</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>With 2025 looking potentially like the year of SteamOS Linux with it coming to more handhelds, perhaps we might finally see a solution to the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/Anti-Cheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat</a> problem that has plagued the Steam Deck and desktop Linux for so long.</p>
<p>Thanks to the news recently of the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/gpd-win-4-handheld-plans-to-support-valves-steamos-in-2025/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GPD WIN 4</a> planning to have SteamOS support (which turned out to be false from GPD - but clearly they want to do it), and the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/valve-will-join-lenovo-at-ces-2025-for-the-future-of-gaming-handhelds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">leaked Lenovo Legion Go S</a> that seems to have a SteamOS version and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/valve-may-be-working-on-a-new-kind-of-steam-machine/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">perhaps some new form of Steam Machine</a> (along with a possible Steam Controller 2) - there's a <em>lot</em> to be excited about right now.</p>
<p>Backing up for just a moment though, because I've seen confusion on this still across Reddit and other social media platforms, the popular solutions <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/09/epic-games-announce-full-easy-anti-cheat-for-linux-including-wine-a-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Easy Anti-Cheat</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/supporting-linux-proton-and-the-steam-deck-with-battleye-is-just-an-email-away/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BattlEye</a> <em>do</em> support Linux platforms. However, <em>not</em> for the kernel-level side of it, since that's designed for Windows. There's also others that don't support Linux platforms at all like Vanguard from Riot Games.</p>
<p>Sadly, with the user share of SteamOS / Linux still only <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">being around 2%</a>, it gives game developers an easy-out for not enabling their anti-cheat to work on Linux platforms, or looking into ways to make them more secure. Why would bigger developers invest in the support, if the user numbers just aren't there? They <em>won't</em> as summed up clearly by Epic's own Tim Sweeney when <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/fortnite-on-linux-steam-deck-not-until-tens-of-millions-of-users/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously mentioning</a> Fortnite wouldn't see support until there's "tens of millions of users" because then "it would actually make sense to support it".</p>
<p>We've seen games like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/grand-theft-auto-v-gets-battleye-anti-cheat-breaks-online-play-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GTA Online</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/ea-respawn-now-block-apex-legends-from-running-on-linux-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Apex Legends</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/game-over-for-roblox-on-linux-steam-deck-as-its-now-blocked/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Roblox</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/facepunch-put-out-a-fresh-statement-on-rust-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Rust</a> and numerous titles from EA completely block Linux-based platforms rather than look into securing them further for the currently smaller market. Many smaller developers and publishers also still refuse to enable their anti-cheat for Linux platforms.</p>
<p><em>At least we had <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/marvel-rivals-team-issue-a-statement-on-recent-bans-for-steam-deck-and-macos-players/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Marvel Rivals recently issue a statement</a> to reverse bans and reiterate their support of compatibility layers like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a> to run Windows games on Linux systems.</em></p>
<p>You'll see comments here and elsewhere arguing to the effect of: "But they say Linux doesn't have many players, and yet there's a lot of cheating on Linux! They can't both be true!". This misses the point entirely. The reason usually being: cheat makers directly end up doing their cheats on Linux, because the protection levels right now are lower. The problem is that even a <em>small</em> amount of cheaters can cause <em>big</em> problems for the wider player-base. Just think, it really only takes <em>one</em> cheater to ruin an entire game and it all adds up. Disabling support for Linux is easy low-hanging fruit in the fight against cheaters.</p>
<p>This creates a loop: not enough players to be worth supporting, so more people stick with Windows on their handhelds and PCs to play the games, and so the loop continues. If we see a steady increase in the amount of devices running SteamOS (and desktop Linux too), it will become a market that cannot be ignored, but only once it's big enough.</p>
<p>I see a lot of people practically begging Valve to release a general SteamOS download, since the Steam Deck has shown just how good Linux can be. But would that actually make enough people switch? I actually highly <em>doubt</em> that. Operating system switching would still be a relatively <em>minor</em> percentage of people overall. I've long said that just having a decent version of Linux available and marketing don't matter enough — it <strong><em>needs</em></strong> to be pre-installed on hardware you purchase. It's really as simple as that.</p>
<p>And this, <em>seems</em> to be slowly what's beginning to happen now which is what's giving me hope that a solution to the anti-cheat problem will be found. It's my number 1 desire for 2025.</p>
<p>I'm not here to offer up any solutions though, since it will require minds about 1000x smarter than mine. But Linux systems (Steam Deck, desktop Linux, other handhelds with SteamOS), will require some kind of secure environment that developers can be assured nothing has been tampered with. It's why they all love Windows kernel-level stuff so much, even though the security of that is rather <em>debatable</em> with the rampant cheating in plenty of Windows games anyway. But again, if the market grows, they would end up <em>having</em> to deal with it or losing out.</p>
<p><em>This is something that's going to require a little patience from gamers.</em></p>
<p>So here's to 2025, potentially the year we see more games having their anti-cheat in someway compatible. You can keep up with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat compatibility on our dedicated page</a> that's gradually being expanded.</p>
<p>For people who do want to try something similar to SteamOS right now, I constantly hear good things about <a href="https://bazzite.gg/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bazzite</a>.</p>

      <title>Zelda-inspired dungeon maker &#39;Quest Master&#39; 1.0 due out in Spring with a single-player campaign</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Quest Master is a very positively reviewed Zelda-inspired dungeon maker currently in Early Access, and recently a big roadmap update was shared for the upcoming 1.0 release. Quest Master has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>The developer has now set Spring 2025 for the full 1.0 release which will include a single-player campaign, which they're building with the same tools that are available to the community. In this story mode you'll be able to explore Castle Town as it grows into a bustling hub of quests and characters, journey through six elemental dungeons filled with unique challenges, and uncover secrets that connect players and developers alike in shaping Aetheria’s destiny.</p>
<p>Quest Master also recently had a big "Coldfang Grotto" update which includes a frosty 7th themed set. This new additions allows dungeon makers to freeze objects in Maker Mode, creating puzzles that challenge adventurers to unthaw them. Additionally it added in a freezing boomerang to halt enemies mid-motion and use them to activate pressure plate puzzles, and you can turn bodies of water into temporary ice paths unlocking new ways to navigate treacherous terrain.</p>

<p>From the press release: </p>
<p>“Seeing the Quest Master community create over 3,000 dungeons is incredible. It proves that this game has become more than just a dungeon maker—it’s an imagination engine,” said Julian Creutz, Lead Developer of Quest Master. “The creativity and passion of our players in Early Access continues to inspire us as we build the Single Player Campaign into something truly special.”</p>
<p>“Quest Master bridges the best of classic 16-bit dungeon crawling with tools that unlock endless creative possibilities for players today,” said Jeron Moore, Executive Producer at Apogee Entertainment and Game Director of Quest Master. “The Coldfang Grotto theme expands those possibilities even further, offering new mechanics that make dungeon creation more exciting and imaginative than ever. It’s incredible to see how the community continues to bring these tools to life, and we can’t wait to share what’s next as we build toward 1.0.”</p>

      <title>Wireless HORIPAD for Steam gets a firmware fix for the Steam Deck OLED</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update: 07/01/25</strong> - <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/steam-steam-deck-beta-update-brings-improvements-for-startup-animations-steam-input-and-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve released a Steam Beta update</a> that should actually solve this issue. So <em>hopefully</em> this means you won't need to do the firmware update.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>If you plan on picking up the Wireless HORIPAD for Steam for use with a Steam Deck OLED, you'll likely want to upgrade the firmware on the HORIPAD. This is the special <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/hori-steam-controller-releases-in-the-usa-in-december/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">HORIPAD released in the USA late last year</a>, with a UK release due January 31.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">A firmware update went out on December 16th noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Steam Deck OLED has a feature that allows the connected controller to wake up the console from sleep.</p>
<p>When the Steam Deck OLED goes to sleep while our Wireless HORIPAD is connected, due to product specifications, there is a bug that the Wireless HORIPAD automatically wake up the Steam Deck OLED. *This bug occurs only on Steam Deck OLED.</p>
<p>The firmware will fix this issue and the sleep feature can be enabled again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20244738541736174584gol1.png"/></p>
<p>See more on their <a href="https://stores.horiusa.com/hpc-055u/firmware/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">firmware page</a>. Looks like you need Windows to run their firmware updater.</p>
<p>Have any GamingOnLinux readers picked one up? Let me know in the comments your thoughts if you have.</p>

      <title>Discord Canary on Linux breaks Wayland screen-sharing support for now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 09/01/25</strong>: a Discord developer mentioned that it has returned again with Canary 0.0.556.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Recently I shared the news that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/looks-like-discord-finally-fixed-linux-screen-and-audio-sharing-with-wayland/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Discord Canary had fixed full Wayland screen-sharing on Linux</a> with working audio, but it has been removed again.</p>
<p>There was a lot of excitement about this but the point to remember is that Discord Canary is their public testing environment, it changes often and not everything makes it into a full stable release of Discord.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">On Reddit, a Discord developer jumped in to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1hsaalg/comment/m59uk64/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">explain</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello! I work at Discord ( see my flair in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">r/discordapp</a> ). Canary tests a variety of different things at different times and while rolling out wayland support we found some other bugs that required us to roll it back for now. Canary specifically should be thought of as "we test stuff in production", once wayland screenshare hits stable it should not come and go.</p>
<p>Our intent is still to get Wayland screensharing out to 100% once we've ironed out the bugs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">And in another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1hsaalg/comment/m5a0k6g/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">comment</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We saw an increased crash rate in general for Linux clients so we had to revert and step forwards to figure out what's causing it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully we'll see it not only return to Discord Canary sometime soon so you can share your screen with working audio on Linux with Wayland, but also get it into a proper Discord release for everyone.</p>

      <title>GPD WIN 4 handheld plans to support Valve&#39;s SteamOS in 2025 (updated: nope)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 07/01/25</strong>: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337913/no-valve-isnt-working-with-gpd-to-bring-steamos-to-its-handheld" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The Verge</a> spoke to Valve designer Lawrence Yang who told them "We’re not currently working with GPD on official SteamOS support". So this news from GPD is completely false. I've reached out to GPD to see if they care to explain anything here.</p>
<p><strong>Update #2 07/01/25 - 13:35: </strong>GPD replied to my email, giving a rather confusing statement that didn't actually answer my question. I asked clearly "Do you have a statement to share on why this was stated by GPD if it's not happening?" (noting Valve's reply) and this is what they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'd like to tell you that Steam sent us an email after launching Steam Deck, hoping that our device could be pre-installed with SteamOS. We did not agree to pre-install SteamOS, but agreed to provide users with a SteamOS image that matches our device for download on our official website. However, they did not provide us with a technical image or technical support, including power management tools for our device and solutions to bugs encountered by users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've pressed GPD again on this, and will update if they reply.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Hardware vendor GPD have updated their store page for the GPD WIN 4 (2025) which notes they plan to support SteamOS on it with help from Valve. The Win 4 is not some brand-new announcement though, it's one they launched originally in 2022 but the 2025 refresh brings newer hardware for it.</p>
<p>It's not entirely clear exactly when GPD updated the page for the GPD WIN 4, but now it does clearly state it will support SteamOS as they talk about going "Beyond The Steam Deck".</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So far, the WIN 4 is the smallest AMD APU handheld in the world, but its processor is powerful, far surpassing the custom APU of the Steam Deck. The WIN 4 inherits the sliding design and physical buttons of the WIN 3, and it supports Windows 10/11 and SteamOS (with system adaptation provided by Valve).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to GPD this will be across both the WIN 4 AI 9 HX 370 and WIN 4 8840U models.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14614169351736172802gol1.png"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Tech specs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Screen: 6 inches, 1920 × 1080</li>
<li>CPU: AMD Ryzen™ AI 9 HX 370 / AMD Ryzen™ 7 8840U</li>
<li>GPU: AMD Ryzen™ 890M / AMD Ryzen™ 780M</li>
<li>DDR: 32GB LPDDR5x 7500 MT/s</li>
<li>Storage: 1TB / 2TB PCIe Gen4 M.2 NVMe SSD</li>
<li>Wireless Network: Wi-Fi 6E, 4G LTE (Optional)</li>
<li>Bluetooth: 5.3</li>
<li>USB4: ×1, 40Gbps</li>
<li>USB Type-C: ×1, 3.2 Gen2 10Gbps</li>
<li>Oculink (SFF-8612): ×1, 63Gbps</li>
<li>microSD Slot: ×1, UHS-Ⅰ A2, U3, V30</li>
<li>Battery: 45.62Wh</li>
</ul>
<p>It's going to be another machine that's incredibly niche though, when you look at the minimum price according to GPD that will be $851 for the 1TB AMD model. Even though it will "support" SteamOS, it seems it will still only ship with Windows 11 out of the box according to the GPD page.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/gpd-talk-about-cooperating-with-valve-for-steamos-on-their-devices/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GPD did say back in 2022</a> they were looking to cooperate with Valve for SteamOS on their devices.</p>

      <title>There is no AMD Z2 Steam Deck model coming - Valve</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With CES starting tomorrow, there's already lots of leaks and speculation going around and Valve have been quick to shoot down an AMD Z2 Steam Deck.</p>
<p>AMD are expected to reveal the AMD Z2 processors today and the website Videocardz ran an article that seemed to include early leaked details. They also said this would include an updated Steam Deck.</p>
<p>However, quickly shooting it down after it spread like wildfire across social media, Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais posted on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/plagman.bsky.social/post/3lf36y66ggs2b" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> to say: "There is and will be no Z2 Steam Deck. Guessing the slide was meant to say the series is meant for products like that, not announcing anything specific.".</p>
<p>Nice to see Valve quickly clear this up. It also goes to show that waiting for official announcements is always best.</p>
<p>Valve have said repeatedly they want to do a Steam Deck 2, but they're <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/valve-still-waiting-on-a-generational-leap-for-steam-deck-2-but-its-coming/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">waiting on a true "generational leap" before doing a Steam Deck 2</a>. Considering the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/steam-deck-oled-is-just-pure-joy-the-definitive-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Deck OLED only launched in November 2023</a>, and Valve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/steam-deck-oled-limited-edition-white-and-steam-deck-australia-have-launched/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">only just launched it in Australia</a> along with a Limited Edition White model, this is still clearly far too early for a Steam Deck 2.</p>

      <title>Valve set Palworld back as Steam Deck Playable but with multiple listed problems</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's been a strange few days for Palworld on Steam Deck. Originally it was rated Steam Deck Playable, then after the major Feybreak update <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/while-palworld-enjoys-a-resurgence-valve-dropped-the-rating-to-steam-deck-unsupported/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve set it as Steam Deck Unsupported</a> and now it's back to Steam Deck Playable again.</p>
<p>We still don't know what happened. Valve's Deck Verified system is quite the mystery on why exactly they tag each game as they do. When a game is set as Steam Deck Unsupported, it rarely actually says why other than very specific times where the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat</a> is clearly not enabled or the graphics cannot be set to perform well enough.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">So here we are again! 3 days after Valve set it as Unsupported, it's now rated Steam Deck Playable again. However, Valve do clearly list multiple issues with it including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Some functionality is not accessible when using the default controller configuration, requiring use of the touchscreen or virtual keyboard, or a community configuration.</li>
<li>This game sometimes shows mouse, keyboard, or non-Steam-Deck controller icons.</li>
<li>Entering some text requires manually invoking the on-screen keyboard.</li>
<li>Some in-game text is small and may be difficult to read.</li>
<li>This game requires manual configuration of graphics settings to perform well on Steam Deck.</li>
<li>This game does not default to external Bluetooth/USB controllers on Deck, and may require manually switching the active controller via the Quick Access Menu.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Even when a game is set as Steam Deck Unsupported, it doesn't always mean it won't run at all, just that Valve for some reason don't recommend it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WS2yS9rO-lI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4725ddf9ab34c482e9fb2922b64adc89.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WS2yS9rO-lI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>After the update Palworld continues to see a lot of players jumping in with a 24 hour peak concurrent count of 198,212 players. We're still waiting to see what happens from the Nintendo lawsuit though, as there's been no official update <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/palworld-dev-details-the-patents-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-for/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">since November last year</a>.</p>

      <title>Marvel Rivals team issue a statement on recent bans for Steam Deck and macOS players</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently it came to my attention that Marvel Rivals did a ban-wave for a whole bunch of players on macOS and some on Steam Deck (Linux) too. Now, their team have issued a statement on the situation.</p>
<p>While Marvel Rivals is only officially released for Windows on PC, players on Linux platforms (like Steam Deck) and macOS have been using compatibility layers like Wine and Proton to play it. Unfortunately, anti-cheat can sometimes trip-up on this, even when players aren't actually using any cheats at all.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The Marvel Rivals team issued this statement in their Discord:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recently, we've received feedback from players regarding an issue where some individuals playing in compatibility layer programs have been mistakenly flagged as cheaters, even without using any cheating software. This has resulted in bans. We sincerely apologize for this situation and want to assure you that we do not &amp; will not ban players who are playing fairly and without cheating.</p>
<p>We have identified the specific reasons behind these false bans and have compiled a list of affected players. We have lifted these bans and want to express our heartfelt apologies for the inconvenience this has caused.</p>
<p>Our mission is to provide all players with a fair, just, and enjoyable gaming environment. Therefore, preventing and identifying cheaters is one of our top priorities. We have invested significant manpower and resources to improve the speed and accuracy of our detection systems. With any any ongoing detection system, there is always room for improvement. We appreciate your assistance in helping us tackle this challenge. If you encounter any cheating behavior, please report it immediately; our reporting system will respond promptly. If you believe you have been wrongly banned, you can appeal to our customer support team, and we will review your case and respond in a timely manner. You can reach the support team via either in-game or in Discord!</p>
<p>Thank you for your understanding and support!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For once it's nice to see such a clear statement and continued support like this. This is the complete opposite to games like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/ea-respawn-now-block-apex-legends-from-running-on-linux-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Apex Legends</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/grand-theft-auto-v-gets-battleye-anti-cheat-breaks-online-play-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Grand Theft Auto V</a>, various <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/ea-anti-cheat-arrives-for-battlefield-1-breaking-it-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Battlefield</a> games and more that went and permanently blocked compatibility layers so players on Linux / Steam Deck cannot play them.</p>
<p>Be sure to keep checking back on our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">growing dedicated anti-cheat compatibility page</a>.</p>

      <title>Medal of Honor: Allied Assault open source remake new Beta gets lots of fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm genuinely looking forward to replaying through Medal of Honor: Allied Assault and the expansions thanks to the open source OpenMoHAA project that just put out a new Beta release. It works cross-platform across Linux, macOS and Windows.</p>
<p>The OpenMoHAA project aims to keep the classic FPS alive on modern platforms with plenty of improvements and fixes.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">On January 2nd, v0.81.0-beta was released bringing these highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>4K HUD support (HUD and UI elements are scaled for resolutions above 1920x1080).</li>
<li>Audio IMA-ADPCM WAV support (sea sounds in the d-day mission landing, subpen sound in Flughafen MP map...).</li>
<li>FOV is now adjusted based on the aspect ratio.</li>
<li>Lot of bugfixes (AI, gameplay/round, mods/scripts, issues in long matches, UI...).</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/363670881735905770gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/363670881735905770gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7728250001735905769gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7728250001735905769gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>A really impressive project, the game is already very playable thanks to it! You do need to own a copy of Medal of Honor: Allied Assault to run it which you can <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/medal_of_honor_allied_assault_war_chest" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">find on GOG.com</a>. You can then install it easily on Linux with the Heroic Games Launcher and just drop OpenMoHAA into the installed folder and run it.</p>
<details class="spoiler_container"><summary class="spoiler_header">Full changelog, click me</summary>
<div class="spoiler-content">
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>4K HUD support (HUD and UI elements are scaled for resolutions above 1920x1080)</li>
<li>Audio IMA-ADPCM WAV support (sea sounds in the d-day mission landing, subpen sound in Flughafen MP map...)</li>
<li>FOV is now adjusted based on the aspect ratio</li>
<li>Lot of bugfixes (AI, gameplay/round, mods/scripts, issues in long matches, UI...)</li>
</ul>
<h2>General</h2>
<ul>
<li>Don't execute newconfig.cfg anymore as it overrides graphical settings</li>
<li>Fixed letters with diacritic not being parsed nor displayed correctly in Spearhead and Breakthrough</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that would occur on some custom maps with a lot of grid patches (increased <code class="inline-code">MAX_PATCH_PLANES</code>)</li>
<li>Fixed a rare crash that would occur when rendering static models under certain configurations</li>
<li>Fixed a stack overflow crash that would occur with a name of more than 30 characters</li>
<li>Some errors that show in console will only print in developer mode now (<code class="inline-code">developer</code> set to 1), as those are not relevant for the end-user</li>
<li>The <code class="inline-code">unnamedsoldier.cfg</code> configuration file will be used as a template for creating the <code class="inline-code">omconfig.cfg</code> configuration file if the latter doesn't exist</li>
</ul>
<h2>Client</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added support for smaller lightmaps (BSP files having <code class="inline-code">_sml</code> suffix). Smaller lightmaps are enabled at startup when the texture detail is set to <code class="inline-code">Low</code> and if the map supports it (single-player levels of Spearhead and Breakthrough), useful for old low-end hardware</li>
<li>Added a new variable to customize the FOV client-side <code class="inline-code">cg_fov</code> (defaults to 80), the FOV is no longer an ephemeral server-side setting</li>
<li>Fixed the client getting stuck in the loading screen when disconnected due to an error</li>
<li>Fixed the client loading the map twice when the server restarts and change map immediately</li>
<li>Fixed the first person model not matching the player model</li>
<li>The FOV is automatically adjusted depending on the aspect ratio</li>
</ul>
<h3>Audio</h3>
<p>The OpenAL library has been updated to version <a href="https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft/releases/tag/1.24.1" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">1.24.1</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for IMA-ADPCM Wave sound files (4-bit compressed sound). Sounds such as sea waves (in the d-day landing mission) and subpen are now played accordingly</li>
</ul>
<h3>User interface</h3>
<ul>
<li>Automatically scale UI and HUD for resolutions above 1920x1080 (support for 2K and above). UI and HUD elements no longer look tiny on 4K resolutions</li>
<li>Fixed an issue when resizing an in-game window, the window would stop being resized when the mouse was rapidly moving</li>
<li>Fixed huddraw elements being wrongly positioned on wide screen when elements have virtualscale enabled</li>
<li>Fixed pulldown menus being improperly focused and activated at the same time</li>
<li>Fixed the crosshair being too small or hidden when a lower <code class="inline-code">Texture Detail</code> value (<code class="inline-code">r_picmip</code>) is set</li>
<li>Properly handle long strings in the chat message box and in the game message box</li>
</ul>
<h2>Server</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the result of the <code class="inline-code">status</code> command which prevented tools like <code class="inline-code">Advanced Security</code> from getting IP addresses (note: <code class="inline-code">Advanced Security</code> doesn't support IPv6 addresses)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where connecting clients would disconnect with the error <code class="inline-code">tried to parse cg message without cgame loaded</code>. This issue occurs in original 1.11, but was fixed in original 2.0 (Spearhead and Breakthrough)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Game Module</h3>
<h4>AI &amp; MP bots</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed singleplayer AI not aiming at the enemy while taking cover</li>
<li>Fixed singleplayer AI not dropping weapons if forcedropweapon is set on the sentient and weapon drops are disabled in the level (should be better for Breakthrough single-player maps)</li>
<li>Fixed a random crash that would occur when using multiplayer bots</li>
<li>Improved multiplayer bot logic</li>
</ul>
<h4>Chat</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed game messages not having a newline</li>
<li>Fixed letters with accents not displaying in the chat box</li>
</ul>
<h4>Gameplay</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed doors closing immediately when blocked (this bug also occurs in the original game)</li>
<li>Fixed smoke grenades not reapparing when loading from save</li>
<li>Fixed vehicle tank tandem causing a crash when a single turret was attached</li>
<li>Make players non-solid when they're a passenger in a vehicle (fixes players getting hit/damaged by the moving vehicle)</li>
<li>Prevent the player from going out of the maximum world bounds in noclip mode (as in mohaas/mohaab)</li>
<li>Prevent the player from shooting silently by firing and dropping the weapon at the exact same time (this is trick is possible in the original game)</li>
<li>When a door is blocked (voluntarily by a player or not), it will now try to open again in the other direction, to make the door not impossible to open (this is also an issue in the original game)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Multiplayer</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that would make the player die or spawn with no inventory. This occurs when getting killed and respawning immediately (this bug also occurs in the original game)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where remote clients would lose track of other clients team that have changed their name</li>
<li>Fixed players getting the score from previous maps if they reconnect at the right moment (this bug also occurs in the original game)</li>
<li>Fixed players deaths (or total kills) being added twice in round-based matches</li>
<li>Fixed spawn metrics being terrible in FFA (like players respawning right behind other players)</li>
<li>Fixed teamkill kick not displayed in Spearhead and Breakthrough</li>
<li>Fixed the match not ending after the clock reached 0:00 in round-based games</li>
</ul>
<h4>Scripts</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an infinite loop that would very rarely occur when an entity is removed from script (this can also occur in the original game)</li>
<li>Fixed script lexer errors (this occured mainly for custom maps/mods)</li>
<li>Fixed unusual issues that could occur in mods during very long matches (e.g., over 24 hours) due to floating-point precision loss in script wait times. For example with JVMF (recoil emulation), ammo would be randomly consumed when firing</li>
</ul>

      <title>Slavic fantasy story-driven mystery adventure The End of the Sun releases January 29</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The End of the Sun is an upcoming Slavic fantasy story-driven mystery adventure that sounds interesting and it's ready for release on January 29.</p>
<p>Developed by a two-person indie team, this first-person adventure invites players to step into the shoes of Ashter, a time-travelling Slavic sorcerer, as they unravel mysteries across shifting seasons and lifetimes. The developers explained that the story begins "in a mysterious village marked by burnt-out bonfires, where players navigate a dynamic environment to uncover secrets hidden in the ashes of the past" and that "With the power to manipulate time, players witness key events in the lives of the villagers, exploring how their choices shape the present and future".</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>

<li><strong>Time-Travel mechanics</strong>: Shift between four distinct periods, each reflecting different stages in the lives of the villagers. Experience their stories in spring, summer, autumn, and winter, with years separating each moment in time.</li>
<li><strong>Slavic culture and mysticism</strong>: Dive deep into forgotten traditions, uncover ancient rituals, and encounter mythical creatures rooted in Slavic folklore.</li>

      <title>Prime Gaming January 3rd 2025 edition round-up for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Welcome to the first round-up of games you can claim from Prime Gaming for 2025, along with the expected compatibility across Steam Deck and desktop Linux. Each week Prime Gaming, part of what you get with a subscription to Amazon Prime, add and remove various games you can claim to keep.</p>
<p>I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"/> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play. Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now.</p>
<p>Amazon haven't yet put up a list of what's coming over this month, but they've still added a few.</p>

      <title>Selaco won IndieDB&#39;s 2024 Indie of the Year Award plus a big sales milestone was hit</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The epic retro-fuelled shooter Selaco managed to win an award as IndieDB crowned it their 2024 Indie of the Year and it seems overall the game has done really well on sales. </p>
<p>Selaco had some tough competition over on <a href="https://www.indiedb.com/groups/2024-indie-of-the-year-awards/features/players-choice-indie-of-the-year-2024" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">IndieDB</a> with it beating the likes of Palworld, Balatro and Hades II. Nice to see one of my favourite shooters getting the recognition it deserves.</p>
<p>Additionally, writing on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/selaco.bsky.social/post/3lermonvkis2p" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, the developers announced it's managed to cross over 100,000 sales. In a follow-up post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/selaco.bsky.social/post/3lermoqdgos2p" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> the developer noted how it has blown past their expectations. They said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our goal was to hit 25,000 in the first 12 months. Somehow, we managed to achieve 4x that amount in just half the time. We went without a publisher, placing all our faith in the game itself, and our the community to help spread the word. You delivered and we're grateful!</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12319893461735902195gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Congrats to the team at Altered Orbit Studios. Can't wait to see the next part of the campaign for Selaco to see what they add into it.</p>
<p>Selaco has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Stardew Valley hits over 41 million sales with millions sold during 2024</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Eric Barone "ConcernedApe", has updated the Stardew Valley website with some new figures showing the pixel-art farming life-sim has only continued to grow.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/stardew-valley-v16-confirmed-to-release-in-march-hits-over-30-million-sales/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Back in February 2024</a>, Barone mentioned how Stardew had hit around 30 million sales but the update on the website mentions that as of December 2024 that number has risen to over 41 million. This means somewhere around 10 million was just during 2024 which is crazy to think of when the game is now coming up on 8 years since release.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/press/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">website</a> notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As of December 2024, Stardew Valley has sold over 41 million copies across all platforms, with over 26 million copies sold on PC, and 7.9 million copies on the Nintendo Switch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13017934271735824811gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Simply incredible and well deserved. No surprise that it is still receiving updates when it's selling so well. After all, why not? Easy money for the developer to keep adding to it. 10 months ago it also hit a record of concurrent players on Steam with 236,614 playing it and it regularly sees over 100,000 in-game.</p>
<p>They're still slowly working on their next game, Haunted Chocolatier. As noted in a <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2024/12/04/update/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> in December 2024, work did come to a halt while the focus went back to Stardew Valley for a while. Barone will be doing the same with Haunted Chocolatier working solo and no plans for Early Access, they'll just put it out when they feel it's ready. So it's likely quite some time away yet.</p>

      <title>While Palworld enjoys a resurgence Valve dropped the rating to Steam Deck Unsupported</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update - January 3rd</strong>: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-set-palworld-back-as-steam-deck-playable-but-with-multiple-listed-problems/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the rating has changed on it again</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Palworld is enjoying a nice resurgence after the release of the Feybreak major update with a huge increase in players. Going from around a regular 45,000 players online to around 200,000 concurrent players. However, Valve have dropped the rating the Steam Deck Unsupported.</p>
<p>It's not exactly clear why. Previously it was Steam Deck Playable up until yesterday (January 1st, 2025), when Valve suddenly dropped it down to Steam Deck Unsupported.</p>
<p>Checking back on a fresh download, with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-4 which is the latest stable</a> release, and the game does still appear to run without any clear technical problems on my Steam Deck LCD. Performance on the lowest settings also still seems to be <em>okay</em>, at least in my old save with a low-level base. Joining an online server also worked fine.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11558142941735822543gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Palworld</em></p>
<p>It would nice if at some point this year Valve updated the Deck Verified system to give a clearer reason on <em>why</em> a game has an Unsupported rating. Perhaps their testing found something specific that breaks at some point on Steam Deck, but we can only guess for now.</p>
<p>Especially odd for this one, since it's a most-played game on Steam Deck, it even has a special banner to show this on the Steam page. It was actually one of the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/valve-released-the-best-of-steam-2024-showing-off-the-highest-earners-and-most-played-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">most played Steam Deck games across the whole of 2024</a>. As of the current numbers (Jan 4, 2024 - Jan 2, 2025), Palworld is the 5th most popular on Steam Deck (27th over the last month).</p>

      <title>Half-Life 3 rumours are about again after a teaser from G-Man&#39;s voice actor</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>2025 is shaping up to be potentially one of the most exciting in recent memory, with more rumours about Half-Life 3 being a very real thing.</p>
<p>We saw back in August 2024 that there <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/valve-working-on-a-new-game-that-could-be-half-life-3/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">was a leak</a> from an actress noting Voice Over work for Valve that was quickly removed from their résumé. And now we have the voice actor of the one and only G-Man, Mike Shapiro, posting a very cryptic video on X / Twitter. It's their first post since December 2020, with many of their previous posts being about Half-Life: Alyx.</p>
<p>Their <a href="https://x.com/mikeshapiroland/status/1874213952680607922" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">social media post</a> has the tags "#Valve #Halflife #GMan #2025" with a video that has a voice over of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another year already. Good to see and hear from so many of you. May the next quarter century deliver as many unexpected surprises, hmm, as did the millennium's first. Then again time is fluid, like music. See you in the new year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, do we think 2025 is really the year of Half-Life 3? Half-Life 2: Episode 3, or something else entirely?</p>
<p>According to a video from Gabe Follower on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP9JgtJPzbI" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, they claim they've been told insider info that "HLX" has started active playtesting so there's that too.</p>
<p>Considering how many times Valve have cancelled projects previously, these leaks and rumours could still end up turning into nothing. So do keep that in mind.</p>

      <title>Valve saw a record-breaking 19,000 games released on Steam in 2024</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Steam continues to grow with it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/steam-sets-a-new-record-with-39-million-concurrent-users-online/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">repeatedly breaking</a> the concurrent online user counts throughout 2024, we also saw 2024 as the biggest in terms of game releases ever too.</p>
<p>SteamDB posted about it on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/steamdb.info/post/3le3chljqbi2c" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> on December 24th, noting <em>nearly</em> 19,000 games had been released. That number was then hit a few days later as games continued to arrive on Steam.</p>
<p>As noted on the SteamDB releases <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">stats page</a> there we actually 19,003 games in total released in 2024. While most years have seen an increase, this was a truly record-breaking year considering just how many extra games were released compared to all the previous years.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21080451431735816926gol1.png"/></p>
<p>The "Limited Games" note is interesting which SteamDB note as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Limited games have "Profile Features Limited" flag. Steam automatically enables profile customization features as games reach certain player and sales metrics that give confidence that a reasonable number of customers that are engaged with the game.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So during 2024, Steam had 15,009 that were Limited Games showing that while the number of releases is ridiculously high, it seems clear a lot of them are really small releases without much player engagement. When you look at SteamDB's stats, the amount of these Limited Games for 2024 was higher than the total number of games released in 2023.</p>
<p>Not overly surprising since we saw games like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/hundreds-of-thousands-of-people-are-now-clicking-a-banana-on-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Banana</a> that ended up spawning lots of clones. But we also saw an explosion of survivor-likes in 2024 as well, as more developers look to get in on a slice of the pie that Vampire Survivors created and while some of them have been really popular, plenty more have hardly been noticed at all.</p>

<p>As a reminder: you should ideally stick with Valve's official Proton on Steam, unless you need specific fixes from GE-Proton. Since GE-Proton has less testing, less support, and it's easier to report bugs to Valve if you're using their Proton.</p>

      <title>Linux user share on Steam ended 2024 on a high note</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have put up the Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey for December 2024, which shows that the Linux share ended 2024 in December with a nice boost.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's what Valve gave as the overall operating system share on Steam:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 96.10% -0.51%</li>
<li>Linux 2.29% +0.29%</li>
<li>OSX 1.61% +0.22%</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of this movement can likely still be explained by the overall drop in Simplified Chinese once again, which saw a 3.53% change.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14339053141735813902gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Check out the interactive chart on our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Tracker page</a>.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Switching over to the Linux side, these are the most popular distributions, which also includes the Flatpak and Snap versions of Steam:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 36.47% -0.44%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 9.70% +0.84%</li>
<li>Freedesktop SDK 24.08 (Flatpak) 64 bit 5.73% +5.73%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS 64 bit 4.79% -0.01%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 22 64 bit 4.62% +0.38%</li>
<li>Ubuntu Core 22 (Steam Snap) 64 bit 3.79% +0.01%</li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 2.96% -0.07%</li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 2.71% -0.02%</li>
<li>EndeavourOS Linux 64 bit 2.66% +2.66%</li>
<li>Other 27.47% +0.67%</li>
</ul>
<p>We have a lot to thank Valve for here, with the Steam Deck with SteamOS continuing to be a big slice of the Linux gaming pie. And with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/valve-will-join-lenovo-at-ces-2025-for-the-future-of-gaming-handhelds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">leaks about a new Lenovo handheld with SteamOS</a>, we could see another boost this year.</p>
<p>There's some things that don't quite seem to add up on it right now though. So it's possible we may see a correction like Valve have done a few times in the past. When switching between just Linux, macOS and Windows the Processor Vendor on each of them adds up to over 100%, as does the Linux distribution list.</p>
<p>All the details can be see <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">on Steam</a>.</p>

<p>Happy New Year! Here's a short look back over what the most read articles were on GamingOnLinux throughout 2024. An easy way for you to refresh your memory and prepare for 2025.</p>

<p>"We've all been there right? You paid for a game, it required an active internet connection and a couple of years later the publisher decided they're done with it and shut it down leaving you with a broken game. Annoying."</p>

      <title>Fan-made PC port of Star Fox 64 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From the team behind PC ports of other Nintendo games like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/ship-of-harkinian-a-pc-port-of-ocarina-of-time-has-a-feature-filled-upgrade/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/2-ship-2-harkinian-another-unofficial-pc-port-of-zelda-majoras-mask-is-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</a>, a new PC port has arrived for Star Fox 64.</p>
<p>Just like their previous releases, Starship (their name for the project) does not include any copyrighted assets. You are required to provide the data files from a copy of the game you own.</p>
<p>Currently the only available build is for Windows, which you can try running through Wine / Proton. The developer said in the announcement in their Discord: "The Linux and Mac versions are very close but we ran into some snags and didn't want to delay the release for it. If any Linux/MacOS developers want to help the ports across the finish line, it's available to be built from source (see our GitHub Starship repository)."</p>
<p>Hopefully it won't be too long before the Native Linux build is up to make it easier to run.</p>
<p>Star Fox designer Takaya Imamura <a href="https://x.com/ima_1966/status/1871337679176237461" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> on X (Twitter) to say "I don't think Nintendo would tolerate this, but I'm personally very happy about it." (translated from Japanese).</p>
<p>You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/HarbourMasters/Starship" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the GitHub page</a>.</p>

      <title>Open source evolution sim Thrive v0.8 brings more graphics improvements and new game mechanics</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Thrive is an open source evolution sim built with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, it's getting more impressive with every new release and there's another update out now for you to try out.</p>
<p>Version 0.8.0 brings with it some more graphics improvements to make all the little organisms look more impressive with new textures, new 3D models plus new and improved icons.</p>
<p>There's a lot more to this release like the introduction of a Organelle Suggestion System that suggests what organelles to add to your organism in order to guide you towards optimizing its evolution. You can ignore it if you wish, but sounds like a useful feature for you to keep jumping to the top of the food chain. The devs also added in sulfur chunks, an underwater vent eruption event that creates extra hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide in the patch, nitrogen is now dynamic and there's two new multicellular loading screen artworks.</p>
<p>Check out their release highlights trailer:</p>

<p>Thrive has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Playable. See more about the update in the <a href="https://revolutionarygamesstudio.com/devblog-45-suggestion-of-an-update/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>. It's free from their launcher or you can buy it from stores to support development.</p>

<li>Added a new tab in the editor to control organelle split order for more fine tuned control over ATP during reproduction</li>
<li>Reintroduced Mac builds of Thrive. Thrive is again playable on macOS but this is not official full support yet.</li>
<li>Balancing changes to microbe storage: most organelles now give much less storage to make storage an actual gameplay mechanic that needs planning</li>
<li>Created new membrane textures that help make the 3D membranes of different types more easily distinguishable (as the change to 3D membranes made all the membranes look very similar)</li>
<li>Reworked all organelle 3D models</li>
<li>Added sulfur chunks</li>
<li>Added a bloom strength slider and enabled it by default</li>
<li>Added an underwater vent eruption event that creates extra hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide in the patch</li>

<li>Mucocyst can now be used by the AI to defend itself</li>
<li>Added difficulty options for what to do with stored compounds after reproducing</li>

<li>Reduced unlock requirements of gas-dependent organelles</li>
<li>Reduced base endosymbiosis time costs by one</li>
<li>Lowered hydrogenase ATP output by 10%</li>

<li>Fixed process toggle buttons not always matching the underlying process states and fixed processes re-enabling by themselves when organelles reproduced</li>
<li>Fixed hex popup menu being able to operate on deleted hexes which could be exploited for infinite MP. Also fix a related bug in the prototype editors.</li>
<li>Fixed not all patches showing up in the editor report patch selector dropdown</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the volcanism effect that caused it to add way more CO2 than originally intended</li>
<li>Fixed non-LAWK unlocks showing after loading a save</li>
<li>Fixed aspect ratio of sunlight icon in daytime selection bar</li>
<li>Fixed chemical equation arrow to be vertically centered</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where compound diffusion between patches could move too much compound</li>

<li>Made auto-evo exploring tool show patch events, note that historical view for events doesn't work yet</li>
<li>Disabled temperature miche being generated when in LAWK mode (no species could occupy it but for clarity it is entirely disabled now)</li>
<li>Added two new multicellular loading screen artworks</li>
<li>Tweaked PhotoStudio image capture distance math</li>
<li>Made organelle tooltips not constantly try to refresh their displayed chemical equations</li>
<li>Added an energy icon for the later stage prototypes</li>
<li>Linked late multicellular prototype jump force to mass to make jumping speed more consistent</li>
<li>Added proper content for the Thriveopedia page of ferroplast</li>
<li>Added code for UV unwrapping of macroscopic creatures, but there's no textures yet so the code isn't enabled</li>

      <title>Merry Christmas and Happy New Year from GamingOnLinux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hello there! It's coming up on Christmas now, and so GamingOnLinux will be starting to go into it's usual mostly hibernating state to take a little break.</p>
<p>As per usual I'll be taking some holiday time and <em>slightly</em> longer than usual over the next 2 weeks. So unless there's some sudden big stories that appear, or just plain <em>boredom</em> from me (sometimes I really just can't help myself) or from guest contributions, you can expect news to be rather <em>quiet</em> over the 2 weeks. A time to recharge, see family and play some video games on Linux (you should see my backlog…).</p>
<p>I'll take this moment to thank all readers and supporters for another <em>incredible</em> year. We've been through some really interesting news through 2024, and it really does look like 2025 is going to be even <em>bigger</em>.</p>

      <title>For fans of Advance Wars there&#39;s a new demo up for Warside and new release window</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Something for the weekend: you can now try out a brand new demo of Warside, a game very much inspired by the classic Advance Wars and it does look good. Playing it a little bit close to their inspiration though.</p>
<p>From developer LAVABIRD and publisher First Break Labs, the game is preparing to launch sometime in Q2 / Spring 2025.</p>
<p>The new demo has a five-mission mini-campaign featuring new air units playable for the first time, including jets, bombers, and helicopters. Plus there's new not seen before battle powers like an EMP Blast which disables vehicles in an area, an Orbital Strike to rain energy beams from the sky and Rage that forces enemy units to attack each other. Sounds like a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Along with a new demo there's also a new trailer:</p>

<p>At some point after the release of Wine 10.0 we'll see Valve and their partners at Codeweavers update <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> and we'll then see a Proton 10.0 release as well. We don't know exactly when that will happen though, for the Wine 9 to Proton 9 release, it took about a month and a half to arrive.</p>

      <title>Firaxis reveal Sid Meier&#39;s Civilization VII system requirements for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Firaxis Games and 2K are releasing Sid Meier's Civilization VII on February 11, 2025 and now we know what power you're going to need to run it on Linux Desktop systems. It will have a supported Native Linux version, as covered here on GamingOnLinux <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-arrives-in-2025-with-a-teaser/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously</a>.</p>
<p>Older games in the series had Aspyr Media responsible for the Linux and macOS versions, but it looks like this is an internal build this time as Aspyr have not been mentioned anywhere. Nice to see a day-1 supported release of such a major game — not something you see too often now with the rise of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> running games so well.</p>
<p>Here's the specifications needed for Civilization VII on Linux</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>MINIMUM:</strong><br/>
<br/>
<strong>OS:</strong> Ubuntu 22.04<br/>
<strong>Processor:</strong> Intel i5-4690 / AMD Ryzen 3 1200<br/>
<strong>Memory:</strong> 8 GB RAM<br/>
<strong>Graphics:</strong> NVIDIA GTX 1060 / AMD RX 580<br/>
<strong>Storage:</strong> 25 GB available space<br/>
<br/>
<strong>RECCOMENDED:</strong><br/>
<br/>
<strong>OS:</strong> Ubuntu 24.04<br/>
<strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core i5-10400 / AMD Ryzen 5 3600X<br/>
<strong>Memory:</strong> 16 GB RAM<br/>
<strong>Graphics:</strong> NVIDIA RTX 2070 / AMD RX 6700<br/>
<strong>Storage:</strong> 25 GB available space</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those actually seem like some pretty reasonable minimum requirements, and compared with a lot of bigger well-known games, not much storage space being taken up by it either.</p>
<p>A week ago they also revealed the opening cinematic:</p>

<p>Will you be picking up Civilization VII? I know I'll be diving in.</p>
<p>The main release is February 11th, but they're also doing Advanced Access on February 6th for people who buy the more expensive game editions.</p>

      <title>Direct3D to Vulkan translation layer DXVK v2.5.2 brings fixes for Alpha Protocol, The Sims 2, Borderlands 2 and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another bug fixes release is out for DXVK (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v2.5.2" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">v2.5.2</a>), the project that translates Direct3D 8, 9, 10 and 11 to Vulkan. It's a big part of what makes <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> able to run Windows games on Steam Deck / Linux so nicely.</p>
<p>However, it's not <em>just</em> for Linux, quite a few people slot it into their games on Windows as well, as it can make a bunch of older games run smoother.</p>
<p>On the Windows side there's this note in the changelog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On Windows, if <code class="inline-code">VK_EXT_fullscreen_exclusive</code> is supported, DXVK will now always try to <strong>disable</strong> exclusive fullscreen in an attempt to work around common alt-tab issues, as well as issues with numerous games that mix D3D9 with GDI user interfaces. Whether this is honored is up to the graphics driver. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4465" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4465</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4485" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4485</a>)</p>
<p>Previously, this was only done for D3D9 applications that explicitly enabled support for GDI dialog boxes in fullscreen mode. The <code class="inline-code">d3d9.enableDialogMode</code> configuration option to control that behaviour was removed accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This change may affect input latency and/or performance, depending on the exact implementation of Vulkan swap chains in the graphics driver. It does <strong>not</strong> affect Linux systems in any way since the concept of exclusive fullscreen, and thus any problems associated with it, do not exist there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And everything else:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added an implementation of D3D9 shader validation interfaces. This is needed for <strong>The Void</strong> and used in several other D3D9 games. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4398" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4398</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed behaviour when D3D9 applications use incorrect texture types as seen in <strong>Alpha Protocol</strong>. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4513" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4513</a>)</li>
<li>If <code class="inline-code">VK_KHR_maintenance5</code> is supported, DXVK will now use <code class="inline-code">VK_FORMAT_A8_UNORM</code> to implement the corresponding D3D11 format. This fixes warnings in various games, as well as rendering issues in <strong>TopSpin 2K25</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/4514" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4514</a>).</li>
<li>Optimized behaviour of disabled clip planes for D3D9 games. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4508" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4508</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the <code class="inline-code">DXVK_CONFIG</code> environment variable was not applied correctly under specific circumstances.</li>
<li>Fixed various issues causing Wine test failures for D3D8 and D3D9. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4479" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4479</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Borderlands 2:</strong> Fixed missing lava in certain places. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4482" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4482</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Codename Panzers: Phase One / Two</strong>: Work around an issue with the main menu not rendering on regular Wine builds. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4495" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4495</a>)</li>
<li><strong>The Sims 2</strong>: Extended existing app profiles to various mod tools. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/4518" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4518</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4520" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4520</a>)</li>

<em>Pictured - Alpha Protocol</em></p>
<hr/>
<p>If you're curious on how to upgrade, you <em>don't</em> actually need to do anything. Valve's official Proton and GE-Proton use DXVK directly, and so they both pull in updates in their new releases. However, for those who like to live on the <em>wild</em> side, you <em>can</em> upgrade the DXVK version in Proton yourself. Do it at your own risk.</p>
<p>To do so you can just overwrite the existing DXVK files with the release download of the latest DXVK. You can find your Proton install <em>somewhere</em> like this (depending on your Steam Library drives):</p>
<p>For Proton 9 and Proton Experimental:</p>
<p><code>path-to-your/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Proton x.x/files</code></p>
<p>Proton 8 and below:</p>
<p><code>path-to-your/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Proton x.x/dist</code></p>
<p><em>Where x.x is whatever Proton version installed you wish to give a new DXVK.</em></p>
<p>Inside there you will see "lib" and "lib64", for 32bit and 64bit. Inside each of those, there's a "wine" folder and inside there is a "dxvk" folder and that's where you replace the files with new versions. If you mess anything up, one way to ensure it gets reinstalled cleanly is just to remove the "/dist" folder.</p>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 Comic issue 7 is finally, officially available</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What a nice early holiday surprise. The official Team Fortress 2 comic has finally officially returned. Now you've got something to read over the weekend. In an official <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=235677" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> titled "A Smissmas Miracle" on the Team Fortress 2 website, Valve developers posted this message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Did you know the construction of the Leaning Tower of Pisa was one hundred and ninety nine years late? Literally everyone alive when construction started was dead by the time it finished. So unless you're having this read to you from the bad side of a Ouija board, you made it out the other end of issue seven's historically-speaking-pretty-short seven year delay alive. Which isn't too bad.</p>
<p>And, honestly, we can think of another, much more popular project we're involved with that you're STILL waiting on: The Sagrada Familia in Barcelona, which began construction in 1886 and still isn't done, and which the Spanish government hired us to write a delay-themed blog post about after seeing an early draft of the blog post you're reading right now</p>
<p>Speaking of you reading things, we are very, very relieved to present <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/tf07_thedayshavewornaway/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Team Fortress Comics issue 7</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Nice to see Valve finally did it. </em></p>
<p>The Smissmas event is also ongoing in Team Fortress 2 has been live since December 11th that included:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>All players who play TF2 during the event will receive a Stuffed Stocking as a gift! Stockings contain goodies for good little Mercenaries.</li>
<li>Featuring 6 new community maps: Overcast, Fortezza, Penguin Peak, Patagonia, Cutter, and Maul</li>
<li>Added the Winter 2024 Cosmetic Case
	<ul>
<li>Contains 23 new community-contributed items</li>
<li>The Festivizer can be found as a bonus drop when opening the case</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added 3 new community-contributed taunts to the Mann Co. Store
	<ul>
<li>Taunt: Fore-Head Slice</li>
<li>Taunt: Peace!</li>
<li>Taunt: Curtain Call</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added 18 new community-created Unusual effects
	<ul>
<li>9 new effects for Unusual hats</li>
<li>9 new effects for Unusual taunts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All cosmetic and taunt cases will grant Smissmas 2024 Unusual effects instead of their normal Unusual effects during the event. This does not include crates.</li>

      <title>Cult classic RPG &#39;OFF&#39; is getting an expanded Steam release in 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A game I had honestly never heard of because I live under a rock. A cult classic RPG named OFF is getting a Steam release next year. It was originally released in 2008 from Belgian developer Mortis Ghost, who has now teamed up with Fangamer for the updated version.</p>
<p>Why is this one important? Well, despite never having a proper store page anywhere as it was distributed across various direct-downloads, it managed to amass quite a following. It's had millions of downloads and was even cited multiple times by UNDERTALE's own Toby Fox as an inspiration for his designs.</p>
<p>The press email notes "This definitive version features an all-new battle system, balancing improvements, as well as new areas and hidden bosses from the game’s creator, Mortis Ghost. The surreal indie RPG, originally released in French, has now also received an OFFicial English translation."</p>

<p>Take control of the Batter as he seeks to purify an uncanny and hopeless world haunted by specters, guided by a cryptic, grinning cat called The Judge.</p>
<p>As they move the Batter through increasingly confused zones—a farm that extracts metal from the inside of cattle, an amusement park full of people too frightened to enjoy themselves, a sugar factory with ominous smokestacks—players must reckon with The Batter’s mission themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fangamer aren't just publishing though, they're directly involved in the development too. As co-founder Ryan Alyea said in the press email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fangamer has published physical editions of indie games for a while now, but OFF is the first time we’ve moved into the development side for Steam and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Lots of us here love the game; for a long time the English fan translation was actually distributed on a forum post on <a href="https://u26296841.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.nGLunG4LVL0Tj1EHduMYhbQSs1E7JPkjEdqjBab8Nqk-3DtL_9_M7561dTk8oPSP7-2FkK3w4hSHrn1BMbSU-2F-2FKpCHpwgmXY0SDTxQGZXQjvOzHrcVZDk-2BzyR625fNlwUnzHvTV0yy0oGJNoFf-2BpjS-2F8533TJr312Ce2cBxKEDc0rZxYlhQB3H0wyEJtnEpJqvlTpsazuL0YxePlW6KbXFEmDUFIt5s7unYboq21peWsgyI3ku-2FwMQ7a3ssdqNViP4YDAHrFtViAvlz5e-2FP9siRnLfyDzZaUaEcGvSsd5hLbV4lQNa53bdcxlnGialu9t6Tdf-2FmxBrVKo1r8lp-2FxTHsFX6TOz1qqWfIB9Przwfll2dPZOWWl98ewDDk4N5w9kOQoTFfPSrSTtLXqR5LWNUkCAwDzn2SGnM0RD-2Bn9nrY-2BySZhivGQhUt6UU78WxsoEuXkCEPo3mH-2BiqW08tht9BH15FqPb-2BEm9yE8A4Ynjx3ok2DImgewayhEggcRP0N9OysLe3vrf-2BLiBBJFakWalcmpXRvTJruo-3D" target="_blank">Starmen.Net</a>, the EarthBound fansite started by many of us in 1998.</p>
<p>Moving a game that began as a freeware RPG Maker 2003 title to modern platforms wasn’t easy, but it felt like a perfect project for us.</p>
<p>​It’s a great game, and it’s very rewarding to be able to help build something that’s exciting for old fans and accessible to players who might not have found OFF otherwise.</p>

      <title>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is getting a price increase in January 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor, the popular bullet heaven / survivor-like spin-off from Funday Games and Ghost Ship Publishing continues to be very popular and so the price is set to go up soon.</p>
<p>The developer said in announcement that on January 2nd, 2025 that the price will rise to $12.99 / €12.99 / £11.99 which to me still seems perfectly reasonable for it. They're doing it as they've "added a lot of content to Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor since we released it, and to reflect the added value we’ll increase the price a bit".</p>
<p>As soon as the Steam Winter Sale ends it goes up, so if you were on the fence you might want to jump over with the current 30% discount on it.</p>
<p>Check out the recent trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AqujRQcBDm0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0dfc9ca515724ea151562f475e2202a3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AqujRQcBDm0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The most recent player reviews on Steam give it an Overwhelmingly Positive rating, with a Very Positive rating overall. It's Steam Deck Verified and Platinum on ProtonDB so you're good to go across Steam Deck and Desktop Linux.</p>

      <title>The Rogue Prince of Persia will not get Ubisoft Connect and no price rise in January</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two bits of good news for gamers interested in picking up The Rogue Prince of Persia from developers Evil Empire and publisher Ubisoft, as they've given an update on some future plans. The game is currently rated Steam Deck Verified and Gold on ProtonDB.</p>
<p>In a fresh <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2717880/view/652556020635141599" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam posted December 19th the developer clarified that "There will in fact be no Ubisoft Connect at all for the game on Steam.". It was previously planned as an optional feature but now they're not doing it. On top of that a planned price rise for January is also off the table, but the price may still go up in future.</p>
<p>Back in November the developers at Evil Empire gave the game quite a big upgrade too, check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yEOalMmItLA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0c94c12ad0e8d4ea7f83abe751223506.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yEOalMmItLA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A roadmap for the first part of 2025 has also been put up:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11956437281734705380gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11956437281734705380gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The game is 25% off during the Steam Winter Sale 24. It has a Very Positive rating on Steam so clearly players have been enjoying this one from some of the team previously responsible for Dead Cells.</p>

      <title>Valve will join Lenovo at CES 2025 for the future of gaming handhelds</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It seems the stage has been set for more SteamOS Linux devices to join the Steam Deck, as Valve will be partnering up with Lenovo at CES 2025. The news comes from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/19/24325072/lenovo-legion-go-ces-event-valve-microsoft" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The Verge</a>, who got a press email invitation to the event, which I haven't seen.</p>
<p>As The Verge's Sean Hollister notes the email they received from Lenovo mentioned "The future of gaming handhelds is coming to CES '25".</p>
<p>Quite likely it will be the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/the-upcoming-lenovo-legion-go-s-may-come-with-a-steamos-linux-version/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">upcoming leaked Lenovo Legion Go S</a>, which follows on from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/valves-new-branding-guidelines-hint-at-steam-decks-steamos-for-more-devices/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve updating their brand guidelines</a> for SteamOS to include third-party hardware vendors. According to Hollister the email noted Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais will be there as Valve's "Chief Design Architect" for the event. Although, Jason Ronald, Microsoft VP of Xbox Gaming Devices and Ecosystem is also attending the event. We've seen from the leaks that Lenovo might have multiple handhelds likely to launch, so it makes sense if other devices will have Windows.</p>

      <title>Sony buy up KADOKAWA shares to become largest shareholder of the FromSoftware parent company</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There it is, the deal has been announced. Sony and KADOKAWA have "signed a strategic capital and business alliance agreement" that will make Sony the largest shareholder. It's not done just yet though, as the deal is set to go through on January 7, 2025.</p>
<p>Sony will acquire 12,054,100 new KADOKAWA shares for "approximately 50 billion yen", this will bump up Sony to have about 10% total shares in KADOKAWA and make them the largest holder overall. This is a <em>big</em> deal for video games, Anime and Manga since Kadokawa control FromSoftware (ELDEN RING, ARMORED CORE), Spike Chunsoft (Danganronpa, DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO), ACQUIRE Corp. (OCTOPATH TRAVELER) and Gotcha Gotcha Games (RPG Maker) in addition to all their Anime and Manga publishing.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Comment from Takeshi Natsuno, Chief Executive Officer, KADOKAWA CORPORATION</p>
<p>"We are very pleased to conclude this capital and business alliance agreement with Sony. This alliance is expected to not only further strengthen our IP creation capabilities, but also increase our IP media mix options with Sony's support for global expansion, allowing us to deliver our IP to more users around the world. We are confident that this will greatly contribute to maximizing the value of our IP and increasing our corporate value in the mid- to long-term. We intend to do our utmost to ensure that our collaborative efforts with Sony produce great results in the global market."</p>
<p>Comment from Hiroki Totoki, President, COO and CFO, Sony Group Corporation</p>
<p>"Through this capital and business alliance, we will become the largest shareholder of KADOKAWA, which consistently creates a wide variety of IP, including publications and books, such as light novels and comics, as well as games and anime. By combining KADOKAWA's extensive IP and IP creation ecosystem with the strengths of Sony, which has promoted the global expansion of a wide range of entertainment, including anime and games, we plan to work closely together to realize KADOKAWA's 'Global Media Mix' strategy, aimed at maximizing the value of its IP, and Sony's long-term vision, 'Creative Entertainment Vision.'"</p>

      <title>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl gets a massive patch with an AI overhaul and lots of A-Life fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl from GSC Game World has a huge patch out now, that attempts to fix up a lot of the disappointments and bugs with their A-Life system and other AI issues. I mentioned in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review-works-on-linux-desktop-with-proton-but-poorly-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my original review</a> that it had a lot of bugs, and the AI system was not particularly great. It certainly sounds like this patch will fix up a lot of my and everyone else's complaints about it.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some of the A-Life biggest fixes and improvements include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the issue with spawning NPCs behind the player's back.</li>
<li>Players can now encounter roaming NPCs across the Zone more often.</li>
<li>Greatly extended the distance at which A-Life NPCs are visible to the player.</li>
<li>Fixed the aggressive optimization issue that prevented A-Life NPCs to exist in Offline (out of player's visualization range).
	<ul>
<li>In Offline mode, A-Life will continue to advance towards their goals over time.</li>
<li>Players may now have opportunities to encounter A-Life NPCs they've previously met by following in the same direction as the NPCs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improved A-Life NPCs navigation in Offline using GameGraph (global AI navigation map):
	<ul>
<li>Fixed multiple issues where NPCs would fail to follow or find a path to their designated goals.</li>
<li>Fixed several issues with NPC being stuck in Online-Offline transition state,</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enhanced A-Life NPCs' motivation to expand territory and actively attack enemies and mutants.</li>
<li>Fixed issues that could result in fewer A-life NPCs encountered than intended.</li>
<li>Further contextual actions improvement to ensure seamless transitions between Offline and Online states for NPCs engaged in these actions.</li>
<li>The groups exploring the Zone are now more diverse regarding possible factions and group sizes.</li>
<li>Fixed issue that while roaming over the Zone, Human NPCs didn't satisfy their communication needs and talks. </li>
</ul>

<em>Pictured - Stalker 2 on Linux</em></p>
<p>Above is just the A-Life system changes. There's absolutely loads of other bug fixes and improvements across the whole game. From cut-scene problems to story progression issues and more, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/525329871842312365" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">it's truly massive</a>. Lots of fixes to various visual bugs too which is great to see.</p>
<p>Think I'll have to dive back in again soon and see how much it has improved. <em>Once the 110GB patch download has finished that is…</em></p>

      <title>New Linux kernel patch submitted to improve Lenovo Legion series support including Lenovo Legion Go </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Looks like we may see some improvements to the Lenovo Legion series of hardware like the Lenovo Legion Go handheld when running on Linux, thanks to a new Linux kernel patch that's been sent in.</p>
<p>From the developer Derek J. Clark <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2024/12/17/1611" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the patch</a> mentions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Adds support for the Lenovo Legion series of laptop hardware to use WMI interfaces that control various power settings. There are multiple WMI interfaces that work in concert to provide getting and setting values as well as validation of input. Currently only the "GameZone", "Other Method", and "LENOVO_CAPABILITY_DATA_01" interfaces are implemented, but I attempted to structure the driver so that adding the "Custom Mode", "Lighting", and the other CAPABILITY_DATA interfaces would be trivial if desired in a later patch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clark mentioned how they tested it directly on a Lenovo Legion Go. It's actually supposed to be a replacement for a <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/20241118100503.14228-1-jonmail@163.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">previous patch</a> and was inspired by the Linux <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/20240930000046.51388-1-luke@ljones.dev/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">asus-armoury driver</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18347934551734606115gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Nice to see continued direct improvements in the upstream Linux kernel for handhelds like this. Especially interesting as it seems we may get a SteamOS Linux version of the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/the-upcoming-lenovo-legion-go-s-may-come-with-a-steamos-linux-version/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">upcoming Lenovo Legion Go S</a>.</p>
