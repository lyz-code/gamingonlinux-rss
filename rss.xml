      <title>GE-Proton 9-16 released with mod support for various Bethesda games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're modding Bethesda games on Linux / Steam Deck, GE-Proton 9-16 could make things a little easier for you.</p>
<p>As your reminder: GE-Proton (or Proton-GE) a community-build of Proton, nothing to do with the official Proton from Valve. You'll find GE adds specific fixes that Valve often can't (due to legal reasons), and sometimes other special additions, but GE comes with less testing and support. Usually you only want to use it for specific games until they work properly in Valve's Proton, <em>or</em> for using Proton outside of Steam like in Heroic and Lutris. See more about <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton in my guide</a>.</p>
<p>In GE-Proton 9-16 one of the main additions is a change to how Bethesda games will launch like the Fallout series, Skyrim, Oblivion and Starfield. If GE-Proton detects a known mod executable for these it will launch that <em>instead</em> of the original - something that will just save players a fair bit of messing around. Seems like a nice change!</p>
<p>Another addition is that games run with UMU (Unified launcher for Windows games on Linux), for using it outside of Steam like in Heroic Games, is that games will now have the <code class="inline-code">/mnt</code>, <code class="inline-code">/run/media</code> and <code class="inline-code">/media</code> and the user's home folder added as drives that games can see.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7527689401729065035gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Skyrim</em></p>
<p>There's also a few other game-specific fixes, and the usual additions of new code from the official upstream projects.</p>
<p>Here's the full <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton9-16" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Proton:</p>
<ul>
<li>import upstream makefile changes</li>
<li>import upstream proton changes</li>
<li>import upstream steam_helper changes</li>
<li>import upstream vkd3d-shader changes</li>
<li>update wine to latest bleeding edge</li>
<li>updated dxvk to latest git</li>
<li>update vkd3d-proton to latest git</li>
<li>update dxvk-nvapi to e4bad70</li>
</ul>
<p>Protonfixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>fixed issue with game_titles not being pulled correctly for UMU</li>
<li>game_titles are now looked up as part of included umu-database csv instead of trying to send online website api call</li>
<li>games run with UMU will now have /mnt,/run/media,/media/, and the user's home folder added as drives u:,v:,w:,x: respectively inside the prefix if they are not empty. This is to allow users to install or import games outside of the prefix more conveniently. A typical scenario for this would be if you have your games pre-installed on a different mounted drive, or somewhere else in your home folder outside of the prefix and you want to add them without reinstalling the game, OR if you want to install the game to one of those mounts instead of the C:\ drive inside the wine prefix. With steam, users don't really have to worry about this because steam handles the drive mounts and the install locations, however we found that outside of steam users were trying to use the Z: drive (which is symlinked to root (/)) -- which is of course containerized and read only, and therefore also unable to provide a proper drive size, resulting in users being told they don't have enough space. With the new drives added into the prefix it should fix this, allowing users to access their mount locations or existing game folders for installation or importing via the new drives instead of Z:.</li>
<li>Mod support for various bethesda games has been added (Thanks Root-Core). If a mod executable is found for bethesda games it will launch the mod executable instead of the original:<br/>
mapping = {<br/>
'22380': ('FalloutNV.exe', 'nvse_loader.exe'), # Fallout New Vegas<br/>
'22370': ('FalloutLauncher.exe', 'fose_loader.exe'), # Fallout 3<br/>
'377160': ('Fallout4Launcher.exe', 'f4se_loader.exe'), # Fallout 4<br/>
'22330': ('OblivionLauncher.exe', 'obse_loader.exe'), # Oblivion<br/>
'72850': ('SkyrimLauncher.exe', 'skse_loader.exe'), # Skyrim<br/>
'489830': ('SkyrimSELauncher.exe', 'skse64_loader.exe'), # Skyrim SE<br/>
'1716740': ('Starfield.exe', 'sfse_loader.exe') # Starfield<br/>
}.get(game_id, ('', ''))</li>
<li>protonfix added for metal gear solid 2 (thanks FranjeGueje)</li>
<li>protonfix for Kindom Hearts HD Remix added for steam version (already existed for egs version) (thanks Internetbestfriend)</li>
<li>protonfix added for Gothic Playable Teaser (thanks Root-Core)</li>
<li>Star Citizen protonfix updated (no longer requires EAC workaround)</li>
</ul>

      <title>Rogue Legacy 1 source code released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rogue Legacy, a rogue-lite from Cellar Door Games, that originally released in 2013 has now had the source code released. The game has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://x.com/CellarDoorGames/status/1846246914406195662" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Twitter / X the developer noted they've been working with game porter and FNA developer, Ethan Lee, to make this happen who will be maintaining it going forward.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8915973611729018609gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The game is <u>not</u> open source though, to be completely clear on that. It's source available under a <em>custom</em> license with certain restrictions, much the same as <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/01/vvvvvv-from-terry-cavanagh-has-the-source-code-opened-up-to-celebrate-the-10-year-anniversary/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VVVVVV</a> and is actually based on the license that Terry Cavanagh used for it. This is also only the source code, it does <em>not</em> include the assets - so you still need to own a copy of the game.</p>
<p>In their own <a href="https://x.com/flibitijibibo/status/1846249473741410725" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a>, Ethan Lee posted on Twitter / X that they intend to take on community contributions to it, and they're in progress on upgrading it to use SDL 3 that's currently in Beta.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3823223841729018862gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Really great to see more developers open up the code for their older games. This way they can practically live on forever. It would have been even better if it was fully open source, but having it open like this is still a great resource for developer curious on what goes on behind the scenes to learn from as well.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://github.com/flibitijibibo/RogueLegacy1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the GitHub</a> for the source code.</p>
<p>You can buy the game from:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/rogue_legacy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a></p>

      <title>Intel and AMD join up to form the x86 ecosystem advisory group to shape the future</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems AMD and Intel may be feeling the pressure from Arm? Today both companies announced the forming of a new x86 ecosystem advisory group to help shape the future of the platform.</p>
<p>It's not just them though they've pulled in Linus Torvalds (creator of Linux) and Tim Sweeney (Epic Games), along with companies including: Broadcom, Dell, Google, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, HP Inc., Lenovo, Meta, Microsoft, Oracle, and Red Hat as founding members.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“We are on the cusp of one of the most significant shifts in the x86 architecture and ecosystem in decades – with new levels of customization, compatibility and scalability needed to meet current and future customer needs,” said Pat Gelsinger, Intel CEO. “We proudly stand together with AMD and the founding members of this advisory group, as we ignite the future of compute, and we deeply appreciate the support of so many industry leaders.”</p>
<p>“Establishing the x86 Ecosystem Advisory Group will ensure that the x86 architecture continues evolving as the compute platform of choice for both developers and customers,” said Lisa Su, AMD Chair and CEO. “We are excited to bring the industry together to provide direction on future architectural enhancements and extend the incredible success of x86 for decades to come.”</p>
<p>Their plan is to come together to find new ways to expand the x86 ecosystem with their intended outcomes to be:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Enhancing customer choice and compatibility across hardware and software, while accelerating their ability to benefit from new, cutting-edge features.</li>
<li>Simplifying architectural guidelines to enhance software consistency and standardize interfaces across x86 product offerings from Intel and AMD.</li>
<li>Enabling greater and more efficient integration of new capabilities into operating systems, frameworks and applications.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Valve still waiting on a &#39;generational leap&#39; for Steam Deck 2 - but it&#39;s coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve gave us the strongest wording yet that a Steam Deck 2 is actually real, although it's still clearly going to be some time away before there's enough of an upgrade.</p>
<p>Recently we had the news that the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-deck-officially-comes-to-australia-in-november/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Deck is finally going to release in Australia</a>, and so now Valve have another market opened up for future hardware launches. So, a few Australian websites managed to get Valve to open up a little to discuss the future and it's sounding good.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.reviews.org/au/games/valve-steam-deck-australia-interview/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reviews.org Australia</a> here's what Steam Deck designer Lawrence Yang said about a Steam Deck 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is important to us, and we’ve tried to be really clear, we are not doing the yearly cadence. We’re not going to do a bump every year. There’s no reason to do that. And, honestly, from our perspective, that’s kind of not really fair to your customers to come out with something so soon that’s only incrementally better. So we really do want to wait for a generational leap in compute without sacrificing battery life before we ship the real second generation of Steam Deck. But it is something that we’re excited about and we’re working on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also mentioned in the interview is how they really love seeing all the devices from other companies, even if they're not a fan of the constant device refreshes. There's plenty of other good stuff mentioned in the full interview so be sure to go give it a read.</p>
<p>It's not exactly the freshest news though if you've been following along, since I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/steam-deck-2-is-absolutely-coming-new-booklet-from-valve-confirms/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously covered Valve's little handbook for the Asia launch</a>, that did make it seem pretty clearly like more was planned. Still, Valve reiterating it so <em>strongly</em> is a great sign.</p>
<p>Until then we've still got plenty to look forward to like the final release of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/steamos-36-preview-for-steam-deck-brings-numerous-big-new-features/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.6</a> (it's in Beta) which will bring another big lot of system improvements. And, whatever this <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/valve-appear-to-be-testing-arm64-and-android-support-for-steam-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ARM64 and Android stuff</a> is for (likely a new VR set).</p>

      <title>All three Szymanski brothers are working on a chaotic Harry Potter inspired game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Secret Agent Wizard Boy and the International Crime Syndicate is the latest game from the Szymanski crew who you might know from the likes of DUSK, My Friendly Neighborhood and other games. It's basically a Harry Potter rip-off that's pretty comically good.</p>
<p>I know calling it a rip-off might seem <em>harsh</em>, but — just look at it. I do mean it in the nicest possible way as well. What you get is an overly silly wizarding sandbox game to run around in and cause some ridiculousness either alone or with friends.</p>
<p>Testing it on Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/proton-90-3-released-and-proton-experimental-upgraded-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-3</a>, it does work well. Although you need an extra install step before playing with the Microsoft Visual C++ runtime that pops up.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17583098911728992207gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Running around you can collect wizard biscuits, which are the currency here, that look suspiciously like delicious party rings. This allows you to buy things from the shopkeeper, rather than steal them and have them chase you down with a massive sword.</p>
<p>After a while I lost count of the amount of times I died. You can die in <em>so many stupid ways </em>it's pretty funny. From being bounced around and squashed between things, to stepping on pads and having the walls move and turn you into a pancake there's a lot to find. At one point I used the beginner spell on a random girl standing around, and she came up to me and just insta-slapped the life out of me — ouch.</p>
<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Secret Agent Wizard Boy is going undercover again to topple the international crime syndicate run by Grumblemort. He must use his wits to infiltrate Grumblemort's wizarding school and crack the evil vault deep within the castle. Or, Wizard Boy could choose to ignore his mission entirely and instead use knowledge of spells and espionage to wreck havoc and destruction.</p>
<p>He can also team up with fellow Wizard Boys in cooperative(?) multiplayer to explore (blow up) the castle together.</p>
<p><strong>FEATURES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A multitude of spells to learn and inflict on others.</li>
<li>Physics-based mayhem.</li>
<li>Open-ended goals to accomplish (or ignore) however you see fit.</li>
<li>Online multiplayer.</li>
<li>Retro-themed third person action, straight from the days of Unreal Engine 1.</li>
<li>Landmines.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>It's janky bootleg Harry Potter that looks like it was made for the PS1 with silly physics. Give it a try.</p>

      <title>Tenebris Somnia looks awesome blending live-action cutscenes and retro horror</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Quite a unique one here. Tenebris Somnia was announced from Andrés Borghi, Saibot Studios and publishing help from New Blood Interactive. They even pulled in Airdorf, creator of FAITH: The Unholy Trinity, to serve as Executive Producer on it.</p>
<p>It's a 2D survival horror adventure game like the classics with a feel like Silent Hill and Resident Evil mechanically. However, what really makes this one stand out is the blend of retro pixel-art main visuals for the gameplay, and then it totally flips with live-action cutscenes. It's…strange, but it <em>works</em> and when it jumps into a live-action scene it really does make quite the impact before it flips back to the gameplay.</p>
<p>Testing the demo on Kubuntu Linux, it worked perfectly with the latest <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/proton-90-3-released-and-proton-experimental-upgraded-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton version 9.0-3</a> and I definitely think you're going to want to try it for yourself if you like puzzles and horror. See <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my guide</a> if you don't know how to use Proton.</p>

      <title>Be careful with pachinko roguelike Ballionaire as it might suck away your entire week</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ballionaire from developer newobject and publisher Raw Fury has a demo up for Steam Next Fest, and you're really going to want to keep an eye on that clock when you hit play. It has already become my latest absolute obsession. </p>
<p>Inspired by pachinko machines but it adds in some roguelike flavour, and the result is something that has just completely captured me and I'm going to be playing it all night. Drop a ball down the vertical machine, where you've placed various triggers to try and build up a lot of money. It quickly turns into absolute chaos, with the ball bouncing around everywhere and it's just a thorough delight to play.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12410606501728985610gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12410606501728985610gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Ballionaire on Linux</em></p>
<p>The idea here is that you go across various boards where you have to pay a tribute in money gained from the pachinko machine. Each tribute you manage to hit, will bring you to a new round where the needed tribute is higher, so it can get quite challenging. So it's up to you to build up the board, and hit various insane combinations that might even break the game to absolutely smash the goal and become a Ballionaire.</p>
<p>In a way it feels like a merger between Peglin and Balatro. Check out the announcement trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kJ4CLsPA31g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/062f41e5e0435749d7082e2e4fa8029c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kJ4CLsPA31g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>Fun fact: it's another <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> game.</em></p>
<p>I fully expect this to be a <em>huge</em> hit at release. It's great to play with wonderfully inviting visuals and just so entertaining to see the ball get smashed around while you see your money ticking upwards. Especially nice when you've got a good combination going, and the ball just manically bounces between them all for a while, as you sit back and take a well-earned sip of your favourite drink and just watch it all happen.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2667120/Ballionaire/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and as far as I can tell it works to perfection. No release date just yet, but the publisher made it sound like it was <em>really</em> soon.</p>

      <title>Fractured Alliance gives off some real classic Command &amp; Conquer vibes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you adore your classic base-building real-time strategy games? You may want to keep an eye on the in-development Fractured Alliance. I grew up playing the likes of Command &amp; Conquer, Red Alert, Tiberian Sun and all the rest and so this one feels like it's whispering sweet things directly into my ear.</p>
<p>Looks to be something of a spiritual successor to me both in terms of game mechanics and the style of it. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery as they say, and it pleases me to see more game developers attempt to get more into this genre. Seriously, this looks and sounds like what could have been a lost Westwood game if they kept going. I need it.</p>
<p>Check out their new prototype trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zSf_0-ekIBU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9568b7cd5243f9b34a2e2cb9b80a5430.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zSf_0-ekIBU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Lots of different unit types, nice varied map styles, super weapons, weather effects and more — yep I'm sold.</p>
<p>At release they play to offer a full single-player campaign, along with various types of online battles too.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2583660/Fractured_Alliance/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>. They also have a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/fracturedalliance" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Patreon</a>.</p>

      <title>The props fight back against the humans in Puropu Defense Squad </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PlayTogether Studio who made Run Prop, Run! and the Mad Experiments: Escape Room series have put up a demo and release date for Puropu Defense Squad. A mixture of a shooter and tower defense.</p>
<p>A curiously silly setting too. An alternate universe where Props have come alive. Yes, Props, the things you would disguise yourself as in certain hide and seek games. Now they must "protect their existence against Earth's relentless human invaders". You assume the role of an elite warrior of the Puropu Defense Squad and your mission is clear: build defences to stop enemies from reaching your precious Extractor, the lifeblood of your civilisation.</p>
<p>Check out the latest trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="TTAv8w9G5DE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0644c92af68aa4b8d123d77910ebb395.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/TTAv8w9G5DE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Getting some serious Orcs Must Die vibes from this, seems like a whole lot of chaotic fun. The good news is that it has a demo up now you can play for Steam Next Fest that was expanded with more content, and it will release with Native Linux support on December 9th.</p>
<p>Features (from their press email):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategic Action</strong>: Immerse yourself in a seamless blend of third-person shooting and strategic tower defense. Build a vast arsenal of traps, turrets, and barricades, each upgradeable to fend off waves of enemies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unique Characters</strong>: Choose from a diverse roster of quirky heroes, each offering radically different playstyles. Whether it’s the explosive might of Mr. Box, the tactical genius of Grey, the swift strikes of Tomusashi, the transpercing Ryush, or the blinding lights of Denkyu—every character brings something unique to the battlefield. Customize them by unlocking new talents in each hero's talent tree, and by acquiring a variety of items and XP-based upgrades to tailor your playstyle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Co-op Campaign</strong>: Embark on a challenging campaign solo or with up to 3 friends. Use powerful abilities and clever tactics to defend your Extractor against increasingly difficult waves of enemies. Unlock new items, characters, and content as you complete challenges. Tackle new difficulties in Elite, Heroic, and Infinite modes, where only the most strategic players will survive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Endless Replayability</strong>: After conquering the campaign, dive into infinite modes where waves of enemies become progressively harder. Master elite modes like Heroic and Infinite to prove your worth as a top defender. Compete for the top spot on global leaderboards in both solo and co-op Infinite modes.</p>
</li>
</ul>

      <title>That didn&#39;t last long - the Junk Store for Steam Deck has its Steam page removed (updated)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/first-steam-deck-plugin-on-steam-will-bring-gog-and-epic-games-compatibility/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">A few days ago</a> I wrote about the Junk Store coming to Steam, a special plugin for Steam Deck to bring GOG and Epic Games compatibility unnoficially - but it seems to be a short lived idea.</p>
<p>It is already available as a free and open source plugin for the Decky Loader plugin system, but this was going to be completely standalone, and a paid product for the convenience of just having it right on Steam.</p>
<p>Even though Valve had clearly reviewed the Steam page, and so would have seen what it actually was to even allow the page to go live, it seems Valve <em>may</em> have backtracked on that. It's not clear though if this was done by Valve, or by the developer, the Steam page is just gone. Looking on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3250950/history/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> the note mentions "This app has been retired and is no longer available on the Steam store."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18469908521728978917gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18469908521728978917gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Junk Store</em></p>
<p>Perhaps not really surprising. While Valve do allow a lot of weird stuff on their store, a launcher that has a primary purpose of launching other games from other stores might have been a bridge too far.</p>
<p>I've reached out to both Valve and the Junk Store developers to find out exactly what happened, and will update if I get any reply from either party.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Update - 16/10/2024 - 07:20 UTC</strong>: the Junk Store developers posted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JunkStore/comments/1g4hi6x/its_true/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reddit</a> that it was Valve who took it down. It was taken down not due to the Epic or GOG features, but specifically because it modifies Steam itself.</p>
<p>Here's what Valve support said to them:</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer Part 44: The Legend of Kobo</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-43-demons-and-angels/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Part 43: Demons and Angels</a></strong></p>
<p>A lot of early UNIX and therefore Linux games struggled with the fact that the X toolkit was geared towards constructing staid graphical user interfaces, rather than for the speed and flexibility needed by games. Both <em>100 Great Linux Games</em> as well as the <em>Linux Games &amp; Entertainment for X Windows</em> compilation included many valiant attempts, which while all being admirable in their own way, failed to sustain much in the way of scrutiny. One X11 game that does is <em>Xkobo</em>.</p>
<p>Inspired by Namco’s 1981 arcade title <em>Bosconian</em>, <em>Xkobo</em> was created by the Japanese coder Akira Higuchi and released for a diversity of different UNIX derived systems starting in 1995. The original source code tarball archive of the final 1.11 version from 1997 has build issues when trying to do so on newer versions of Linux, forcing me to use an older compiled binary from 1998 instead included in the xkobo-1.11-1.i386.rpm package to play the game.</p>
<p>For an X11 based game, <em>Xkobo</em> is remarkable in how smooth and fast it is to play. While having the expected limitation of being restricted to a small game window, the art itself is polished and the scrolling seamless. I am often not enamoured by "shmups" in this style, but the puzzle element here of tactically dismantling the enemy fortresses by targeting the coloured nodes helped to keep me engaged, at least until the game descends too close to being bullet hell.</p>
<p>Even then, <em>Xkobo</em> does mercifully allow you to start over from the stage after the one you last cleared when your lives run out. This means you can tackle the game in bursts, as <em>Xkobo</em> would wear out its welcome if it forced you to solve it all in one sitting. There are 50 stages to the game, although I have only cleared 22 of them so far myself. For those without the patience, you can also play through any stage with infinite lives through the use of the "-cheat" launch flag.</p>
<p>There is also a "-doublesize" flag that increases the size of the game window at the cost of using much more memory, but with 512 MB of RAM installed in my machine, I can go ahead and laugh in the face of danger. Even on my overpowered for the time computer however, the game will still slow down if a lot of explosions are drawn on screen at the same time. This can be further mitigated through the use of "-fast" flag, which again consumes more memory in exchange for a faster algorithm.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15983347151728930889gol6.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15983347151728930889gol6.png"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15358656701728930890gol6.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15358656701728930890gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>A modified branch of <em>Xkobo</em> by Kenneth Nielsen also exists which fixes the game to build with the new strong type checking found in later compilers; Nielsen would later merge this with a fork by Wolfgang Jährling which adds some new levels and enemies to the game. This formed the basis of the RPM packages distributed by Dag Wieers for use on later Red Hat Linux and Fedora releases, with most players likely completely unaware there had ever been any changes.</p>
<p>A separate fork of <em>Xkobo</em> by Masanao Izumo was also developed which added sound effects to the game, work which would later be built upon by David Olofson to craft <em>Kobo Deluxe</em> starting in 2001. This reworked <em>Xkobo</em> to use SDL as well as further modernizing the game. I was unable to get any version of <em>Kobo Deluxe</em> past 0.4.1 to compile on Red Hat Linux 7.3, which was when the game engine switched to OpenGL being loaded dynamically, but any version before that works.</p>
<p>Work on <em>Kobo Deluxe</em> continued past 2007, and the game can still be found packaged with many modern Linux distributions, but David Olofson himself has moved on to other projects. One of these was his more experimental <em>Kobo II</em> prototype, which eventually lead to the release of <em>Kobo Redux</em> in 2017. This is still available for purchase from itch.io, although further updates have stalled due to life and health challenges on the part of Olofson.</p>
<p>The more I played these expanded versions of the game though, for all of their bells and whistles, I could not help but feel that sometimes less is more. The original <em>Xkobo</em> is a great example of what can be done when you focus on just the core gameplay loop paired with a consistent set of art assets. It may seem simple when put against the variety of game modes and explosion of effects offered by its inheritors, but there is an elegance here that still shines through after all of these years.</p>
<p>There is a reason why SDL and SVGAlib, and to a lesser extent GGI and Allegro, were embraced by Linux game developers. Magic can come out of people working against imposed limitations however, and games like <em>Xkobo</em> succeed by this. This is not to say that a bit of pizzazz is always unwelcome, especially when you have your own multimedia toolkit to promote and the beer of your sponsor to sell. It is time for us to cut to commercial.</p>

      <title>Steam Next Fest - October 2024 edition is now live with lots of demos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's here! The big Steam Next Fest event returns to suck up all your free time, as tons of game developers hope you'll try out their demos. An event that can easily be overwhelming in sheer numbers, but a whole lot of fun to get a glimpse of what's to come next.</p>
<p>Valve's official trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="T5WV8qqalew"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bc3dadc43df4545d75574aef9b000d0d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/T5WV8qqalew" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As per usual I'll be going over and highlighting games individually over the next week on anything interesting I think that's worth a dedicated shout-out in an article. Something worth noting is that plenty of games that will have an official Native Linux version don't have a Linux demo, and there's a fair few that <em>do</em> have a Linux demo that for some reason don't show it. However, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a> is a thing and will no doubt run most of them. <em>There's also a quite a number of games featured that don't have a demo at all - annoyingly, and some will only go live with the event.</em></p>
<p>Going over the press-preview here's a few that could be worth a look, just a bunch to get you started. Rather than pointing out the big obvious stuff you likely already know about, these could be gems to keep an eye on. Most of these are supposed to have Linux support at release too:</p>

      <title>Streets of Rogue 2 delayed again but a demo is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>My most anticipated game of the year keeps running away from me. Streets of Rogue 2 is no longer entering Early Access on October 22nd, but at least a demo is out now.</p>
<p>Writing in a post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2165810/view/7199658258492782196" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> the developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So first off, why the delays? Well, the TL;DR is “Big Open-Ended Game + Solo Programmer = Unpredictable Timeline.” October 22 seemed like a viable date back in July, but ultimately despite my best efforts, I felt the game needed a bit more time in the oven. My sincere apologies for the delays, I fully understand how annoying it can be to look forward to something only to have the rug pulled. That’s why we won’t be announcing any more specific dates until it’s a 100% lock.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12560066721728918028gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12560066721728918028gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's no specific date being given now but it will be in the "near future", so I imagine still this year.</p>
<p>Good news though — you can play the demo right now on Steam for Steam Next Fest. Although the demo only has a Windows version, I've checked and it works with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/proton-90-3-released-and-proton-experimental-upgraded-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-3</a>. If you don't know how to use <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton see my guide</a>.</p>
<p>With the demo the developer mentioned it's now close to the EA release with a solid foundation, but it needs a lot more polish to "bring the core game loop and progression system to where they need to be, and bugs are still a little too prevalent" so it's still a bit rough.</p>
<p>The addition of vehicles is great! At one point I was driving along taking a shortcut, where thought I could make it over this little pond. Clearly I wasn't paying enough attention, as I drove into a bunch of chickens who shortly after descended on the vehicle and blew it up. Those are some powerful chickens.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1037845281728917090gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1037845281728917090gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13575548471728917092gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13575548471728917092gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I've also been mauled by a bear, I chased someone into a road because I wanted their gun and a car nicely finished them off for me, gave blood for money, raided many trashcans and at one point caused a riot so big it levelled most of the initial starter city — woops.</p>
<p>Even with my short time in it so far, I've already done and seen some truly hilarious things. I really enjoyed the first game, and just wanted more of it in a bigger setting and it seems Streets of Rogue 2 may very well deliver on that.</p>

      <title>Daily Dungeon gives you a fresh dungeon-puzzle every day inspired by Wordle</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Remember when Wordle appeared and the world seemingly went mad for it? How about a dungeon-crawling puzzle game inspired by it? Daily Dungeon is for you.</p>
<p>Created by Vijay Pemmaraju, here's what they said in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vijay.io/post/3l672nt25gn2r" rel="noopener" target="_blank">social media post</a> I spotted recently:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i made a game called <a href="https://dailydungeon.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dailydungeon.net</a> a couple years ago. it's a daily puzzler inspired by wordle that you can play on any device with a browser. check it out and let me know what you think!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea of it is simple and it gives you a fresh dungeon to run about in each day with keys to collect to open doors, puzzles to solve to gain artifacts and beat it in the quickest time possible.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11171399471728913838gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11171399471728913838gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The puzzles in it have a fun mixture from memory games, to rearranging letters to make a correct word and more. You might also find some secrets - maybe. Once you manage to finish a run you're then given a stats screen with the number of steps taken, the time, badges earned and an option to share the details of it like my quick run today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>dailydungeon.net #944 👟 700 ⏱ 06:02 ✨✂️👠🧠</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a really slow time due to taking the screenshot and testing stuff. <em>Don't judge me on it.</em></p>
<p>I just thought it was a great idea and thought you might like it too.</p>

      <title>OBS Studio 31.0.0 Beta 1 released bringing multiple new features</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The best tool for video recording and livestreaming is about to get another upgrade with OBS Studio 31.0.0 Beta 1 out now.It's in Beta meaning it's not quite ready for everyone, but a good time to test everything works as expected ahead of the next stable release.</p>
<p>For this release NVIDIA Kepler GPUs are no longer supported for NVENC, NVIDIA users also need to upgrade at least to driver version 550.54.14.</p>
<p>New features include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added NVIDIA Blur Filter and Background Blur.</li>
<li>Added preview scrollbars and zoom/scale indicator.</li>
<li>Added v210 format support for AJA device capture.</li>
<li>Added Amazon IVS service integration.</li>
<li>Added QSV AV1 Screen Content Coding.</li>
<li>Enabled first-party YouTube Chat features.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5526299951728297353gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5526299951728297353gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - OBS Studio on Linux</em></p>
<p>Some Linux-specific changes too:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Disabled the (currently unsupported) built-in Automatic Scene Switcher when using Wayland on Linux.</li>
<li>Changed display and window capture on Linux to not capture implicitly.</li>
<li>Improved screensaver inhibit functions on Linux in Flatpak</li>
<li>Fixed two crashes with the QSV encoder on Linux.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Support for Ubuntu 22.04 was also removed, so you'll need to upgrade for it.</p>
<p>There's various other bug fixes and improvements like an NVENC upgrade. See the <a href="https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/releases/tag/31.0.0-beta1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a> for more.</p>
<p><em>Notice: This article originally went up last week, a bit too early, the Beta was properly released two days later so it has been republished today.</em></p>

      <title>Mini Royale is a battle royale with toy soldiers and fun game modes - demo available now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're after a new shooter that will have Linux support, Mini Royale looks like it could end up being a good choice.</p>
<p>More about it: "Step into the world of Mini Royale, where the battlefield is a kid’s bedroom and the warriors are green army toy soldiers! This action-packed battle royale pits you against other players in epic combat as you fight to be the last soldier—or team—standing in a chaotic, larger-than-life environment."</p>
<p>Ahead of Steam Next Fest today, the developer has upgraded the demo to bring on a new game mode that sounds like a lot of fun. The mode is called "Color Conquest" where 4 teams of different colours battle to eliminate each other. The fun part: if you die, you join the killer's team. So at some point, someone will make their last stand against everyone else, and potentially do well enough to repopulate their own team.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Qd4kGADVIFY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2ec68f087b53545973d2c2d9d9e09203.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Qd4kGADVIFY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On top of that, there's also a more standard battle royale mode for solos, duos and trios, plus support for custom games. Although of course the demo is limited on what you can do.</p>
<p>Some nice game mechanics in it with various different types of weapons you can customize with attachments, there's weapon levels (a bit like Fortnite) you can upgrade, interesting movement systems with a grapple gun and parachutes to zip across the map and more.</p>
<p>Visually it looks great, and the map design is a lot of fun too. So far in the demo I've managed a few games, and it does seem to perform really well with their Native Linux version.</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1657090/Mini_Royale/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">out on Steam</a> with the demo that will hopefully get populated during Steam Next Fest to try properly. I'm looking forward to properly diving in this evening.</p>

      <title>TUXEDO reveal the Stellaris 16 Gen 6, a more compact desktop-replacement laptop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After showing off the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/the-tuxedo-gemini-17-gen3-is-a-big-powerful-desktop-replacement-class-laptop/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TUXEDO Gemini 17 - Gen3</a> back in September, TUXEDO have now revealed a slightly more compact desktop-replacement laptop with the Stellaris 16.</p>
<p>What they said about it: "At first glance, the new TUXEDO Stellaris 16 - Gen6 may not appear exceptionally "compact" with its overall z-height of just over 2.6 cm and weight of 2.5 kg.</p>
<p>However, a second look with having the Linux high-end laptop's specifications in mind makes it clear: this is the fastest hardware on the planet in an enclosure that strikes the golden mean between portable case dimensions and high cooling capacity for either fastest high-end hardware on par with upper-class desktop PCs or quieter fan noise at very high working and gaming performance."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8686940631728902627gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Moving past the marketing speak for a moment, what are you getting? Full Linux support of course, as standard for TUXEDO systems. The base config on offer comes in at €1660 (excluding tax) and that will give you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Display: 16'' WQXGA IPS | 16:10 | 240 Hz (2560 x 1600), 100% sRGB, G-SYNC.</li>
<li>Processor: Intel Core i9-14900HX.</li>
<li>GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 (up to NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090)</li>
<li>RAM: 16GB DDR5-5600.</li>
<li>Storage: 500GB Samsung 980 SSD.</li>
<li>Wireless: Intel Wi-Fi 6E AX211 (802.11ax | 2.4, 5 &amp; 6 GHz | Bluetooth 5.3)</li>
<li>Power: 99 Wh battery.</li>
<li>For ports you're getting in total: 3x USB-A 3.2 Gen1, USB-C 3.2 Gen1, 2-in-1 audio jack (headphone &amp; microphone), Card reader (SD/SDHC/SDXC), HDMI 2.1, Gigabit ethernet, DC-in, Thunderbolt 4 / USB-C 4.</li>
</ul>
<p>So while it is indeed pricey, that's a ridiculous amount of power in a still pretty small case overall. You could do some serious gaming on that.</p>
<p>See more on <a href="https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en/TUXEDO-Stellaris-16-Gen6" rel="noopener" target="_blank">their website</a>. They said the shipping starts mid-November.</p>
<p>I'm curious to know if there's any TUXEDO computers customers reading GamingOnLinux, be sure to give over your experiences in the comments. </p>

      <title>Slimbook reveal the new powerful AMD powered EVO ultrabook</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Slimbook have announced a fresh powerful AMD Ryzen powered ultrabook, the EVO, and it looks like a wonderful device. If you're after a new laptop from a company with top Linux support, this should be on your radar.</p>
<p>Coming in a €999 with the €100 discount for pre-orders, it's due to arrive in December. So what do you get for that price? Quite a lot actually and they expect it to end up as the "best-selling computer in our history".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9684717121728900571gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Main specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 8845HS 8 cores 16 threads, up to 5.1GHz.</li>
<li>Graphics: AMD Radeon 780M.</li>
<li>Display: 14” WQXGA 3K (2880x1800) 16:10 sRGB 100% sRGB refresh 125 Hz 400 nits.</li>
<li>Ports: 2x USB-C 3.2 Gen2 + DP 1.4 + PD 100W.</li>
<li>Ports: 1x USB-A 3.2 Gen2 + 2x USB-A 3.2 Gen1.</li>
<li>Keyboard: backlit.</li>
<li>Material: aluminum.</li>
<li>Connectivity: Wifi 6E, Bluetooth 5.2.</li>
<li>RAM memory: up to 96GB at 5600 MHz DDR5 (16GB DDR5 on base model).</li>
<li>Disks: 2x SSD NVMe PCIe 4.0 M.2 up to 8TB (500GB NVMe on base model).</li>
</ul>
<p>This unit is a replacement for their previous flagship model, the ProX, and it comes with many other improvements. Fans of security and privacy will be pleased to know it has a physical webcam lock, there's now a Gigbit ethernet port, a SD / SDHC / SDXC card reader, Nahimic 2412 speakers they say "provide less muffled sound and less distortion during over-amplification compared to their predecessors" and dual high-performance fans that are "designed for gaming laptops but optimized for quiet operation in a slim profile".</p>
<p>You can order it with your choice of Linux including Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Ubuntu MATE, KDE neon, Debian, Linux Mint, Fedora, Manjaro and more. Windows is also an option but bumps up the price by at least €170.</p>
<p>Overall it really does sound great.</p>

      <title>Minetest breaks the chains of being a Minecraft clone with a new name — Luanti</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Minetest, a voxel game engine created to be something like a Minecraft clone, is finally smashing apart the chains to become more its own unique thing.</p>
<p>Announced in a <a href="https://blog.minetest.net/2024/10/13/Introducing-Our-New-Name/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a> the team explained why it was originally created and how it's grown with a huge community. Minetest itself of course, is just a voxel game engine, a platform for various games. And so with that in mind, it needed its own identity to finally throw off the "Minecraft clone" comments and so the era of Minetest is now over with the introduction of <strong>Luanti</strong>.</p>
<p>The name is a play on the Finnish word luonti (“creation”) and the programming language used for games and mods, Lua. Combined together, that's Luanti. They're still in the process of getting all bits of it renamed, so it may take a while.</p>
<p>Seems quite a fitting name and I like the idea behind it, although it's not particularly memorable, but then again for most people it will be the <em>games</em> made with it that create the memories. If you missed it we also had MineClone2, a game for <s>Minetest</s> <em>Luanti</em>, recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/mineclone2-inspired-by-minecraft-gets-renamed-to-voxelibre/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">change its name to VoxeLibre</a> as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7592450361728899419gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7592450361728899419gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Theme Hospital originally from Bullfrog Productions is a true classic, one I spent a ridiculous amount of time playing and the CorsixTH project is doing fantastic work to keep it alive for modern platforms. A new release of this open source reimplementation has been released with version 0.68.0 now available.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6948188941728896112gol1.jpg"/><br/>

</ul>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>You need the data files from the original game which you can buy on <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/theme_hospital?as=1636858786" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG.com</a>.</p>
<p>For Linux you can grab the CorsixTH engine from <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/com.corsixth.corsixth" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.</p>
<p>Getting it working was ridiculously easy too. I installed the classic from GOG using the Heroic Launcher, pointed CorsixTH to the folder and it just worked. Nice. </p>

      <title>SteamOS 3.6.18 Beta released, still not quite the true end of the line</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>When will it end? Will SteamOS 3.6 ever become stable? The end of the line has come, and gone, a few times now.</p>
<p>You thought <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-beta-gets-big-game-recording-improvements-plus-steam-deck-steamos-3616-beta-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.6.16</a> "End of the Line" was going to be it? Wrong. You also thought <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-deck-steamos-3617-beta-released-with-another-quick-fix/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.6.17</a> "End of the End of the Line" would be the one — also quite clearly wrong. Now we're onto <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4511009460896477896" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.6.18 Beta</a> "The Color at the End of the End of the Line".</p>
<p>Could this actually be the one to push SteamOS 3.6 over the finishing line into a stable release? Only the code magicians at Valve will know the answer to that.</p>
<p>From the release notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: This update is for the Steam Deck Beta and Preview channels, and includes new features that are still being tested. You can opt into this in Settings &gt; System &gt; System Update Channel.</p>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a possible crash when using Steam Deck as the Remote Play host</li>
<li>Fixed colorspace for Game Recording</li>
<li>Improved color range when using Remote Play to Steam Deck</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam purchases now clearly state you&#39;re just getting a license not ownership</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Doing the rounds across the net right now is a small update to the Steam checkout process when you're making a purchase, to make it clear you don't own what you buy.</p>
<p>Valve added a note (I don't entirely know when), to mention how "A purchase of a digital product grants a license for the product on Steam" with a link to the Steam Subscriber Agreement. As you can see in my shot below taken today when testing a purchase:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9233828001728818534gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9233828001728818534gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Of course, there's already a lot of misinformation going around about this from people on social media. To remind everyone: this has <em>always</em> been the case. The Steam Subscriber Agreement says (if you bothered to read it, you all read agreements right?) "The Content and Services are licensed, not sold. Your license confers no title or ownership in the Content and Services".</p>
<p>So while this has always been the case, it is still somewhat buried because most people just quickly scroll through these things to get access to what they want. At least now, Valve has put it upfront every time you make a license purchase on Steam.</p>
<p>Why is all this happening now? You can likely thank a new California law on this (<a href="https://digitaldemocracy.calmatters.org/bills/ca_202320240ab2426" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AB 2426</a>) that is summarised as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Existing law makes it unlawful for any person doing business in California and advertising to consumers in California to make any false or misleading advertising claim. Existing law makes a person who violates specified false advertising provisions liable for a civil penalty, as specified, and provides that a person who violates those false advertising provisions is guilty of a misdemeanor.</p>
<p>This bill would, subject to specified exceptions, additionally prohibit a seller of a digital good from advertising or offering for sale a digital good, as defined, to a purchaser with the terms buy, purchase, or any other term which a reasonable person would understand to confer an unrestricted ownership interest in the digital good, or alongside an option for a time-limited rental, unless the seller receives at the time of each transaction an affirmative acknowledgment from the purchaser, or the seller provides to the consumer before executing each transaction a clear and conspicuous statement, as specified. By expanding the scope of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>GOG took the opportunity to jump into this as well on Twitter / X with a <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1844752098145038435" rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> suggesting they will be adding a note onto their checkout process too, to say that their offline installers they offer cannot be taken away from you:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8988360621728818791gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8988360621728818791gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The new law <em>doesn't</em> seem to actually affect GOG, since in the main bill text it does specifically note it does not apply if they have access to a permanent offline download. However, it should be noted GOG also sell you a <em>license</em> as per their own terms. So while the new bill may not apply to them, this little jibe only really properly works <em>if</em> people are backing up all of their GOG purchases. Since you only get a license, rights holders <em>could</em> still technically get GOG to entirely remove them.</p>
<p>I should also note that this situation is the same for most physical media too, it's not a digital distribution only issue for consumers. Much like GOG's offline installers, you have access to your physical media whenever you want, but you still only get a license for the media you have on disc - you do <em>not</em> own it.</p>

      <title>NonSteamLaunchers gets booted from Steam Deck plugin store Decky Loader</title>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's a bit of unfortunate drama going on right now in Steam Deck land, with the Steam Deck plugin NonSteamLaunchers for Decky Loader getting the boot. Both projects I've covered a fair bit (see plenty in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/Steam_Deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our Steam Deck tag</a>), and they're quite popular, so this is a bit of a PSA on what's happened.</p>
<p>If you've not heard of or not used the <a href="https://github.com/moraroy/NonSteamLaunchers-On-Steam-Deck" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NonSteamLaunchers</a> project: it's a way to pretty darn easily install the likes of Amazon Games, GOG Galaxy, Epic Games and various other launchers with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a>. It can be used standalone on desktop, or as a <a href="https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Decky Loader</a> plugin.</p>
<p>A few days ago, Roy, the developer of NonSteamLaunchers reached out directly to notify me that NonSteamLaunchers was delisted from the Decky Loader plugin store. Something that will end up causing issues for users of it.</p>
<p>Trying to find out what happened is a bit difficult, since the situation really isn't very clear. Speaking to the Steam Deck Homebrew team behind Decky Loader, they provided me this statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steam Deck Homebrew has decided to remove the NonSteamLaunchers plugin from the Decky Plugin Store after being shown statements on Steam Deck-related subreddits from its creator in a report. These appear to show continued harassment of members of these communities. We have also discovered harassment from the creator in our own server. We decided to delist the plugin from our store alongside banning its creator to prevent potential abuse of our community and plugin store.</p>
<p>Decky plugins can be downloaded outside the Decky Plugin Store, but we have decided to separate ourselves from NonSteamLaunchers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking to Roy as well, they offered this statement of their own to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don't believe I said anything racist or wrong to anyone regarding race or color or bigotry of any type or orientation of any kind. I will continue holding this stance and will not move from it. I still don't really know what I did wrong for my plug-in to be taken away so fast but I just want to apologize to the steam deck community for causing any sort of drama and for failing them as a developer. Unfortunately I don't know what has transpired but I am obviously not wanted in their environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully a resolution will be found for the benefit of the Steam Deck community for these popular tools. For now, NonSteamLaunchers fans will need to grab the tool directly.</p>

      <title>Comedy 2.5D puzzle-platformer Ari Buktu and the Anytime Elevator gets a demo and new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A single-player comedy adventure 2.5D platformer developer by a former Disney ride designer, Ari Buktu and the Anytime Elevator looks and sounds great.</p>
<p>Coming from Adventure Works, a small production studio lead by Jeffrey Ashbrook, a former Disney parks designer and a producer on the Millennium Falcon ride at Disney’s Hollywood Studios. What we've seen of it looks incredibly promising and I'm personally looking forward to seeing more from this one. The game will have Native Linux support too.</p>
<p>They just released a brand new demo ahead of Steam Next Fest, and to go along with it there's new trailer too:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mh6Fo0WNths"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/baa002950d9e6e34d20011a75560d24f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mh6Fo0WNths" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On the origins of the game, Jeffrey Ashbrook, founder at Adventure Works, said "I always wanted to create a game inspired by those cinematic story-driven adventures I loved growing up. I was such a big fan of ‘80s adventure films like Indiana Jones and The Goonies, and large-scale games like the Uncharted and Metal Gear Solid series, those seamless blends of cinematics and gameplay to create a memorable experience for players. Even with only a handful of devs from around the world , we wanted Ari to be that same kind of experience you used to get from much larger teams: full 3D cutscenes, ensemble casts of characters, and a story that you could really sink into if you wanted, so we’ve set our sights high and really hope people enjoy what we’ve been creating."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thrilling cinematic adventure:</strong> Embark on a rip-roaring, feel-good journey inspired by classic blockbuster adventure films.</li>
<li><strong>Eccentric ensemble cast:</strong> Interact with an eccentric and loveable cast including 11 fully voice-acted characters.</li>
<li><strong>Nostalgic puzzle platforming</strong><strong>: </strong>Journey through 13 levels and 6 distinct environments - from freezing tundras to scorching deserts.</li>
<li><strong>Stunning in-game cutscenes:</strong> Feast your eyes on stunning in-game cinematics from the mind of a former Disney producer.</li>
<li><strong>Unique tools and abilities:</strong> Unlock a repertoire of quirky tools to solve mysteries, utilize environmental elements, and tackle treacherous terrain.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Go <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2184020/Ari_Buktu_and_the_Anytime_Elevator/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check it out on Steam now</a>. There's no set date for the release yet but the demo is live now.</p>

      <title>ZEPHON from the devs of Warhammer 40,000: Gladius releases November 8</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Proxy Studios, developer of the popular Warhammer 40,000: Gladius, have announced their next 4x strategy game ZEPHON will release on November 8th. ZEPHON will have Native Linux support. <em>Disclosure: the developer sent me a pre-release key.</em></p>
<p>If you think it looks like Gladius, you would be right, since both are evolutions over Proxy Studios first game Pandora: First Contact from 2013. Here you control the survivors of humanity in a near-future apocalypse of alien origin. Pick a path between the indifferent abominations of the Voice and the uncaring automata of ZEPHON, with city management, turn-based tactical combat, unholy research, diplomatic maneuvering, and branching narrative quests. Gather your allies and pick your actions wisely.</p>
<p>Check out their previous gameplay trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DPD4MiGc2g0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bc1ac8fea864939ac2780eeb0ece3d63.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DPD4MiGc2g0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking over email the developer said to me: "Our previous game, Gladius, has been played by over 1.5 million players. Zephon now has in excess of 500 k views on YouTube (including 100 k on the IGN gameplay trailer) and more than 100 k wishlists on Steam a month before release.</p>
<p>In Zephon we did some fun stuff to tackle the "endgame problem" in 4X games, leaned heavily into Souls-like world-building and added narrative design elements to reward players who play multiple sessions (inspired by Hades and co.)."</p>
<p>You can wishlist and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1481170/ZEPHON/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Aspyr announce Star Wars: Episode I: Jedi Power Battles coming to PC in 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Star Wars: Episode I: Jedi Power Battles is another remaster coming from Aspyr Media, bringing over the originally console-exclusive game to PC. <em>The force appears to be strong with Aspyr.</em></p>
<p>Originally released back in the year 2000 for PlayStation, it was then released for Dreamcast and later the Game Boy Advance. Hopefully this latest Star Wars game from Aspyr will have a good release, after the mess that was the STAR WARS: Battlefront Classic Collection but since then they seem to be doing really well with their other releases getting great reviews. I'm just happy to see more classics come to PC, so we can then play on Linux and Steam Deck thanks to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a>.</p>

      <title>Internet Archive hit with DDoS attacks and hacked with 31 million accounts hit</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A sad day for the internet, as it has been confirmed that the Internet Archive (https://archive.org/) that hosts a massive amount of historical data has been hit by DDoS attacks, and unfortunately they've had a breach.</p>
<p>Recently instead of seeing the website as usual, users were greeted with message like this (<a href="https://x.com/jwdomb/status/1844123760720548040" rel="noopener" target="_blank">credit</a>):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5468299481728640690gol1.png"/></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever felt like the Internet Archive runs on sticks and is constantly on the verge of suffering a catastrophic security breach? It just happened. See 31 million of you on HIBP!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>HIBP is in reference to the popular <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">HaveIBeenPwned</a> website, that lists various data breaches and now <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites#InternetArchive" rel="noopener" target="_blank">includes</a> this latest breach in their database. Troy Hunt, founder of HIBP, <a href="https://x.com/troyhunt/status/1844136762727448644" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed</a> in a thread on Twitter / X that it is legitimate and they had been communicating with the Internet Archive about it,</p>
<p>The breach was also <a href="https://x.com/brewster_kahle/status/1844183111514603812" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed</a> by Brewster Kahle, founder of the Internet Archive, who said this on Twitter / X:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What we know: DDOS attack–fended off for now; defacement of our website via JS library; breach of usernames/email/salted-encrypted passwords.</p>
<p>What we’ve done: Disabled the JS library, scrubbing systems, upgrading security.</p>
<p>Will share more as we know it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It did briefly come back up, but was hit by another DDoS. As a result, the Internet Archive has been taken offline while their admins deal with the situation.</p>
<p>An account on Twitter / X called "Sn_darkmeta" claimed responsibility for it.</p>
<p><em>Just another reminder that you should never share passwords between websites.</em></p>

      <title>Ubuntu 24.10, Kubuntu 24.10 and other Linux flavours now officially released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The day is here. Canonical have announced the release of Ubuntu 24.10 (Oracular Oriole), along with various flavours like Kubuntu 24.10 now being available. <em>This is not an LTS (long term support) release, but an interim release towards the next LTS.</em></p>
<p>Some of the big changes include the latest 6.11 kernel, along with Canonical's shift to "a more aggressive kernel version selection policy going forward", automatic kernel crash dumps, GNOME 47 with its various new additions to the desktop and also Wayland by default for NVIDIA.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/376433451728639494gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/376433451728639494gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Ubuntu 24.10 (Oracular Oriole)</em></p>
<p>You'll also find various Raspberry Pi support improvements, various improvements to the Snap packages like the new security center, additional stability and performance patches added to GNOME, Firefox 130, LibreOffice 24.8, Thunderbird 128, Pipewire 1.2.4 and the list of updates goes on and on.</p>
<p>See more in the <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-24-10-oracular-oriole-released/48652/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release announcement</a>.</p>
<p>Of course there's all the extra flavours too like my favourite Kubuntu 24.10 which comes with KDE Plasma 6.1 that also has Wayland by default now too.</p>

      <title>Gaming on Linux with Apple Silicon now becoming a very real thing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Alyssa Rosenzweig has given an update in a blog post and a presentation at XDC 2024 going over work to improve Linux gaming on the Apple M1/M2 with Asahi Linux.</p>
<p>They announced their "Asahi game playing toolkit" which brings together their Vulkan 1.3 graphics driver, and x86 emulation with Windows game compatibility (using <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> amongst other things). It's all still "Alpha" level quality, but good enough to run some AAA games now. Unlike Apple's own macOS, Asahi Linux has the <em>only</em> conformant OpenGL®, OpenCL™, and Vulkan® drivers for this hardware (as Apple focus on their own API - Metal).</p>
<p>All you have to do is install the Fedora Asahi Remix on your Apple system, get the latest driver updates and then install Steam although they said "most games require 16GB of memory due to emulation overhead".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16335559671728637336gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16335559671728637336gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Fallout 4 on Apple Hardware with Fedora Asahi Remix</em></p>
<p>Incredible work to make more hardware not only able to run Linux nicely, but become actual proper gaming machines too. Sounds like it's been a thoroughly complicated process, with many contributors but the end result looks great for users.</p>
<p>More work is to be done yet on the Honeykrisp driver, like "Sparse texturing" up next which they said will "unlock more DX12 games" but it's already good enough for titles like Fallout 4, Hollow Knight and Cyberpunk 2077.</p>
<p>More in their <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/aaa-gaming-on-m1.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a>, and you can see their talk during XDC 2024 - Day 2 in the below video with the talk starting at about 20:46 (they do eventually start speaking English):</p>

      <title>First Steam Deck plugin on Steam will bring GOG and Epic Games compatibility</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><em><strong>Update: It looks like Valve have changed their position on this. See this <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/that-didnt-last-long-the-junk-store-for-steam-deck-has-its-steam-page-removed/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">updated article</a>.</strong></em></p>
<p>Original Article:</p>
<p>In a really surprising move the developers behind Decky Loader plugin <em>Junk Store</em>, which provides the ability to install games from GOG and Epic Games, are bringing the plugin to Steam officially.</p>
<p>This is a special new release just for the Steam Deck, and <em>seems</em> to indicate that Valve are open to having Steam Deck plugins available directly like this. Especially nice for all the people claiming free games (or buying) from the Epic Games Store and GOG.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20667548891728635222gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20667548891728635222gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It will <em>not</em> be free and open source like the Decky Loader plugin though, as confirmed in a Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JunkStore/comments/1g0qygm/junk_store_is_officially_coming_to_the_steam_store/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a>, due to the work involved in re-writing it for a Steam release. A price has not been decided on it yet as they gauge interest. However, the existing plugin will remain. The developers said they plan to keep expanding it and hopefully add support for more stores too.</p>
<p>That is, <strong>if</strong> Valve <em>do</em> actually give it the true nod of approval once the Junk Store developers are ready to put it live. Valve has at least approved the Steam store page, so it it has at least passed the initial stage but it could still end up catching more attention and end up not being approved - this will be quite a test for Valve too. Just how open is Steam really on what it will allow?</p>
<p>Main features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Engineered specifically for Game Mode. Once installed you can download and launch games without needing to go into Desktop Mode.</li>
<li>Junk Store utilises the Steam-native interface for managing games, allowing Steam to handle most of the process.</li>
<li>Junk Store leverages Steam's built-in functionality to manage Proton prefixes.</li>
<li>You can use the QAM to adjust per game Proton settings such as FPS limiting, etc.</li>
<li>It is extensible! You can write whatever you want for Junk Store integrations if you have the skill. You don't need to wait on anyone else to add features or store front integrations.</li>
<li>Currently we have integrated support for Epic and Gog Games that ships with Junk Store.</li>
<li>Epic achievements and EOS overlay are functional for games that support this feature (however, there is no playtime tracking).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Compatibility with other stores is a common complaint with the Steam Deck. You are able to go into Desktop Mode and install whatever you want, but the convenience of having something directly on Steam will be nice.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3250950/Junk_Store/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wishlist it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck officially comes to Australia in November</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Our friends down under will finally be able to buy an officially supported Steam Deck, as it heads to Australia officially in November. It's been a long road to get there, but it's finally happening which opens up Australia to other Valve hardware now too.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck LCD was originally <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/steam-deck-initial-review/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">released back in February 2022</a> and was later expanded with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/steam-deck-hits-japan-hong-kong-south-korea-and-taiwan-on-december-17th/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Komodo partnership</a> to also be sold in Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan. Much <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/valve-reveals-steam-deck-oled-for-november-16th/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">later in November 2023</a>, Valve then revealed the much better Steam Deck OLED.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the press email the prices will be (inclusive of GST):</p>
<ul>
<li>256GB LCD: $649.00 AUD</li>
<li>512GB OLED: $899.00 AUD</li>
<li>1TB OLED: $1049.00 AUD</li>
</ul>
<p>Not bad pricing, and with the OLED truly being a much better device you really should grab that model if you can afford it. It's truly <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/steam-deck-oled-is-just-pure-joy-the-definitive-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the definitive Steam Deck</a>.</p>
<p>It's only going to get better too with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/steamos-36-preview-for-steam-deck-brings-numerous-big-new-features/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">upcoming release of SteamOS 3.6</a>.</p>
<p>Once Valve are eventually ready to talk more about a potential Steam Deck 2, this should also hopefully mean Australia won't be left out in the cold on release day. Although, it's also another signal that the current Steam Deck model is here to stay for some time yet.</p>

      <title>Think you&#39;ve seen it all? There&#39;s now a Steam game about squeezing eggs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You've cooked a lot of them in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/arctic-eggs-is-thoroughly-weird-physics-based-dystopian-cooking-game/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Arctic Eggs</a> (which is really good) but have you ever just stopped for a moment to squeeze some eggs? No? Maybe you should. Released on Steam on October 1st it's now <img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Steam Deck Verified and works with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/proton-90-3-released-and-proton-experimental-upgraded-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-3</a> perfectly on Kubuntu Linux desktop.</p>
<p>So what is it? Egg Squeeze is a "biological intuition test where you squeeze eggs for as long as you can without breaking them". No, I have no idea what's going on here either. I had to test it of course, for science, and to see if I could beat the test. Or maybe the test will beat me, or whisk me, or fry me — or whatever else you do with eggs.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18430649521728473464gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18430649521728473464gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>While you're squeezing that egg tightly, trying not to smash it inside your palm, some funky music starts playing. The longer you manage to hold down the button to squeeze before it cracks, the better your score. I'm still trying to figure out how to tell when it's about to break and it's scrambled my brain. I'm not entirely sure what exactly it is that I'm doing. It's all about testing your synergy with the eggs apparently, but how does that work? I need an answer.</p>
<p>Get multiple in a row that you managed to keep intact, and you'll build up streak, crack it open and you'll lose points. The more I played, the more confused I became, and thoroughly frustrated at the amount of eggs I had smashed open. I've touched and smooshed more eggs in this game that I have in my entire real life.</p>
<p>When you manage to hit the needed score, it's time to start a new day and…things get weird — really weird. Seems the days get progressively more difficult too, with the second day adding in an insanity bar and if you crack too many eggs it's game over, and the score you need to hit is much higher too.</p>
<p>Trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Lx7M7H_2iWA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e9b31be0b1adc8c8a06d524b7ba2da44.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Lx7M7H_2iWA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Surprisingly tense for such a simple game too. When you're one crushed egg away from losing and you're counting in your head to a specific number and then (much like the egg) your dreams about passing the test get demolished as you let out a loud expletive <em>F—</em> with a sigh.</p>
<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have been chosen as a volunteer for the "Egg Squeeze" exam - a test that evaluates one's <em>psychokinetic intuition of biological makeup</em>. In each test, you will be asked to squeeze an egg for a short period of time. The objective is to estimate the egg's unique breaking point and release your grasp <strong>Before it cracks</strong>. You will be graded relative to your synergy with the eggs.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>May the eggs be ever in your favor.</strong></p>
<p>Features</p>
<ul>
<li>Short core game (1-3 hours)</li>
<li>"Infinite Squeeze" mode, for unlimited replayability</li>
<li>50+ track score, composed by indie game veterans</li>
<li>Plenty of secrets waiting to be found...</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3229170/Egg_Squeeze/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Explore a top-secret uranium mine in retro-FPS Kvark</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kvark is a new release from developer Latest Past and publisher Perun Creative, set in a fictional version of the 80s Czech Republic where you explore a top-secret uranium mine. <em>Note: my key was provided by PR Outreach.</em></p>
<p>The 1.0 release is out now, which comes with a Native Linux version after a year in Early Access. What is it? A retro-inspired FPS that pays homage to such games as Half-Life and BioShock. You can definitely tell, as it wears the inspiration on its sleeve. If you love retro inspired shooters, you're in for a bit of a treat on this one.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nBmUjnIvO4I"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9627d46639b4f5bff8839207fd19ecb2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nBmUjnIvO4I" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fast-paced fights with a plethora of weapons, from wrenches to grenades, bazookas, and the iconic EK-48.</li>
<li>Uniquely designed, diverse, and challenging enemies that require swift tactics and weapon swapping, quick thinking, and constant movement.</li>
<li>An intriguing story told through hidden notepads that the player must find to reveal.</li>
<li>Search for suspicious substances that may help you with your efforts.</li>
<li>Simple to intricate puzzles that the player will have to solve to progress.</li>
<li>Detailed, interactive levels that reward players willing to explore with hidden Easter eggs, secrets, and achievements.</li>
<li>Stylized retro graphics that bring old-school gaming nostalgia.</li>
<li>A strong “just-one-more-level” vibe and loads of explosive fun!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">With the Native Linux version that was tested, two prominent bugs were found in the 1.0 release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Videos don't play and instead you get a white screen (the developer is aware).</li>
<li>In my case when pressing ESC to go to the menu, I was unable to exit the menu again unless I loaded the last save. That's quite game-breaking as you'll lose progress.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on those issues, I would recommend just playing it with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a> where those issues don't exist after testing with Proton 9.0-3. However, with Proton the Unreal Engine it uses brings up an additional step to install some bits it needs so you'll have to wait a minute or two for it to appear.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2319390/Kvark/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Kind Words 2 (lofi city pop) is a sweet game about writing letters to real people</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Expanding greatly from the original, Kind Words 2 (lofi city pop) from Popcannibal is out now with Linux support. <em>Note: the developer sent me a key.</em></p>
<p>Sometimes, all you need are a few kind words to set your day off right or to cheer you up from a bad week. That's pretty much what Kind Words 2 is all about. You write and receive completely anonymous letters, all real people that are also playing it. The sequel is a far bit more than that though with you able to go out and explore a little, giving you more opportunities for letter writing. It includes everything from the original game (the letters are backwards compatible), remastered and available inside this one too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-Qzjz4wVfR0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bc8bbb9067d2fa00b14585a919f25148.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-Qzjz4wVfR0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In this one there's also shops you can visit to change your look, write and share poems or listen to others, visit the forest to write chain-letters and more. It's just thoroughly sweet.</p>
<p>Calling it a game is perhaps doing it dirty, it's not a game in the sense that you <em>play</em> it, it acts more like an anonymous social network with a specific laser-focus of just being nice to everyone and getting some advice, or getting some handy tips and suggestions.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2118120/Kind_Words_2_lofi_city_pop/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>FEX-Emu version 2410 out bringing some important fixes for gaming on AArch64</title>
      <author>nwildner</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://fex-emu.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FEX-Emu</a> is an emulation layer that allows you to run x86 and x86-64 binaries (like games and apps) on an AArch64 Linux host, similar to qemu-user and box86/box64. Instead of using full disk images, FEX-Emu uses rootfs overlay + forwarding GL processing to the host to achieve better performance in emulated software.</p>
<p>Version 2410 was <a href="https://fex-emu.com/FEX-2410/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">released this week</a> and the changelog is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ARM64EC changes:</strong> Fixed AVX bugs around state saving and restoring when running under Wine, and changes to dynamically determine Windows syscall numbers under WINE instead of hardcoding them. The call checker was also revamped fixing issues when applications hook function early using Wind32 APIs.</li>
<li><strong>JIT Optimizations</strong>: More optimized JIT code which result in 9% less CPU being spent in JIT'ing code. This is important because, the less time cpu is spent in JIT the less "choppy" the software being emulated will be.</li>
<li><strong>JIT fixes: </strong>Fixed bugs on the x87 instruction set that was offering a bugged <code class="inline-code">FPREM</code> instruction (although <code class="inline-code">FPREM1</code> was working and its also part of <code class="inline-code">x87</code>). One of the weird issues this caused was that Steam login was super weird and you had to repeat login multiple times to work. This also fixed bugs on <em>Touhou Luna Nights</em> and <em>Halls of Torment</em> games. <code class="inline-code">SSE MAXSS</code> instruction was also fixed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The detailed changelog of changes can be found at the <a href="https://github.com/FEX-Emu/FEX/compare/FEX-2409...FEX-2410" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FEX-Emu Github</a>.</p>
<p>If you missed it there's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/valve-appear-to-be-testing-arm64-and-android-support-for-steam-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">been some leaks</a> that Valve may be preparing to use tools like FEX to get gaming working on ARM. So it's a project worth following to see the progress.</p>

      <title>Descent 3: Piccu Engine is a new open source build focused on quality-of-life improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Thanks to Descent 3 being <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/descent-3-has-been-made-open-source/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">officially open source</a>, developers can do almost anything with it now and this has given rise to the <a href="https://github.com/InsanityBringer/PiccuEngine" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Descent 3: Piccu Engine</a>.</p>
<p>Forked from the open source Descent 3 game engine the Descent 3: Piccu Engine, it includes "almost every change from <a href="https://github.com/InsanityBringer/InjectD3" rel="noopener" target="_blank">InjectD3</a>, among many more". You might think, well why not submit to the original open source project? But this is the benefit of open source isn't it! People can do whatever changes they want.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1397537761728463053gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Descent 3 from Steam</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">This includes enhancements like:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Centered window mode.</li>
<li>Scaling in window and fullscreen mode.</li>
<li>Fullscreen which does not change desktop settings (multi adapter support forthcoming).</li>
<li>New mouse code.</li>
<li>Adjustable FOV, with automatic expansion for widescreen.</li>
<li>Missing features in OpenGL restored, including specular highlights and the ability to control mipmapping.</li>
<li>Cockpit actually works in widescreen, unlike InjectD3.</li>
<li>Faster iteration when many missions are present.</li>
<li>Smoother UI (FPS limit raised to 60).</li>
<li>OpenAL sound system with no crackling and environment reverb support.</li>
<li>Many bugfixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently though according to the GitHub page this version of the code is only set up for Windows, but the developer hopes "to change this shortly".</p>
<p>You do need a copy of the game to run it which you can get from <a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/descent_3_expansion?as=1636858786" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/273590/Descent_3/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>SDL 3.1.3 Stable ABI Preview released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One missed in the inbox of no return from last week. The next-generation SDL 3 is closing in on a proper stable release now with the SDL 3.1.3 Stable ABI Preview now available for game developers.</p>
<p>Despite the version number, it's still pre-release and not officially released just yet. What is SDL used for? It's a cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware on many different platforms like Linux, macOS, Windows, iOS and Android.</p>
<p>In the release <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> developer Sam Lantinga (Valve) said: "We have lots of bugs to fix before the 3.2.0 stable release, but SDL 3.0 has been battle tested by millions of people in DOTA, CS2 and Steam, and is ready for your eyes!". Additionally developer Ryan Gordon <a href="https://x.com/icculus/status/1842311794817442015" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mentioned</a> on Twitter / X: "I can't believe I finally get to say this. SDL3 is officially ABI locked! We will _add_ new things but not _change_ or _remove_ what's there, starting right now. Which means it's safe to start migrating your games to it, starting today!"</p>
<p>Some of what's new includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/APIByCategory" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Extremely good documentation</a>: We've spent a ton of effort writing and revising the API reference.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/tree/main/examples" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Example programs</a> to get you started, <a href="https://examples.libsdl.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">running in your web browser</a>!</li>
<li>More consistent API naming conventions. Everything is named consistently across the API now, instead of different subsystems taking different approaches. Also, we've tended toward more descriptive names for things in SDL3.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryGPU" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GPU API</a>: access to modern 3D rendering and GPU compute in a cross-platform way.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryDialog" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dialog API</a>: access to system file dialogs (file and folder selection UI for opening/saving).</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryFilesystem" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Filesystem API</a>: simple directory management and globbing, access to topic-specific user folders.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryStorage" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Storage API</a>: Abstract interface to platform-specific storage.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryCamera" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Camera API</a>: access to webcams.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/README/main-functions#main-callbacks-in-sdl3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Main Callbacks</a>: optionally run your program from callbacks instead of main().</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryPen" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pen API</a>: access to pens (like Wacom tablets and Apple Pencil, etc).</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_OpenAudioDevice" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Logical audio devices</a>: different parts of an app can get their own unique audio device to use.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_CreateAudioStream" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Audio streams</a>: handle buffering, converting, resampling, mixing, channel mapping, pitch, and gain. Bind to an audio device and go!</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_PLAYBACK" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Default audio devices</a>: SDL3 will automatically manage migrating to new physical hardware as devices are plugged in, ripped out, or changed.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryProperties" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Properties API</a>: fast, flexible dictionaries of name/value pairs.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryProcess" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Process API</a>: Spawn child processes and communicate with them in various ways.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_Colorspace" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Colorspace support</a>: Surfaces and the renderer, etc, can manage multiple colorspaces.</li>
<li>The Clipboard API <a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_SetClipboardData" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">can support any data type</a> (SDL2 only handled text), and apps can provide data in multiple formats upon request in <a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_ClipboardDataCallback" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a provided callback</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/BestKeyboardPractices" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Better keyboard input</a>, for all your keypress needs.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_StartTextInputWithProperties" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Customizable virtual keyboards</a> on iOS and Android.</li>
<li>High DPI support is dramatically improved over SDL2.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_SetAppMetadata" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">App metadata API</a> for letting SDL report things about your app correctly (like in the About dialog on macOS, etc).</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_CreateRWLock" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Read/write thread locks</a>, to let multiple threads access rarely-changing data in parallel.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_InitState" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Init State</a> to help with multiple threads that might need to initialize something on-demand without racing.</li>

      <title>Block Factory is basically a LEGO factory automation game with diorama building</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You've seen and likely played Factorio, Satisfactory and no doubt seen the chilled-out shapez 2 but there's a newcomer ready to suck your time away in Block Factory. This one is basically a LEGO block factory and automation sim, they just obviously can't use the LEGO name.</p>
<p><em>I've been played the demo on Kubuntu Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/proton-90-3-released-and-proton-experimental-upgraded-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9</a> and it works beautifully.</em></p>
<p>Coming from OverPowered Team and publisher Shiro Unlimited there's a few things that will set this one apart from the likes of shapez 2, which is what it's most similar to for the much more relaxed atmosphere — just you and the factory and your many conveyor belts.</p>
<p>Here, not only are you extracting blocks but you also need to put them together <em>manually</em> in a little mini-building game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9601891601728402615gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9601891601728402615gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>To make it clearer: you will set down piece dispensers to pull up blocks from resource nodes, and send them across the map on conveyors into various stacking machines. It's inside here, that you manually drag blocks around to arrange them. It can get complicated, since you will end up needing to do this across multiple stackers to end up with the exact shape needed at the end. So you'll stack certain blocks together, to then stack multiple of those together later into another shape.</p>
<p>Quite a brilliantly clever use of game mechanics here.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4947753901728402617gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4947753901728402617gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Then you have more like gluing blocks together on their sides, you may also need to cut certain blocks into different shapes to then combine or stick together later on. There's a <em>lot</em> of possibilities here, and based on the demo they're really doing some great stuff with the ideas.</p>
<p>Eventually on each map you build up a diorama too, so it gives you a fun little something to progress towards.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="A6yGmc7HOsU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2e26522d317ff624d4c543203b1d418f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/A6yGmc7HOsU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I think this one, if done right with enough content in the full game, it will end up being a big hit. Really enjoyed trying out the demo.</p>
<p>Worth a go check it out now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2827680/Block_Factory/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Steam page</a>.</p>

      <title>Red Dead Redemption and Undead Nightmare come to PC on October 29</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Finally huh? They sure kept us waiting. Red Dead Redemption from Rockstar Games is now set for a PC launch on October 29.</p>
<p>Working together with Double Eleven the PC release will come enhanced with native 4K resolution at up to 144hz on compatible hardware, monitor support for both Ultrawide (21:9) and Super Ultrawide (32:9), HDR10 support, and full keyboard and mouse functionality. It will also feature NVIDIA DLSS 3.7 and AMD FSR 3.0, NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation, adjustable draw distances, shadow quality settings and more.</p>
<p>It will also include Undead Nightmare plus bonus content from the Game of the Year Edition.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mnvc6uC6xZE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c573668e74e3ca508b2d327f8b7e90d3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mnvc6uC6xZE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>One still annoying thing about this release is that according to the Steam page it "Requires 3rd-Party Account: Rockstar Games". For a single-player game that's always a nuisance since there's no multiplayer content in this release.</p>
<p>It will be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2668510/Red_Dead_Redemption/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">available from Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Will you be buying it? Hopefully it will run well with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a>.</p>

      <title>ZOOM Platform store announces new tool to run Windows games on Linux with Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some fun news here. <a href="https://www.zoom-platform.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ZOOM Platform</a>, a games store that offers DRM-free games both new and old (as well as helping update some older games) now offers a special tool for Linux gamers to run Windows games with Proton.</p>
<p>This new tool called <a href="https://zoom-platform.sh/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">zoom-platform.sh</a> was built to include "safety checks, handling updates, installing DLCs, creating desktop entries, a simple uninstaller" and more. It's based on top of the new Unified Linux Wine Game Launcher (UMU) that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/unified-linux-wine-game-launcher-umu-gets-a-first-official-release/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently had a first release</a>, along with protonfixes to ensure everything works as well as possible.</p>
<p>How many games from ZOOM Platform will work with this new tool? They said "We tested our most popular games, and we submitted our own fixes for many of them; some work out of the box, and some may not work at all." - so pretty normal stuff for running Windows games on Linux with Wine / Proton.</p>
<p>ZOOM Platform do offer actual Native Linux games too, but this gives you the best of both worlds. They also recently celebrated their 10th anniversary of the ZOOM Platform.</p>

      <title>Pairs &amp; Perils combines deck-building and dungeon-crawling with a card-matching memory game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You've probably played card-matching memory games before, but have you played them in the setting of a dungeon-crawling deck-builder before? Pairs &amp; Perils has a fun idea.</p>
<p>Here you have to try and memorize all the cards on the table to match up weapons and characters to attack enemies, while avoiding damaging trap cards that will force you to skip a turn. There's enemies to battle who have a turn countdown until they attack, so you have to defeat them with card matching before you die.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18641006571728389691gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18641006571728389691gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>After each turn you earn coins to go into the shop where you're able to buy up new special cards in the form of relics to have an effect all the time, plus cards you can consume for special effects during a battle. Thanks to this system there's plenty of ways to go through a run.</p>
<p>Various enemies you face have special abilities too and some of them can be quite annoying to get in the way of you matching your cards, or even destroying your prized relic that's been helping you push through a run. Overall a nice little twist on the deck-building dungeon-crawler idea that I'm keen to see more from as the demo is promising.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WWT3NXXbzSE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/029b85eb4eb87b283fa31f0279d1d5cc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WWT3NXXbzSE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3179860/Pairs__Perils/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a> now with a Native Linux version. I played through it for a while today and it works great.</p>

      <title>Space Marine 2 fixes online for Steam Deck but may need launch option on desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Space Marine 2 recently broke online play on Linux / Steam Deck, but the latest update should solve it. Although it seems desktop Linux users will need a launch option.</p>
<p>The breakage came from the 3.0 patch which caused a AVF error to appear and stopping Linux / Steam Deck players from accessing any of the online features.</p>
<p>In the latest "Hotfix 3.1" there's these <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/4696782040358852369" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fixes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed several crashes.</li>
<li>Fixed heavy stutters on some CPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed launch issue on Linux and Steam Deck.</li>
<li>Fixed issue with dynamic resolution and ultrawide screens.</li>
<li>Fixed issue with upscalers using wrong resolution parameters.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13977292441728386997gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>However, like we've seen from a few games over the last year, desktop Linux users have issues since the game appears to look for the Steam Deck specifically. To get around it you need to spoof your desktop Linux PC to appear as a Steam Deck with this Steam launch option:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">SteamDeck=1 %command%</code></p>
<p>You can buy Space Marine 2 from:</p>

      <title>Gamescope gets improved ROG Ally support hinting at more progress for SteamOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/valve-confirm-plan-to-get-steam-decks-steamos-on-the-rog-ally-and-more-handhelds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve previously confirmed</a> that they are indeed working towards a version of SteamOS (used on Steam Deck) for the ROG Ally / ROG Ally X, we're now seeing some of that get into <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gamescope</a>.</p>
<p>For those who don't know all the Linux lingo: Gamescope is micro-compositor, used by default on the Steam Deck (and can be used on desktop Linux) to manage the output of games in a way that's contained and then allow for many transformations on it like adjusting resolutions, FSR and NIS upscaling, fullscreen mode and more.</p>
<p>Just recently code was <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope/commit/b288a82a61005b91dd268b8ea4e8d124d4dd5267" rel="noopener" target="_blank">merged</a> by a contributor (it's open source) into the project to allow for configuring the display on the ASUS ROG Ally and the newer ASUS ROG Ally X. From the notes on the code:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This introduces a display configuration for the ROG Ally and ROG Ally X handhelds. These devices feature the same 1920x1080p panel, which supports VRR and has a range limit of 48-120Hz in the EDID.</p>
<p>I tested this configuration on two separate units:<br/>
* ROG Ally - SteamOS Main 20240919.1002 with kernel 6.8.12-valve2-1<br/>
* ROG Ally X - SteamOS Main 20240919.1002 with kernel 6.11.2</p>
<p>Both function exactly the same throughout multiple games with the entire refresh rate slider within Steam.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To set expectations: this doesn't mean a SteamOS build for the ROG Ally / X are due any time soon. It may still be a while away.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma 6.2 released with improved Wayland colour management</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The KDE team have today released the Plasma 6.2 desktop environment bringing with it a "friendlier, more accessible and smarter environment". <em>This is the same UI used on the Steam Deck Desktop Mode!</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">What to expect from this release? Here's some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>A whole lot of new features for users of drawing tablets.</li>
<li>More complete support for the Wayland colour management protocol enabled it by default.</li>
<li>Power management improvements like overriding applications that block sleep.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17597198101728385360gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17597198101728385360gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - KDE Plasma 6.2</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features continued:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overhauled accessibility options.</li>
<li>Various improvements to the look and feel of the UI.</li>
<li>Lots of bug fixes and various other smaller updates.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The once a year request for donations pop-up is also live as of this release.</em></p>
<p>I'm still currently on Plasma 5.27, so I'm really looking forward to the next Kubuntu release with 24.10 that will at least get me up to Plasma 6.1. One of the benefits of being just a bit behind is seeing all the new stuff get stable before moving over to it. I'm excited! The KDE team have been doing some stellar work.</p>
<p>What are you most happy to see in Plasma 6.2? Leave a comment and let me know!</p>

      <title>Creative Assembly confirm Alien: Isolation is getting a sequel</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's truly hard to believe that Alien: Isolation is 10 years old now, and we're going to get a sequel to one of the scariest games ever made.</p>
<p>Alien: Isolation is a special one for me, since Aliens is one of my all-time favourite movies, and this perfectly expanded the universe while treating it with respect. Just…my heart didn't particularly like it. What an exceptional experience it was to play.</p>
<p>The day after its 10th anniversary (today), the official account on X (Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/AlienIsolation/status/1843305291322200488" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed</a> a sequel is now in early development. To save you clicking into Twitter here's the image-cropped statement they shared:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16804605381728316846gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16804605381728316846gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To our fans around the world:</p>
<p>It's hard to believe that it has been 10 years since we embarked on our journey with the release of ALIEN: ISOLATION™</p>
<p>When we started developing ALIEN: ISOLATION, we had one guiding principle: to create a truly authentic experience that went back to the roots of the ALIEN™ franchise - a new story capturing the atmosphere and terror of the original 1979 movie masterpiece.</p>
<p>It's been nothing short of incredible to witness your passion for the game over the years and see it reach so many players around the world. Your boundless enthusiasm, excitement, screams (!) and steely courage in the face of cinema's greatest killer, have been profoundly rewarding.</p>
<p>Whether you're a nightmare mode veteran or stepping into Amanda Ripley's shoes for that thrilling first attempt (good luck!), we wanted to express our deep gratitude. It was a dream project brought to life by a brilliant team, and the reception you have given it over the years is extraordinary.</p>
<p>On the 10th anniversary, it seems only fitting to let you know that we have heard your distress calls loud and clear.</p>
<p>Today, I'm delighted to confirm, on behalf of the team, that a sequel to ALIEN: ISOLATION is in early development.</p>
<p>We look forward to sharing more details with you when we're ready.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you.</p>
<p>Until next time,<br/>
Al Hope, Creative Director - ALIEN: ISOLATION</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The original had Native Linux support from Feral Interactive, who no longer port games over to Linux, so it's likely you'll need Valve's Proton to play the sequel.</p>
<p>I'm excited to see what they come up with, and already terrified to think how it's going to feel to play through.</p>

      <title>Uncompromising wilderness survival game The Last Plague: Blight now in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Original Studios just launched The Last Plague: Blight, an uncompromising wilderness survival game based on a more realistic set of game mechanics. It arrives with Native Linux support in Early Access. <em>Note: key provided by ÜberStrategist.</em></p>
<p>For a game that's not finished, the initial impression I get from it is quite fantastic actually. Giving vibes of a mixture of Rust, Valheim and other similar games in a new and fresh setting that still somehow feels unique in a crowded genre.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="YZXW5obTink"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3a590df153c674dee3e32d22eac1a3b5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/YZXW5obTink" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>One of the key points of this game is in the game, the dreaded Blight. It's a disease-ridden world, one where you will eventually try to find a cure. That's how the game sets you up too, you're not just randomly dropped into a world. You've escaped the Blight — for now, but you're on your own and you need to survive the wilderness with nothing but your bare hands to start with.</p>
<p>This is a game that, if you let it, will end up consuming you and your whole week. Everything in it takes time and it's surprisingly deep mechanically already. From smashing rocks together to make a bowl, to gathering and boiling water so it's safe and actually getting a roof over your head just surviving is a constant battle. Surprisingly a little bit on the scary side too, when you're wandering through the forest trying to reach water and a bunch of Coyotes run in the distance when all you've got a small hatched and a bowl to your name.</p>
<p>Thankfully there's a full tutorial to guide you through all the basics steps of getting stuff done, and even the tutorial will take you a good while to get through. The UI is also thankfully rather well thought-out too, all parts of it just seem to make sense to the point that I so far haven't been confused even a single time. Same can't be said for my sense of direction though, but that's also been thought about with you able to craft markers to help you. There's also a reasonable map system too.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Even though there's plenty to it already the developer has big plans to keep expanding it including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Continuation of the story and tying in an actual long-term goal to the game.</li>
<li>Collaboration and trading with other NPC survivors to rebuild.</li>
<li>Fishing.</li>
<li>Character customization including gender.</li>
<li>Injury and wound system.</li>
<li>Controller support.</li>
<li>Taming animals.</li>
<li>More localized languages (French, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, German, Italian and possibly more).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Performance is surprisingly great too. Testing it on my Kubuntu Linux desktop with an AMD Ryzen 5800x and Radeon RX 6800 XT on the Very High preset at 2560x1440 has been really smooth and always well above 60FPS.</p>
<p>Since it's in Early Access I'll be keeping a keen eye on this and keep checking back on it. If you're in need of a new game to get hooked on and get in deep this is a great choice right now. Great atmosphere, great game mechanics and really interesting to play. This has all the makings to be a huge hit and I'm already hooked on it.</p>
<p>Considering it's only £14.29 when not on sale, that's a fantastic price for what's there too - good value. It may go up in price once it leaves Early Access. There's also a demo available.</p>

      <title>Nazi Zombies: Portable is a free and open source Call of Duty: Zombies demake</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm surprised I hadn't heard of this one before! A few developers have been building Nazi Zombies: Portable, a Call of Duty: Zombies demake powered by various enhanced forks of the Quake engine. What's a demake? It's basically remaking another game in an older style.</p>
<p>The developer explains: "The game itself is feature-equivalent with Call of Duty: World at War on a generic level. Gameplay components are implemented with minor parity differences. Most World at War maps and their unique features are not yet represented. Various small additions and changes from Call of Duty: Black Ops are present as a means of gameplay smoothing, but not on a wide scale. NZ:P is, first and foremost, a Call of Duty: World at War remake."</p>

<em>Pictured - Nazi Zombies: Portable on Linux</em></p>
<p>If you've not played Call of Duty Zombies and have no idea what is going on: in simple terms it's a Zombie survival wave-shooter mode. You start off with a simple handgun, and gradually gain money from taking down the walkers to buy up new weapons and access new areas. I tried it out for a bit today and it feels pretty good actually, they really nailed the vibe of it and the mechanics.</p>
<p>Fun to see such a project exist. And perhaps with a little GamingOnLinux shout-out it can find a new audience, and who knows maybe some development help. Would love to see this one keep expanding.</p>

      <title>Ridiculous physics platformer Mosa Lina added co-op, game rebuilt to be native</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mosa Lina is a really fantastic game. It's also completely insanely ridiculous, full of chaos and now you can bring a friend along for the ride. It has Native Linux support and is <img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>What is it? The developers say it's a "Hostile Interpretaion of immersive sim design". Basically, it's a challenging platformer with a whole lot of ridiculous physics going on. It's super random in the design, the developer explained how it's a "response to the current trend of Immersive Sim design, where every ability is perfectly suited to solve a specific problem in the game".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EbverJLQy_U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bdb46c10d085434f1bf429bf1bc7b636.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EbverJLQy_U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In an update launched in September that I missed called The Collaboration Update they basically re-built the game so it's no longer using web browser tech to run the game, with it being fully native now. The benefit is that it runs much faster, it's smaller and many other improvements.</p>
<p>Also there's now full 2 player co-op in the game with local and online support. This co-op mode works with all existing modes and custom levels, plus there's two new co-op exclusive gameplay modifiers.</p>
<p>However, their recording system was removed, as they believe Steam Recording will be better. See all the improvements in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2477090/view/4607834045442857504" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a>.</p>

– You may now use the mouse-wheel to scroll while mousing over menus and text fields.<br/>
– The game’s playability on Steam Deck has been vastly improved.<br/>
– You can now use the move-buttons / left joystick to deploy party members in the pre-combat party placement state (until now you’ve had to use the mouse).<br/>
– Pressing the “Swap Character” button (‘Q’ / RIGHT BUMPER) in combat, cycles through available targets.<br/>
– Character level cap is raised to 25.<br/>
– Certain enemies in the late game will now scale past level 20 making the end-game slightly more difficult.<br/>
– Added new Bard class. This includes a new school of spells..<br/>
– Added new Backgrounds: Entertainer, Laborer, Monastic, Nomad, Snake-Cultist.<br/>
– Fixed a bug where Horryn Guards roam around after you retake the city.</p>

      <title>Halo will now be built on Unreal Engine 5, 343 Industries rebrands to Halo Studios</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A bit of game industry news for you: in a pretty big win for Epic Games and their Unreal Engine, 343 Industries rebrands to Halo Studios and said the future of Halo will be built on Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>“If you really break Halo down, there have been two very distinct chapters. Chapter 1 – Bungie. Chapter 2 – 343 Industries. Now, I think we have an audience which is hungry for more. So we’re not just going to try improve the efficiency of development, but change the recipe of how we make Halo games. So, we start a new chapter today.” — Pierre Hintze, Studio Head</p>
<p>They confirmed that they're working on "multiple projects" so we can expect a whole lot more Halo to come. Hopefully they will work well enough on Linux platforms with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a>.</p>
<p>Part of this is building Project Foundry, which is a research project for the studio to see what's required to build a Halo game in Unreal Engine and makes it a training tool for them. You can see more from that in the video below.</p>

      <title>GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) finally closing on the 3.0 release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For any of you who work with image editing on Linux for any reason, you've probably used the GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) at some point, well it's getting really close to the long-awaited 3.0 release now. <em>It's a tool I use every day for GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>Announced in a development <a href="https://www.gimp.org/news/2024/10/05/development-update/#non-destructive-editing-updates" rel="noopener" target="_blank">update blog post</a> the team noted they're about 96% of the way there towards the first Release Candidate, after development slowed over the summer due to a few developers falling ill after the Libre Graphics Meeting conference.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17021059391728293982gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17021059391728293982gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP)</em></p>
<p>Quite a lot to look forward to from this upcoming release including expanded non-destructive editing, upgrades to the API for plug-ins, work towards enabling letting you easily export an image into several different sizes leaving the original untouched, colour space work, darktable integration improvements for RAW images, upgrading the documentation, lots of bug fixes and so on.</p>

      <title>Grounded no longer needs a Microsoft Account for multiplayer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Sony are actively making their PC ports worse with forced PlayStation Network accounts even for single-player games, some companies choose to make them better and now Grounded from Obsidian Entertainment and Xbox Game Studios gets improved.</p>
<p>Grounded was updated at the end of September to remove the forced Microsoft Account sign-in to play multiplayer on PC, as it's now Steam Native. Nice to see! We saw a similar thing with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/it-takes-two-now-steam-deck-verified-ea-app-launcher-no-longer-required/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">It Takes Two removing the EA app requirement</a>. Hope to see more like this, because it's thoroughly annoying to launch one game and end up with another sign-in.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5922073391728292925gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Here's what's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/962130/view/4664130308822453256" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changed</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steam Native Support</p>
<ul>
<li>Steam players no longer require a Microsoft Account to play multiplayer
<ul>
<li>While not logged into a Microsoft Account, you can host and join standard world multiplayer sessions with players from your Steam friends list</li>
<li>Note: a Microsoft Account is still required for Crossplay, Shared Worlds and Playgrounds</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added a Crossplay Toggle in the Main Menu to quickly switch between a “Crossplay State” and a “Steam Native State”
<ul>
<li>Friends will need to be in the same “State” to see and join each other online</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Players can now unlink their Microsoft Account from their Steam Account
<ul>
<li>Navigate by going to Options - Game Tab - At the bottom you will see “Unlink Microsoft Account”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Grounded is Steam Deck Verified and works great on desktop Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a>.</p>

<p>If those interest you then <a href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/y2GbLb" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check it out on Humble Bundle</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Humble have this month <em>closed</em> their built-in partner program and moved over to the <em>much</em> less generous third-party service called Impact. So our links have changed, and we get <em>far</em> less now too. Remember that <a href="https://www.patreon.com/liamdawe" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Patreon</a> is the best way to support GamingOnLinux (and now more than ever!).</p>
<p>Additionally, Humble seem to now be including Deck Verified status and info pulled from ProtonDB on the bundle. Although they're conflating ProtonDB status with how a game will run on Steam Deck, like for The Last Stand: Aftermath they say underneath it has "ProtonDB Platinum Deck Support" despite Valve listing it as Unsupported (since ProtonDB covers desktop Linux too). Nice to see they're trying though.</p>

      <title>Steam Beta gets fixes for SteamVR, Game Recording and Steam Input</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another Steam Client Beta release is live for October 4th that includes a bunch of quick bug fixes for desktop and Steam Deck. Since it's a normal Client (the Steam App) Beta update, it's the same for Steam Deck and desktop.</p>
<p>Here's all the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/4659627343423606990?snr=2___" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Steam not being able to connect to SteamVR with error "SteamVR Failed to initialize: VR API not loaded (101)"</li>
</ul>
<p>Game Recording</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a regression from October 2nd's beta client which was causing some recordings to incorrectly fall back to using the CPU to encode video while playing a game, resulting in an increase in CPU usage.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue causing exporting a clip to file, clipboard or chat to fail or sometimes crash.</li>
<li>Fixes some cases where the clip export dialog did not appear.</li>
</ul>
<p>Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a regression from the October 2nd Beta Update which caused per-controller preferences to not get loaded in some cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>macOS</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed regression causing some games to be repeatedly restarted after launching.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>We're probably not far off having the Game Recording feature roll out to the stable client now. After <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/steam-families-has-officially-launched-with-a-big-steam-client-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Families was officially launched in September</a>, this is the next big one coming.</p>
<p>Have you noticed a particular bug lately you want to see solved?</p>

      <title>JRPG-inspired adventure Flowstone Saga with a puzzle-battle system is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From Impact Gameworks who made the excellent Tangledeep, their next game Flowstone Saga is officially out now with Linux support. <em>Note: my key was provided by NOVY UNLIMITED PR.</em></p>
<p>Given how much I enjoyed Tangledeep, I was keen to see what Impact Gameworks had up their sleeve next. It started off life as Puzzle Explorers: A Tangledeep Story which had a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/07/puzzle-explorers-a-tangledeep-story-announced-and-now-on-kickstarter/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">failed crowdfunding campaign</a>, then it came back <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/05/flowstone-saga-is-an-upcoming-jrpg-inspired-adventure-from-the-dev-of-tangledeep/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">just shy of a year later</a> renamed to Flowstone Saga and it was a success this time around. Nice to see that when you have a good idea, sometimes you just need a little more time to get everything right.</p>
<p>Fusing together the basic idea of Tetris and a JRPG-styled adventure, with an intriguing story and some nice pixel art Flowstone Saga really hits a lot of the right notes. It pulls you in right from the start, even the first 5 minutes has you battling away as it teaches you the basics of the falling-blocks battle system and you just want <em>more</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19598636241728055893gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19598636241728055893gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15589474391728055894gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15589474391728055894gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

<p>The battle system basics are: drop the blocks to get a full horizontal line, which then gets destroyed and you'll attack the enemy. You start off with basic shapes, with more types of shapes to unlock as you go. It throws in lots extras as well with different types of special blocks you can line up and destroy for more damage, that make it feel just that bit more frantic.</p>
<p>Like a true classic RPG, you can fight multiple people in one battle, and switch targets any time while dropping blocks. You will need to do this at times too, as enemies can charge up special attacks, so this again adds to the additional heart-pounding moments when you really need those damn blocks to line up nicely. On top of that, enemies can throw stuff onto the board you need to clear, as they have harmful effects and become a nuisance. The design of it is mechanically just <em>great</em>. I'm not even particularly a Tetris fan at all, but here it fits in so perfectly that it's just plain fun.</p>
<p>Check out the launch trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="P1ZIUS2DzEc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/66c6968680fd0c66934fb896992aee9a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/P1ZIUS2DzEc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's even more to it, since it's an RPG, you have a level system. Here, you can earn special perks which can directly affect the block-dropping board. You could select to have some blocks pre-filled for example, with more filled at higher levels or put your unlocks into power perks when you hit enemies harder. There's multiple ways to play.</p>
<p>As you explore there's various places that need re-building, and here you do little puzzles instead of battles with the falling blocks. They're optional, but a nice way to help towards upgrades and just a fun little break from the rest of the game. Just a nice little extra added in for explorers and completionists.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10095903091728057174gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10095903091728057174gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Flowstone Saga, click images to enlarge.</em></p>
<p>When it comes to the story, it's thoroughly intriguing too and will keep you guessing for a while. You do learn early on <em>how</em> you do the block-dropping, and <em>where</em> the power specifically for you comes from but it's still quite mysterious on where it originallyy came from to keep you wanting to progress further and explore more of the carefully designed world. Nice bit of town-building outside all the battling too, giving you more of a sense of purpose. And, in true retro-RPG fashion, you can run into everyone's house and open their chest for some extras - has no one ever heard of a lock?</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Gorgeous pixel art with painstakingly handcrafted areas sprawling across multiple biomes.</li>
<li>An epic story grand in scope, but with plenty of heart and charm.</li>
<li>Designed with accessibility in mind – including multiple difficulty options and a turn-based “Hold” mode.</li>
<li>Improve, expand, and decorate the hub town of New Riverstone – helping its citizens and making it your own.</li>
<li>Mini-games with unique and quirky ways to play … and profit!</li>
<li>In co-op assist mode, join the fight with a friend in battle.</li>
<li>Lots of ways to create unique battle strategies and express yourself: equipment customization, perk trees, job system, and more!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>One nice touch is that before you even get to the main menu, you're given screen display settings so you can get it how you want it first. More games should do that.</p>
<p>There were a few issues with it at release across Linux / Steam Deck, but the developer has solved them before publishing this so you're good to go with the Native Linux version. Works really nicely.</p>
<p>If you long for the days of sweet-looking 16-bit styled JRPGs, you're in for a bit of a treat on this one. Everything from the art style, to the design of the music and sound effects really reminded me of the golden age of such games years ago. The battle mechanic really adds to the experience too. Absolutely worth grabbing without a second thought needed. Flowstone Saga made me, <em>surprisingly</em>, finally truly appreciate dropping-blocks.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1372000/Flowstone_Saga/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>. And at some point on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/flowstone_saga" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a> too.</p>

      <title>Pinball Spire is a wonderful reinvention of what Pinball can be</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's been a few attempts to update Pinball into something new, and Pinball Spire is the latest that's out now. It's Steam Deck Verified and works great on desktop Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a>. <em>Note: my key was sent by the developer.</em></p>
<p>It's being called a pinballvania, because it takes some ideas from metroidvanias to provide a rather different experience for pinball fans and turns it into much more of an adventure. Developed by Apparition Games, a tiny indie game studio in Canada. What you get here is a rather unique blend of pinball, platforming and puzzles to make something quirky and different to spend your time with.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16792888961728051836gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16792888961728051836gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Pinball Spire on Linux</em></p>
<p>What makes it quite different is that each main level in the game acts as a self-contained puzzle for you to solve, with the power of pinball. I'll be honest, pinball is a game I never really got. Like many others though, I did play plenty of Space Cadet in the early Windows days but other than that it never really appealed to me. However, Pinball Spire thankfully understands me and shows me there's another way to do it, one that's just far more exciting and mysterious.</p>
<p>Here you go into each new room not really knowing what to expect from it, and there's quite a lot of surprising variety in how you'll be dealing with each section. Thankfully, you've got a special scouter that you can hit a button to pause the movement at any time to look around and hover over objects to learn more, and hopefully get an idea on how to beat the room.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="o4eVLrlq634"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/de5a19e810f264c9cc632e385d6cc6e2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/o4eVLrlq634" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's definitely a little frustration that can be found though. Some parts of it seemed to take me forever, because I just couldn't hit a very specific spot. Other times you're left just waiting for the ball to drop, which can take a while in some cases. Basically, it has all the annoying bits of Pinball too, as well as all the exciting new additions to make it (to me) actually worth a go.</p>
<p>Thankfully, you're not just any old pinball, you have special abilities! Like being able to slow down time to line up a perfect shot (still not easy), but it gives you an actual shot line when you use the slow ability if the ball is over a flipper so you know exactly where it will fire. Seriously though, there's a few times I got worried I was smashing the keys on my keyboard a little <em>too</em> hard when desperately wanting to make a shot. Using these abilities takes up mana too, so you can't just use them all the time, which adds to the challenge of it all.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Welcome to the world of Pinballvania! A fusion of arcade pinball mechanics with platforming, puzzles, and exploration—drawing inspiration from retro action-adventure games</li>
<li>Elaborate pinball levels to explore, combining traditional pinball tables with atmospheric dungeons and passageways to explore.</li>
<li>Mana-powered pinball abilities enable unorthodox ways to interact with the environment.</li>
<li>Fun accessories to collect and equip to customize Pip’s appearance!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>With the launch of Pinball Spire, solo developer Tom Voros said: "I hope players enjoy the atmospheric art and music as they journey through the Pinball Spire in this unconventional take on pinball action!".</p>
<p>It's a really unique experience not to be missed. Fantastic design and great audio to go with it make it a really fun game overall.</p>

      <title>Unified Linux Wine Game Launcher (UMU) gets a first official release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Unified Linux Wine Game Launcher (UMU) from Thomas "GloriousEggroll" Crider version 1.1.1 is out now as the first official release to help improve Linux desktop and Steam Deck gaming.</p>
<p>A refresher on what it is: despite the name, it's not a launcher in the sense of it being an app like Steam, Heroic Games, Lutris, Bottles, Legendary and so on. Instead, it's a tool that various apps can use to run Windows games on Linux, acting as a copy of the Steam Runtime Tools and Steam Linux Runtime that Valve uses for Proton to allow Proton to properly run outside of Steam.</p>
<p>From the release notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First official release of UMU launcher!</p>
<ul>
<li>Should work inside both flatpak and snap</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not have official builds for flatpak or snap yet, but instructions are provided on building and using for both:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-launcher/tree/main/packaging/flatpak" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-launcher/tree/main/packaging/flatpak</a><br/>
<a href="https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-launcher/tree/main/packaging/snap" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-launcher/tree/main/packaging/snap</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what does it actually mean? It means that any app can run games using Proton just like they would from inside Steam so you can get a good experience with Windows games on Linux / Steam Deck from Epic Games, GOG, Amazon and various other stores via apps like Heroic, Lutris and others (when they add in full support for UMU).</p>
<p>This is all part of <a href="https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Open Wine Components</a>, and so all apps will end up using the same online database of game-specific fixes that some games need to run properly via protonfixes. In short: better compatibility overall for gaming — eventually.</p>

      <title>6 years after Kickstarter, Orphan Age dev Studio Black Flag shuts without a release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Game development is a complicated beast, a constant challenge to get funding and for Studio Black Flag who were building the promising looking Orphan Age it's all over. A game I covered <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2018/06/dystopian-life-sim-orphan-age-should-be-on-linux-currently-on-kickstarter/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">all the way back in 2018</a> with their Kickstarter, when the developer was confident on it having Linux support.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17925485001728035017gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17925485001728035017gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Speaking in a fresh <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/767660/view/4679893541742798755" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam the developer put it very bluntly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dropping the nautical jargon for clarity, the last few months we’ve been going through bankruptcy procedures in France. This started when communication broke down between us and our publisher, leading to payments not continuing. Alas, with our publisher not continuing funding and no other sources of continued funding to finalize the game, the French government has elected to shut down the studio effective immediately. (Like at the end of the work day today we cannot legally continue working.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Going by the date, they shut as of October 2nd.</p>
<p>To make matters worse when going through the Kickstarter they originally stressed how they "tried to work with publishers, but we never found a compromise that respected Orphan Age's DNA". Clearly they found one, but this is where it gets messier. In the FAQ at the bottom of the announcement it seems their publishing agreement handed over all of the rights of the game noting "I’m not able to get into the specifics of our contract with our publisher, but we simply do not have ownership over Orphan Age in a way that would allow us to shop it to another publisher.".</p>
<p>It might not be the complete end for the game since the publisher <em>could</em> continue it but it's now entirely out of the hands of Studio Black Flag.</p>
<p>Brutal, but a reminder that there's a lot of <em>bad</em> publisher contracts out there, where like this you hand over all your rights just to get the money. The developer has not named the publisher involved.</p>
<p>It's <em>also</em> a reminder that a lot of Kickstarter and other crowdfunding campaigns aren't nearly enough for a developer to fund a full game. Which is why a lot of them also end up with a publisher.</p>

      <title>Epic roguelike Caves of Qud gets a tutorial Beta and the price goes up soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Caves of Qud is easily (and I keep saying this) one of the best roguelikes ever made, and with the latest Beta it's a lot easier to get into. You might also want to buy it soon before the price rises.</p>
<p>They're making the final preparations for the 1.0 release to leave Early Access later this year and on October 29th the price will be jumping up to $29.99 USD (it's currently $19.99). So now really is a good time to buy it, especially with the latest Beta release.</p>
<p>Writing in an update on Steam they said: "We just released the Caves of Qud tutorial on our beta branch. It’s designed to teach the very basics of Caves of Qud and ends with your character arriving in Joppa, just like in a standard game. If you’re already a seasoned Qud player, you’ll likely be familiar with most of what gets taught (though there may be some useful nuggets for you); if you have a friend who’s been itching to try the game, this is a great opportunity to get them going!"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2c6burNvtsU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ccd58887074390f4c94399bd41f6b179.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2c6burNvtsU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The tutorial Beta is opt-in on Steam and a separate download on itch.io. Unclear if the Beta is on GOG.</p>
<p>The tutorial along with the last segment of the main story will come into the main branch when 1.0 releases. Which there's no date for just yet. It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck SteamOS 3.6.17 Beta released with another quick fix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-beta-gets-big-game-recording-improvements-plus-steam-deck-steamos-3616-beta-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bigger Steam Beta Client recently</a> that had some nice improvements for Game Recording, and various Linux fixes along with another SteamOS Beta - we have yet another tiny SteamOS update.</p>
<p>Valve are really pushing towards the stable release of SteamOS 3.6 for Steam Deck now!</p>
<p>SteamOS 3.6.17 "End of the End of the Line" Beta <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4674264042203547171" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wireless</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a problem where Steam Deck would be unable to connect to certain Wi-Fi 7 access points</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Given the Beta naming, Valve were likely hoping the <em>previous</em> Beta was the final one. Hopefully this one then. Who knows, maybe they'll treat us to SteamOS 3.6 stable later today, since Valve do have a habit of releasing things on Friday.</p>
<p>To access the current Beta you need to be in the Beta or Preview channel via Settings &gt; System &gt; System Update Channel.</p>

      <title>Sid Meier&#39;s Civilization VII gets Windows system requirements with Linux and macOS details later</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Firaxis Games and 2K have released the system requirements for Sid Meier's Civilization VII on Windows, but the Linux and macOS requirements will be coming later.</p>
<p>If you've been paying attention, Sid Meier's Civilization VII coming to Linux officially shouldn't be news since I've <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-arrives-in-2025-with-a-teaser/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">covered it</a> now <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-arrives-february-11-2025-gameplay-reveal-trailer-live/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">multiple times</a>. But it's a nice reminder for people who missed that.</p>
<p>Writing on X (Twitter) they <a href="https://x.com/CivGame/status/1841870892449640471" rel="noopener" target="_blank">showed</a> off the requirements:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6644565971728030866gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6644565971728030866gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>What's this? Only 20GB? You mean big new games don't have to be 100s of GBs? I am shocked.</p>
<p>In a follow-up <a href="https://x.com/CivGame/status/1841885325528043648" rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> Firaxis additionally said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're also releasing Civilization VII for MacOS and Linux / SteamOS. However, we don't have specs to share for those platforms at this time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I did email them previously to try and find out who is doing the Linux version, but they did not reply. Usually it's Aspyr Media, but they're not listed anywhere this time around so it might be done directly by Firaxis.</p>
<p>The Windows version will have Denuvo Anti-tamper, which doesn't actually have Linux support, so it's likely again the Linux version will not have Denuvo. Additionally, there's no launcher this time around but the game does require a 2K Account for online interactions (but not for offline play).</p>

      <title>Hearts of Iron IV to get an Expansion Pass, plus Gotterdammerung DLC releases November 14</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox Interactive have announced that Hearts of Iron IV is getting a big new expansion in Götterdämmerung on November 14th, and they're bringing the whole Expansion Pass idea from other games to Hearts of Iron IV as well.</p>
<p>For the new Expansion Pass you get a 20% overall discount versus buying individually and the first pass will give you all of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instant unlock of three new 3d tank models and a music track.</li>
<li>The Götterdämmerung expansion (Nov 14th 2024).</li>
<li>The Graveyard of Empires country pack (Q1 2025).</li>
<li>Prototype Vehicles unit pack (Q3 2025).</li>
</ul>
<p>As for Götterdämmerung itself it's very much focused on Germany, which Paradox said is "something many of you have been clamouring for for many years". Sounds like a great addition to the game with a super-weapons feature and so this expansion is also giving you some new special tools. As Paradox developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>War drives all sorts of technological innovation in an attempt to out-do opponents and although many projects ultimately never saw the battlefield, Götterdämmerung aims to tie together existing research systems with a new experimental research mechanic that allows for both historical and less historical but plausible super-projects to be pursued. The research process will become an important part of gameplay, with scientists, map-located experimental facilities, and supporting infrastructure all combining to produce a wide variety of outcomes that can augment your forces or change the very nature of the war you are fighting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<p>Based on regular player numbers, this seems to be the currently most popular grand strategy game from Paradox.</p>

      <title>Monty Pythonesque humour fused with Renaissance art comes in Death of the Reprobate on November 7</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Solo developer Joe Richardson is bringing on another brilliantly funny fusion of Monty Pythonesque humour with artwork styled like moving Renaissance paintings in Death of the Reprobate. This is their third game in this style following on from Four Last Things in 2017 and The Procession to Calvary from 2020.</p>
<p>It's a standalone game, technically, so you don't need to have played or know anything from the previous games but it does continue the overall story of Immortal John.</p>
<p>More about it: "In stark defiance of his name, Immortal John is dying. His heir, 'Malcolm the Shit', graciously takes a break from ordering cruel and unusual executions to visit the dying man and seek his inheritance - I mean, fulfill his final wishes. Unfortunately for Malcolm, the promised title and riches will only be awarded if he completes seven good deeds before sundown. Guided by the Lord God Almighty (quite literally - if you’re stuck, He’s the one holding a big arrow), the player must set forth into a surreal world of real Renaissance paintings and help a host of preposterous characters in order to earn Malcolm his inheritance."</p>
<p>Announced today it's going to release with Linux support on November 7th.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="X3ql6wnJwT8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f7876ae2529ab7acb293fc2ccfdf72ce.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/X3ql6wnJwT8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Pointing and Clicking – A traditional point and click interface, with a 'verb coin' interaction menu and a simple inventory from which you can drag and drop your preciously hoarded items.</li>
<li>Renaissance Artwork – Renaissance, Rococo and even a hint of Romanticism, to be a little more precise. Hundreds of paintings, spanning hundreds of years, are all brought together into one consistent world.</li>
<li>Classical Music – Music by Eduardo Antonello. Period appropriate music that adapts as the story progresses, recorded using real medieval/renaissance instruments.</li>
<li>Standalone Story – Death of the Reprobate is set in the same world as Four Last Things and The Procession to Calvary, and features some recurring characters/themes, but it can be played independently.</li>
<li>Highbrow Buffoonery – Lofty subject matter is treated with gleeful flippancy. Gags about butts are taken very seriously. But rest assured, while some of the jokes may be ridiculous, the puzzles make perfect sense! (or at least adhere to a consistent internal logic)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking about it, the developer Joe Richardson said: "I burnt myself the fuck out six months ago but the game wasn't done so I kept going and now I feel genuinely unwell lol I HOPE YOU LIKE IT!"</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1739900/Death_of_the_Reprobate/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>More info on the Valve (Steam) collab with Arch Linux and potential future hardware support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently we had the big news that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/valve-steam-begin-a-direct-collaboration-with-arch-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve (Steam) began a collaboration with Arch Linux</a>, to help fund two very specific parts of the Linux distribution. Now, we have a bit more info on what it means.</p>
<p>After an interview recently from the A1RM4X YouTube channel with an Arch Linux developer, Antiz, they took to Reddit to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1fssfow/comment/lpne5p0/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">explain</a> things a little bit further to help people understand what's happening. Here's an excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Basically, the way packages are currently built / managed still requires a few manual interventions from Package Maintainers (e.g. triggering the build itself and signing the built packages afterwards). As of now, supporting multiple architectures would mean multiplying those manual steps by the number of supported / targeted architectures. With the current number of packages compared to the current number of (volunteers) Package Maintainers maintaining them, Arch is not able to handle the extra amount of effort that it would imply.</p>
<p>A central build service and a central secure signing enclave (the two projects concerned by that Valve "sponsoring") would streamline the overall process by allowing automated build and signing for packages without requiring any manual steps / interventions from Package Maintainers anymore (and it will also allow to increase the security of the process as a side benefit). Only such a streamlined / automated workflow would allow us to start working on supporting multiple architectures without implying to multiply the current amount of required effort.</p>
<p>In other words, those projects are prerequisites to start working on multiple architectures support in a clean &amp; sane way, which is a end goal shared by both Arch and Valve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So basically, a lot of it is towards supporting multiple architectures. And with the news that Valve are seemingly working on supporting <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/valve-appear-to-be-testing-arm64-and-android-support-for-steam-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">some form of Arm and Android support</a> (likely for a future VR headset), this definitely makes sense. Especially when Valve already use Arch Linux for SteamOS on the Steam Deck, it seems increasingly likely that Valve will use an Arch Linux base for what comes next.</p>
<p>Antiz has also been replying to other comments on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1fssfow/comment/lps1xud/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, in one post noting that it is very much their "end goal" for Arch Linux to support multiple architectures.</p>
<p>Check out the full interview on the A1RM4X YouTube channel with the Arch Linux developer Antiz:</p>

      <title>XR glasses on Linux / Steam Deck get vastly better with the XR Gaming Plugin</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Wayne Heaney has been working to make XR glasses on Linux / Steam Deck a much better experience, and their latest release of the XR Gaming Plugin sounds awesome.</p>
<p>Heaney has been working on the <a href="https://github.com/wheaney/XRLinuxDriver" rel="noopener" target="_blank">XR Linux Driver</a> for Linux devices (including the Steam Deck) to automatically recognize supported XR glasses, <a href="https://github.com/wheaney/breezy-desktop" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Breezy Desktop</a> a collection of tools to enable virtual desktop environments for gaming and productivity (desktop Linux) and the Decky Loader <a href="https://github.com/wheaney/decky-XRGaming" rel="noopener" target="_blank">XR Gaming Plugin</a> to bring easy controls <em>directly</em> in Steam Deck's Gaming Mode.</p>
<p>This includes support for popular XR glasses from VITURE, TCL/RayNeo, Rokid and XREAL.</p>
<p>As they said on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1fq0rt3/xr_on_steam_deck_just_got_way_better/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reddit</a> the new 1.0 XR Gaming Plugin brings:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Virtual Display</strong> mode - "pin" your game so it doesn't follow your head movements. Enable <strong>Side-by-side</strong> so the display can be pulled in closer (like a real monitor) or moved further away to reduce eye strain or play games that support 3D side-by-side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>VR-Lite</strong> mode - head tracking in first and third-person games creates a VR-like experience for non-VR games (doesn't require SteamVR, etc...).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Follow</strong> mode - Resize and reposition the display, put it in the corner of your display or just make it smaller so it's easier to see the edges. Enable <strong>Smooth follow</strong> so the screen glides to follow you and smoothes out bumps and jerks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Virtual display and smooth follow modes give you the ability to <strong>zoom-in</strong> for a more IMAX-like experience (this crops the display, but you can use head movements to look to the edges) or enable a <strong>curved display</strong> that wraps around you for easier viewing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you've used the plugin before, the biggest improvement is that the Virtual Display and Follow effects apply across <strong>everything in Game Mode</strong>: Steam OS views like Home and Library, all games, streaming apps like Chiaki and Moonlight, even apps like Firefox</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently it requires the latest SteamOS 3.6 Beta.</p>
<p>See their video talking about the update below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="z8ROMQagjgE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/11f97beb4e7f619dd1e3c5ae52c6ad96.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/z8ROMQagjgE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of their future plans include native KDE support for Breezy Desktop, Multi-monitor support for Breezy Desktop for productivity on GNOME, Monado integration and more.</p>

      <title>DOOM ported to run almost entirely on AMD GPUs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Whatever will they do with DOOM next? A developer at AMD decided to port over classic DOOM to run almost entirely on the GPU. Why? In their own words "Because I can".</p>
<p>From the doomgpu <a href="https://github.com/jhuber6/doomgeneric/tree/master" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a port of DOOM that runs (almost) entirely on the GPU using the <a href="https://libc.llvm.org/gpu/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LLVM C library for GPUs</a> based on the <a href="https://github.com/ozkl/doomgeneric" rel="noopener" target="_blank">doomgeneric</a> interface.</p>
<p>To try it you will need a WAD file (game data). If you don't own the game, shareware version is freely available (doom1.wad).</p>
<p>This implementation works on NVIDIA as well as AMDGPU. To use the NVIDIA implementation perform the same steps but with the <code class="inline-code">nvptx</code> loader and make target.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6070146121727947637gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6070146121727947637gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>We've seen DOOM run on basically everything, so why not just a GPU? According to the GitHub page it currently requires a Linux system, an AMDGPU with ROCm support, SDL2 libraries, a ROCm or ROCR-Runtime installation and an LLVM build off of the main branch (LLVM20 as of writing).</p>
<p>How they did it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code class="inline-code">clang</code> compiler can target GPUs directly. We emit a single kernel that calls the 'main' function. Functions that require the operating system are handled through the RPC interface. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLGc48GYHc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">my LLVM talk</a> for more information.</p>
<p>This implementation defines the <code class="inline-code">amdgpu-loader</code> utility, which handles launching the <code class="inline-code">main</code> kernel, setting up the SDL2 window interface, and provides functions to get the input keys and write the output framebuffer. Okay, it's not <em>entirely</em> on the GPU, but all the logic and rendering runs on the GPU.</p>

      <title>Counter-Strike 2 update The Armory released with weapon charms</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released the latest major update to Counter-Strike 2 that brings with it more than 100 new items including weapon charms. These charms are quite popular in other shooters, so it's not a big surprise to see Valve add them in. Plus, it's yet another cosmetic item for Valve to basically print money with.</p>
<p>This brings with it a new battle pass system, which Valve call an Armory Pass. Although they work more a like a ticket, and you can have up to five of them active at a time. Each Armory Pass costs £12.79 so they're certainly not cheap and they each give a total of 40 credits. All the new stuff is gated behind this system too, so you have to buy a pass (or five) and then actually play to earn Armory Credits to then redeem for the items.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20818164661727946423gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20818164661727946423gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The new weapon charms look quite nice, and you can place them anywhere on your weapons too.</p>
<p>In true Valve style, it's all random too. You can select a specific category of items to spend your credits, and then pay up to receive a random item from the collection. Obviously this is to get you to pay <em>and</em> play more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11104623031727946626gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11104623031727946626gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Valve also made some changes to inventory items, placing a 7 day re-trade and re-market restriction on everything no matter how you got them. That includes the in-game store (including the Armory), Trade Offers and Steam Community Market.</p>
<p>There's also some network improvements, animation improvements and various bug fixes.</p>

      <title>Steam Beta gets big Game Recording improvements, plus Steam Deck SteamOS 3.6.16 Beta out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a fresh Steam Client Beta for all platforms with some big Game Recording improvements, plus there's also another small Steam Deck SteamOS Beta update.</p>
<p>First up the Steam Deck - SteamOS 3.6.16 "End of the Line" Beta has this <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/4674264042200389436?snr=2___" rel="noopener" target="_blank">one note</a> "Fixed a system crash when hotplugging a second display in Desktop mode".</p>
<p>A Steam Client Beta was also released, with these <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/4674263407967028563?snr=2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changes</a> specific to the Steam Deck:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed games stored on an external drive still showing as available when the drive is removed.</li>
<li>Make the enter action on the login password entry attempt to login rather than requiring navigation to the "submit" button.</li>
<li>Improve compatibility for native titles that have not been reviewed yet by launching them in the same runtime environment as reviewed titles.</li>
<li>Added a setting to record microphone input alongside gameplay audio.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And the main Steam Client Beta <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/4659626709189608599" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated embedded Chromium build in Steam to 126.0.6478.183</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Game Recording</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for recording with the H.265 (HEVC) video codec when supported by the machine's GPU. This is enabled by default on Windows and should provide improved recording video quality over H.264 at the same file size. Coming soon to Mac and Linux.</li>
<li>Added support for recording up to 4k video resolution when using H.265 (HEVC).</li>
<li>Added a new "auto" quality setting that will set the recording bit rate based on the game's video resolution. This will raise the bit rate when recording games running in 4k, to keep the recorded video sharp, and lower the resolution when running a game at 1080p to save disk space. This setting is on by default for all users.</li>
<li>Added support for recording ultrawide monitors up to 32:9 aspect ratio.</li>

      <title>From November 15, all Steam games sold in Germany will need an Age Rating</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/all-older-games-being-sold-in-germany-on-steam-now-require-a-content-rating/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Earlier in 2024</a>, Valve announced that games being sold in Germany were going to require an Age Rating to continue to be sold, and now there's a deadline.</p>
<p>An update was posted to Valve's official Steamworks <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/contentsurvey/germany" rel="noopener" target="_blank">documentation</a> (thanks <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@SteamDB/113236564734679281" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>), that now makes it clear that game developers have a deadline of November 15th 2024 to ensure an Age Rating is provided. If one is missing, from that date the games simply won't be displayed to Steam customers in Germany.</p>
<p>Developers will need to "truthfully complete Steam's built-in content questionnaire and publish the results". Thankfully Valve has a built-in system for this, so it shouldn't take long for developers to do.</p>
<p>From Valve's FAQ:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q. When do I need to complete this questionnaire by?</strong><br/>
A. You can complete the questionnaire at any time. Games without a German age rating will be hidden from customers in Germany starting November 15, 2024.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Q. If I fill out the questionnaire, is my game guaranteed to remain available in Germany?</strong><br/>
A. No. There are certain kinds of content that are not allowed for sale to customers in Germany. If present in your game, this content must be disclosed in the content questionnaire. Please complete the questionnaire completely and truthfully. Steam will automatically generate an appropriate rating for your game in Germany. If the generated rating allows, your game will automatically become visible to customers in Germany.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Q. What if my game has a USK rating?</strong><br/>
A. If your game has been issued an age rating by going through the rating process directly with USK, you may also enter that information within the store page editor for your game. This is rare. If you do not have an agreement directly with USK, do not enter a USK rating.</p>

      <title>China continues rising on the Steam Survey with Linux now at 1.87%</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pretty much as expected, the Linux user share overall on Steam has dropped off a bit with the Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey for September 2024.</p>
<p>We almost always see the Linux user share drop, when Simplified Chinese as a language on Steam rises due to the popularity of Windows in China and just the massive amount of people there that cause the spikes to happen. Especially so with continued popularity of Black Myth: Wukong.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's the overall user share per operating system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 96.84% +0.06%</li>
<li>Linux 1.87% -0.05%</li>
<li>macOS 1.29% -0.01%</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated Steam Tracker</a>, it's well within the expected trend still overall:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18493693261727854811gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Specifically on the Linux side here's the most-used distributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64bit (Steam Deck) 39.20% -1.28%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64bit 8.66% +0.44%</li>
<li>Freedesktop SDK 23.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64bit 6.03% -0.20%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS 64bit 4.03% +4.03%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 22 64bit 3.73% +0.75%</li>
<li>Ubuntu Core 22 64bit 3.30% +0.33%</li>
<li>"Manjaro Linux" 64bit 3.04% +0.09%</li>

      <title>Nintendo Switch emulator Ryujinx gets shut down</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, there it is. After <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/yuzu-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-2-4-million-and-will-entirely-shut-down/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">what happened with yuzu</a>, many wondered if it would happen, and now it has. Nintendo has shut down the Nintendo Switch emulator Ryujinx.</p>
<p>Earlier today the <a href="https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a> page vanished into a 404 not found error, with some confusion amongst contributors. But it has now been confirmed on the official Discord and on social media that it's not an error. As stated in <a href="https://x.com/RyujinxEmu/status/1841188744126480428" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the post</a> the original creator was contacted by Nintendo and offered an agreement if they stopped working on it and removed everything related to Ryujinx.</p>
<p>It should be noted, this announcement comes from another contributor riperiperi, <em>not</em> the original Ryujinx creator gdkchan:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1953926441727817061gol1.png"/></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday, gdkchan was contacted by Nintendo and offered an agreement to stop working on the project, remove the organization and all related assets he's in control of. While awaiting confirmation on whether he would take this agreement, the organization has been removed, so I think it's safe to say what the outcome is. Rather than leave you with only panic and speculation, I decided to write this short message to give some closure.</p>
<p>These words are my own. I don't want to speak for anyone else here, so just remember that while reading.</p>
<p>Thank you to @everyone who has contributed code, documentation or issue reports to the project. Thank you all for following us throughout the development. I was able to learn a lot of really neat things about games that I love, enjoy them with renewed qualities and in unique circumstances, and I'm sure you all have experiences that are similarly special. I'm extending my own massive thanks to our moderation team, who have been here through some rough circumstances and always found ways to make light of it.</p>

<p>In related news Nintendo recently filed a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-file-lawsuit-against-palworld-maker-pocketpair/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">lawsuit against Palworld maker Pocketpair</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, Nintendo has continued their crackdown on YouTube videos showing their games being emulated, with Retro Game Corps recently being hit as they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoZQiN0o7f36H7PaW4fVhFw/community?lb=UgkxqDniEBASvWOChP2-WYysGcwkCDwSMD9k" rel="noopener" target="_blank">explained</a> in a post. Even though it was for the Wii U, a console no longer supported by Nintendo.</p>

      <title>Epic Games reduce their cut for Unreal Engine games for same-day Epic Store launches </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Epic Games are once again trying to entice more game developers to not only ship same-day on the Epic Games Store, but to use Unreal Engine too.</p>
<p>Announced during Unreal Fest Seattle 2024 is the new "Launch Everywhere with Epic" program. A deal for game developers and publishers that use Unreal Engine, to get a reduced royalty cut from 5% to 3.5%. This reduced cut will apply to all platforms and all stores (including Steam and consoles), as long as they ship their games at least same-day on the Epic Games Store. This new royalty model will begin January 1st, 2025.</p>
<p>This is on top of previous exclusive deals like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/epic-games-launch-first-run-and-now-on-epic-with-100-revenue-for-devs/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Epic First Run</a>, that can give developers 100% of the revenue for 6 months before going back to their standard 88%/12% split.</p>
<p>No doubt something that will entice more developers to get their games shipped on the Epic Store, and likely Unreal Engine too since the royalty fee is quite low. It's also another way for them to get more developers to release on their new mobile stores too, since developers also get 100% of net revenue if they use their own in-app payment solution (or 88% using Epic's).</p>
<p>The Epic Games Store still has no official Linux desktop or Steam Deck support, so you'll need community-built software like Heroic Games and Lutris to work with it.</p>

      <title>Devolver launch Big Fan Games a label for indie devs to work on licensed games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Devolver Digital have just announced the proper launch of Big Fan Games, a new label that will work with indie developers to work on licensed content to make games from their favorite movies, comics, TV shows, and cult heroes and more.</p>
<p>They've already done collaborations in the past like John Wick Hex and Reigns: Game of Thrones. Although some are thanks to Good Shepherd Entertainment, which Devolver acquired back in 2021.</p>
<p>From the press release they note their team including people that have experience "working with games and entertainment properties like Dune, Star Wars, Blade Runner, Lord of the Rings, Evil Dead, Blair Witch, The Power Rangers and more".</p>
<p>Years and years ago, licensed games were a huge thing, they were everywhere. Movie tie-ins were often a given, but over time that was lost. So, it will be interesting to see what Big Fan Games along with indie developers can keep cooking up. However, the press release does stress that their goal is not for marketing tie-ins but for "fun and inventive games that stand on their own".</p>
<p>There's no doubt an endless list of movies and TV shows that would be prime settings for standalone games.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://www.bigfangames.com/news/introducing-big-fan-games-a-new-publisher-dedicated-to-creative-adaptations-of-iconic-entertainment-brands" rel="noopener" target="_blank">launch announcement</a> for more.</p>

      <title>Jump and climb through huge structures in the creepy and atmospheric Lorn&#39;s Lure</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lorn's Lure is a thoroughly odd game. It's all about jumping and climbing your way through these huge structures, with a creepy and lonely atmosphere it's certainly a unique experience not found elsewhere. <em>Note: Key provided by the developer.</em></p>
<p>I've followed this with great interest since the first early preview versions, intrigued by the idea of the game. With an intro that instantly makes you sit back and just take it all in, you know you're in for something different. Lost and alone for 100s of years, you assume the role of an Android trying to find their way out of this…place.</p>
<p>You've by now seen all the complaints across social media about yellow paint, and various other forms of in-your-face sign-posting in games to show you the exact places to climb right? Well, Lorn's Lure strips all that away and basically says "good luck finding your way". A challenge, since it's pretty easy to get a bit turned around, but the exploration and wonder you get from it is quite something. That said, there's a few hints like a waypoint marker you can toggle but it's not forced on you.</p>

<p>Also, you're not <em>entirely</em> alone. The intro gives you a first glimpse at some kind of owl, that looks like a visual glitch that entices you to go deeper into the world. The mystery surrounding the world and what happened to everyone was really causing an itch in my brain that needed to be scratched, I had to find out more and go deeper. The atmospheric sounds are wonderfully done too, and really demand you turn the volume up and put on some good headphones to fully take in the feeling of it, and once I realised that it truly lured me in.</p>
<p>You get a lot of hints as to what happened, most of it through environmental story-telling, which is how it rewards the exploration and not always just blindly jumping around to keep progressing. A game that will truly leave a lot of burning questions in your mind. You will find some lore too, but not a whole lot.</p>
<p>Speedrunners will probably like what it provides as much as those who like to explore and take their time, and I would genuinely love to see some attempt it in this one because the control system along with various in-game challenges make it worth watching as much as playing.</p>
<p>No parkour here though, this is not a run and jump sort of game. With the help of your tools, you can climb practically every vertical wall. It's very much your choice on how you approach the game, although some parts are more enclosed and linear than others, it does a good job at spacing it all out throughout the game. It is a tough one, but the game mechanics are simple enough to get to grips with.</p>
<p>While it's a thorough challenge, it's not in any way punishing. The restart system from your last jump off a ledge makes experimenting with your positioning and choices on how you tackle all the platforming and climbing a fun thing. That doesn't in any way make it easy though. You're still going to fall to your doom countless times.</p>
<p>Really interesting. Check it out.</p>

      <title>#DRIVE Rally is an impressive new racer that I can&#39;t wait to see more from</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need a new racing game? #DRIVE Rally from Pixel Perfect Dude is officially out now in Early Access. <em>Note: my key was provided by Evolve PR.</em></p>
<p>I've not actually played many rally styled games recently, so this has been a bit of a treat. And, it's nice to see another with proper Linux support too, especially when we see games like EA SPORTS WRC <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/ea-sports-wrc-is-adding-ea-anticheat-breaking-another-game-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">being completely broken</a>. Not quite the same of course, but #DRIVE Rally is a worthy addition to your racing game library even this early on. I generally prefer the more arcade-styled racers to the serious stuff anyway, and this is actually a pretty great blend between serious driving but with a more arcade look and feel overall and it works well.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wyXsRMdI5O0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/557589aad648f3942564231482b7e2ab.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wyXsRMdI5O0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The more I played of it, the more I kept thinking it reminded me of something. Then it hit me! I adored <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/09/art-of-rally-strips-down-the-furious-sport-into-a-serene-top-down-experience/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">art of rally</a>, and this basically feels like a new blend of it that's slightly more like a traditional arcade rally game. For anyone who has played art of rally, that really is the best description I can give because of how it feels. Here though, it's a fair bit more extensive and in-depth so if you want something a little more it's already a good choice and it's not even done yet with more to come.</p>
<p>Something I did quite appreciate is the cinematic camera, allowing you to remove the HUD to just get you to appreciate the view and the race a lot more. And gosh, I genuinely <em>love</em> the visual style Pixel Perfect Dude has gone for here. While other bigger developers continue to chase realism (which lets face it, gets boring - where the <em>style</em>?!), this feels like the perfect middle-ground on visuals.</p>
<p>One change I would like to see is the ability to move the co-driver announcements to the top of the screen, they feel a bit buried as subtitled at the bottom right now. Would feel more natural to have the navigator text at the top where your focus generally is. And if they could add direction icons instead of just text like other rally games that would be a big improvement too. Another change I would also really like to see is more camera options, as they're quite limited. It's either right up close behind the vehicle, or inside it, with nothing else. Once those two requests are done, I truly think it would be a whole lot more special. Simple things, but essential for me.</p>
<p>While it is a brilliant start for the game it does have one problem — it's <em>far</em> too easy. I came first in everything, and I am truly a horrifically bad driver. There needs to be some difficulty options where you can customize the challenge to actually make it more fun. The driving feels great with handling that is exactly what I would expect from it on an Xbox Controller, it looks great, sounds pretty good too but it's simply too easy.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Main Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Over 400 km of Rally Tracks</strong>: Tackle diverse environments inspired by real-world rally locations. From sun-scorched deserts to icy mountain roads, every track offers a different challenge.</li>
<li><strong>36 Customizable Cars Across 3 Unique Classes</strong>: Fine-tune your car to match your racing style. Each class modifies your vehicle's base stats, pushing you to adapt your driving to extract every bit of performance out of your car.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Co-Drivers</strong>: Your co-drivers will react in real-time to your performance, guiding you to victory or throwing in some sharp-tongued criticism. <em>Constructive</em> criticism, of course!</li>
<li><strong>Championship Mode</strong>: Choose a constructor and conquer all their stages. Rise to the top of the leaderboards and unlock customizable vehicle parts on your way there.</li>
<li><strong>Photo Mode</strong>: Capture your favorite moments with a state-of-the-art photo mode.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Currently the Early Access edition has:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>4 unique rally locations with up to 48 stages each (24 normal and 24 reverse).</li>
<li>Championship mode with 4 fully voiced co-drivers to guide or taunt you.</li>
<li>12 cars with unique performance stats, each with 3 different classes, providing a total of 36 variations.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Since it's in Early Access it's not finished, with plenty more content planned in regular updates.</p>
<p>Definitely enjoyed my time with it so far and once my issues above are solved, it will be then a must-buy. For now, though, I still think it's good but it's a few steps away from being truly great. I'll be keeping tabs on this one, giving it more thoughts as it adds in more features because I truly like what I'm seeing.</p>
<p>Available to buy with Native Linux support on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2494780/DRIVE_Rally/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/drive_rally" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a>. There's no Steam Deck rating for it yet but the developer explained it has been "fully optimized for the Steam Deck".</p>

      <title>Silence of the Siren is a new HoMM-like from the dev of Project Hospital</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Quite a genre change for Project Hospital developer Oxymoron Games, as they've just put their Heroes of Might and Magic-like game Silence of the Siren into Early Access. <em>Note: the developer sent me a key.</em></p>
<p>A very promising one if you like the blend of exploration and turn-based strategy, although this is in a fun sci-fi setting where you're fighting for control over a distant star system. You get to explore what's left of various planets, secure resources, upgrade your bases and hire big armies. From what I've seen and tried of it, if you enjoyed Heroes of Might and Magic III then you're pretty much guaranteed to love this I think. For everyone else: it's a fantastic start for this mixtures of strategy, exploration and RPG mechanics that I'm excited to see now available.</p>
<p>Check out the Early Access trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-wUXy2DJ5QU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3c62a618d6245fbb14d2bec23b975b46.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-wUXy2DJ5QU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Current Features as of the EA release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>3 completed playable factions - <strong><em>Fossorians</em>, <em>Children of the Source</em>, <em>Sovereign Fleet</em></strong><em>.</em></li>
<li>Story campaign for the Fossorian faction with 4 levels (<em>average playtime &gt;12 hours</em>) + 9 playable skirmish maps.</li>
<li>Explore a rich sci-fi world and discover secrets of a lost civilization.</li>
<li>Collect powerful artifacts, secure important resources, upgrade your bases and hire the strongest units.</li>
<li>Encounter a wide range of enemies in turn-based combat, use your tactical thinking to gain advantage on the battlefield.</li>
<li>Learn unique moves of your units, deploy your commander's special abilities and outsmart even much stronger opponents.</li>
<li>Level-up your commanders and crush your enemies in exciting turn-based battles.</li>
<li>Available in: English, French, German, Spanish, Polish, Simplified Chinese, Hungarian.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developers expect it to be in Early Access for around a year while they implement new features, bug fixes, general improvements and two more factions. There's already multiple tens of hours of content to play through right now.</p>
<p>Linux version seemed to work really nicely too. I'm somewhat in love with the style of the artwork as well. I'm a real sucker for sci-fi and the way this blends everything together looks fantastic in motion. Fun faction designs too. Absolutely worth checking out.</p>
<p>Available from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2147380/Silence_of_the_Siren/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Steam store</a>. It has Native Linux support just like their previous game.</p>

      <title>Unique time-stopping horde-survival game Moon Watch now has a Steam demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Don't play this demo if you value having any free time at all. Seriously. Moon Watch is delightfully great and properly brings some unique additions to the now very popular horde-survival genre. From the creators of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/inventory-tetris-with-roguelike-exploration-and-combat-backpack-hero-is-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Backpack Hero</a>, you know it's gonna be good!</p>
<p>Here you're taking on vampires — in space. That's right. You're smashing into their ship above your planet to hopefully take them down for good. Armed with a deck of weapons, and a unique watch fuelled by "high tech nonsense" and vampire blood, time will stop when you stop moving.</p>
<p>It has the frantic feeling of other survivor likes (hi Vampire Survivors), but gives you more room to think and breathe. Your abilities are from your deck of cards, which all cost energy that you build up while moving. So while stopped, you can flick through them and decide what ability to fire. It feels like a glorious fusion of Slay the Spire and Vampire Survivors in the way you progress.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Tf90YqbOxDw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/238d7048b732fb200a47b763bf209b9d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Tf90YqbOxDw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Really interesting mixture of gameplay mechanics in this one, that has thoroughly sucked in my attention something fierce. The demo isn't just a static build either, they're calling it a "Living Demo" as they're going to keep on upgrading it while building upon their unique gameplay.</p>
<p>For anyone who played the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/moon-watch-is-a-time-stopping-horde-survival-deck-builder-from-the-devs-of-backpack-hero/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previous web demo a highlighted</a> the good news is that there's a lot more to it now with the first two acts, two boss battles, new run rewards, randomised runs and just a whole lot more of everything.</p>
<p>Give it a try <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2878030/Moon_Watch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">from the Steam page</a>. It has Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>In Thyria you enter dreams to combat demons in this unique party-based RPG </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I need of a new party-based RPG with dynamic exploration, turn-based combat and a fun gameplay loop? Thyria looks like a good one to pick up.</p>
<p>Thyria blends together exploring a colourful dynamic 2D isometric map, with turn-based battles where you enter the minds of cursed villagers to attempt to purge their demons with your summoned guardians. There's a lot of freedom in how you approach this one with each play-through being different, and with you able to customize your team of guardians throughout the game.</p>
<p>Not just that, but there's a whole time-management part to this too with a day and night cycle where you mix between battling living creatures in the overworld and entering dreams.</p>
<p>Check out their trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ODxW2dxsGpI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e0e0e5a1243c4c5a0540a5c45f183a6e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ODxW2dxsGpI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Summon your Guardians and get into the minds of the cursed villagers.</strong> Explore the dreams to collect Soul Dusts, Inks and knowledge. Treat your patient to increase the rewards but also the many risks... Each Guardian will offer a range of spells, and unique abilities. Redouble your strategy and perseverance to overcome the living nightmares, which creep in the heart of the most obscure dreams.</li>
<li><strong>Exploration.</strong> Steer Thyria on a procedurally generated 2D isometric map with varied landscapes. Various places offer exchanges, gifts… but also deception and fights! Maintain an inventory of relics that can optimize (or reduce…) the end of quest rewards. Face the living nightmares on the map using Thyria's arsenal, which will expand as the adventure unfolds. Always keep an eye on the clock to best manage the day / night cycles, the visibility and behavior of nightmares being greatly impacted!</li>
<li><strong>The fights.</strong> Defy the demons of every dream by deploying your Guardians, learn about their strengths and weaknesses, and use strategy to defeat the toughest monsters. The management of time, resources and individual resources will be the key to success!</li>
<li><strong>The laboratory.</strong> Learn how to merge two Soul Jewels and summon new Guardians! Each adventure will be different depending on your team, and each fight can be approached differently. Customize each Guardian: choose and combine spells before assigning them to the Guardian. Choose your spells before assigning them to the Guardian. Skill combinations increase the strategic aspect of each fight, it's up to you to find the right balance.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1608590/Thyria/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Linux support on Steam</a>. It's 40% off until October 14th.</p>

      <title>Evolve and fuse monsters in inventory management battler NEODUEL: Backpack Monsters</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NEODUEL: Backpack Monsters is out today from DiceHit Games, Rogue Duck Interactive and it's another quality one in the inventory management auto-battler genre. <em>Note: key provided by the publisher.</em></p>
<p>Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery as they say and this is <em>very</em> similar in style to Backpack Hero, and then Backpack Battles even more so. The idea is to build up a backpack of creatures and items, moving them all around into the best possible position to have the highest possible battle power to take down opponents in automatic battles. It's a pretty cute entry with all the creature designs and is plenty of fun to play through.</p>
<p>As you progress you get monies to expand your backpack with additional slots, which you can place anywhere as long as one slot connects to another. And then you can buy and sell various items and creatures to fill it all up again.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="RA9KfkjK5r8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/16005ad92ef3d8fc2cabf801dfa6cb2d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/RA9KfkjK5r8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>If you <em>haven't</em> played auto-battlers or inventory management games before, I would consider NEODUEL: Backpack Monsters to be a really nice entry to it with the wonderfully sweet creature design and fun fusions. Some creatures have multiple types of fusions to transform, giving you many ways to tweak your inventory as you go depending on what items you can grab from the shop to give them different abilities. It's a pretty relaxed game to play through, with you able to go at your own pace too which is nice for people who don't like to rush.</p>
<p>Having little creatures instead of weapons is an interesting mix-up for the genre, but it really is <em>very</em> much like Backpack Battles. Here though the upgrade mechanic is an additional nice touch, allowing you to experiment quite a lot with your overall build. So even if you went for the same creatures, you can still try out different ways to progress through the battles each time.</p>
<p>The main issue I observed was specific to the Linux version, with some of the little overlay videos being blank. A common problem with the Unity game engine, with its limited support of video codecs on Linux. Trivial bug to solve, so I've let the developer know and they're working on it.</p>
<p>From the developer: "We’re so excited to finally release NeoDuel: Backpack Monsters. This game has been a labour of love from our small team, and we can’t wait to see how players experiment with Cosmions, fusions, and different builds. A big thank you to our devoted community of Duelists for all the support and feedback during development. We couldn’t have done without you." — Bahadır, Lead Developer at DiceHit Games.</p>

      <title>Merge spells to make new crazy combos in An Amazing Wizard: Prologue</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>An Amazing Wizard: Prologue just launched on Steam giving you a taste of a bigger game to come and if you like Dead Cells combat, along with the idea of fusing spells together to make unique combos this is for you.</p>
<p>While Valve are trying to get <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/valve-gives-developers-some-big-reasons-to-add-a-demo-on-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">more devs to use demos</a>, we're still getting a few of these Prologue games and this is one you for sure need to be checking out. I still think the name is a bit too <em>generic</em>, but thankfully after now playing it, I can safely say the gameplay is great fun.</p>
<p>Similar in style to the likes of Dead Cells, Wizard of Legend, Skul the Hero Slayer and Noita it sort of blends a lot of their ideas together and if you like any of those you'll feel pretty at home with this one. Here you kill enemies and build up a list of spell scrolls, which you can swap around any time. However, the really fun part is at any time you can speak to the old wise guy and get him to merge two together. The result is that you're given a new spell with a combination of abilities and it means you can make some really cool stuff in it.</p>
<p>In the Prologue there's 60 unique spells, 100 permanent upgrades across 5 elemental play-styles, 100 enchantments and 2 worlds to battle through. The full game will have a <strong>lot</strong> more with 120+ spells across 7 elements, various playable characters, more worlds, more enemies, more bosses and the list goes on.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4WTLblT2KY4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/05e790366982a5ed171f70e98aba3207.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4WTLblT2KY4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Definitely one not to miss. The action is really fun in this one with how much you can customize your play-through.</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2920980/An_Amazing_Wizard_Prologue/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">out now on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1372660/An_Amazing_Wizard/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full game</a> is due out early next year.</p>

      <title>Get cooking with tasty ingredients to make creatures in turn-based battler GladiEATers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lots of points for originality here. GladiEATers has a really fun idea that combines cooking and turn-based battles into something a little quirky. It's announced for a Steam (Windows) release but likely will run great with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a>.</p>
<p>Here you cook up a team of food-based monsters to command in turn-based battles and become champion of the CALosseum. With every battle starting off in the kitchen you get your basic ingredients and cook them up against the clock to turn them into powerful creatures. Each mini-game lets you change your GladiEATers’ form and boost its stats, but it’s up to you to choose how to spend your time. So you could create a really powerful strange creature, or send in a whole lot of boiled eggs to overwhelm an opponent.</p>
<p>With both a single-player mode, an endless roguelike mode and even online ranked versus battles this looks delicious. I want it.</p>
