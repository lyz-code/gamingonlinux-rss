      <title>Steam Deck OS 3.4.9 released with GPU fix for Starfield</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/steam-deck-os-349-beta-gets-a-gpu-fix-for-an-upcoming-game/" target="_blank">As I speculated previously</a> when Steam Deck OS 3.4.9 went into Preview, Valve has now <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3702568031464333823?snr=2_9_100015_" target="_blank">released</a> it as a Stable update for all Steam Deck owners for Starfield.</p>
<p>When the update launched into Preview, Valve only noted the GPU fix was for "an upcoming game". Now Steam Deck OS 3.4.9 is Stable with the changelog noted as:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a GPU driver crash with Starfield</li>
<li>Fixed hangs on reboot when switching from upcoming Beta OS releases.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I will have a very rough quick first-look as soon as Starfield is installed and ready on my Steam Deck. Stay tuned on that one (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gamingonlinux" target="_blank">follow on YouTube</a>), I'm not expecting performance to be particularly good though <em>for now</em>. As we've seen with many AAA launches, they generally work better (and in many cases fully Steam Deck Verified) a few weeks after release.</p>
<p>Nice to see Valve get ahead of this one though, good to see such prompt updates for the Steam Deck!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8487039221693527057gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8487039221693527057gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Starfield</p>
<p>For players who pre-purchased the special deluxe edition, early access for Starfield has now begun, with the full release on September 6th.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1697431054167183682" target="_blank">mentioned</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a known issue with Starfield where the initial window waits on a black screen. You can tap it with the touchscreen to progress past it, and we are releasing another OS update with a fix within the next hour.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Update #2</strong>: Steam Deck OS 3.4.10 has <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3687939575938360687?snr=2_9_100015_" target="_blank">rolled out</a> for the extra fix "where Starfield could become stuck on a black screen while launching, waiting for touchscreen interaction."</p>

      <title>Embracer closes Volition developer of Freespace, Red Faction, Saints Row</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, there goes another big industry name. Embracer Group, who currently own a stupidly vast portfolio of developers and publisher has shut down Volition.</p>
<p>The new was shared by Volition on their <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/volition_an-update-from-volition-activity-7103051392797351936-hkgT/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> that reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Volition team has proudly created world-class entertainment for fans around the globe for 30 years. We've been driven by a passion for our community and always worked to deliver joy, surprise, and delight.</p>
<p>This past June, Embracer Group announced a restructuring program to strengthen Embracer and maintain its position as a leader in the video game industry. As part of that program, they evaluated strategic and operational goals and made the difficult decision to close Volition effective immediately.</p>
<p>To help our team, we are working to provide job assistance and help smooth the transition for our Volition family members. We thank our customers and fans around the world for all the love and support over the years.<br/>
You will always be in our hearts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A shame to see such a name shut. That said, their latest release with the Saints Row reboot didn't exactly gain recognition. It also caused Volition to move under Gearbox. Embracer themselves <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q2-july-september-2022-net-sales-increased-by-190-to-sek-9569-million-35-organic-growth/" target="_blank">said</a> that Saints Row had "left the fanbase partially polarized" although the game had "performed in line with management expectations in the quarter".</p>
<p>This won't be the last getting shut, as Embracer <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/after-eating-up-lots-of-game-studios-embracer-group-set-to-close-a-bunch/" target="_blank">previously announced</a> a comprehensive restructuring program.</p>

      <title>HoloCure is a Vampire Survivors clone that&#39;s free, really cute and surprisingly fun </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I will admit, I know basically nothing about Hololive, VTubers or anything like that and yet I'm now completely sucked in by the free fan game HoloCure - Save the Fans! This is a Vampire Survivors clone made for fans of Hololive, but don't let that dissuade you, it's also a surprisingly great game to kill some time with.</p>
<p>You pick a character, and go through various stages to beat a boss and then move onto the next stage when you unlock it. Or you can pick the endless mode and just keep going. It's an auto-attack game, with defeated enemies dropping little arrows to pick up to level you up where you can pick from a randomised set of new abilities or character buffs. So, you know, it's Vampire Survivors in another skin. For the most part anyway, it takes VS and does its own thing with it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="fKtS-EK2D5o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/46d12899a8c79f4934fd9de2e6e2ce60.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/fKtS-EK2D5o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's various extras inside it too with an upgrade system, a sort of in-joke about gacha games with you buying extras with the entirely in-game earned currency too. Quite a lot of characters too, I counted 38 of them to unlock with 5 given to you at the start free. Again though, all of it you earn in-game, it's entirely free as a fan game.</p>
<p>On top of all the characters, and the many stages to play through there's even an extra part with the Holo House you unlock. This is like an extra mini-game, where you can do extra activities some of which will also give you a boost in the main stages gameplay. </p>
<p>So many things to talk about the design of it, because honestly it's amazing. From the different enemy waves, to the anvil that drops down from the sky to let you augment your weapons. Who would have thought that one of the best <em>free</em> games this year would be a VS clone? At one point I was able to create flames just by walking, and I turned my sword into a great big flame too:</p>
<div class="ckeditor-html5-video" data-responsive="true" style="text-align: center;">
<video autoplay="autoplay" controls="controls" loop="loop" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15112293201693486681gol1.mp4" style="height:auto; max-width:100%"></video>
</div>
<p style="text-align:center"><em>Clip captured on Kubuntu 23.04</em></p>
<p>So many fun combinations you can do with the characters and the upgrade system. I'm only really just starting to properly get into the game, absolutely loads more to unlock and I really can't wait to spend some more time with it on my coffee breaks.</p>
<p>Really impressive stuff and it's proven popular with a peak player count today alone of 18,868 people. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21244064281693484935gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21244064281693484935gol1.jpeg"/></a>Pictured - HoloCure - Save the Fans! on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>It has no Steam Deck rating yet, but as far as I can see it works great! Performance is good, it looks great and everything I can see works as expected. It doesn't have full controller support, so you may see some keyboard icons but it still works just fine out of the box. On desktop Linux, it's much the same. No issues there and with Proton 8 it works to perfection.</p>
<p>Lots of unique cute characters, all with their own abilities and styles. Totally free, no micro-transactions of any sort. Great retro beats to bop your head along to as well. What's not to love about this? Go check it out and thank me later.</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2420510/HoloCure__Save_the_Fans/" target="_blank">out on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Halls of Torment adds new characters, new stage, &#39;Agony Mode&#39; and much more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, there goes basically all of my free time. Halls of Torment blends together retro Diablo with Vampire Survivors and it was already horribly addictive and now I fear I'm going to be sucked in again.</p>
<p>This new update has expanded the game quite a lot, surprisingly so. Firstly there's a new 'Class Marks' feature that allows you to pick traits for your character from other classes, although it needs you to finish certain quests.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5815848391693482226gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5815848391693482226gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's also a new 'Agony Mode' that unlocks once you defeat the Lord of a stage. Agony Mode makes the monster count, monster health, and XP drops dynamically scale based on your performance. So agony increases the more you kill, and reduces the more that's left alive. Here you'll find uncommon items, additional champions will spawn and they are randomized with extra modifiers and abilities and these champions will drop various rewards for you.</p>
<p>Some of the other new stuff:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>New stage: Frozen Depths</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Can be unlocked by defeating the frost knight on the Forgotten Viaduct.</li>
<li>New unknown enemies await with 3 unique bosses and a new lord.</li>
<li>The stage layout limits your movement and requires you to navigate carefully through the caves while avoiding getting encircled by foes.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>New elemental effect: Frost</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Frost explodes and deals damage in an area when the affected monster dies or 20 stacks have been accumulated.</li>
<li>If the frost effect runs out it triggers with only half of its damage.</li>
<li>Frost deals damage based on the number of stacks.</li>
<li>The strongest hit that applied frost determines the area of the effect.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>New characters</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Norseman
<ul>
<li>Dual wielding axe fighter boosting your physical abilities.</li>
<li>When he hits a certain number of enemies he unleashes a devastating Frost Nova.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Beast Huntress
<ul>
<li>Throws her spear with great force, piercing through the enemy lines and applying frost effect.</li>
<li>Has a hound that protects her from close enemies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>New abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ice Avalanche: an ice based attack with a diagonal pattern.</li>
<li>Flame Strike: close quarter defense or boss killer.</li>
<li>Arcane Rift: magic mines that deal devastating damage.</li>
<li>Spirit Warrior: summoned warrior that dashes through enemies.</li>
<li>Potion of Renewal: allows you to reroll abilities</li>
<li>Hallucinogenic Elixir: allows you to reroll items in a chest</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Easily one of my favourite games that hit Early Access this year. An absolute delight to spend many hours with and this update seems absolutely brilliant for it. If you haven't checked it out yet you're really missing out on a good time!</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2218750/Halls_of_Torment/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>New update for Dota 2 might pull me back in, with new reporting and matchmaking</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It finally seems like it might be time for me to put another 500 hours into Dota 2, as Valve has given the game quite an interesting upgrade for The Summer Client Update.</p>
<p>Firstly, they've completely changed the way you view and buy cosmetics. Before, it was quite a mess. Now there's the Armory where you can go and view all characters and shop around for all the cosmetics available. Allowing you to see what you're missing, and what you currently have. It's <em>much</em> better. It also allows you to quickly demo a hero while previewing a cosmetic set.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2861663091693477860gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2861663091693477860gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>That's not the best bit though. The new matchmaking and reporting system is finally sounding like it might actually make Dota 2 a better place to spend your free time.</p>
<p>Now the commendation system will affect matchmaking. A player you commend is more likely to show up in future games, while a new "Dislike" button will make them less likely to show up. There's also the new reporting system allowing you to report Toxic Chat, Toxic Voice, Smurfing, Griefing, Cheating and Role Abuse. You can report any time during or after a match, allowing you to make a report for either your team or the enemy and removes the cap on the number of reports you can submit.</p>
<p>There's also now real-time processing of toxic chat. So when you report someone during a game, Valve say it will be analysed in real-time. If they detect it's toxic, Valve will mute that player's voice and text chat for the game and put a timer on pings, alt-clicks and pre-set chat wheels.</p>
<p>Valve will also notify you when action is taken thanks to a report.</p>
<p>Each player also has a behaviour and communication score between 0 and 12,000. While it previously only affected who you got matched with, it will now also disable access to certain features like post-game item drops, game pausing, and ranked play if you're particularly naughty.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11502606991693478286gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11502606991693478286gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>This update sound fantastic. Valve has clearly put real proper effort into making Dota 2 better going forward. I can't wait to spend some time with it again.</p>

      <title>SteamWorld Build arrives December 1st with full Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SteamWorld Build is the latest in the SteamWorld series from Thunderful Development / Thunderful Publishing and they're once again entirely changing the genre for the series and turning it into a city-builder.</p>
<p>While previous games in the series including SteamWorld Dig, SteamWorld Dig 2, SteamWorld Heist and SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech all had Native Linux releases — this time SteamWorld Build will not as <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2134770/discussions/0/3764480918998658630/#c3764481114698409787" target="_blank">confirmed</a> on their Steam forum. However, they also <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2134770/discussions/0/3779119905188346209/#c3779119905191384690" target="_blank">confirmed</a> it will have full controller and Steam Deck support so no doubt it will run great with Proton (reports on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/2134770?device=any" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> from the demo show it running just fine).</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<p>More about it: "Be the architect of a SteamWorld mining town! Break ground and raise houses for your steambot citizens, keep them fed and provide some rootin'-tootin' entertainment.</p>
<p>There's an abandoned mine sitting under your town, and it’s rumored to be filled with ancient tech that holds the key to escaping the impending doom. Use the natural resources above ground and the abundant ores buried in the mine to expand your town. Stimulate new residential tiers to join the quest to dig deeper, unearth untold riches and ultimately help them to hightail it off the planet!"</p>
<p>There is a demo available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2134770/SteamWorld_Build/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and the full release will also be on <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/steamworld_build" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>

      <title>Slime Rancher is being turned into a movie</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this could be a whole lot of fun! Slime Rancher, the series of games about a lone rancher sucking up slimes in a vacuum gun is getting a movie adaptation.</p>
<p>First reported by <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/08/story-kitchen-monomi-park-slime-rancher-1235520932/" target="_blank">Deadline</a>, game developer Monomi Park has teamed up with Story Kitchen for the full feature film. This is the same team who are also working on the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/animated-series-in-the-works-for-vampire-survivors-plus-big-upgrade-upcoming/" target="_blank">Vampire Survivors TV series</a>. Writing on X, Monomi Park founder Nick Popovich <a href="https://twitter.com/NickPopovich/status/1692267594341048347" target="_blank">confirmed </a>the news simply stating "Yes, I'm excited.".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/360990091693404588gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/360990091693404588gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Slime Rancher</em></p>
<p>Could be quite fun, it's definitely an interesting setting to have a movie about it and the games are just wonderful too and both games work well on Linux. </p>
<p>Slime Rancher is also one of the best-reviewed games on Steam, currently sitting at position number 21 on <a href="https://steam250.com/top250" target="_blank">Steam Top 250</a>. It sold well too, with the developer <a href="https://twitter.com/slimerancher/status/1570136503539634177" target="_blank">announcing</a> last year it hit the 6 million mark. Slime Rancher 2, currently in Early Access, is also <a href="https://twitter.com/NickPopovich/status/1574485734840360962" target="_blank">clearly</a> quite a hit selling over 300,000 copies in only a few days.</p>
<p>No details on when it will release, there's no real info on anything yet apart from a confirmation that it's happening.</p>

      <title>Check out the demo for Crop Rotation, a farming-themed card drafting game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A farming-themed card drafting game? Well that's a new one. Crop Rotation is releasing on September 15th and there's a fresh demo available on Steam now too. It will have Native Linux support at release.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="v9diokKi1LY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e6f8007d596d42962d4eb7626b1e751c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/v9diokKi1LY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer doesn't give you much to go on though, here's the synopsis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have taken a loan to buy an automated farm. The loan is huge but the farm should pay for itself right ??? RIGHT???</p>
<p>Crop Rotation is a farming-theme card drafting game. Cards are played automatically so you can focus on the deck building and building synergies.</p>
<p>Earn enough money to pay off the loan, or spend all of them rerolling for that one card</p>
<p>Play in relaxed mode, or chase high score in rating mode, or play the weekly mode to show off your skill.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems like it could be interesting, nice to see indie developers continue trying all sorts of new things both weird and wonderful like this. They're a solo developer and you can follow them for more on <a href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@ZwodahS" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>.</p>
<p>Check <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2348090/Crop_Rotation/" target="_blank">it out on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Budgie 10.8 desktop released with plenty of new features</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://buddiesofbudgie.org/blog/budgie-10.8-released" target="_blank">Budgie 10.8</a> was released recently, bringing plenty of enhancements to this interesting desktop environment so here's a little run over what's new.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18120771811693402979gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18120771811693402979gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<ul>
<li>New trash applet - a previously third-party addon is now part of the main Budgie project for users to add to their desktops.</li>
<li>Magpie - a new soft-fork of GNOME's Mutter, to enable them to keep up X11 support in a good state. Eventually it will be a full wlroots-based Wayland compositor as they will drop X11 support to go all-in on Wayland.</li>
<li>Privilege Escalation Dialog Improvements - when PolicyKit pops up an overlay for you to enter a password, you can expand a little details tab to see what exactly requested it.</li>
<li>Battery Status Applet - you can now control system power modes and swap between Balanced, Power Saver and Performance depending on your system's support for it.</li>
<li>System Tray Applet - now using the modern Status Notifier specification.</li>
<li>Budgie Menu - had some menu category reorganisation to be more clear.</li>
<li>Small theme refinements.</li>
</ul>
<p>The question in mind is: why would you use Budgie? What does it offer that's better than say KDE Plasma, GNOME and others? If you use it, let me know why in the comments.</p>

      <title>Get some great strategy games in the Steam Strategy Fest</title>
      <author>Smellbringer</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'll be the first to admit that we're a bit late on this news as the sale started Monday, but the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/strategy" target="_blank">Steam Strategy Fest</a> is up and has some awesome deals on strategy game classics. As a fan of Warcraft and Halo Wars, it's very nice to see this oft forgotten genre of game get some love. So, for your discerning pleasure, we'll highlight the deals that stick out to us as great deals.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/21432/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VI_Anthology/" target="_blank">Civilization VI Anthology</a>: ($<s>209.65</s> $24.93) <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Steam Deck Playable</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sub/37429/" target="_blank">X-COM Enemy Unknown Complete Pack</a>: ($<s>49.99</s> $9.99) <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Steam Deck Playable</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/7118/XCOM_2_Collection/" target="_blank">X-COM 2 Collection</a>: ($<s>132.95</s> $12.04) <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Steam Deck Playable</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/839770/Phoenix_Point/" target="_blank">Phoenix Point</a>: ($<s>24.99</s> $12.49) <img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Steam Deck Verified</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/24780/SimCity_4_Deluxe_Edition/" target="_blank">Sim City 4 Deluxe Edition</a>: ($<s>59.99</s> $9.99) ($<s>29.99</s> $4.99) <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Steam Deck Playable</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/560130/Pillars_of_Eternity_II_Deadfire/" target="_blank">Pillars of Eternity II Deadfire</a>: ($<s>59.99</s> $9.99) <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Steam Deck Playable</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/17480/Command__Conquer_Red_Alert_3/" target="_blank">Command &amp; Conquer Red Alert 3</a>: ($1<s>9.99</s> $4.99) <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Steam Deck Playable</p>
<p>If you can only choose one, I'd highly recommend <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/bundle/21432/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VI_Anthology/" target="_blank">Civilization VI Anthology</a>. Because $209 worth of content for $25 is an amazing deal but the other tiers, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/289070/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VI/" target="_blank">Base</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/12218/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VI__Platinum_Edition/" target="_blank">Platinum</a>, are great deals as well. Runner up goes to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/7118/XCOM_2_Collection/" target="_blank">X-COM 2 Collection</a> with $132 worth of content for $12.04.</p>
<p>Of course, I'm still salty that Blizzard hasn't brought Starcraft or Warcraft to Steam nor did Microsoft put Halo Wars on sale. But it's fine, there's plenty of other games to choose from. I'll probably get <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/sub/37429/" target="_blank">X-COM</a> and maybe <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/839770/Phoenix_Point/" target="_blank">Phoenix Point</a>, which I shouted out because it's made by the original developer of the 90's X-COM.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/strategy" target="_blank">Steam Strategy Fest</a> ends on September 4th, so don't miss out and don't forget to check in everyday to claim a free reward.</p>

      <title>Patch 2 for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 coming with &#39;major performance improvements&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Larian only just released a MASSIVE patch for Baldur's Gate 3, and another is being planned out to come with some "major performance improvements" which sounds exciting - especially for Steam Deck players.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/patch-1-now-live_87" target="_blank">first patch</a> went live on August 25th, and the patch notes were <em>so long</em> it couldn't fit on Steam. With it addressing over 1,000 bugs like short characters not really being able to smooch properly. That's been addressed now though so Larian say they're bringing back "Short King Summer".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18877358961693329323gol1.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18877358961693329323gol1.gif"/></a></p>
<p>So what's all this about a second patch then? Well, on X (formerly Twitter) Larian Studios <a href="https://twitter.com/larianstudios/status/1696534057251921949" target="_blank">posted</a> this:</p>
<p>"Patch 2 is around the corner. It features major performance improvements, many new tweaks &amp; changes, and begins our journey incorporating feedback into Origin Character epilogues, among other major things. Details coming soon."</p>
<p>Given how even on my desktop, certain parts would drop quite a lot in performance, this is good news. We already know they're planning to upgrade to FSR 2.2 as they previously confirmed, but some major performance improvements on top of that are going to be very welcome as it's really <em>rough</em> in many parts on Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>You can buy Baldur's Gate 3 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/baldurs_gate_iii?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>
<p>Still easily going to be my GOTY, unless something else particularly amazing appears. Starfield who? How's your play-through going? It's still proving to be a huge game with a peak player count today of 539,576 which is very impressive.</p>

      <title>Schizollama from Chaosmonger Studio is a blazing-fast run and gun game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Chaosmonger Studio sure are busy. After releasing ENCODYA and Clunky Hero, then announcing Soul Tolerance and Three Minutes To Eight they've now announced a fifth game. It's called Schizollama and it looks ridiculous.</p>
<p>Their aim with it is to create "one of fastest action-platformers on the market" with retro-arcade pixel visuals "to entertain different generations of players, with tons of funny splatterish elements, fast-paced action, humor, and randomized levels". Check out their first trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rYp7zt4LMIs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6eb86b17b1e6f65573ead423c47632e1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rYp7zt4LMIs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Procedurally generated levels for nearly infinite replayability.</li>
<li>Colored pixel-art toon graphic, with frame-by-frame animations.</li>
<li>Fantasy violence, with liters of pixelated blood and funny splatter scenes.</li>
<li>Two multiplayer co-op.</li>
<li>Very fast action.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>More about it: " A group of highly-trained mercenaries is hired by a wise old llama to join an almost impossible mission. The aim of which is to exterminate every alpaca out there. The reason? Well, first of all, they are disgusting beasts, second, they are often confused with llamas, therefore is better for everybody if only one species survives. Aboard a drilling-machine, the llamas will travel a bizarre journey all around the world, digging their way out, collecting funky substances, and fighting an army of alpacas and their beastie allies."</p>
<p>There's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2571500/Schizollama/" target="_blank">demo available now on Steam</a> with planned full support for Linux (including Steam Deck), macOS and Windows. With a plan for a full launch sometime in mid-2024 and they're also launching a Kickstarter to help fund it in a few weeks.</p>

      <title>Check out the demo for upcoming action RPG Drova - Forsaken Kin</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Drova - Forsaken Kin is an upcoming action RPG from Just2D and Deck13, inspired by the allure of Celtic mythology. There's also a fresh demo out to try.</p>
<p>More about it: "Drova - Forsaken Kin is a pixel art Action-RPG inspired by the grim dark classics of the genre and the mystical allure of Celtic mythology. Dive into a handcrafted open world where your choices and actions shape the environment. A society has discovered the power of a dead empire: to capture the spirits that govern nature and rule over them instead. However, the anger of the remaining spirits divided them. Where will you stand?"</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Free navigation in a dynamic hand crafted open world.</li>
<li>Flow based combat system with different combos and weapons.</li>
<li>Tailored story based on your actions and dialogues.</li>
<li>Join one of two factions to survive in this world.</li>
<li>Learn and master various abilities to create your own playstyle.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It will have Native Linux support and there is a Linux demo available. At least from the trailer it looks like it could be quite an interesting one, with some good looking environments if you like your pixel art. The full release is due out sometime in 2024 so it's a while away.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1585180/Drova__Forsaken_Kin/" target="_blank">Give it a go on Steam</a> with the new demo.</p>

      <title>Dev of Shadow Tactics, Desperados III, Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew shutting down</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this is certainly unexpected. Mimimi Games developer of games including Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun, Desperados III and the recently launched Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew will be closing up.</p>
<p>I'm honestly shocked by this one, as they made some really great games in a genre that not many other developers are doing (or not doing well). Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew also only just launched on August 17th to pretty glowing reviews from many publications and videos.</p>
<p>This just goes to show how difficult the games industry is, even for reasonably known names like Mimimi Games who made games that had great reviews.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6657625741693312876gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6657625741693312876gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew</em></p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.mimimi.games/our-final-game/" target="_blank">announcement</a> they said their increasingly ambitious games "took a heavy personal toll on us and our families" and so they're going to "prioritize our well-being and to pull the brakes instead of signing up for another multi-year production cycle" so Shadow Gambit was their last game. They'll still continue support for Shadow Gambit with patches but no more games will be made.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck OS 3.4.9 Beta gets a GPU fix for an upcoming game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's something interesting for you. Valve <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3702568031464333823?snr=2_9_100015_" target="_blank">released</a> a fresh upgrade for the Steam Deck OS now in Beta, including a fix for an upcoming game.</p>
<p>They don't actually name the game, which makes me even more curious. Likely as they don't want to name any third-party games to not cause any issues with the developer / publisher in question. What do we think it is though? Starfield? It's probably Starfield right?</p>
<p>Here's what's changed in Steam Deck OS 3.4.9 Beta:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a GPU driver crash with an upcoming game</li>
<li>Fixed hangs on reboot when switching from upcoming Beta OS releases.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>How to get it? You need to opt into the Steam Deck <strong>Preview</strong> channel. You can change this via the Settings &gt; System &gt; System Update Channel drop-down box and select Preview.</p>
<p>If it is Starfield, they'll likely want this release before the end of the week when the pre-purchase early access for it starts. Guess we'll have to wait and see. It could be anything and there's no hints as to what.</p>
<p>We're still waiting on SteamOS 3.5, which Valve seem to be taking their sweet time on, which <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/steamos-35-for-steam-deck-gets-a-screen-colour-temperature-setting/" target="_blank">recently added</a> a colour temperature setting for the screen.</p>

      <title>Daggerfall Unity adds exclusive in-game books by the original lead designer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall continues living on with Daggerfall Unity, an open source recreation of Daggerfall in the Unity engine and a new release just rolled out with Daggerfall Unity 0.15.4 Beta.</p>
<p>Some of the benefits of Daggerfall Unity include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Cross-platform (Windows/Linux/Mac)</li>
<li>Retro graphics are boosted by modern engine and lighting</li>
<li>High resolution with classic style</li>
<li>Smooth first-person controls</li>
<li>Huge draw distances</li>
<li>Quality of life enhancements</li>
<li>Mod support</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the big fun additions in Daggerfall Unity 0.15.4 Beta is the inclusion of two exclusive in-game books from the original lead designer, Ted Peterson. They give you a little background on a key figure in Daggerfall's story, and can be discovered once you progress past a key moment in the game.</p>
<p>From the release notes they say that "Ted wanted to be clear these books are in no way official and should not be considered canon. If Bethesda does something different with these characters in future then whatever Bethesda does is canon. Please also note that Part 1 and 2 are not the complete series, just the first two chapters".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1383506831693306034gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1383506831693306034gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><em>Side-note: Peterson's studio, OnceLost Games, are currently working on a big open world RPG called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1685310/The_Wayward_Realms/" target="_blank">The Wayward Realms</a>.</em></p>
<p>The rest of the update for Daggerfall Unity is a mixture of bug fixes and localization enhancements, with this version intended to be a stable beta for general play - so you're good to upgrade to it.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma 6 gets double-click to open by default and other improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Something that has proven to be quite divisive in the Linux community for KDE Plasma users is single or double-click to open something, as Plasma 6 will <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2023/08/18/this-week-in-kde-double-click-by-default/" target="_blank">default to double-click</a>.</p>
<p>It will still be configurable of course, but it's a change that has people split with lots of posts across social media arguing about it. Me though? I'm happy about it! Single click to open just seemed like such an odd default to have. Especially so for people coming from Windows, which as we all know is the most used desktop platform - for such a <em>small</em> thing, it just makes sense to match the behaviour there.</p>
<p>On top of that, Plasma 6 will also have touchpads have <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2023/08/25/this-week-in-kde-tap-to-click-by-default/" target="_blank">tap to click turned on</a> by default now that touchpads aren't as bad as they were 9 years ago when the original decision was made.</p>
<p>Another big change is how bug reporting happens when apps crash on Plasma, with it being much more simplified with an option to report the issues automatically. So you won't even need to sign up for a Bugzilla account, bugs get reported quicker and hopefully this will means bugs get solved faster.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13187061151693304851gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>There's so much more the KDE team have been doing for Plasma lately, here's some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keyboard brightness level on many laptops now shows an on-screen display for the change.</li>
<li>When toggling keyboard backlight off / on it now remembers the original brightness level.</li>
<li>Minimum screen brightness now set to 1 so you can't accidentally turn it off.</li>
<li>Dolphin’s settings window has gotten an overhaul to re-arrange things to be more logical.</li>
<li>Starting a Plasma Wayland session in VirtualBox is now more reliable.</li>
<li>They fixed the ability to monitor NVIDIA GPUs using System Monitor, and improving compatibility with multi-GPU setups (Plasma 5.27.8).</li>
<li>System Settings' minimum window size is now smaller, fitting better into low-resolution 1366×768 screens with thick panels.</li>
<li>Plasma Wayland improvements like keeping copied text from XWayland apps after it quits.</li>
</ul>
<p>What do you think to all the changes coming to Plasma 6? Is there something you're particularly pleased or displeased with coming to Plasma 6?</p>

      <title>Linux kernel 6.5 released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here it is, on August 27th the latest work by a great many developers was released with Linus Torvalds announcing the Linux kernel 6.5. From the release <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2023/8/27/348" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So nothing particularly odd or scary happened this last week, so there is no excuse to delay the 6.5 release.</p>
<p>I still have this nagging feeling that a lot of people are on vacation and that things have been quiet partly due to that. But this release has been going smoothly, so that's probably just me being paranoid. The biggest patches this last week were literally just to our selftests.</p>
<p>The shortlog below is obviously not the 6.5 release log, it's purely just the last week since rc7.</p>
<p>Anyway, this obviously means that the merge window for 6.6 starts tomorrow. I already have ~20 pull requests pending and ready to go, but before we start the next merge frenzy, please give this final release one last round of testing, ok?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of what's included in Linux kernel 6.5:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steam Deck fix for AMD Zenbleed.</li>
<li>Fixes for for ASUS ROG ALLY Audio and Bluetooth support.</li>
<li>Improved Fan and Sensor support for the AYANEO 2, Geek, OXP Mini, and AOKZOE A1 PRO.</li>
<li>Rumble support for Xbox Elite Series 2 (model 1797), Xbox One (model 1708) and Xbox Series X (model 1914) controllers.</li>
<li>Support for the NVIDIA Shield Thunderstrike controller.</li>
<li>Enable Freesync Video Mode by default.</li>
<li>More work on Wi-Fi 7.</li>
<li>ASUS ROG Z13 Keyboard support added.</li>
<li>A fix for "a really annoying interrupt storm in the AMD driver affecting Asus TUF gaming notebooks".</li>
<li>+ thousands more changes, improvements, new hardware support and it just goes on and on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Full kernel <a href="https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v6.x/ChangeLog-6.5" target="_blank">6.5 changelog here</a>. As usual <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/linux-65-features" target="_blank">Phoronix</a> has a reasonable overview because trying to go through the changelog is an absolute nightmare.</p>
<p>Was there anything in particular you're excited about for kernel 6.5? Let me know in the comments.</p>

      <title>GuliKit reveal SNES styled dock for Steam Deck and other handhelds</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Still in the market for a dock for your Steam Deck or whatever other handheld you have? At Gamescom, GuliKit revealed a pretty slick looking SNES styled retro dock for you.</p>
<p>It's not on the market yet, so you can't buy one. Although it is due to release sometime soon but they're not saying exactly when or giving a price just yet. The wide compatibility is nice as they say it works across the Steam Deck, ROG Ally, Nintendo Switch and Ayaneo handhelds.</p>
<p>Pictures from GuliKit:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9118638191693237297gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9118638191693237297gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17178422071693237298gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17178422071693237298gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Dock Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>USB-C Out</li>
<li>USB-C In</li>
<li>3 x USB 3.0</li>
<li>1 x HDMI out</li>
<li>Gigabit Ethernet</li>
</ul>
<p>Looks pretty slick, and is mighty tempting me even though I have many docks already. But one more couldn't hurt when it looks this cool right? Collecting random tech is not a problem is it? <em>Don't answer that.</em></p>
<p>It also has a fun cover and space to store some memory cards as well:</p>

      <title>Respawn begin unbanning various Apex Legends Linux and Steam Deck players</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's been a bit of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/respawn-now-properly-looking-into-apex-legends-bans-on-linux-steam-deck/" target="_blank">a saga for Apex Legends players</a> using the Proton compatibility tool to play it on Steam Deck and Linux desktop but it seems Respawn continue their ban investigation.</p>
<p>Reports have been sprinkling in over the last few days that numerous players who were unfairly banned have seen their bans get reversed. Hopefully this is a sign of Respawn now properly looking into it, after many players have been waiting over a week for a resolution on the issue despite firm claims of no cheating happening.</p>
<p>It's still not clear what's going on, or what caused this second ban-wave of players on Linux systems and we're not likely to be told why — because when it comes to anti-cheat bigger developers and publishers don't like to go into details that might in any way help cheaters.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13741917371693228610gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Respawn still have the investigation noted on their official <a href="https://trello.com/c/7roI320C/418-linux-steam-deck-players-encountering-getting-kicked-from-servers-and-banned" target="_blank">Trello</a> page so they haven't finished yet.</p>
<p>Are you still banned? Or have you been unbanned recently or were you not banned at all and were able to carry on? Let me know in the comments.</p>

      <title>Darwinia from Introversion Software gets a big compatibility upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Darwinia, a classic from Introversion Software (original devs of Prison Architect) released originally in 2005 just got upgraded to keep it running nice on modern platforms. Not many developers go back to update their classics like this, nice to see from Introversion!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3512239901693227506gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3512239901693227506gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Darwinia offers up full Native Linux support and there's currently no Steam Deck rating for it.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Major Changes:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added a native OpenGL ES rendering backend.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash triggered by entering/leaving levels several times.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where radar dishes would forget how to rotate if the renderer was restarted (e.g. if the Screen settings were changed while in a level).</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where cutscenes did not correctly preserve the world state, and could cause some buildings to change team ownership. (e.g. on Temple, the Spam cubes could be assigned the wrong team and be attacked by the red Darwinians)</li>
<li>Now supports a new NVIDIA driver feature, the DXGI present path for Vulkan/OpenGL. Should greatly improve frame smoothness and eliminate stutters.</li>
<li>Reduced stutter caused by one-off long frames.</li>
<li>Reworked some of the water avoidance behavior. There were some bugs in how the water avoidance decisions were made, which caused Darwinians to sometimes become confused and just stand still after leaving water.</li>
<li>When Darwinians or Squads are in water, instead of dying immediately after 10 consecutive seconds, they start to take damage over time.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Darwinians would clip through the landscape when coming out of water, and then suddenly pop up above ground after several seconds.</li>
<li>Fixed the floating-on-water animation to update every frame instead of every game tick.</li>
<li>Worked around a bug in NVIDIA drivers older than 530, which caused some rendering glitches with VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_library.</li>
<li>Fixed some cases where AMD FSR 1.0 shaders would not compile correctly when targeting AMD GPUs.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Minor changes:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Introduced timed expiration for cached pipelines and shaders.</li>
<li>Fixed a failure to initialize OpenGL core renderer on Zink.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the mouse cursor render using 16-bit float RGBA framebuffers.</li>
<li>Fixed targeting reticles being shown for units behind the camera.</li>
<li>Minimized clipping of game cursor below the landscape.</li>
<li>Fixed input handling bugs when running at very low framerates.</li>
<li>Many code cleanups to modernize the code base a bit.</li>
<li>Tuned thread priorities for audio and worker threads.</li>
<li>Improved performance of MiniAudio mixing.</li>
<li>Several minor performance improvements.</li>
<li>Updated contributing libraries (MoltenVK, ANGLE, SDL, MiniAudio, etc)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available in the Introversion Classics pack on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/introversion-classics-pack?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/darwinia" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1500/Darwinia/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Deimos Games shutting, making Helium Rain and Astral Shipwright free to play</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Deimos Games announced they're shutting down but their games code is already open source, and now both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/681330/Helium_Rain/" target="_blank">Helium Rain</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1728180/Astral_Shipwright/" target="_blank">Astral Shipwright</a> will be going free to play.</p>
<p>In an announcement on the Steam pages for both games the developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's been about a decade since I first started prototyping a space game - one where you'd start off with a small ship and trade resources. Two games, three game engines and 15,000 copies sold later, here am I with a new life where I don't quite have the time for such work anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Deimos Games will be shutting down this year. Both Helium Rain and Astral Shipwright will be going free-to-play, so that new players can still experience them in the future. As a reminder, both are also open-source, so if you were going to build anything based on these projects, you now have access to free content too. It's been refreshing to see game developers reuse code for their own projects, and I hope that will continue.<br/>
<br/>
I want to thank all players who supported me on this endeavour. I'm truly happy that I was able to share my work with you.<br/>
<br/>
Stranger</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4074953851693226873gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4074953851693226873gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Helium Rain</em></p>
<p>This means anyone can still easily check out their games, and tinker with the code to learn from or make something new. While both games code are available under the BSD license, they do use Unreal Engine, so the code is open source but it still relies on a proprietary game engine - just to be clear on that.</p>
<p>They both go free to play on September 1st.</p>

      <title>Roblox support returns to Linux with Wine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/roblox-support-is-coming-back-to-wine-on-linux/" target="_blank">After the recent news</a> that Roblox was playable in Wine again with their special Beta channels, it seems they've now enabled Roblox to run in Wine on the stable version making it really easy to get Roblox on Linux.</p>
<p>There's been no announcement that I can find yet, but testing it myself today after lots of reports came in — yup, Roblox is now working just fine without a Beta.</p>
<p>Probably the easiest way to run it is with <a href="https://flathub.org/en-GB/apps/io.github.vinegarhq.Vinegar" target="_blank">Vinegar</a>, a Wine wrapper for Roblox. You can just install it from Flathub (or Discover on Steam Deck in Desktop Mode), make a configuration file in terminal to set it to Vulkan and then you're good to go after that:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">mkdir -p ~/.var/app/io.github.vinegarhq.Vinegar/config/vinegar/ &amp;&amp; { echo "[player]"; echo "dxvk = false"; echo "renderer = \"Vulkan\""; } &gt;&gt; ~/.var/app/io.github.vinegarhq.Vinegar/config/vinegar/config.toml</code></p>
<p>Screenshot showing Blox Fruits, a <em>very</em> popular game based on One Piece that at time of writing has 440,814 active players. Roblox is easily one of the biggest platform for games around, so it's good to see it working so easily on Linux now.</p>

      <title>Radeon RX 7800 XT and RX 7700 XT revealed, plus more details on FSR 3</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AMD just announced the Radeon RX 7800 XT and Radeon RX 7700 XT Graphics Cards, and they're giving out more details on FidelityFX Super Resolution 3 (FSR 3).</p>
<p>Of course availability is the big question. AMD said to expect them both on September 6th from partners including ASRock, ASUS, Biostar, Gigabyte, PowerColor, Sapphire, Vastarmor, XFX and Yeston. Plus they will be selecting them direct on the same date.</p>
<p>Here's the specs sheets AMD gave out:</p>

</table>
<p></p>
<p>As for FidelityFX Super Resolution 3 (FSR 3), AMD have a new <a href="https://community.amd.com/t5/gaming/first-look-at-amd-fidelityfx-super-resolution-3/ba-p/626581" target="_blank">blog post</a> up with even more details. The first titles to get it will be Forspoken and Immortals of Aveum some time in "early fall". With other titles confirmed to be adding it later including Cyberpunk 2077, Space Marine 2, Frostpunk 2, Squad, Starship Troopers Extermination, Avatar Frontiers of Pandora, Alters, Crimson Desert, Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth and Black Myth Wukong.</p>
<p>The key addition in FSR3 is frame generation that AMD say "uses an enhanced version of AMD Fluid Motion Frames (AFMF) optical flow technology and temporal game data such as motion vectors to generate additional high-quality frames for a higher framerate in supported games, up to 2x2". Useful for games that you want to bump up to 4K with Ray Tracing.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/413555431692978613gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/413555431692978613gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>One thing they've address is ensuring it doesn't impact the UI of a game, so they include "UI processing included as an integral part of our solution to minimize any impact frame generation may have on the in-game interface" and FSR3 also includes the latest version of their temporal upscaling that's integrated with the new frame generation.</p>
<p>Another addition in FSR 3 is a "Native AA" quality mode that allows you to use FSR 3 without applying any upscaling but still gives you the high-quality anti-aliasing and sharpening of FSR. It will come with a performance cost though, but might look better than what AA some games provide out of the box.</p>

<p>AMD has also committed to keeping it open source and will be added to the AMD FidelityFX SDK.</p>

      <title>Factorio: Space Age revealed giving you a fleet and multiple planets</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We knew an expansion was coming as it was confirmed some time ago, but now Wube Software have revealed much more about what's now called Factorio: Space Age.</p>
<p>This expansion will continue your building after you launch into space at the end of a game in Factorio. You'll get to discover new worlds with challenges, exploit their resources and manage your fleet of interplanetary space platforms they say. </p>
<p>With this expansion though, instead of sending up one rocket, you'll be sending many! As these will provide resources in orbit for you to use to build big space platforms. However, since you're doing it multiple times, rockets will be a bit cheaper to produce. There will be 4 extra planets, each with a unique theme, resources, challenges and gameplay mechanics and some have different military targets too.</p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7942676501692977080gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7942676501692977080gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's still the free 2.0 update coming which will benefit all players, as technically the expansion will act like a mod on top of their updated base game. Some things you'll get in the update includes the ability to control train systems better, better blueprint building, better flying robot behaviour and more to be revealed.</p>
<p>It's not due a while though, they say at least another year until it's ready. However, they will now be talking about the expansion regularly to go over more details of it.</p>
<p>The blog post also touches on how it's similar to the Space Exploration mod. There's a good reason for that, as Earendel who made the mod is part of Wube Software and has also been working on the expansion. They say that Space Age though is designed for everyone, and required game engine changes for what they wanted to do with it.</p>
<p>Factorio is available to buy on <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/factorio?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/factorio?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and it is rated Steam Deck Playable by Valve. It also recently had a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/07/factorio-upgraded-with-controller-support-now-in-the-stable-release/" target="_blank">big upgrade to the controller support</a>.</p>

      <title>Canonical give some thoughts on the future of Ubuntu Desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ubuntu is one of the top most used Linux distributions on the desktop and Canonical, the company behind it, has a new <a href="https://ubuntu.com/blog/ubuntu-desktop-charting-a-course-for-the-future" target="_blank">blog post</a> up giving some thoughts on the future of Ubuntu Desktop.</p>
<p>In the post Oliver Smith, the Product Manager, goes over various details about the current status. Like how Ubuntu on the desktop has 6 million monthly active users, it's the most popular Linux distro for developers (Stack Overflow) and the most popular for <em>gaming</em>. The gaming side perhaps is a little debatable, as they're guesstimating based on what's inside the "Other" category on the Steam Survey. If Valve showed all versions of Ubuntu, I would imagine it easily is the biggest.</p>
<p>With the changing landscape Smith mentions how the Ubuntu Desktop team continues to "grow rapidly", which is a good sign for the future of it of course as clearly they're investing a lot of resources into it right now.</p>
<p>One thing pointed out is the new installer, which is the same one that Ubuntu Server uses. They say it could enable things like having a laptop with Ubuntu pre-installed with the ability to easily "apply customisations on first boot to create a personalised or enterprise specific installation through device enrollment".</p>
<p>They're also teasing something related to hardware. Noting that there's devices from Dell, HP, Lenovo, Raspberry Pi, other Arm devices and cloud devices but with Ubuntu 23.10 they're "keeping quiet" about…something. So a potential new hardware deal is to be announced at some point.</p>
<p>Other things coming for Ubuntu 23.10 include a modern and performant app store, the ability to customize Ubuntu desktop images, quarter-screen tiling, their partnership with Intel on hardware accelerated video encoding and decoding in the Chromium snap is now making its way to stable, investigations into providing a mechanism for users to manage additional permissions requested by apps, experiments into hardware-backed full disk encryption as an option in the Ubuntu installer, they're bringing Netplan to Ubuntu Desktop to "deliver a more unified experience for those managing Ubuntu across both server and desktop" and continued work on Ubuntu Core Desktop (an immutable version of Ubuntu - think like SteamOS and Fedora Silverblue).</p>
<p>It's nice to see Canonical talking up Ubuntu Desktop more!</p>

      <title>ARMORED CORE VI FIRES OF RUBICON runs well on Steam Deck and desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ARMORED CORE VI FIRES OF RUBICON is the big new release developed by FromSoftware Inc, the same team from ELDEN RING and it does seem to run quite well on Steam Deck and desktop Linux.</p>
<p>The game does use Easy Anti-Cheat, however FromSoftware have it enabled for Linux / Steam Deck so that doesn't appear to be causing any issues. They said clearly before releasing they did want it to work well on Steam Deck so that's great to see. It's also rated Steam Deck playable by Valve, not Verified as some text is too small — an ongoing problem many developers still don't add in text scaling.</p>
<p>Here's a look at it on Steam Deck showing gameplay plus a little benchmark across Low, Medium, High and Max Presets:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="b8gNCg3GbbQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/443a77282c24fbc5915edfbfdc73f603.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/b8gNCg3GbbQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For Steam Deck my choice graphics settings are simply the Medium Preset, with Motion Blur OFF and 40Hz locked on the Steam Deck. Overall that seems to be a pretty decent. While the "best" might be to lock it to 30FPS due to some drops in large battles, a lot of it can hit 40 so it just felt better to stick there overall. Like most bigger intense games, battery life is not long between 1.5-2 hours.</p>
<p>On desktop Linux (Kubuntu), running it on the Max Preset with my AMD Ryzen 5800x and Radeon 6800 XT it's been sticking quite well around 90FPS at 2560x1440. So I'm quite happy with the performance on this one. I did try for 120FPS, but on Max it would dip regularly between 90-100FPS depending on what was going on. This is without the setting to dynamically adjust the rendering, and there's no settings for any AMD FSR.</p>
<p>Desktop Linux screenshots (click to enlarge):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11427561541692962493gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11427561541692962493gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7336916721692962495gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7336916721692962495gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20837720971692963587gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20837720971692963587gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2523116421692963589gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2523116421692963589gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Two problems I did notice on desktop Linux: the first is that the Steam Overlay does not work with it but Steam Achievements work just fine though. The other is that while gamepad controls work perfectly, it will on some launches get stuck showing keyboard icons.</p>
<p>Something to keep in mind is that it is a <em>tough</em> game. Much like ELDEN RING, it will punish you. However, I feel the combat here is plenty more forgiving and personally, I much prefer the mech setting. Since it's mission-based, it works quite well to give you plenty of breaks.</p>
<p>Really seems like FromSoftware Inc. are onto another hit here. It won't get anywhere near the status that ELDEN RING had but I've no doubt it will sell well and be enjoyed by many.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA posts NVAPI core software development kit on GitHub</title>
      <author>nwildner</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Without any additional <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvapi/commits/main" target="_blank">commit messages</a> except the repository description, Nvidia posted the source code for its Developer Kit tool on <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvapi/tree/main" target="_blank">Github</a> under the NVIDIA Corporation organization umbrella.</p>
<p>We do currently have the <a href="https://github.com/jp7677/dxvk-nvapi" target="_blank">DXVK-NVAPI</a>, which is an alternative NVAPI implementation on top of DXVK, so there's a potential it could help projects like this. There is a considerable difference between reading some API documentation stating how a resource should be used and investigate some undocumented behaviour versus having the code available to also read its implementation. Some of the files pushed to that repository like the <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvapi/blob/main/nvapi_lite_salstart.h" target="_blank">nvapi_lite_salstart.h</a> date back from 2012 as per file headers.</p>
<p>While there is some code available in that repository, libraries are still being provided as binaries like the <tt>amd64/nvapi64.lib</tt> and <tt>x86/nvapi64.lib</tt> files.</p>
<p>The dxvk-nvapi creator also opened on <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvapi/issues/1" target="_blank">Issue request</a> to include the nvapi-open-source-sdk as well on a Github repository for better tracking of future releases.</p>
<p>Is this an indication that NVIDIA is on it's way to better collaboration and that it also sees potential in projects like the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/nvk-the-open-source-vulkan-driver-for-nvidia-merged-into-mesa/" target="_blank">NVK opensource driver</a>? Only time will tell...</p>

      <title>Over 11,000 games now rated Steam Deck Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's currently somewhere around 92,000 games on Steam and so it's going to take a long time for Valve to check them all on Steam Deck but here's some recent picks.</p>
<p>Currently there are 11,007 games rated Playable or Verified! With 7,254 Playable and 3,753 Verified, and also 3,296 Unsupported.

      <title>Kentucky Route Zero has a big upgrade improving it on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kentucky Route Zero: PC Edition has seen it's first major update since the release of Act V in 2020, and now it should be a better experience on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>While it already has Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified, they clearly weren't satisfied with it. So they went back and overhauled the user interface in the new "Modern" mode.  There's also new and improved language support, plus lots of bug fixes.</p>
<p>This new Modern interface is supposed to be "more flexible and readable on a wider variety of devices, including tablets and the Steam Deck". The original interface is still around if you want it but they tweaked that too. They said another final update is planned to come in future to add in "line rendering improvements for high resolutions, and full multi-touch input on the Steam Deck" - so it's going to get even sweeter.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">New Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Switch freely between "Modern," "Classic," and "Retro" modes.</li>
<li>New translations: Arabic, Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese, Polish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish.</li>
<li>A new Japanese translation.</li>
<li>Steam Cloud sync.</li>
<li>Zoom in on details in the scene by holding the right mouse button or gamepad trigger, or pinching the screen.</li>
<li>Improved touchscreen support makes the game 100% <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yqn9CXG1n6A" target="_blank">hot dog compatible</a>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/kentucky-route-zero?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/231200/Kentucky_Route_Zero_PC_Edition/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Whisker Squadron: Survivor takes Star Fox and adds a lil Vampire Survivors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Taking the rail shooter goodness inspired by Star Fox, making it a bit more rogue-lite and blending in the Vampire Survivors styled gems to pick up and choose a random power-up, Whisker Squadron: Survivor is ace. Note: key provided for me.</p>
<p>It's just entered Early Access on Steam and I've been having a lot of fun with this one. Developed by Flippfly, the same team that made Race the Sun. Giving you some seriously wild runs each lasting around 30 minutes, you'll face off against an onslaught of all sorts of craziness. At times the screen can be quite literally filled full of lasers trying to cut your ship in half.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_5Z6kYdF2P0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f8b22114f1fbcb5b3064ad73439c25d0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_5Z6kYdF2P0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While it does have Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified, testing on both my desktop (Kubuntu) and Steam Deck - neither had any gamepad input at all. Swapping over to Proton Experimental made gamepad input work though. Odd, I've reported this to the developer.</p>
<p>It's a huge amount of fun but I'm definitely looking forward to them expanding the content on it. Still gives me that brain-itch of needing another run though.</p>
<p>Have a look at my little Steam Deck video on it below:</p>

      <title>No Man&#39;s Sky - Echoes Update is out adding a secret society of robotic aliens</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this is quite an expected update, No Man's Sky - Echoes is live as another free upgrade for players and it's a pretty big update for the game full of new content. No Man's Sky is Steam Deck Verified and playable on Linux desktop with Proton.</p>
<p>This update adds in the <em>Autophage</em>, a long-hidden civilization of robotic beings whose bodies are cobbled together with scrap metal and salvaged tech with lots of varied styles. The extra fun thing about them? You get to make your own robotic avatar and customize it to your liking. That's not even the best bit of the update — there's loads to it including: a big expansion to space combat with a <strong>lot</strong> more depth, pirate frigates with massive space cannons, you can make a unique staff to be your multi-tool, there's also a new class of customizable multi-tool, a new expedition, outlaw capital ships and the list goes on.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8g2YqU-_GtA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fa47d45f69e79f024982bb31fd77577a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8g2YqU-_GtA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's safe to say No Man's Sky is now almost an entirely different game to what released originally, it's also becoming one of the most in-depth open-world space games ever made. What they've added in this update alone is pretty amazing, Hello Games continues to impress with the post-release support. Seems like it may be time to play it through.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/no-mans-sky?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Sweet beekeeping sim APICO update 3.0 heads to the ocean</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What do beekeeping and ocean exploration have in common? Well they will both be in the APICO 3.0 update that's planned to arrive this "fall".</p>
<p>Update 3.0: What Lies Beeneath invites you to dive into the crystal blue ocean waters surrounding the APICO archipelago and explore its depths. New areas, forageables, quests, and new bees are yours to discover deep bee-low the watery abyss. Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kgUb2TUuSFA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2f11eb82051bff42dea73a5ddcd53062.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kgUb2TUuSFA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What's coming in the 3.0 update:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New areas:</strong> Dive deep down to the bottom of the ocean and discover a new bee-ome with new areas to explore that include deep-sea flora and fauna, a coral reef system, and more!</li>
<li><strong>New Bees:</strong> Discover, collect, build homes and breed new species of bees found only at the furthest depths of the ocean, and collect their resources for craftables and quests.</li>
<li><strong>New Quests: </strong>Harness the help of your newfound bee friends to restore the damaged coral reef system and clean up underwater pollution to help the bee-cosystem and its inhabitants thrive.</li>
<li><strong>New Fishing Mechanic:</strong> Skipper’s dad, Captain, arrives at the archipelago to teach you the ins and outs of a new mechanic — fishing!</li>
<li><strong>And More:</strong> New quality-of-life improvements, including a newly added trash can and nearby chest auto-deposit, will help your beekeeping bee-come more efficient than ever!</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a really lovely game to play through. Relaxing, sweet and just a nice game to relax with so this expansion certainly has my eyes glued to it. Even sweeter is that when you buy it a portion of the proceeds go towards bee conservation.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Available to buy right now on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/apico?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://tngineers.itch.io/apico" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1390190/APICO/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Respawn now properly looking into Apex Legends bans on Linux &amp; Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/linux-players-getting-banned-on-apex-legends-again/" target="_blank">Around five days ago</a> I reported on Apex Legends doing a ban wave which for the second time hit a bunch of players on Linux and Steam Deck playing it with Proton. Now at least the developer Respawn is looking into it.</p>
<p>While I've been updating the previous article, it's probably a good idea for a fresh report to keep people up to date on what's happening. There's been quite a <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/Technical-Issues/Linux-players-getting-banned/td-p/12338557/page/34" target="_blank">lot</a> of confirmed reports of bans now, with the majority of which being Linux desktop players but a few who play on Steam Deck were also caught up in it.</p>
<p>My emails to various EA contacts went unanswered, but thankfully a Respawn staff member on the community run, developer supported Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/15uqt7w/comment/jxgwj2m/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank">replied</a> officially to note: "Updating folks here that the investigation is continuing and we've added this to the <a href="https://trello.com/c/7roI320C/418-linux-steam-deck-players-encountering-getting-kicked-from-servers-and-banned" target="_blank">Trello</a> for transparency. We'll update that card as more details become available. Cheers for your reports!"</p>
<p>The official Respawn account on X (formerly Twitter) also <a href="https://twitter.com/Respawn/status/1694467974021996951" target="_blank">posted</a> on August 23rd that a number of bans were issued on that day, but no word from either them or EA on X about the Linux bans so it's likely unrelated (unless more bans appear).</p>
<p>Hopefully sometime soon we can find out why it happened, and see the bans getting reversed. Since this is the second time it's happened, hopefully they will also make steps to prevent it happening to non-cheaters so I don't have to report on it for a third time.</p>

      <title>Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands musical comedy RPG is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love a bit of music, comedy and absurdity? Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands has plenty and it's officially out now with full Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified too. Seems players on Steam are liking it too with a Very Positive rating.</p>
<p>Even though it is Steam Deck Verified the developer still continues making improvements, with an update landing today to improve controls for Steam Deck and other gamepads. The developer has been patching up various other bugs since release too so it's seeing nice post-release support. Another worthy Linux game to add to your collection. Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hXEP4cm7Res"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/de3f7bdec9ee22fbfa7b9e8b05f1dc04.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hXEP4cm7Res" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Customise the band with 9 musically-themed classes to choose from, each with their own attacks, perks and sensational appearance.</li>
<li>Kick down every single door you come across, regardless of how unlocked they might be.</li>
<li>Some doors will be too strong to kick down. That's why you gotta kick down weaker doors to level up your door kicking skill until you're strong enough.</li>
<li>Fancy combat system that focuses on BAR EFFECTS. What happens BETWEEN turns makes all the difference, bringing real-time elements into the turn-based combat.</li>
<li>Sew patches of band logos onto your BATTLE JACKET for extra perks in BATTLE.</li>
<li>No Random Encounters! Monsters will be shown on the field for your avoiding leisure.</li>
<li>Original soundtrack that'll make you say things like SIIICK and OH RIGHT ON.</li>
<li>Bursting at the seams with humour, absurdity and a wide variety of colourful characters, armed with an abundance of dialogue faces to express themselves TO THE MAX.</li>
<li>A rich world packed with well over 100 unique NPCs.</li>
<li>Even the ITEMS have personality. Say bye bye to the generic "HEALTH POTION". Local NPC Barry Friendly is taking care of the soothing beverages around here. Sink into a warm cup of BARRY FRIENDLY'S TEA whenever your health is low. Maybe you'll even have the pleasure of meeting Barry at some point.</li>
<li>One of the enemies you fight is a skateboarding platypus.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This was actually <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/deathbulge/deathbulge-battle-of-the-bands" target="_blank">funded on Kickstarter</a>, so it's good to see another successful release thanks to crowdfunding.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1083790/Deathbulge_Battle_of_the_Bands/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Epic Games&#39; new exclusive deal gives devs 100% for 6 months</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Epic Games have announced their new Epic First Run program, to entice more developers to release on their store exclusively and give developers a boost. With this we can expect to see many more developers opt to go Epic exclusive.</p>
<p>The Epic First Run program will give developers 100% of the revenue, so Epic Games will not take a cut from sales on the Epic Games Store for the first 6 exclusive months. It's opt-in for developers and does <em>not</em> prevent them from selling it directly <em>and</em> selling it using keys via the likes of Green Man Gaming, Humble Store and other stores that sell keys. Naturally, this rules out Steam and GOG, which is largely the point of it to get more people to shop on the Epic Store and not Steam.</p>
<p>After the 6 month exclusive period is up, developers can then release elsewhere and the revenue split goes back to 88% for developers and 12% to Epic Games.</p>
<p>Epic also mention that they now have over 68 million monthly active users with over 230 million players. To help get word out, developers who opt into the Epic First Run program will get "new exclusive badging, homepage placements, and dedicated collections" along with features in "elevant store campaigns including sales, events, and editorial as applicable".</p>
<p>See Epic's <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/introducing-the-epic-first-run-program" target="_blank">announcement here</a>.</p>
<p><em>What do you think to this news?</em></p>
<p>On Linux and Steam Deck, you can use the likes of the <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> to really simplify getting games from Epic since they still do not officially support either with the Epic Store.</p>
<p><em>In related news Denuvo are rolling out some <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/denuvo-expand-their-anti-tamper-and-add-special-unreal-engine-protection/" target="_blank">special protection for Unreal Engine games</a>.</em></p>

      <title>Denuvo expand their Anti-Tamper and add special Unreal Engine Protection</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You all absolutely adore Denuvo right? Well it's about to expand to offer game developers more options to add into their games so here's what's coming.</p>
<p>Announced during Gamescom is an expansion of their Anti-Tamper tooling with Integrity Verification. They say it will bring "more granular options to the Anti-Tamper product" letting developers verify the integrity of their own code, which is supposed to protect it against static and dynamic tampering preventing people from altering protected game code before startup and during gameplay.</p>
<p>“We understand the paramount importance of code security in the gaming industry,” said Doug Lowther, Chief Executive Officer at Irdeto, “Our Integrity Verification feature offers an effortless and robust defense, empowering our customers with a powerful tool to protect their valuable code and maintain the integrity of their gaming experiences.”</p>
<p>As for the Unreal Engine Protection, this new feature is a "first-of-its-kind solution is easy to integrate into the game on a binary level, effectively thwarting data mining attempts and creating formidable barriers against cheat creators, pirates and fraudsters" according to Denuvo developer Irdeto. </p>
<p>“With the Unreal Engine Protection, we are creating new weapons for the gaming industry’s fight against hackers trying to do things with games that are not supposed to be done,” said Lowther, “Our commitment to staying ahead of the curve in gaming security is exemplified by this first-to-market solution, enabling game developers and publishers to protect their creations with unparalleled ease.” </p>
<p>Full <a href="https://irdeto.com/news/denuvo-by-irdeto-unveils-new-features-for-enhanced-gaming-security-at-gamescom" target="_blank">press release here</a>.</p>
<p>Thankfully, so far, Denuvo hasn't actually caused all that many issues for Linux desktop and Steam Deck gamers, since games protected by it work in Proton. When I spoke to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/01/steamworks-gets-denuvo-anti-cheat-heres-what-irdeto-say-about-linux-support/" target="_blank">Irdeto back in early 2021</a> they mentioned their anti-cheat would work on Linux too but it would tell developers as running at lower integrity but still that the "userspace game process performs significant cheat detection". Since then we've not had any updates on that.</p>

      <title>Bazzite is a new Fedora-based Linux for Steam Deck and gaming PCs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to try something a little different? Bazzite was recently announced as a custom Fedora 38-based Linux image designed to bring the best Linux gaming to PCs and Steam Deck. The developers note it's built from <a href="https://github.com/ublue-os/main" target="_blank">ublue-os/main</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ublue-os/nvidia" target="_blank">ublue-os/nvidia</a> using <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/" target="_blank">Fedora</a> technology so you'll get expanded hardware support and plenty of drivers included.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17488967831692788372gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17488967831692788372gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>A bunch of features they say to expect from it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proprietary Nvidia drivers pre-installed.</li>
<li>Full hardware accelerated codec support for H264 decoding.</li>
<li>Full support for AMD's ROCM OpenCL/HIP run-times.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/atar-axis/xpadneo" target="_blank">xpadneo</a> driver for wireless Xbox One controllers.</li>
<li>Full support for <a href="https://www.synaptics.com/products/displaylink-graphics" target="_blank">DisplayLink</a>.</li>
<li>Includes Valve's KDE themes from SteamOS.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ishitatsuyuki/LatencyFleX" target="_blank">LatencyFleX</a>, <a href="https://github.com/DadSchoorse/vkBasalt" target="_blank">vkBasalt</a>, <a href="https://github.com/flightlessmango/Mangohud" target="_blank">MangoHud</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/nowrep/obs-vkcapture" target="_blank">OBS VkCapture</a> installed and available by default</li>
<li>Support for <a href="https://www.wallpaperengine.io/en" target="_blank">Wallpaper Engine</a>. (Only on KDE)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox" target="_blank">Distrobox</a> preinstalled with automatic updates for created containers.</li>
<li>Automated <code class="inline-code">duperemove</code> services for reducing the disk space used by wine prefix contents.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pop-os/system76-scheduler" target="_blank">System76-Scheduler</a> preinstalled, providing automatic process priority tweaks to your focused application and keeping CPU time for background processes to a minimum.</li>
<li>Customized System76-Scheduler config with additional rules and CFS parameters from <a href="https://github.com/Frogging-Family/linux-tkg" target="_blank">Linux-TKG</a>.</li>
<li>Uses <a href="https://github.com/google/bbr" target="_blank">Google's BBR TCP congestion control</a> by default.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sezanzeb/input-remapper" target="_blank">Input Remapper</a> preinstalled and enabled. (Available but default-disabled on the Deck variant)</li>
<li>Helpful first-start installer provides an easy way to install numerous applications and tweaks, including installing <a href="https://gitlab.com/corectrl/corectrl" target="_blank">CoreCtrl</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/leinardi/gwe" target="_blank">GreenWithEnvy</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://nixos.org/" target="_blank">Nix</a> package manager optionally available.</li>
<li><a href="https://waydro.id/" target="_blank">Waydroid</a> preinstalled for running Android apps. Future releases will offer to set this up for you. (Not available on Nvidia builds)</li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/CalcProgrammer1/OpenRGB" target="_blank">OpenRGB</a> i2c-piix4 and i2c-nct6775 drivers for controlling RGB on certain motherboards.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hannesmann/gcadapter-oc-kmod" target="_blank">GCAdapter_OC</a> driver for overclocking Nintendo's Gamecube Controller Adapter to 1000hz polling.</li>
<li>Out of the box support for <a href="https://wooting.io/" target="_blank">Wooting</a> keyboards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Including Waydroid configured by default is a pretty interesting choice, could expand what you can do on Steam Deck rather a lot don't you think? There's a lot of things there making me quite keen to try it out on one of my Steam Decks. Tempting…</p>
<p>They include various tweak between using it on desktop and Steam Deck. For example the Steam Deck release gives you the ability to install the likes of Decky Loader, EmuDeck and ProtonUp-Qt during the setup. You get the latest version of the Mesa graphics drivers, easy update rollbacks if something breaks, a custom update system to let you upgrade  the OS, Flatpaks, and Distrobox images to be updated directly from the Gamemode UI and much more.</p>
<p>Quite an exciting idea overall!</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://universal-blue.org/blog/2023/08/20/bazzite-10/" target="_blank">release announcement</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: as a clarification, this is not a "new distro" but doing a bunch of fancy customizations directly on top of Fedora. The text was edited to reflect this.</p>

      <title>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty new trailer live, plus big free update coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty is an upcoming paid expansion for the open world game from CD PROJEKT RED. Here's all the new details for you.</p>
<p>With the base game currrently Steam Deck Verified and rated Gold on ProtonDB, it remains to be seen how the update and expansion will change that. We'll know a lot more closer to release and I'll be taking a look to let you know what to expect. Although a lot of what's new will be paid content in the DLC they've said that the redesigned skill trees, overhauled police system, and vehicle combat will all be available for free as part of Update 2.0 for Cyberpunk 2077!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zBrkG3aeWCc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/083d3af82a74f889215583988a4c5934.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zBrkG3aeWCc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The new skill tree offers a wide range of powerful abilities that will allow you to master new playstyles and create unique, meaningful builds. Phantom Liberty also introduces a densely packed new location, Dogtown, with endless dynamic events and missions, action-packed gigs, new clothing items, weapons, cyberware, and more to explore.</p>
<p>Also highlighted is the redesigned parks system, which shows off some new perks that open up more gameplay options, and interesting new ways to take down enemies. Thankfully both enemy AI and police AI have been improved, meaning everything is a lot more dynamic. Hopefully this means we'll see less of everyone just standing around lifeleslly, which was quite funny to see in the original. Police for example will now set up roadblocks, attempt to ram you off the road and more. Oh, and there's vehicle combat now too.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty releases September 26th and the 2.0 update a while before. You can pre-order on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2138330/Cyberpunk_2077_Phantom_Liberty/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store (GOG Key)</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/cyberpunk_2077_phantom_liberty" target="_blank">GOG</a> direct.</p>
<p><em>I've actually yet to play through it, so it seems like my waiting will pay off big time for this one to truly get a better experience overall. Are you also holding off?</em></p>

      <title>Blending GTA with Deus Ex, Streets of Rogue 2 gets a first trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As a big fan of the original game, I'm very excited for Streets of Rogue 2. Giving you a big unpredictable open world that combines elements of GTA, Deus Ex and various sandbox games. The first trailer was shown off during Gamescom.</p>
<p>You'll be able to explore a lively world where <em>everything</em> is destructible. According to the info I was sent Streets of Rogue 2's procedurally-generated map is more than <u>100</u> times the size of a level from the first game. That's…pretty big actually. Exciting! In the game you'll see a nice variety of locations including neon-lit cities, the serene countryside, mysterious caves, sunlit islands, and creepy graveyards.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="r57eVyONrJo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b1f9ab6ea95258972b8d24eeb6fc72a8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/r57eVyONrJo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Last I spoke to developer Matt Dabrowski it was still getting Native Linux support. But we'll know more closer to release.</p>
<p>From the press release: “I'm super excited to finally reveal gameplay footage for Streets of Rogue 2! It's been a long time coming,” said Matt Dabrowski, creator of the Streets of Rogue franchise. “Streets of Rogue 2 is the culmination of nearly 10 years of ongoing work on the series. It's a truly massive project that frankly makes the original game look like a prototype. I'm looking forward to getting this into everyone's hands via Early Access next year!”</p>
<p>It enters Early Access in 2024. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2165810/Streets_of_Rogue_2/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Nightdive Studios announce Turok 3 and Star Wars: Dark Forces remasters</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems we have even more remasters on the way from Nightdive Studios, as they've now announced both Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion Remastered and Star Wars: Dark Forces Remaster.</p>
<p>For Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion Remastered, this is the first game that will be remastered using the very latest version of the proprietary KEX engine, which Nightdive say "utilizes an improved renderer to achieve a higher tier of visual fidelity across 3D models, textures, and graphical effects".</p>
<p>Here's the trailer for Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion Remastered</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SdCaj5ZRp-A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/be05fd52edc4084021fdc6c1d5b9b7fe.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SdCaj5ZRp-A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A remastered version of the 2000 classic, available for the first time since its Nintendo 64 release</li>
<li>Up to 4K 120FPS performance</li>
<li>Advanced rendering features, including anti-aliasing, bloom, ambient occlusion, dynamic shadows, and motion blur</li>
<li>Remastered environment art, character models, and updated weapon models</li>
<li>Optional Motion/Gyro controls for Nintendo Switch console and Gamepad rumble</li>
<li>Brand new Achievements</li>
</ul>
<p>Next up is Star Wars: Dark Forces Remaster which we have less details on. Nightdive are working in collaboration with Lucasfilm Games and it will be just like the other remasters with the proprietary KEX engine. Star Wars: Dark Forces Remaster supports up to 4K at 120FPS and features advanced 3D rendering, modern gamepad support, trophies and achievements, and more! Trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4b9TTurkH4c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a13bf3598cda5ca0d669be2bade96acb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4b9TTurkH4c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>No release date for either was mentioned.</p>
<p>Of course we won't know what the Linux and Steam Deck compatibility is going to be like until later. However, I will aim to keep you posted. However, KEX engine remasters generally work just fine in Proton just like the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/quake-ii-remastered-shadow-dropped-playable-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">recent Quake II Remastered</a>.</p>

      <title>Sniper Elite 5 now rated Steam Deck Playable with an anti-cheat update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Today Sniper Elite 5 got updated and it seems they upgraded Easy Anti-Cheat from Epic Online Services, including making sure it works on Linux and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>So thanks to that Valve have also as of today given it a Steam Deck Playable rating. As seen on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1029690/history/?changeid=19995387" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, it originally mentioned the unsupported anti-cheat but that's no longer the case. It would be Verified if it didn't have some cases where the in-game text was too small, so hopefully that's something Rebellion can work on next. It also notes the first-time setup needs an active internet connection.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3495862031692717318gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3495862031692717318gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Currently the Steam Deck verification has it pinned to the stable version of Proton (Proton 8.0-3).</p>
<p>Sniper Elite 5 originally launched in May 2022, so it's nice to see continued support for the game and for the developer to ensure it works properly for Steam Deck and Linux desktop players like this. The list of games unplayable on Steam Deck is getting shorter all the time.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/sniper-elite-5?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1029690/Sniper_Elite_5/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 and Half-Life 2 RTX announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Today NVIDIA announced DLSS 3.5 further enhancing Ray Tracing and Half-Life 2 RTX was also announced. So let's go over the details.</p>
<p>Firstly Half-Life 2 RTX is being built by the community. Four top Half-Life 2 modding teams have come together including the people behind Half-Life 2: VR, Half-Life 2: Remade Assets, Project 17, and Raising the Bar: Redux under the banner of Orbifold Studios. They've been given access to the latest RTX Remix and they're rebuilding materials with Physically Based Rendering (PBR) properties, adding extra geometric detail via Valve’s Hammer editor, and leveraging NVIDIA technologies including full ray tracing, DLSS 3, Reflex, and RTX IO.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aM_gzfAMdNs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1e56751632013bf42dd4b7a5800a3a35.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aM_gzfAMdNs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can see a lot more in the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/half-life-2-rtx-remix-in-development/" target="_blank">NVIDIA announcement</a>. The project also has a <a href="https://www.hl2rtx.com/" target="_blank">dedicated website</a>. Like previous RTX remasters, it will probably not have Native Linux support but will be playable with Proton.</p>
<p>The other big one is NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 that NVIDIA say features "Ray Reconstruction, a new AI model that creates higher quality ray-traced images for intensive ray-traced games and apps". It is trained with "5x" more data than DLSS 3, and recognises more ray-traced effects that NVIDIA say allow it to "make smarter decisions about using temporal and spatial data, and to retain high frequency information for superior-quality upscaling". So basically put it's supposed to continue making ray-tracing look better, while also giving you potentially better performance.</p>
<p>You can see an example of it below with Cyberpunk 2077 and below that is a Tech Talk with NVIDIA VP of Applied Deep Learning Research, Bryan Catanzaro:</p>

<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="sGKCrcNsVzo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6ee81d140b17145553dfceb6a6fac147.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/sGKCrcNsVzo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>See more <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/nvidia-dlss-3-5-ray-reconstruction/" target="_blank">about DLSS 3.5 here</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally the previously released Portal with RTX will also be getting an upgrade to use DLSS 3.5 "later this fall", along side an update to the NVIDIA RTX Remix used for it that improves performance and the quality of path tracing for older graphics cards.</p>

      <title>SteamOS 3.5 for Steam Deck gets a screen colour temperature setting</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A while ago I mentioned (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyAmFvLdYbg" target="_blank">in a video</a>) how the upcoming SteamOS 3.5 for Steam Deck added in a colour vibrance setting, and now Valve seems to have expanded it even further with a screen colour temperature setting as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2211544441692700547gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2211544441692700547gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Here's a look at the difference between the default 7500K colour temperature and then turning it up to 11000K, with colour vibrance at default:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14662815541692701588gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14662815541692701588gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12506157311692701597gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12506157311692701597gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You can see the difference very clearly in the second picture where it's turned up, look at the difference in the blues.</p>
<p>This is currently available in the Main + Steam Deck Beta update channels, which you'll see if you turned on Developer Mode, and then select to see the Advanced Update Channels in the Developer menu in settings. I would firmly advise <strong>against</strong> this though, as it's updated often and can be full of big bugs (there's a reason it's hidden). Stick with the normal Steam Deck Stable / Beta.</p>
<p>SteamOS 3.5 is sounding quite exciting now, hopefully it's not too much longer until it's released.</p>

      <title>JSAUX launch a Steam Deck Anti-Glare screen replacement</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While we have <a href="https://www.deckhd.com/" target="_blank">DeckHD</a> launching their higher-resolution Steam Deck screen replacement, we also now have <a href="https://jsaux.com/products/anti-glare-screen-for-steam-deck-gp0300" target="_blank">JSAUX</a> who have launched their own Steam Deck Anti-Glare screen replacement.</p>
<p>Unlike DeckHD, the team at JSAUX decided to stick with the normal 800p Steam Deck resolution. The only minor difference is that JSAUX claim their screen has 70% sRGB coverage versus 67% on the original. Could be a good little upgrade mod for anyone with a 64GB or 256GB Steam Deck to get the anti-glare screen.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3791624981692699558gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3791624981692699558gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>A difficult mod to do though, that requires taking the entire Steam Deck apart. Not something beginners should think about, as a lot of small things can go wrong that could end up becoming a big expense. Even the JSAUX store page has a warning on this (nice to see).</p>
<p>Still, it's nice to continue to see more and more hardware mods appearing for the Steam Deck because of how open it is.</p>
<p>Available for $89.99 via <a href="https://jsaux.com/products/anti-glare-screen-for-steam-deck-gp0300" target="_blank">JSAUX</a>.</p>

      <title>Roblox support is coming back to Wine on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news for Roblox fans, as the game will soon start working in Wine again as the developers have been working to update it since the big breakage with the new client.</p>
<p>A few days ago on their developer forum, one of their staff members <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/why-did-roblox-stop-supporting-linux-users/2444335/61?u=sirsquiddybob" target="_blank">replied</a> (you have to be signed in to read) noting "shoutout to the Grapejuice community - this one is for you". <em>Grapejuice being a tool that configures Wine and Roblox together. </em>The staff member also included a screenshot of Roblox running on Manjaro Linux:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9904814361692696327gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9904814361692696327gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Roblox has multiple version channels, and it seems you're actually able to play it right now with Wine on the "zintegration" or "zcanary" channel. Although you should really wait until it rolls out properly, because switching around channels can cause all sorts of <strong>issues</strong> (like getting stuck on a particular channel) because it's all in <em>testing</em>.</p>
<p>That same staff member did also <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/why-did-roblox-stop-supporting-linux-users/2444335/100?u=sirsquiddybob" target="_blank">note</a> that "There will be an official announcement regarding unofficial support for Wine. As for an ETA, let’s just say soon™."</p>
<p>Just for science, testing it myself it does indeed work again when testing using the zcanary channel with the <a href="https://flathub.org/en-GB/apps/io.github.vinegarhq.Vinegar" target="_blank">Vinegar</a> wrapper for Roblox and Wine:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8422098541692697297gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8422098541692697297gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - BIG Paintball in Roblox on Kubuntu</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11939633871692697513gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11939633871692697513gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Pet Simulator in Roblox on Kubuntu</em></p>
<p>If you <em>really</em> want to try it out, again I <strong>wouldn't</strong> suggest so (really just wait until it hits stable Roblox), but it is possible if you use Vinegar linked above. You will need to switch it over to the zcanary update branch and use Vulkan, which you can do via this in terminal:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">mkdir -p ~/.var/app/io.github.vinegarhq.Vinegar/config/vinegar/ &amp;&amp; { echo "[player]"; echo "dxvk = false"; echo "renderer = \"Vulkan\""; echo "channel = \"zcanary\""; } &gt;&gt; ~/.var/app/io.github.vinegarhq.Vinegar/config/vinegar/config.toml</code></p>
<p>After that you'll be able to just login on the website, and run games or use the Vinegar Roblox App it gives you.</p>

      <title>5 years ago Valve released Proton forever changing Linux gaming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Has it really been that long? Apparently so. Valve originally announced their <em>rebranding</em> of Steam Play with Proton back on August 21st, 2018. Seems like a good time for a quick reflection being halfway to a decade old now.</p>
<p>The problem: before, during and just after the original Steam Machine push developers just weren't porting many games to Linux, and on the whole really when you look back Linux gaming was in a period of mostly stagnation. Nothing much was happening. A lot of the early porting work that came along was slowly dying off since the Steam Machines didn't provide the boost Valve and Linux gamers were hoping for. </p>
<p>Originally, “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190204114909/https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=9439-QHKN-1308" target="_blank">Steam Play</a>” simply meant you could buy a game on Steam and get access to all versions of it. So if you purchased a game on Windows, you could play it on Linux if it had a Native Linux version (same again for macOS). Clearly though, that wasn't enough for what Valve had planned. So if Valve wanted to make Linux a <em>better</em> platform for people to actually use it, they needed <em>something</em> more.</p>
<p>Popular games needed to be able to run on Linux if more people were to use it, because what good is a platform for gaming if tons of the most played games weren’t compatible? As Valve saw with the Steam Machines (not the only reason of course) it doesn’t end well.</p>
<p>I remember being sat in my office at the time, going over my TODO list of various articles and games to cover, planning the week ahead. Ready to then probably go to bed and then <em>BAM</em> — out of nowhere this <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/221410/announcements/detail/1696055855739350561" target="_blank">announcement</a> comes along from Valve that basically said <em>“you're going to be hella busy, better get a lot of coffee”. </em>Valve had partnered up with <a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/" target="_blank">CodeWeavers</a> and <strong>Proton</strong> was the answer. </p>
<p>Proton being the name Valve gave to their fork of <a href="https://www.winehq.org/" target="_blank">Wine</a> with a bunch of added extras, and it has changed Linux gaming forever. Steam Play is more than just Proton though, be sure to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">read my full Steam Play Proton guide</a>. <em>Side-note: John Carmack (id Software / Oculus VR / Keen Technologies) even thought Wine was the solution</em><a href="https://twitter.com/id_aa_carmack/status/298628243630723074" target="_blank"><em> </em><em>back in 2013</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>Of course Proton wouldn't have been possible without all the many years of work that went into the Wine project in the first place, and everyone who contributed to Wine should be applauded for their effort. Valve has funded a lot of extra work though to get things like<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk" target="_blank"> DXVK</a> and<a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton" target="_blank"> VKD3D-Proton</a> for the translation from Direct3D to Vulkan into a state where performance can be really great! <em>Valve also funds work on Linux graphics drivers, Linux kernel work and the list goes on.</em></p>
<p>Just how much has Proton changed things though? Well, we certainly <em>wouldn't</em> have the Steam Deck if it wasn't for Proton. There's no way Valve would have released their handheld without as many games as possible, clearly learning their lesson on the failure of the Steam Machines. But as we all know, the Steam Machines burned so Proton and the Steam Deck could rise from the ashes.</p>
<p>Proton just makes a <em>lot</em> of sense. It didn't take long for Valve to expand Proton to go initially from a few select Valve-approved titles, to being able to run anything we choose to try with it. From there, Linux gaming just seemingly <em>exploded</em>. And then eventually we saw <em>why</em> Valve made Proton with the Steam Deck announcement coming less than three years later in July 2021.</p>
<p>When you look at the crowd-sourced reports on<a href="https://www.protondb.com/" target="_blank"> ProtonDB</a> over 11,000 titles are reported to work by multiple people. It's a small fraction of Steam's overall game count but ProtonDB relies on people actually going and writing a report.</p>
<p>Valve's own Deck Verified rating system <em>just</em> for the Steam Deck hit plenty of milestones since the Steam Deck's release too, now having over<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/steam-deck-hits-over-10000-verified-and-playable-games/" target="_blank"> 10,000 titles rated to be Playable or Verified</a>. Although both ProtonDB and Deck Verified include a mixture of Native Linux releases and Windows games run with Proton. The <em>point</em> is - being on Linux now for a gamer means quite often a huge amount of your games do actually "just work". It's <em>almost</em> magical.</p>
<p>The real number of games playable on Linux will never be truly known though, because on Steam there's many tens of thousands of games and a lot of them will likely "just work" with Proton if they don’t have a Native Linux build available…and many more are releasing every week. This is a truly incredible place to be in. When you think about Linux and Steam Deck together having <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/linux-overtakes-macos-users-on-steam-thanks-to-steam-deck/" target="_blank">just less than a 2%</a> user share on Steam overall — these are some insane numbers for game compatibility for a niche platform.</p>
<p>Thanks to Proton, I've been able to discover a <em>ton</em> of new favourite games, some I would never have played before. Games like Deep Rock Galactic, God of War, Death Stranding, Baldur’s Gate 3, Brotato, Beat Saber and so on. You get the idea, there’s a truly ridiculous selection of games available and at times it’s a little <em>paralysing</em> scrolling through my Steam Library deciding what to play — a delightfully annoying problem to have huh?</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18291519851692554532gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18291519851692554532gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured - Baldur's Gate 3, shot taken on Kubuntu</em></p>
<p>Gamers using Linux (be it desktop or Steam Deck) in 2023 are now in a place where they can get <strong>excited</strong> alongside friends who use Windows or traditional consoles, because they know there's a good probable chance at release that whatever new exciting game coming out will work without much trouble.</p>
<p>Proton is far from perfect though and it does mean in a few ways that Valve, CodeWeavers and everyone else working on it are playing catch-up with Microsoft on compatibility and whatever changes Microsoft suddenly decides to announce that affects gaming. That, and how many different ways game developers can abuse various APIs to do things in weird ways. Valve and co are a dedicated bunch though, <em>constantly</em> fixing up issues from AAA games like<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/proton-experimental-beta-gets-steam-deck-performance-fix-for-elden-ring/" target="_blank"> ELDEN RING</a> where Valve quickly worked to implement optimizations, same again for problems with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/valve-fix-dead-space-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Dead Space</a> to the likes of<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/07/codeweavers-blog-about-their-linux-steam-deck-work-on-proton-with-pooshooter/" target="_blank"> PooShooter: Toilet Invaders</a> (what a fun highlight that was eh?). There's also the constant third-party launcher breakage, that Valve are also fixing up each time it happens.</p>
<p>Valve produce updates to Proton <em>constantly</em> to improve compatibility, with over 300 revisions to the main <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">changelog</a> (although some a minor text corrections) it's clear to see how much work goes into it. With various new main versions of Proton through 4, 5, 6, 7 now onto 8 and multiple updates to Proton Experimental almost <em>every</em> month.</p>
<p>So here's to Proton, the magnificent tech that allows playing all kinds of games across Linux systems from desktop to Steam Deck and wherever else you decide to stick Linux. Nice one Valve. Cheers.</p>

<p>Using the usual rating system of Deck Verified, <a href="http://protondb.com/" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> and Native Linux notes to save you clicking around. Each game title is also a Steam link in case you need more info first. It's $7.99 / €7.99 / £7.99 for the full bundle this time.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 8-13 and 8-12 released, FSR no longer default and many game fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The community maintained GE-Proton has two new releases available, so here's what's changed and improved with the latest versions. This is the version of Proton <em>not</em> supported by Valve, so it may have issues at times the official Proton does not. However, it also at times pulls in fixes a bit quicker and can do things sometimes that Valve cannot do. To sum up: use it if you need it for specific games, otherwise sticking with the official Proton is the best idea. More about Proton can be found in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">my Proton beginner's guide</a>.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton8-12" target="_blank">GE-Proton 8-12</a> they've now disabled FSR by default. It's still there but you'll once again need to use Steam launch options like WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR=1 to set it as they found using it actually limits in-game resolutions in some games.</p>
<p>There's also patches and fixes for these games:</p>
<ul>
<li>Farlight 84.</li>
<li>Guilty Gear Xrd.</li>
<li>Escape from Monkey Island.</li>
<li>Memento Mori.</li>
<li>Titanfall with northstar.</li>
<li>DCS World steam edition.</li>
<li>Assetto Corsa.</li>
<li>Persona 5 Strikers.</li>
<li>Shin Megami Tensei III Nocturne HD Remaster.</li>
<li>Tex Murphy: Overseer.</li>
<li>Alternativa.</li>
<li>The Big Secret of a Small Town.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus other back-end work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Import upstream proton fixes.</li>
<li>Updated wine bleeding edge.</li>
<li>Updated dxvk git.</li>
<li>Updated vkd3d-proton git.</li>
</ul>
<p>While <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton8-13" target="_blank">GE-Proton 8-13</a> was a hotfix to clean up other issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>steam helper MR <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/pull/6555" target="_blank">ValveSoftware#6555</a> re-added and updated. Allows -northstar to work with Titanfall 2 while not breaking other games that use bash script launchers. This also allows other launch options to be used alongside -northstar option, regardless of arguement ordering (ie -northstar -novid, or -novid -northstar). This MR also allows launch options to be used with EA games (link2ea commands).</li>
<li>Updated Titanfall 2 protonfix to restore original Titanfall2.exe if NorthstarLauncher.exe symlink was previously used. (the -northstar option does not use/need NorthstarLauncher.exe, it works instead via wsock32 override).</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Text Guide to install GE-Proton:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Download
<ul>
<li><u>Desktop</u>: head to the <a href="https://davidotek.github.io/protonup-qt/" target="_blank">official website</a>, scroll down and pick your favourite download option either AppImage or <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/net.davidotek.pupgui2" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.</li>
<li><u>Steam Deck</u>: simply download ProtonUp-Qt from Discover in Desktop Mode (Steam Button -&gt; Power - Switch to Desktop).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Load ProtonUp-Qt.</li>
<li>Make sure it's set to Steam at the top and select to install GE-Proton.</li>
<li>Reload Steam to update the compatibility layer list.</li>
<li>In Steam:
<ul>
<li><u>Desktop</u>: right click a game and go to Properties.</li>

</ul>
</li>

      <title>Dwarf Fortress gets a Linux Beta on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready to dig deep? Dwarf Fortress now has a Linux Beta available on Steam, so you can get testing and see what all the fuss is about with this new version. While it was already playable with Proton, we knew for a while that Bay 12 Games planned Native Linux support as well.</p>
<p>As they said in the Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/3660916710568153375" target="_blank">announcement</a> "The Linux version is almost ready, and in about two weeks we will be looking for beta testers, after Tarn gets back from Germany... in fact, it's already on the Public Beta Branch!" — so even though technically right now they're not looking for testers they put it up for you anyway.</p>
<p>Simply opt into the main Beta for it on Steam and you'll be able to play and test it. However, if you find you can't get it because it keeps using Proton, you can select the Steam Linux Runtime from the Compatibility menu which will then make sure it grabs the Linux version.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18209411421692612541gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18209411421692612541gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12872830061692612543gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12872830061692612543gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Shots taken from the Linux Beta.</em></p>
<p>So far so good it's all working as expected, although the game still intimidates the heck out of me.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>ARMORED CORE VI FIRES OF RUBICON rated Steam Deck Playable ahead of release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ARMORED CORE VI FIRES OF RUBICON is a seriously exciting upcoming release from the ELDEN RING developer FromSoftware. Seems it will run well enough on Steam Deck at release!</p>
<p>Valve gave it a Steam Deck Playable rating with Proton 8.0-3 on August 12th, with the rating just now going live. It's Playable and not Verified due to it having some in-game text that might be too small. Hopefully this is something that FromSoftware will address, because it's an annoying reoccurring issue even on desktop some games text is just tiny.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14225332651692462200gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14225332651692462200gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>As a huge fan of games and media with big mechs, ARMORED CORE VI FIRES OF RUBICON is something I'm going to be taking a look at for sure. So I'll be letting you know if it runs properly on desktop Linux and Steam Deck just after release.</p>
<p>You can pre-order on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/armored-core-vi-fires-of-rubicon?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1888160/ARMORED_CORE_VI_FIRES_OF_RUBICON/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>ARMORED CORE VI releases August 24th at 10PM UTC for the Steam release.</p>
<p>They also recently did an official showcase you can view below:</p>

      <title>Linux players getting banned on Apex Legends again</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As a little PSA word of warning, it seems EA / Respawn have begun another little ban wave or they've tweaked something in their anti-cheat that Linux / Steam Deck players are getting caught in for Apex Legends.</p>
<p>This issue happened <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/apex-legends-banning-linux-players-steam-deck/" target="_blank">back in late February into early March</a> this year, with a mixture of mostly desktop Linux players with a few who played on Steam Deck getting banned from Apex Legends. EA eventually overturned the bans, but it seems it has begun happening once again.</p>
<p>Various reports have begun appearing across Reddit and a <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/Technical-Issues/Linux-Users-Getting-Banned-second-time/td-p/12857565" target="_blank">fresh post on the EA Forum</a> with users detailing their bans.</p>
<p>Apex Legends is currently Steam Deck Verified and their Easy Anti-Cheat is supposed to be supported on Linux, so hopefully the bans will once again be overturned. </p>
<p>When you play games with anti-cheat regardless of the support status on Steam Deck and desktop Linux, there's always the chance even if you're a legitimate player that you'll somehow get caught up in a ban wave after doing nothing wrong. False positives are a thing that just happens — sadly. Linux isn't alone is this, various games on Windows over the years have had the same issue it just comes with the territory of online gaming.</p>
<p>If we get any updates on this the article will be updated. Feel free to <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" target="_blank">jump into our Discord</a> to get regular updates.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Update: 21/08/23 10:54 UTC</strong> - EA support have been replying to lots of the people banned, simply stating the ban is sticking. The emails being sent seem to be pretty standard: "We got your note and did a full investigation of your account. After reviewing your case, we determined that we took the correct action in accordance with EA policies and procedures.".</p>
<p>They've also merged the original and new forum posts into one and the amount of people mentioning they've been banned continues to grow. I've reached out to EA Press for a statement and info on what's going on.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Update: 22/08/23 12:53 UTC</strong> - People have been asking EA to look again at their bans, and EA simply email back saying:</p>
<p>"We have received your most recent correspondence expressing concerns about the action that was taken on your account.</p>
<p>After thoroughly investigating your account and concern, we again found that we actioned your account correctly after it was found to have violated our User Agreement. We will also be unable to provide any details regarding our internal procedures.</p>
<p>Due to this violation, we will not remove the sanction that was applied to your account.</p>
<p>You can review the full User Agreement at http://tos.ea.com/legalapp/WEBTERMS/US/en/PC/</p>
<p>After completing two full investigations into your complaint, we consider this matter closed."</p>
<p><em>EA have not yet replied to my email for a statement on it and the bans continue happening. I've sent an email to a different EA contact today to try and pry a statement from EA on this.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Update: 23/08/23 11:04 UTC</strong> - A Respawn team member mentioned on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/15xej2p/comment/jxalscl/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank">Reddit</a> that "The team is investigating this and we appreciate the continued reports in the forums as it gives us added details to work with.". EA still didn't reply to my emails.</p>

      <title>No Man’s Sky has a teaser for the &#39;Echoes&#39; update to celebrate 7 years</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Coming soon they say, a fresh big update to No Man's Sky is on the way and they're celebrating 7 years since the release with a new video. Teasing the ECHOES update, the trailer doesn't really give any proper hints as to what it will be, as it's going over the 7 year free update cycle.</p>
<p>This is a true redemption story! At one point the Steam review score hit Overwhelmingly Negative, but now it's looking much better. Although it's still only on Mostly Positive overall right now. But uh, when you see Negative user reviews of "doesn't have fishing" — the score is not <em>always</em> to be trusted without a pinch of salt eh?</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Mj_TLfNmSQY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/999ac5d6c1aa23a32615410e91515060.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Mj_TLfNmSQY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Are you excited about another update? I keep telling myself I'm going to jump in and finally go all the way through, as I absolutely love space sci-fi and the many hours I've already spent across previous updates were quite fun.</p>
<p>No Man's Sky is playable on Linux with Proton and it's Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/no-mans-sky?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>No sound in War Thunder on Linux? Here&#39;s a potential solution</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>War Thunder is a game I enjoy playing with friends quite a lot, and after recently Linux distro hopping from Fedora to openSUSE and then back to the safety of Kubuntu - my sound in War Thunder wouldn't work. But I have a potential solution for you that worked for me.</p>
<p>It's odd, because I've never actually seen this problem before. When loading into it today, there was no sound and the game's own sound settings claimed there was "NoSound Driver". Confusing, but after a little bit of Googling around, I thankfully found this is an issue others have encountered.</p>
<p>For starters, you likely need the "pipewire-pulse" package installed if you're on PipeWire, and then you can just use this as a Steam launch option for the game (Right click -&gt; Properties -&gt; Launch Options):</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">FMOD_ALSA_DEVICE=pulse %command%</code></p>
<p>Solution found thanks to a War Thunder technical mod in <a href="https://old-forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/573331-no-sound-in-game-noaudio-driver-arch-linux/&amp;tab=comments#comment-9557502" target="_blank">this post</a> on the <em>old</em> official forum where someone had the same issue on EndeavourOS. I've repeatedly tested it and it fixes it without fail every time. I thought it might be worth sharing in case any other War Thunder fans suddenly face the same issue. Hope it helps. Happy thundering.</p>
<p>War Thunder has Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified. Play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/236390/War_Thunder/" target="_blank">free on Steam</a>.</p>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The new help article is a nice touch, and seems like it makes SteamVR just a bit more officially supported by Valve on Linux with some proper instructions on where it will actually work. The new article makes it clear that SteamVR does not support the Steam Snap and Flatpak packages as they "break both DRM leasing and asynchronous reprojection".</p>
<p>For NVIDIA you need driver 525 or higher, AMD / Intel need Mesa 22.0 and AMDVLK and the AMDGPU-Pro proprietary drivers are not supported. Since SteamVR on Linux requires Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) leasing this is the list of where Valve say it's compatible right now:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>All X11 Window Managers and Compositors</li>
<li>KDE Plasma Wayland</li>
<li>Most wlroots based compositors:
<ul>
<li>Sway</li>
<li>LabWC</li>
<li>Hyprland</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As we know from many leaks, Valve are working on something code-named Deckard which seems to be a new VR headset that will support a standalone mode and be powered by Linux, so it makes sense to ensure SteamVR works properly for when it eventually releases.</p>
<p>How have you been getting on with VR on Linux? I've just re-done my setup today with my AMD GPU (6800 XT), and despite a few niggles it now runs Beat Saber very nicely once again.</p>

      <title>OBS Studio 30.0 Beta 1 released supporting Intel QSV on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The free and open source video recording and livestreaming app OBS Studio is readying up another release, with OBS Studio 30.0 Beta 1 now available for testing.</p>
<p>You will also find the system requirements will be different with this release removing support for Ubuntu 20.04, Qt 5, and FFmpeg versions prior to 4.4. I'm especially interested to see this new YouTube Live Control Panel, for whenever I do a livestream as it sounds quite useful - although I've been unable to test this version as their .deb file provided doesn't seem to find the dependencies needed on Ubuntu 23.04.</p>
<p>In this version the new main additions are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added WHIP/WebRTC output.
<ul>
<li>With the introduction of WHIP, FTL is slated for removal in a release after May 2024.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Redesigned the status bar. 
<ul>
<li>The redesigned status bar now provides the same information in a more organized and well structured way, with more representative and recognizable icons.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added option for Full-Height docks to the "View" menu. 
<ul>
<li>When enabled, a dock such as chat can take up the entire height of the OBS window.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added support Intel QSV on Linux.</li>
<li>Added a shader cache to improve OBS startup time on Windows.</li>
<li>Added application audio capture on macOS.</li>
<li>Added a "Safe Mode" that runs OBS without third-party plugins, scripting, and websockets. 
<ul>
<li>When OBS detects that it was not shut down properly it will offer the user the option to launch in Safe Mode for troubleshooting purposes. It can also be manually activated via the "Help" menu.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reworked the virtual camera on macOS to work with all applications (on macOS 13 and newer).</li>
<li>Added a YouTube Live Control Panel when streaming to YouTube.</li>
<li>Added 10-bit capture support for Decklink devices.</li>
<li>Added HDR playback support for Decklink output.</li>
<li>Added an option to hide OBS windows from macOS Screen Capture's "Display Capture".</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Main Changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Changed audio/video encoder dropdowns to be sorted by name.</li>
<li>Changed the list of applications in the macOS Screen Capture source to be sorted by name.</li>
<li>Added more accurate logging for Hardware Accelerated GPU Scheduling status and support.</li>
<li>Added the ability to arrange filters via drag &amp; drop.</li>
<li>Enabled GPU scaling for "Rescale Output" when possible.</li>
<li>Clarified surround sound warning for YouTube 5.1 audio support.</li>
<li>Added warning if Lenovo Vantage is installed.</li>
<li>Added logging for scene changes in Studio Mode. </li>
<li>Changed Video Capture Device sources on Windows to not show an audio device in the Audio Mixer if none is available/selected.</li>
<li>Added support for grayscale MJPEG in V4L / DirectShow sources. </li>
<li>Improved settings interface of the "Text (FreeType 2)" source.</li>
<li>Added button to reactivate stopped capture in macOS Screen Capture.</li>
<li>Changed scene collection removal to retain a backup file (.bak) that can be easily reimported if needed.</li>
<li>Added IPv6 support for RTMP streaming output with IPv4 fallback ("happy eyeballs") for dual-stack streaming services. The preferred protocol can still be selected in advanced settings. </li>
<li>Fixed virtual camera output when used with additional output channels (e.g., Downstream Keyer plugin).</li>
<li>Added ability to set FFmpeg Options for VAAPI.</li>
<li>Added a Help menu item to view the Release Notes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus there's plenty of the usual bug fixes too.</p>

<p>It's not available yet as it seems the store page only went live recently and it will be priced around £597, with it currently noting a discount to £416 (presumably for early orders when it is actually live to order). The keyboard is an added extra at £84 available in various layouts.</p>

      <title>Recent NVIDIA drivers are causing issues for Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have you been seeing some problems with the NVIDIA 535 driver series when trying to run Steam games on Linux with Proton? Well, you're not alone but investigations are under way. Here's what's happening.</p>
<p>Back in June there was a report on the Proton <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6859#issue-1762053811" target="_blank">GitHub</a> where a user noticed how Proton 8 and Proton Experimental were unable to create a new prefix. A prefix being the special directory set up by Proton, where it stores all the expected Windows files each game needs to run. Quite a few comments have confirmed it, including developers working on Proton. </p>
<p>The issue is an odd one, because even if you're on an AMD GPU and happen to have some NVIDIA driver bits installed (say from moving from an NVIDIA GPU to an AMD GPU), the issue can <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6859#issuecomment-1642455583" target="_blank">still</a> happen. The set up gets stalled on DXSETUP and just won't go any further.</p>
<p>On the GitHub issue report a Proton developer just recently <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6859#issuecomment-1682357594" target="_blank">mentioned this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good news - there's some progress. The issue seems to be due to address space exhaustion. DXSETUP is a 32 bit process and it can address 4G of memory. Nvidia's driver starting with 535 seem to be a bit more heavy than the previous series. While the bump is not colossal it's enough to make things crash. Nvidia is aware of this.</p>
<p><strong>One thing that should help with the issue is uninstalling all the other Vulkan drivers that are not in use. So if you are on Nvidia uninstall all things Mesa, including extra Vulkan layers, and vice versa.</strong> Otherwise they are all loaded using the precious address space.</p>
<p>That said I'm looking into where the memory goes in places we have control over it and why DXSETUP is this pathological.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems like if you have the issue you <em>may</em> be able to use Proton 7 initially to try to run a game (even if it won't work in Proton 7) and then swap over to Proton 8 or Proton Experimental.</p>

      <title>Vampire Survivors co-op and new game engine upgrade is live</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The game that started off a sudden craze and lots of clones, Vampire Survivors 1.6 is out now adding in local co-op along with moving over to the Unity game engine.</p>
<p>Looks like they've also made their Linux build official now too, with you not needing any Beta and their release notes mentioned fixing up Linux launch issues and Steam Overlay problems. I can confirm it does indeed run the Linux version on desktop now and quite nicely too. Thanks to the move to Unity, the performance on Steam Deck is many times better too making it an actually Verified experience.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Ei78IfoD2yI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f010b7d2399de59bea81a0087d615083.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Ei78IfoD2yI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The main additions:</p>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>v1.6 New Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added local co-op mode!</li>
<li>Added "Disable Blood" option.</li>
<li>Added "Pixel Font" option.</li>
<li>Added "Border Type" option.</li>
<li>Added Twitch integration (Steam only).</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Local Co-op Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added Friendship Amulet.</li>
<li>Added extra options for co-op:
<ul>
<li>Player colour selection.</li>
<li>Player outlines toggle.</li>
<li>Player indicators toggle.</li>
<li>UI Selection tint toggle.</li>
<li>Controller/Keyboard assignment toggle.</li>
<li>Sequential chest mode toggle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added support for Steam Remote Play Together.</li>
</ul>
<p>Full changelog <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1794680/view/3678929839479077754" target="_blank">can be found here</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to the port over to Unity, they will also now be going back to work on bigger features. Just don't expect lots of little updates like before, since it's a much larger game project now. They said larger features were getting "borderline impossible" to develop with their old game engine.</p>
<p>Linking into the above they also mentioned a teaser of future content to come that can be seen in the below video. As they said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Did you see any of the "Directer's Cut" footage online?<br/>
That's something we've been doing in most events (since TGS 2022): hiding some of the future content for the game in plain sight, but this time it blew up online! While the actual menu screen might never appear in game, all the new content shown in that version is scheduled to be fully developed and released in future free updates.<br/>
So here's a sneak peak of a handful among the dozens of characters and weapons that are getting developed for 2023 and beyond:</p>

      <title>Modern text adventure &#39;I doesn&#39;t exist&#39; releasing September 12th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Inspired by the likes of The Beginner's Guide, Stories Untold, Buddy Simulator, and Zork — [I] doesn't exist is a love letter to the origins of narrative-focused gaming and levels up the text adventure genre through the use of conversational text recognition, beautiful, surreal pixel art, and unconventional, intrapersonal themes.</p>
<p>Making use of AI for natural language processing, you won't need to learn a bunch of annoying commands, making it a proper modern text adventure that should understand what you're trying to tell it. The publisher and developer were keen to point out the entire narrative is human-made too, no AI generation for that.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="91PdAe-n5VA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1b0dc573cfbc934ae364ca5d632d4915.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/91PdAe-n5VA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From what they said about it: "[I] doesn’t exist utilizes a combination of 2D and 3D perspective through optical illusion, giving players a trippy, dreamlike experience. The game’s trance-like visuals and text-based narrative design, supported by modern "Natural Language Processing" technology — which allows players to creatively answer in-game prompts without sticking to a set of specific terms, makes for an eerily intuitive gameplay experience that’s accessible to newbies and text-adventure veterans alike. "</p>
<p>Seems like quite an interesting one here, love the overall design and what they've done with the setting. At release it will have Native Linux support.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1943420/I_doesnt_exist__a_modern_text_adventure/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Paradox Interactive acquires Across the Obelisk, plus new expansion released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After initially being under the Paradox Arc publishing arm, it seems Across the Obelisk has done well enough for Paradox Interactive directly to want it - so they acquired it. The game has managed to sell over 350,000 copies now too.</p>
<p>Across the Obelisk is a dynamic deckbuilding rogue-lite RPG that challenges you to create a party from a diverse set of characters, engage in tactical card-based combat, and find a unique path across a world that changes in reaction to your decisions. You can play it in solo or with up to three friends online with each playthrough being different thanks to branching paths, customizable heroes, hundreds of cards with upgrades and more.</p>
<p>Out now is also a brand new DLC:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yBrGc7PjE8k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9fefd2809e51a77cdffb3f75e8d328cf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yBrGc7PjE8k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The new DLC includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two new Aura and Curse mechanics called Scourge and Zeal.</li>
<li>Three new pets to be unlocked.</li>
<li>A multi-layered dungeon in the pyramids of Ulminin.</li>
<li>More than 20 new enemies.</li>
<li>3 new bosses.</li>
<li>More than 30 new items.</li>
<li>An all-new scarab mechanic where scarabs will randomly appear during combat and give bonuses if you manage to defeat them!</li>
<li>And more.</li>
</ul>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“Paradox Arc's mission is to find the Paradox games of tomorrow; games that are deep, endlessly replayable and resonate with the Paradox Interactive audience. In that regard, Across the Obelisk checks all the boxes,” said Sebastian Forsström, Head of Paradox Arc at Paradox Interactive. “The Arc initiative starts with the support that small development teams need to bring their games to market, but the potential for breakout success is always something we look for as well. It’s a perfect story Arc, pun intended, to see our very first Paradox Arc game reach this level of success, and I’m looking forward to seeing what the game can achieve next.”</p>
<p>Across the Obelisk has Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Playable.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/across-the-obelisk?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1385380/Across_the_Obelisk/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

You also get dedicated support since CrossOver itself is commercial software at £60 for one year of support and updates or £414 to get support and updates for life. Right now you can also use code "<a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/store?deal=LEVELUP23" target="_blank">LEVELUP23</a>" to get 23% off the yearly CrossOver (not the for-life plan) until August 31st. They also offer a free trial.</p>

<li>Update to Wine Mono 7.4.</li>
<li>Update to vkd3d 1.8.</li>
<li>Update to DXVK 1.10.3.</li>
<li>Support for EA App (including many EA games like The Sims 4, Titanfall 2, Mass Effect Legendary Edition etc).</li>
<li>Ability to uninstall applications.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>macOS:
<ul>
<li>Initial support for DirectX 12 games, including Diablo II: Resurrected and Diablo IV.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Linux:
<ul>
<li>Office 365 support on Wayland.</li>
<li>Support for Diablo IV.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They even have a fancy trailer for this release to pump up their marketing a bit:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wtHJ3TReI-4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/71b70abe2e80ee5d4405c43be4b5af25.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wtHJ3TReI-4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Any readers currently using CrossOver? Let us know what you think in the comments. It's been a long time since I personally used it with so many other tools available but I love to see the progress on it and this update does sound rather great.</p>

      <title>Nintendo Switch emulator yuzu gets lots of optimizations, fixes for Pikmin 4</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The team working on the Nintendo Switch emulator yuzu have another progress report up, and as usual it's looking mighty fine so here's a little run over what they've done recently.</p>
<p>For starters their work to improve games using Unreal Engine 4 continues, especially since the recent release of Pikmin 4 back in July. This includes fixing up a recent regression which caused big stability problems on NVIDIA GPUs. Plus they upped the total number of texture buffers from 16 to 32 preventing a bunch of UE4 games crashing like Master Detective Archives: RAIN CODE.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/707804271692269480gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/707804271692269480gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Pikmin 4</em></p>
<p>They're also overhauling per-game configuration, with plans to allow you to use game-specific configurations from the community. This is a pretty big thing and will be helpful so people don't always have to tweak many different settings, you'll just be able to grab one and apply it for whatever game you want. While planning this they also did a rewrite of their entire settings back-end and improved <em>many</em> parts of the settings UI.</p>
<p>Plenty of optimizations on top of optimizations were done too. With their latest changes they managed a "nearly" 10% performance boost in parts of Super Mario Odyssey and Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition. Plus Splatoon 3 saw shader compile time improvements reducing the slowest from 30 seconds to about 4 seconds.</p>
<p>Other changes include continued reverse engineering of the Switch NFC service, button mapping improvements so SDL properly uses the native A/B and X/Y mapping of Nintendo devices, upgrades to their Linux build script to enable Wayland support in their AppImage releases, a bug fix preventing games with non-ASCII titles to crash on Linux, a big memory leak fix in the Discord Rich Presence code was solved and more bug fixes.</p>

      <title>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart update includes a fix for Linux gamers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart released back in late July and Insomniac Games / Nixxes Software have released another patch for it, which includes a fix for Linux gamers.</p>
<p>Even though it doesn't have official Linux support, it is fully playable with Proton and it is Steam Deck Verified. You don't often see dedicated fixes for Linux for bigger games like this, so it's pretty nice to see and continues to show how things are changing (thanks to all the effort from Valve).</p>
<p>From the v1.815.0.0 patch notes: </p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Resolved a crash on start-up that could occur on Linux systems or configurations where NVIDIA Streamline is not active.</li>
<li>Fixed an incorrect prompt display for the Chain Select option at Mrs. Zurkon when using an Xbox controller.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that could cause a visual jitter effect on water bodies and puddles.</li>
<li>Various user interface improvements and bug fixes for Photo Mode and other in-game menus and popups.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="jeoad16CkSo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/182e33f3b420f8887e973420b7f5130b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/jeoad16CkSo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On Steam it has gained a Very Positive user review score, so it seems like Nixxes did some great work on the Windows PC port once again like they did with Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered and Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales. Seems like a pretty quiet Steam release though overall with only 8,757 players for an all-time peak and only just over 3,000 user reviews.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/ratchet-clank-rift-apart?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1895880/Ratchet__Clank_Rift_Apart/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="MXJRU-JsHmM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e60edc4157d939249dc2e24fbbfbad92.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/MXJRU-JsHmM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

      <title>Tempest Rising brings back memories of Command &amp; Conquer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tempest Rising is an upcoming base-building RTS from Slipgate Ironworks and 2B Games with publishing via THQ Nordic and 3D Realms and a first playable preview is out with the first GDF mission.</p>
<p>Playable on desktop Linux with Proton Experimental, the experience was close to flawless. Which is massively exciting to me after growing up playing Dune 2, Command &amp; Conquer, Red Alert and the later games. Tempest Rising is unabashedly taking a ton of inspiration from Command &amp; Conquer but it's all a bit more modern looking and feeling.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uEV3S80M9RE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d8bd630b4a48107544884389ac3ed923.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uEV3S80M9RE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On my desktop with Kubuntu, Ryzen 5800x and Radeon RX 6800 XT it worked great. Well above 60FPS at 2560x1440 resolution on the highest settings. The only slight issue I saw was the commander in the mission intro video lip syncing being clearly off with the speech, which is not clear if it's a game issue or a Proton issue.</p>
<p>If you're like me and love your RTS games though, it seems like this is one to keep a close eye on and you can try the initial mission preview until August 28th.</p>
<p>Screenshots below of it on desktop on Epic settings:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4588097541692185940gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4588097541692185940gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4949985661692185941gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4949985661692185941gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Also playable on Steam Deck, although their advertised "Full controller support" doesn't yet seem to be enabled, so setting it to keyboard and mouse in Steam Input worked. You'll also want it on Low details, as on Medium there's a fair amount of drops.</p>
<p>Steam Deck screenshots. First shot on Medium, second on Low:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/931324271692186034gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/931324271692186034gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10429095561692186035gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10429095561692186035gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>They have a lot to live up to with this game with the absolutely clear C&amp;C inspiration. There's not a whole lot to go on from one mission but it's certainly tickled my fancy here. Lots of fun details in the environments, and the mixture of abilities your units have should be fun in the expanded game.</p>
<p>At release it will be available on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/tempest-rising?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1486920/Tempest_Rising/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Sandtrix the falling-block Tetris-like is getting a Sandtrix+ Steam release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Originally called Setris until a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/sandtrix-is-tetris-with-sand-delightful-free-and-renamed-after-a-dmca/" target="_blank">DMCA from Tetris Holding, LLC</a> appeared, Sandtrix is now getting a Sandtrix+ treatment with a full Steam release coming on September 1st.</p>
<p>This is an <em>expanded</em> version of the original freeware title that will include challenging colour modes, unlockable themes and a creative sandbox mode. The basics are all the same with falling shapes turning into sand. This will have 3 game modes, 3 difficulty settings, high scores, combos and with Sandtrix+ you get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sandtrix+: 4 Color Modes</li>
<li>Sandtrix+: 12 Unlockable Themes</li>
<li>Sandtrix+: Bonus Sandbox Mode</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<p>A lovely little time-waster, taking the basic idea from Tetris but making it a whole lot more interesting and it's really quite challenging due to how the blocks turn into sand. Give it a go!</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2546310/Sandtrix/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a> and play the <a href="https://www.sandtrix.net/" target="_blank">original free</a>.</p>

      <title>ProtonDB now has filters for PC and Steam Deck reports</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.protondb.com/" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> is the go-to for a lot of people to see how games run on Linux desktop and Steam Deck, and while its rating system is far from perfect it's nice to have. A recent upgrade also makes it a lot nicer to browse.</p>
<p>When the Steam Deck released ProtonDB added dedicated Steam Deck reports to game pages, which ended up making it quite a mess - especially for PC players where every page would have you scroll and scroll until you go to the desktop Linux reports — but no more!</p>
<p>Now there's a nice tabbed selection between them, you can link to the specific platform and it will remember your selection. Much <em>much</em> better. Example from the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1091500" target="_blank">Cyberpunk 2077 listing</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/333304051692179880gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/333304051692179880gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here's all that's <a href="https://www.protondb.com/news/device-filtered-report-lists" target="_blank">changed</a> for ProtonDB:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>There is now a tabbed submenu above reports on game pages.</li>
<li>In this menu, you can now filter by PC, Steam Deck, or a combined list.</li>
<li>Steam Deck reports now paginate and you can view beyond the first list of 40 reports.</li>
<li>When you select an item in the device submenu, the URL is updated and can be shared to send someone directly to reports corresponding to your selection.</li>
<li>Your selection is remembered and all future game pages will default to your selection unless the URL specifies otherwise.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Good to see some needed upgrades! </p>

      <title>To the Moon - Beach Episode gets a trailer, plus there&#39;s going to be a card game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Freebird Games have revealed a brand new trailer for To the Moon - Beach Episode, the next is the series of this 2D RPG adventure and there's even going to be a real-life card game.</p>
<p>The description is as confusing as always to not give away any real details of the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Beach Episode(TM) of To the Moon, Finding Paradise, and Impostor Factory.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Or is it?</em><br/>
<br/>
...Yes, it technically is. <em>Just A To the Moon Series Beach Episode</em> is just that: A To the Moon series beach episode.<br/>
<br/>
Get ready for a new short adventure as the SigCorp. crew takes off to an all-expenses-paid vacation at the Golden Lobster Hotel &amp; Resort! For a grand total of 1 day, which is apparently the most the company was willing to fork out. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br/>
<br/>
Join familiar faces from <em>To the Moon, Finding Paradise, </em>and <em>Impostor Factory</em> in this narrative adventure filled with mini-games of varying elements, mysteries and relaxation, as well as--<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
...Wait, most of the characters here should already be dead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1jMne7b7FZM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c0caf713598a6b3180ee54d73c41bed4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1jMne7b7FZM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The feature list is also amusingly unhelpful noting it has:</p>
<ul>
<li>A beach</li>
<li>An episode</li>
<li>A cozy mix between adventure game elements and classic RPG aesthetics</li>
<li>Dialogues that read so wrong but feel so right</li>
<li>Platplat the platypus</li>
<li>Rudog</li>
<li>Long-cat &amp; Ricebot(?)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Okay then.</em></p>
<p>What's not clear right now is if it will have Native Linux support like their previous games, as it only notes Windows in the system requirements on Steam currently - so you might have to run this one through Proton / WINE. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2159210/Just_A_To_the_Moon_Series_Beach_Episode/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a> for whenever it releases (sometime this year).</p>
<p>On top of that there's also going to be a card game, which is crowdfunding on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/freebirdgames/to-the-moon-bestest-memories" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>. As expected for this popular series, the funding is way over the goal at around £75,218 / £29,167 and it ticks up a little every time I scroll back to it.</p>

      <title>Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is going to get some big updates</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm still completely hooked on Baldur's Gate 3, the first time for a while I've been properly firmly sucked into a game and it's set to get some big updates too. Thanks to Valve's effort with Proton, it's working fantastically on desktop Linux and could easily be my GOTY - it's going to take a lot to top this.</p>
<p>You can see my initial <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/baldurs-gate-3-steam-deck-and-desktop-linux/" target="_blank">release article here</a>, plus the article about it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/baldurs-gate-3-is-now-steam-deck-verified/" target="_blank">now being Steam Deck Verified</a> — although for Steam Deck you'll really want to wait for September to get the FSR 2.2 upgrade. </p>
<p><em>So what do Larian have cooking? A lot by the sounds of it.</em></p>
<p>Firstly, in reply to someone <a href="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/1691085306664030208" target="_blank">on X</a> (formerly Twitter) asking about changing your custom character during the game Larian's Director of Publishing said "Things are being cooked", so you might eventually be able to re-do your look. Sure would be nice, there's a few things I completely missed when making mine.</p>
<p>The latest is from Larian's Founder and CEO, Swen Vincke, who <a href="https://twitter.com/LarAtLarian/status/1691479778488909827" target="_blank">mentioned</a> a little teaser about upcoming updates: "We're all very enthused by your feedback. It's very rewarding. Our focus now is fixing any issues you report, but we are listening to suggestions. Current roadmap: a) Hotfix 4, b) Patch 1 (+1000 fixes and tweaks), c) Patch 2. The latter will already incorporate some requests."</p>
<p>You can buy Baldur's Gate 3 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/baldurs_gate_iii" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>

      <title>Happy Debian Day - going 30 years strong</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Today is <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDay" target="_blank">Debian Day</a> and it's quite a special one, because the Debian Project has now been going for 30 years which is a very impressive milestone.</p>
<p>It's hard to imagine what the world would be without the likes of Debian. Think of all the things we wouldn't have! Not only is Debian a popular Linux distribution itself but it's also the foundation for Ubuntu and so all the rebuilds like Linux Mint and a great many more. Heck, even the original SteamOS was based on Debian (it's now using Arch as a base).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20759381381692176773gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20759381381692176773gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em><a href="https://salsa.debian.org/maierjeff-guest/debian-30-years-logo" target="_blank">Image Source</a></em></p>
<p>Officially founded by Ian Murdock on August 16th, 1993 with this classic <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianHistory?action=AttachFile&amp;do=get&amp;target=Debian-announcement-1993-pic-by-Ian_Murdock.png" target="_blank">announcement</a> — how time flies huh? This might make some readers feel old: I was only 5 years old when that announcement was made. Even during my 35 years I've seen the Linux desktop and Linux gaming go through many huge changes.</p>
<p>Here's to the next 30 years of a wonderful Linux distribution, may it have many more. And a big thank you to all developers working hard to ensure it's working well.</p>
<p><em>Feel free to get all nostalgic and share your stories in the comments.</em></p>

      <title>Overwatch 2 becomes the worst user-reviewed game on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While other developers like Larian are riding high with Baldur's Gate 3, it seems Blizzard are not doing so well with the recent Steam release of Overwatch 2 becoming the worst user-reviewed game of all time on Steam (via <a href="https://steam250.com/bottom100" target="_blank">Steam 250</a>). <em>Overwatch 2 is <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/overwatch-2-out-on-steam-works-fine-on-steam-deck-and-desktop-linux/" target="_blank">playable on Linux and Steam Deck</a> thanks to Proton.</em></p>
<p>This hasn't stopped it pulling in plenty of players though, with it hitting an all-time high of 75,608 playing <em>just</em> on Steam 3 days ago according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2357570/charts/" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>. As I type this it still has 61,702 playing, so even though plenty of people are making themselves heard in Steam reviews - a lot of people are still playing it and likely enjoying their time with it. This puts it currently as the 15th most played game on Steam for peak player counts.</p>
<p>You don't have to look far into why the reaction has been so severe though. Steam gives players a real feeling of power thanks to the user review system, that certain other stores don't have, so it was expected this would happen due to the missteps Blizzard have made with Overwatch 2.</p>
<p>So what's happened?</p>
<p>Well it was supposed to be a <em>sequel</em>, but the reality is far different. Blizzard removed the original paid game, and turned the new version into a free to play version while continuing the live service model. Blizzard also cancelled the PvE content that was one of the bigger (biggest?) selling points of Overwatch 2. There is now a small amount of PvE available in the Invasion update - but you have to pay extra for it.</p>
<p>A <em>lot</em> of the negative reviews are Chinese players too, since Blizzard <a href="https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/blizzard-entertainment-and-netease-suspending-game-services" target="_blank">ended</a> their agreement with NetEase which suspended their ability to play Overwatch and other titles officially. Now being on Steam though, Chinese players can make their voices heard (if they use a VPN to get onto normal Steam).</p>
<p><em>There's currently around 117,446 reviews on Steam with 106,596 being Negative.</em></p>

      <title>Check out this modern rewrite of the classic racer wipEout</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you remember the original wipEout? An absolute classic racer originally released 1995 for Sony PlayStation, DOS and later the SEGA Saturn. Now there's a modern cross-platform remake available to try out.</p>
<p>This wipEout Remaster comes thanks to developer Dominic Szablewski, who used the code leak from 2022. This does mean it's something of a legal uncertainty because leaked code could be nuked by rights holders at any time. Although, we are talking about a really <em>old</em> game no longer sold and supported.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12624739471692021213gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12624739471692021213gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the benefits of this remake include cross-platform support with SDL2, better memory management, better performance along with high FPS support, rewritten and upgraded physics and much more. There's still work to be done though with some features missing but it's very playable.</p>
<p>I have some really fond memories of playing the original on an actual PlayStation. Seeing it run in my browser, on a laptop is just - wow. I love how technology moves on and enables things like this, and I especially love seeing classics remade in such a way so more people can experience them and learn from them.</p>
<p>Check out the writeup from the developer <a href="https://phoboslab.org/log/2023/08/rewriting-wipeout" target="_blank">here</a>, the code is on <a href="https://github.com/phoboslab/wipeout-rewrite" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and you can play it in your <a href="https://phoboslab.org/wipegame/" target="_blank">browser</a>.</p>

      <title>Latest trailer for Crowsworn has me desperately wanting this Hollow Knight-like</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Crowsworn looks like it's coming along nicely and fans of Hollow Knight will want to keep a close eye on it. Celebrating two years since their Kickstarter, they have a new trailer up.</p>
<p>About it: Explore a large interconnected world as you fight against hordes of monsters that roam the forsaken lands. Uncover secrets and unlock new abilities that enhance your arsenal of deadly weapons and powers. Venture forth to lift the ancient curse and unravel the mystery behind its origins, as you attempt to discover the truth and realize your salvation. Check out the new trailer below!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lwvx3ksnOQs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a21e21cac08082c53625fd9d0d06762e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lwvx3ksnOQs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's not due out for quite a while though, and they won't be hitting their December 2023 plan as they posted in their latest Kickstarter <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mongooserodeo/crowsworn-a-dark-and-mysterious-action-packed-metroidvania/posts/3879584" target="_blank">update</a>. They said "In some of the previous updates we discussed that the game is going to be taking longer to finish than the initially planned for December 2023 release date. We shed some light on the reasons for this in the previous updates, but for posterity we'll discuss it again.</p>
<p>The delayed release is primarily a result of raising more than 10x the amount of funds we had initially planned for. This basically means need to make a game that is 10x bigger / better than what we initially planned for."</p>
<p>They're also working on a fresh demo.</p>

      <title>Linux kernel gets an AMD Zenbleed fix for the Steam Deck APU</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One security issue I somehow missed back in July was Zenbleed, an issue with AMD CPUs that's getting patched up in the Linux kernel and now the Steam Deck is getting a kernel fix for it too.</p>
<p>Turns out the <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/commit/?id=cfef7bbf0dca27209ea5d82d7060d4fc2c0d72ea" target="_blank">original code</a> in the Linux kernel somehow missed the Steam Deck, so now it's being pulled in urgently to ensure it's also protected as per the <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2023/8/11/1138" target="_blank">patch</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Commit 522b1d69219d ("x86/cpu/amd: Add a Zenbleed fix") provided a fix for the Zen2 VZEROUPPER data corruption bug affecting a range of CPU models, but the AMD Custom APU 0405 found on SteamDeck was not listed, although it is clearly affected by the vulnerability.</p>
<p>Add this CPU variant to the Zenbleed erratum list, in order to unconditionally enable the fallback fix until a proper microcode update is available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we may see a SteamOS upgrade come in at some point, if Valve chooses to patch it.</p>
<p>I'm sure some people will argue against it as these fixes can come with performance penalties, because the Steam Deck is <em>primarily</em> a gaming device. But still, it has a full desktop mode it's not a traditional locked down console, you can install a browser and do basically anything with it - better to be safe than sorry. The Steam Deck is really just a handheld Linux PC.</p>
<p>More info on <a href="https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/zenbleed.html" target="_blank">Zenbleed here</a>.</p>
<p>If you're on desktop, as always it's a good idea to ensure you regularly check for updates to patch up issues like this. Much like we <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/downfall-inception-amd-intel-security/" target="_blank">recently had for Downfall and Inception</a>.</p>

      <title>AMD RADV Ray Tracing to potentially get much faster on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With some work currently pending to be pulled into Mesa, the open source AMD RADV driver could be about to get much faster with Ray Tracing which is exciting to see.</p>
<p>As noticed by <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/RADV-Batch-Accel-RT" target="_blank">Phoronix</a> with the "Batch acceleration structure builds" <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/24587" target="_blank">merge request</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This converts radv_CmdBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR to a simple shim that pushes the actual build commands to a queue, where they are accumulated and dispatched as late as possible.</p>
<p>This helps especially with games that don't do any build command batching of their own. For example, it triples the performance of Hitman 3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then in one of the comments from testing it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the perf uplift from this PR is huge in a few games, out of the ones I own lego builders journey gets a 2x improvement in performance. Control gets an additional ~5 fps at 1080p, Minecraft RTX (education edition) gets ~10 fps more. When paired with the <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/21929" target="_blank">monolithic pipeline MR</a> it completely blows amdvlk out of water.</p>
<p>Tested on my rx6800.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if these two merge requests are pulled in, AMD GPU owners could expect to see a rather nice performance uplift in quite a number of games in later release of Mesa. So we could potentially see this in Mesa 23.3 due later on this year.</p>
<p>As a recent convert over to team AMD GPU with a Radeon 6800 XT, I'm going to be keeping a closer eye on stuff like this.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: turns out this might not get merged into Mesa, as there's also an already <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/pull/1651" target="_blank">merged upgrade</a> for VKD3D-Proton that does the Direct3D 12 to Vulkan translation that does some of the same as the MR noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Significantly improves Raytracing performance on RADV in a number of games, especially Hitman 3.</p>
<p>Handling WriteBufferImmediate is a bit janky as always, since we want to maintain correct command ordering with <code class="inline-code">BOTTOM</code> markers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Either way, things are about to get speedy. Exciting! </p>

      <title>Heart of the Machine from Arcen Games dropping Native Linux for Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Arcen Games developers of AI War, The Last Federation, Bionic Dues have said they're no longer doing Native Linux support for their upcoming game Heart of the Machine and will instead rely on Proton.</p>
<p>What is the game? "Heart of the Machine is a near-future sci-fi colony city-builder in reverse — you are the first sentient Machine Intelligence in an established world rather than starting from nothing. No one knows you exist (yet), and this allows you to operate from the shadows by manipulating the human population for whatever purposes your programming has in mind. The twist is that whether humans live or die does not determine your victory."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14054148691692014799gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14054148691692014799gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>This comes from a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2001070/view/5467985516584106548?l=english" target="_blank">Steam announcement</a> posted on August 11th, where they mentioned they plan to get it Steam Deck Verified as they're routinely testing it and Chris from Arcen Games spends "about 99% of my own gaming on that platform these days. It's a priority for me".</p>
<p>So why are they dropping Native Linux and going with the Proton compatibility layer? They said they found it performs better with Proton, looks better, has better frame timings and so Valve "strongly suggested we ditch the native version in that case". Going into more detail on the problems with their Native Linux build in Unity:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Performance was 10% worse, and frametimings were less even, but it was certainly playable. This was just how Unity 3D works in Vulkan on Linux, so there was no way to solve it.</li>
<li>Certain parts of this game have geometry that is close together, and on Linux these would flicker. This is because Unity 3D does not support a reversed z-buffer on OpenGL or Vulkan (or DirectX9). This problem is not present in DirectX11+, or Metal. And it’s not present when Proton or WINE convert DX11 commands to Vulkan.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other than that, everything was the same on Linux as it is on Windows or OSX. We’ve had a native Linux build of this game for its entire life up until recently, just as all of Arcen’s titles have had a native Linux build for the last decade.</p>
<p>So this all feels very strange. But Unity 3D’s support for Linux, and in particular their implementation of Vulkan, is notably inferior to what is going on with their support for DirectX11 and Proton/WINE’s ability to bridge across.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They believe it's the best way right now for their games, because "If someone has an incompatibility, we can't change the engine" and that "Valve has been more on top of things than Unity".</p>
<p>It's due for release this year and you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2001070/Heart_of_the_Machine/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Rest in peace Dustin &#39;Crusader&#39; Reyes, a pioneer of Linux gaming news</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some sad news to share this Monday morning. A name I imagine a lot of newer readers won't actually know, Dustin “Crusader” Reyes sadly passed away (as confirmed on <a href="https://nuclearmonster.com/2023/08/dustin-crusader-reyes/" target="_blank">Nuclear Monster</a>) - someone who was a pioneer of Linux gaming news.</p>
<p>Dustin was a main contributor to the long-gone linuxgames.com website, which was one of the first proper websites around that tried to give people a place to keep up to date with Linux gaming. I was a <em>big</em> fan of the website, I read it every day so naturally I read the stuff Dustin put up often, and without people like Dustin there's a definite chance I wouldn't have continued reading and eventually start up GamingOnLinux. Even in the beginning of GamingOnLinux I contributed a bit to linuxgames.com myself, which Dustin and others would be approving and publishing.</p>
<p>From an old <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9907/01/linuxgame.idg/index.html" target="_blank">CNN</a> article where they spoke to Dustin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I asked Dustin (who sometimes goes by the name Crusader) how the Linux Games site got started. "Linux Games began as a venture of Marvin Malkowski, head of the Telefragged gaming network," he replied. "Marv had been a longtime Linux supporter, and thus thought it was only natural to add a site dedicated to providing quality news about gaming under the Linux operating system to the network. I had known Marv for a few months via IRC, and expressed an interest in being on staff. Marv also recruited Al Koskelin, and in May of 1998 the three of us took Linux Games public. Looking back, it's almost hard to fathom how far gaming under Linux has come in just over a year -- it's almost an exact microcosm of the acceptance of Linux itself by mainstream computer users."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I personally spoke with Dustin a number of times over the years, and he was always a really friendly and welcoming person to chat to.</p>
<p>Rest in peace, Dustin “Crusader” Reyes, one of the Linux gaming news pioneers.</p>
