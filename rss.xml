      <title>Triple-i Initiative teased by devs of Vampire Survivors, Darkest Dungeon, Risk of Rain</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well well well, what do we have here then? A bunch of developers seem to have joined up for something called The Triple-i Initiative that could be quite exciting.</p>
<p>This was stealthily teased today that I spotted the Vampire Survivor account on X <a href="https://twitter.com/poncle_vampire/status/1767581615528595597" target="_blank">posting</a> about, with nothing other than an eyes emoji pointing to The Triple-i Initiative <a href="https://iii-initiative.com" target="_blank">website</a>. The website also doesn't really give much away either noting simply that it's:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A mysterious teasing page by the studios behind...</p>
<p>Darkest Dungeon, Risk of Rain, Slay the Spire, Vampire Survivors, V Rising &amp; many others</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With a countdown timer to a new announcement due in just over 16 days.</p>
<p>Doing a bit of digging on X there really is a <em>lot</em> of developers and publishers involved in this including others you may recognise like Evil Empire (prev worked on Dead Cells), Fellow Traveller (publisher), Humble Games (publisher), Fireshine Games (publisher), Dotemu (Streets of Rage 4), Thunder Lotus (Spiritfarer), Thorium (UnderMine), Pathea Games (My Time at Sandrock), Matt Dabrowski (Streets of Rogue) and the list goes on and on…</p>
<p>And then there's the new official X account for The Triple-i Initiative that <a href="https://twitter.com/iii_initiative/status/1767580890870292807" target="_blank">posted</a> how this has been "In the works for months, coming to you in days.". Curious.</p>
<p>Hmm. What could this be? A game that they're all part of somehow? A special indie game publisher? A game bundle? A new marketing push for indie games but not specifically a publisher? Something else entirely? A few months isn't a lot of time to prepare a new game, especially with so many involved, so I doubt it's that.</p>
<p><em>Over to you in the comments, what do you think will be announced? Go on, give it your best shot.</em></p>

      <title>God of War now DRM-freed with a GOG release and discount</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You can't keep Kratos shackled, as the excellent <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/god_of_war" target="_blank">God of War is now available DRM-free on GOG</a> and there's a nice discount to go with it too. Easily one of my favourites from the last few years! If you love action adventures it's really one not to be missed.</p>
<p>The GOG release comes with a 50% discount until March 29th. Nice to see more big games, especially from the likes of Sony appear on more PC stores. So it joins like the likes of <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/days_gone" target="_blank">Days Gone</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/uncharted_legacy_of_thieves_collection" target="_blank">UNCHARTED: Legacy of Thieves Collection</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/horizon_zero_dawn_complete_edition" target="_blank">Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck had a strong end to 2023 and a great start for 2024</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While the Steam Deck is now two years old, and has since had the Steam Deck OLED refresh for a few months now, it seems there's just no stopping it. Even in the wake of seeing multiple other handheld gaming devices, what other media like to ask "Is this the next Steam Deck killer?" (like the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/orange-pi-neo-gaming-handheld-to-come-with-manjaro-linux/" target="_blank">upcoming Orange Pi Neo</a>), it's clear that the Steam Deck continues to find a place in the home.</p>
<p>I've been tracking Steam Deck sales overall, and through 2024 the Steam Deck has so far spent every single week in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topsellers/global/" target="_blank">Global Top 10</a> for revenue on Steam. It's been bouncing around a bit, as the position generally depends on what games have been releasing that week, but clearly a lot of people keep buying it.</p>
<p>Steam Deck sales position each week for 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>March 5, 2024 - March 12, 2024: <strong>3rd</strong></li>
<li>February 27, 2024 - March 5, 2024: <strong>3rd</strong></li>
<li>February 20, 2024 - February 27, 2024: <strong>6th</strong></li>
<li>February 13, 2024 - February 20, 2024: <strong>5th</strong></li>
<li>February 6, 2024 - February 13, 2024: <strong>8th</strong></li>
<li>January 30, 2024 - February 6, 2024: <strong>6th</strong></li>
<li>January 23, 2024 - January 30, 2024: <strong>5th</strong></li>
<li>January 16, 2024 - January 23, 2024: <strong>2nd</strong></li>
<li>January 9, 2024 - January 16, 2024: <strong>2nd</strong></li>
<li>January 2, 2024 - January 9, 2024: <strong>1st</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Valve update their list every Tuesday.</em></p>
<p>Now of course, Valve's own list is based on <u>revenue</u>, <em>not</em> units sold. And compared with most games, it clearly costs a lot more. But we're also talking about games in the list that sell often tens to hundreds of thousands of units and more. So, it's a clear indicator it's selling plenty.</p>
<p>Valve don't give out the actual number of units sold, and it's easy to see why, because it would no doubt spawn many clickbait articles about how it's not doing well when stacked up against the big three (Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft). <em>You know it would happen. </em>For a device that comparatively is quite a niche, it's doing great.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck also just recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/steam-deck-hits-14000-games-rated-playable-or-verified/" target="_blank">crossed over the 14,000 mark</a> for games rated either Playable or Verified, and while it's not a perfect measure because there are issues with games wrongly tagged, it's still overall a good indicator of what the Steam Deck is capable of (and shows just how good the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> compatibility layer is). We're also getting <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/proton-90-has-another-beta-release-fixing-deathloop-and-warhammer-40000-darktide/" target="_blank">Proton 9.0 soon</a> which should bump up game compatibility even further.</p>
<p>For a bit of a longer look, here's the global ranking of the Steam Deck over the last 35 weeks:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14478677541710256968gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14478677541710256968gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Clearly the Steam Deck OLED from November 2023, and the cheaper prices of the original units, has really helped more gamers jump over the fence to give the Steam Deck a try.</p>
<p>A keen point to remember is that the Steam Deck is only <em>officially</em> available in the US, CA, UK, and EU on Steam (and Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong via KOMODO). So these stats only include those regions when talking globally, and only those direct from Valve (not KOMODO) as far as we know.</p>
<p>For me, the Steam Deck has been a constant companion allowing me to dive into <em>so many games</em> that have been left gathering dust. And if anything, it's only pushed me to keep buying more games on Steam and largely ignore other stores. Well played Valve.</p>

      <title>Vertical-building colony sim Stellar Settlers: Space Base Builder hits Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What seems like a rather interesting and unique take on the colony building sim is Stellar Settlers: Space Base Builder, which gets you to build vertically and it seems pretty fun. Early Steam user reviews are painting a good picture too with a Very Positive rating.</p>
<p>"Stellar Settlers is a chill space base/city builder and colony simulation game set in the depths of uncharted space. As you embark on a cosmic adventure, take control of a space settlement and build your thriving colony on alien planets with different challenging and hostile environments that want to destroy your colony."</p>
<p>Looks like a fun blend of a few different ideas. The vertical building looks good, and the exploration side of it seems great too. As not only will you be building up a thriving colony, but you'll also be working towards creating a physics-based spaceship to escape the planet when it gets too harsh, to move onto another planet.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LYii87It3TQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4039d549ca7675eb941c57f229989a35.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LYii87It3TQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Their plan for Early Access is about another year of development to include 5 more planets, new structures to build and more with an end result being "basically double the content for the player". Additionally, they also said they want to work on full controller and Steam Deck support too.</p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2628570/Stellar_Settlers_Space_Base_Builder/" target="_blank">the Steam page</a>. It has Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Captain Contraption&#39;s Chocolate Factory looks like one for Zachtronics fans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Captain Contraption's Chocolate Factory releasing in July is an open ended puzzle game, where you design and build machines to combine ingredients to make chocolates. I'm getting a bit of a Zachtronics automation puzzle game vibe from this so it could be well worth a look.</p>
<p>The idea is to go through various levels to design an automated machine to produce tasty chocolate. Launch nuts into the air and combine them with chocolate, smash caramel against a wall to make bite size bits and of course there's all those E number food additives too to give your chocolates some colour. There's many solutions to each puzzle, and you get to go back and optimize your machine designs.</p>
<p>Have a look at their recent demo update teaser trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ypZbxNs5KaI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/202ac7675f364bd09391d99339dff762.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ypZbxNs5KaI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer said it will include an easy to use level editor too, the same one they're using to make the game so you can make your own challenges with Steam Workshop support planned to be supported at launch.</p>
<p>Go <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2166920/Captain_Contraptions_Chocolate_Factory/" target="_blank">check it out on Steam</a>. It has a Native Linux demo available.</p>

      <title>Wizard colony-sim tower defense game Artificer&#39;s Tower readies Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I love indie developers because they keep making some of the most weird and wonderful combinations, and a recent discovery is Artificer's Tower. The devs say it's a "cozy colony sim resource management game that features base-building, tower defense systems, and powerful enemies to defeat".</p>
<p>Check out the most recent teaser trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="L4UtdLxngAI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/54c8ff134358c726499b255b3bef2f53.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/L4UtdLxngAI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2284200/announcements/detail/4147323231929737991" target="_blank">news post</a> the developer mentioned the previously implemented controller support, and now they've moved onto optimising the interface for the Steam Deck and it has proven to be quite complex for their game. Nice to see another developer ensuring it works well, looks like fun!</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Defend Your Base:</strong> Fill the entrance of your tower with traps and watch as the monsters trying to take down your tower drop like flies.</li>
<li><strong>Manage Your Mages:</strong> Keep your tower running like a well-oiled magical machine by managing your mages. Pay them generous wages, fulfill their needs and keep them happy.</li>
<li><strong>Summon Powerful Bosses:</strong> Challenge the biggest bad guys in their area and their lackeys. Show off your tower’s strength by defeating these foes and taking home all the bragging rights.</li>
<li><strong>Train and Practice:</strong> Train your next generation of powerful wizards! Watch as they grow from low-potential, bumbling novices to full-fledged artificers.</li>
<li><strong>Flex Your Alchemy Skills:</strong> Start with simple recipes and watch as your expertise grows and you can start making even more advanced items. Invest research into administration so you can spend less time micromanaging your mages.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a Native Linux <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2284200/Artificers_Tower/" target="_blank">demo available on Steam</a>. It's due to release in April according to the Steam page.</p>

      <title>Latest Steam Client Beta fixes Linux and Steam Deck issues, tweaks screenshots</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released a fresh Steam Client Beta for both Desktop PCs and Steam Deck, and with it there's some useful bug fixes and an interesting new screenshot adjustment for Steam Deck.</p>
<p>The Desktop Steam Beta <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053/view/4134938965487073775" target="_blank">changelog</a> is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix an error when launching some games that was introduced in the previous beta</li>
</ul>
<p>Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed swapped A/B buttons when using Nintendo GameCube controllers</li>
<li>Reset Camera Horizon: Increase maximum delay to allow for a more consistent behavior on lower/less consistent frame-rates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Linux</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a case where the window may become unresponsive until resized.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That Linux fix is especially good, because honestly I thought I was going mad with how Steam was being so unresponsive lately, and couldn't figure out what was causing it and it seems others I spoke to saw it working fine. Turns out it was a bug and now it's fixed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile over on Steam Deck, you may have noticed a while ago with SteamOS 3.5 that screenshots no longer showed any of the Steam UI, including a removal of the performance overlay from screenshots. I did speak to Valve on this, and it was intentional, but I requested an option to have it back and now they've delivered!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12824634211710240628gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12824634211710240628gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p><em>Having the choice is good for people who want to show Steam UI (like the performance overlay) for whatever reason.</em></p>
<p>Steam Deck Beta <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4122554066510752594" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented the framerate limiter from applying changes.</li>
<li>Fixed screenshots not including Steam user interface elements.</li>
<li>Added an option to Settings-&gt;In Game to hide Steam user interface elements from screenshots.</li>
<li>Fix an error when launching some games that was introduced in the previous beta</li>
</ul>
<p>Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed swapped A/B buttons when using Nintendo GameCube controllers</li>
<li>Reset Camera Horizon: Increase maximum delay to allow for a more consistent behavior on lower/less consistent frame-rates.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Fantastic roguelike Jupiter Hell gets a new scary boss, new locations</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Jupiter Hell is without a doubt one of my absolute most favourite roguelikes ever made, not only because it looks good and it's intense but it also doesn't exactly feel like it's even turn-based because it's so damn slick.</p>
<p>ChaosForge, who developed Jupiter Hell, previously gained recognition for making "Doom, the Roguelike", which they later rebranded to just "<a href="https://drl.chaosforge.org" target="_blank">DRL</a>" due to ZeniMax <a href="https://twitter.com/epyoncf/status/804482084702187520" target="_blank">not liking</a> their use of Doom. Jupiter Hell is the spiritual successor to DRL. It's well worth playing because the atmosphere in it in awesome.</p>

<p>The latest update to the game expands the Dante location with new level branches to play through, along with adding in a new enemy variant and expanding it to be 5 levels deep and there's a scary new boss to deal with. There's also a new Japanese translation, an object outlines accessibility option, a potential fix for Steam Deck players seeing a crash when saving and quitting and more. Full changelog below:</p>

      <title>Upcoming space RTS &#39;Falling Frontier&#39; looks epic</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm a real sucker for anything involving spaceships and Falling Frontier from Stutter Fox Studios and Hooded Horse releasing in 2025 looks like it could be epic. Always on the hunt for a good new RTS to sink some time into as well, so this shot right to the top of my wishlist.</p>
<p>More about it: "Falling Frontier is a revolutionary sci-fi RTS where ship design, recon, and logistics are critical elements. Your expeditionary force has just completed construction of its first space port in orbit of a new world, but you are not alone. Rivals from the old colonial wars between Earth, Titan, Venus, and the other lineages that divide humankind have also arrived in the same star system."</p>
<p>Check out the brand new lengthy video below that has a new trailer, along with various gameplay slices:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="StMAQegEFPQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f708e709b383cc324116f2f5ccbb7c06.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/StMAQegEFPQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I would be surprised if <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> wasn't able to run it, so I look forward to playing it on Linux! If you're a big space nerd like me will you be picking this one up too? We don't get many games like this now making it all the more exciting. The ship combat actually looks a little bit like the rather good Battlestar Galactica Deadlock don't you think? Gimme.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1280190/Falling_Frontier/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer Part 40: The Cyborg Project</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-39-beyond-heretic/" target="_blank">Part 39: Beyond Heretic</a></strong></p>
<p>Since it has come up already it is time I properly introduced the General Graphics Interface, a since abandoned effort to create a unified graphics library that aimed to be portable across all platforms. Rather than having games and applications display to say X11 or SVGAlib directly, GGI would streamline that process by allowing developers to target just the one interface. Adoption was limited largely due to the success of SDL, but one game which did rely on it was <em>U.R.B.A.N The Cyborg Project</em>.</p>
<p>The RPM package for <em>U.R.B.A.N</em> created by Karol Pietrzak has a typo making it depend on "libmikmo" as opposed to MikMod, but you can work around this by passing the the --nodeps flag while installing the package. You will also need to download the sound.tar.gz archive and extract it to the /usr/share/urban directory, as the sound effects were kept apart from the main game due to them being a whopping 8.6 megabytes in size. Now that was a sign of the times.</p>
<p>An action platformer first released in 1999, you play as Urban Gutter, a man taken by an evil scientist to a secret military base and changed into a cyborg against his will. The acronym in the title then is a bit odd, but your one goal is to escape and enact as bloody a revenge on the world as possible. In this regard <em>U.R.B.A.N</em> strikes me as being the free software <em>Postal</em>, if arguably even less artful in its presentation. Any hope for true catharsis here often gets lost in frustration however.</p>
<p><em>U.R.B.A.N</em> allows you to move one tile into the foreground and one into the background, but the dead on perspective gives you very little feel for this. To be most effective the game either needed to be seen from an angled view, or have shading to show a visual difference between the varied levels. As it stands you can just about navigate, but you will still find yourself often missing jumps and shots because of it, with some mandatory platforming only possible through keysmashing.</p>
<p>Combat is also imbalanced, with you taking too little damage from bullets and way too much from explosives; the only effective strategy I found for taking out the grenadiers for most of the game was by backing away and shooting at them blindly using my starting rifle from off screen. Worse still are the land mines, which are represented by just a few red pixels flashing in and out on the ground, and are used for some real mean traps designed to burn through all your lives.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12384390941710182153gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12384390941710182153gol6.png"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9851576141710182155gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9851576141710182155gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>Your arsenal will expand to include flame and freeze throwers, and in the late game a rocket launcher and minigun, but most of these still force you to stand in the line of fire to use. There are also some other novelties in the form of futuristic tech weapons that bafflingly do not seem to inflict any damage to the final boss; instead, I had to use the rocket launcher, minigun, and then my starting rifle to take the tank down in that order, all while treating my lives as a consumable resource.</p>
<p>This all feeds into my grievances with the save system, with it being checkpoint based with you only allowed to save your total progress at the end of each level. Quicksaving can absolve a great many sins, and <em>U.R.B.A.N</em> was committing plenty, with your lives needing to be cherished for use on the minefields rather than as a cushion for any other mistakes. You cannot even pause as escaping to the menu ends your session, and it also started to lock up when reloading the last two levels.</p>
<p>In spite of my complaints there is still a strong game buried underneath all these vexations, with <em>U.R.B.A.N</em> sporting high quality pixel art and an impressive tracker music score. The sound effects can be a bit sparse at times though, and many of those that are there are lifted from other media; a complete audit would be needed to determine which assets are free content and which infringe copyright, a major hurdle to anyone hoping to craft an updated and fixed up version of the game.</p>
<p>If ported to a modern SDL version and given some retooling this could become something a of a free software classic, but as it stands it is now just seen as an old freeware oddity, far easier to play from DOSBox on a modern computer than with the native Linux binaries thanks to the deprecation of GGI. NetBSD does still package the game, and I even tried to install that package through pkgsrc on Arch Linux, but the build failed due to LibGGI refusing to compile.</p>
<p>This is unfortunate, as the cheat codes "LINUSISGOD" and "LINUXRULES" clearly show that the Swedish developers were indeed friends of the penguin. In fact, typing in "MICROSOFT" will kill the player instantly. All that being said, <em>U.R.B.A.N The Cyborg Project</em> was not alone in being a freeware action platformer from the turn of the millennium to later have its source code released, and the next one will allow me to highlight the Allegro game library instead.</p>

      <title>Backpack Battles is another clear indie Steam hit</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you enjoyed the idea in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/inventory-tetris-with-roguelike-exploration-and-combat-backpack-hero-is-out-now/" target="_blank">Backpack Hero</a> with inventory management, you may want to also take a look at the new Backpack Battles which has a similar basic theme but puts you in PvP battles against other players and it's proven to be quite a hit.</p>
<p>Released into Early Access on Steam with Native Linux support on March 8th, it's <em>already</em> sold over 100,000 copies and it has gained an Overwhelmingly Positive user rating too.</p>
<p>Sorting through a backpack might not initially sound all that exciting perhaps but as I've discovered (personal purchase), it really is quite a clever game. You start simply by picking whichever of the character classes sounds interesting, and then just dive right in.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20768025861710173551gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20768025861710173551gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>First up — shopping! You need to fill up that backpack with items. Some directly combine together to make a more powerful weapon, some give other items a buff or your character a plain attribute boost and so on. It's all about finding various fun combinations, of which there's rather a <em>lot</em>. Surprisingly, the shop screen is where I've spent most of my time, because I'm constantly rearranging everything trying to get a better item flow. You get strangely engrossed in working on that synergy. Some items have stars around them as well, and when you get another item of the same type with stars, if you manage to get them into a position where the stars match up — you get a special item boost.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19652224371710174274gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19652224371710174274gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Then when you think your backpack looks good, you'll be entering a PvP battle against an opponent matched by the game that will be the character and bag of another real player and the battle begins.</p>
<p>Everyone seems to start with the same gold, health and so on - so it's all fair game. Each round you gain more gold and health, so you'll always be in with a good chance on your next opponent since you'll match on those very basics. Of course the items you have make a massive difference, and some battles can end up quite one-sided. Or they may seems so, but then you run out of stamina due to your choices and then your opponent can flatten you.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13834646091710174781gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13834646091710174781gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's an auto-battler too, so you're not actually doing anything directly. The strategy here is, you guessed it, the backpack itself and how you've positioned everything. I really haven't quite gotten the hang of it yet, lots to learn, but very cool. While it doesn't do particularly well at explaining things, it's easy enough to pick up how it all works with a clear interface, I would have just like to have seen something resembling a tutorial just to ease me in a little more. Hasn't put me off though, and clearly a lot of other people aren't having issue either given that it's seen a peak player count of 32,635 in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11544110291710176127gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11544110291710176127gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Even though you're not actually involved in the battles, you're just an observer, it can get really intense. And the amount of joy you get when you absolutely annihilate an opponent is quite something. The Backpack Battles don't take long at all, and you can speed them up, but even on the normal speed in some cases we're talking even only 10-20 seconds at times.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SJAbeIH1f_4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c0fee8ba4fcba6b4b591bfa7aecf6d59.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SJAbeIH1f_4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This has just become not only my new favourite coffee-break game, but I'm probably going to end up on this all night. The Linux version runs without any issues, really great to see.</p>
<p>Nice to see another big hit being made with <a href="https://godotengine.org" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> as well! Remember to check out <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/Godot_Engine/" target="_blank">our Godot Engine tag</a>.</p>

<p>Working with RPCS3 for PlayStation 3 emulation should now be a whole lot easier on the likes of the Steam Deck, other handhelds and for just gamepad users with the latest update.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/rpcs3/status/1765078864399855976" target="_blank">Announced</a> by the RPCS3 team on the official X account, which includes a screenshot from <a href="https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/pull/15185" target="_blank">this merge request</a> that notes these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Allows to use the game pad to navigate the main window</li>
<li>This spawns a thread that uses the configured pad for player 1 to generate mouse and keyboard events.</li>
<li>The thread is stopped when we go ingame and reactivated when we stop the game.</li>
<li>Has two options in the gui settings for now:
<ul>
<li>Enable pad navigation (uses the pad to navigate the GUI while the game isn't running)</li>
<li>Allow global pad navigation (prevents you from losing pad input if RPCS3 isn't the active window)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The input is currently hardcoded to generate:
<ul>
<li>D-pad -&gt; Arrow keys</li>
<li>Cross -&gt; Enter</li>
<li>Circle -&gt; ESC</li>
<li>Square -&gt; Back</li>
<li>Triangle -&gt; Tab</li>
<li>Left stick -&gt; Mouse movement</li>
<li>Right stick Left/Right -&gt; Horizontal mouse wheel</li>
<li>Right stick Up/Down -&gt; Vertical mouse wheel</li>
<li>L1 -&gt; Left click</li>
<li>R1 -&gt; Right click</li>
<li>L2 -&gt; Boost Mode = faster mouse movement</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Another change they also implemented <a href="https://twitter.com/rpcs3/status/1764807042106015954" target="_blank">recently</a> includes support for playing with midi drums, so you can play games like Rock Band 3 without a a midi pro adaptor. Sounds useful for even better and easier game preservation.</p>
<p>They also recently put up an overview video going over two years of progress on this open source emulator:</p>

      <title>Of Life and Land settlement-builder releases April 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need a new city / villager builder and love everything simulated to be a bit more alive? Keep an eye on Of Life and Land that hits Early Access on April 2nd. Previously called Circle of Kerzoven, it went through a bit of rebranding late last year and it had a successful Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer too:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="md-g0UNTBV4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8675d6748f0e10d98ae4c673b24dfc5b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/md-g0UNTBV4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it: "Take the role of a leader delegated to build new settlements in remote, unknown corners of the empire. In those forgotten places, nature is wild and legends are more real and vivid than one may think. Experience the challenges of different seasons and climates in a world, where every animal and every plant tries to find their place in nature, while you lead your villagers. How much will you share with nature? Will you strive for balance or even enforce the extinction of certain animals? Follow the old paths… or find your own."</p>
<p>Built with <a href="https://godotengine.org" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, it will have full Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Unique deep simulation of the nature in a building strategy game with complex interdependence between humans and nature.</li>
<li>Manage simultaneously the acquisition, refining and distribution of resources on multiple maps in different climatic conditions.</li>
<li>Manage the needs of the citizens. They are “alive” and have a specific home, workplace, and unique needs.</li>
<li>Animals are looking for food, get thirsty, sleepy, and form social groups to find their place in nature.</li>
<li>Plants grow and are affected by the actions of the humans, animals, and their environment.</li>
<li>Seasons and climate affect the gameplay, as certain plants grow only under certain conditions. Temperature affects humans, animals, plants, and the environment.</li>
<li>Interact and trade with other factions that produce goods with the same rules as you do.</li>
<li>Create own maps and scenarios in the editor and extend them using mods.</li>
<li>Charming and calm low poly art style.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1733110/Of_Life_and_Land/" target="_blank">check it out on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>EmuDeck 2.2.12 released to fix a bunch of issues</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.emudeck.com" target="_blank">EmuDeck</a> is one of the go-to solutions for emulation on Steam Deck and other systems, and the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/emudeck-2-2-adds-a-new-pegasus-frontend-better-linux-support-new-emulators/" target="_blank">big 2.2 update</a> recently had some issues so another update is out now with 2.2.12 to clean things up a bit.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6560857961710163468gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Here's what's new:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steam Rom Manager, we've reverted back dynamic parsers. This was causing some parsers to disappear. This will come back in the future.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue related to the CHD compressor in EmuDeck Compressor.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with GC and 3DS folders on ESDE.</li>
<li>Fixed Ryujinx not creating saved games folders</li>
<li>Model 2, sometimes it just wont install, fixed.</li>
<li>Pegasus not working properly in gaming mode, fixed.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue related to RetroArch and its buildbot assets.</li>
<li>Fixed support for both new ESDE and old EmulationStation-DE launchers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully now it will work better.</p>
<p>There was also an issue of downloads not being right at the 2.2 release, but that was fixed up quickly after.</p>

      <title>Steam broke another record with over 35 million people online</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It was only last week I was writing about Steam's growth hitting 34 million players online, and here they are breaking another record to hit well over 35 million.</p>
<p>At 2PM UTC on March 10th, you all smashed that barrier once again for Steam to hit a new peak of 35,385,530 according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/753/charts/" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>. At the time 11,117,276 people were actually in game too!</p>
<p>The games with the most players in the last 24 hours were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Counter-Strike 2</li>
<li>Dota 2</li>
<li>PUBG: Battlegrounds</li>
<li>Apex Legends</li>
<li>Helldivers 2</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16428485261710162931gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16428485261710162931gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Helldivers 2</p>
<p>It's clearly going to be another huge year for Steam, with records being repeatedly broken this early on in the year. But it's not exactly surprising though as we've had multiple huge releases recently like Helldivers 2, Palworld and Last Epoch.</p>

      <title>Linux kernel 6.8 is out now with lots of new features</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Linux kernel 6.8 has been released now by Linus Torvalds and as usual, there's absolutely tons of changes and new features.</p>
<p>From the release <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2024/3/10/243" target="_blank">announcement</a>: "This is not the historically big release that 6.7 was - we seem to be back to a fairly average release size for the last few years. You can see it in the overall diffstats too - this looks like an average release in pretty much all respects, and we don't have (for example) any obvious big new filesystems or architectures. I think the biggest single new thing in 6.8 is probably the new Xe drm driver, but honestly, the big bulk of changes are just various random updates and fixes all over." — Linus Torvalds</p>
<p>Just a small selection of what's new includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Intel Xe GPU driver.</li>
<li>Lenovo Legion Go controllers support in xpad.</li>
<li>AMDGPU has a bunch of new colour management code that is being used in the Steam Deck.</li>
<li>Improved Steam Deck OLED support.</li>
<li>Added a hotkey to switch between gamepad mode and mouse/keyboard mode to the HID driver for Valve's Steam Controller - mirroring the behaviour in the Steam client.</li>
<li>Added support for Nintendo Switch Online controllers - SNES, Genesis and N64.</li>
<li>Support for the Anberic RG351V, Powkiddy X55 and RK2023 handhelds.</li>
<li>New driver for Adafruit Mini I2C Seesaw gamepad.</li>
<li>Apple M1 USB4/Thunderbolt DART support.</li>
<li>Support poweroff on Orange Pi 5.</li>
<li>Raspberry Pi 5 support for V3D graphics driver.</li>
<li>Intel Lunar Lake support for Thunderbolt.</li>
<li>Various other new hardware support, filesystem improvements and the list goes on and on.</li>
</ul>
<p>The full complete kernel 6.8 <a href="https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v6.x/ChangeLog-6.8" target="_blank">changelog is here</a>.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 9-1 brings a whole lot of fixes for Linux / Steam Deck gaming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The first release of GE-Proton based on Wine 9.0 / Proton 9.0 is here with GE-Proton 9-1 bringing in a lot of fixes for various games and new games added to ULWGL (Unified Linux Wine Game Launcher).</p>
<p>As a reminder: ULWGL is a new unified launcher for running Windows games on Linux, it's basically a copy of how the Steam Linux Runtime/Steam Runtime Tools work to allow Proton to properly run outside of Steam, along with various specific game tweaks. It's not a standalone launcher like Lutris or Heroic, they would instead use it directly. GE-Proton itself is a community-built version of Proton, not supported by Valve, that often has fixes Valve can't distribute (sometimes for legal reasons, other times for more QA testing time).</p>
<p>Here's all the changes for <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton9-1" target="_blank">GE-Proton 9-1</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Proton:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pulled in upstream changes from proton 9 bleeding edge</li>
<li>wine updated to Proton 9 bleeding edge</li>
<li>dxvk updated to latest git</li>
<li>vkd3d updated to latest git</li>
</ul>
<p>Wine:</p>
<ul>
<li>All previous proton-ge patches rebased to proton 9 (thanks for the FSR rebase loathingKernel)</li>
<li>Star Citizen EAC patch removed, no longer needed, instead currently uses protonfix with EOS_USE_ANTICHEATCLIENTNULL=1</li>
<li>Wine-staging rebased on top of proton 9 bleeding edge wine</li>
</ul>
<p>Protonfixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>core count fix added for farcry primal (allows game to run)</li>
<li>added ulwgl entry for egs version of farcry primal</li>
<li>core count fix added for farcry 2</li>
<li>added ulwgl entry for uplay and egs versions of farcry 2</li>
<li>core count fix added for far cry blood dragon</li>
<li>added ulwgl entries for uplay and egs versions of far cry blood dragon</li>
<li>added ulwgl entries for uplay and egs version of farcry 3</li>
<li>added ulwgl entries for uplay and egs versions of farcry 4</li>
<li>added ulwgl entry for egs version of uncharted legacy of thieves collection</li>
<li>added fixes for Trails in the Sky 1-3 and ulwgl entries for the gog versions (thanks keenanweaver)</li>
<li>added core count fix for New World</li>
<li>added zoom games platform for ulwlgl</li>
<li>added fix for duke nukem manhatten project zoom edition</li>

<li>added fix for Gabriel Knight 3 (thanks marianoag)</li>
<li>added fix for Gobliiins 5 (thanks marianoag)</li>
<li>added fix for Ceville (thanks marianoag)</li>
<li>added fix for Nine Witches: Family Disruption (thanks marianoag)</li>
<li>xrandr added to protonfixes for screen resolution detection -- this is needed for some games like gothic/gothic 2 (fixes for those those games are still a work in progress)</li>
<li>added fix which wil skip running winetricks in protonfixes if no internet connection is available. A winetricks check is performed on every run. If a winetrick is found to be missing it tries to install it. During that time it will check if there is an internet connection available. If there is not one, the winetrick is skipped until the next time the game is run and subsequently the winetrick.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Known Issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>wmv video playback regression in some games (one example being Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3). This is a known regression in upstream proton and they are aware/working on it.</li>

      <title>Proton Experimental fixes up Apex Legends, Epic Games Store, Warlords Battlecry III</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released an update to Proton Experimental to further improve the Windows game compatibility on Steam Deck and Linux PCs. Here's all that's changed for the March 8th update.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now Playable: Warlords Battlecry III.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a few 9.0 regressions:
<ul>
<li>Epic Game Store is able to launch again.</li>
<li>Gungrave G.O.R.E no longer has hitching video playback.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed Apex Legends hanging on a black screen after a recent game update.</li>
<li>Fixed Descent 3 not being playable on system using long Steam Library paths.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>While Valve also recently did a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/proton-hotfix-updated-for-apex-legends-to-work-again-on-steam-deck-linux/" target="_blank">Proton Hotfix for Apex Legends</a>, it should no longer be needed, as you can just use Proton Experimental now.</p>
<p>Also interesting to see Valve fix up the Epic Games Store in Proton like this. While it's not available on Steam obviously, plenty of people do run it with Proton on Steam Deck to get more games. And the thing is, often fixes for one app will fix issues in something else - so it's always worth doing.</p>
<p>You can just select Proton Experimental in the Properties -&gt; Compatibility menu on each game.</p>

      <title>BORE BLASTERS will be your next fixation - out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What's not to absolutely love about flying around in a gyrocopter and using its machinegun to blast away rocks and creepy creatures? BORE BLASTERS will absolutely suck away your time. <em>Note: key provided by ÜberStrategist.</em></p>
<p>Scottish studio 8BitSkull have crafted something truly satisfying here, a game that you'll want to keep pumping hours into as you see all the wonderful pixels flying around as you smash your way deeper into it. I put quite a lot of time into the demo doing repeat runs, and it's great to see the expanded full game really delivers on that feeling of just wanting <em>one more run</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17528842661709921918gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17528842661709921918gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's not a complicated game at all. The basics really are simple. You fly around and pick an island on the main map, then get dropped down in your little gyrocopter to blast through some rocks. Simple is good in this case. Much like the rise of Vampire Survivors and attack of the clones, that's the real key. It's all about repeating the runs, doing better, unlocking more and smashing through as many rocks as you can to get more monies. Even when you fail, you keep what you earned to power yourself up for another run to keep doing better. It's great!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_v5rjPOWa94"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a7a104ece931b5536b7847a57cf295d5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_v5rjPOWa94" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>Oh hey, you don't see me quoted too often in a trailer. Simply delicious indeed. Wise words from me. </em></p>
<p>It can get pretty frantic too, partly because of the fuel system. You're not <em>supposed</em> to be able to complete things in one run, or even two. The fuel is a system to keep you focused, keep you moving and trying to reach your goals and finish the little quests it sprinkles in. Fuel is ticking down constantly, and while you can find fuel whilst exploring, there's not a whole lot of it. Thankfully, with the amount of tools at your disposal - it's not a big deal. You have a special ability to move quickly and just absolutely annihilate every block in your path, then add to that all the upgrades you can do and it's pure brilliant pixel-art mining chaos.</p>
<p>I love the claustrophobic feeling you can get from some of it too. One of the biomes has these vine blocks that repeatedly grow back, and if you're not careful they can box you in. Making it worse, as you go deeper down your visibility reduces into a cone in front of you too, so you don't exactly see what's creeping up behind you. You'll also see some really weird blocks, like eyeballs that get angry and reduce your vision further if you destroy them when open and so on. There's a good few little tricks the developer spread throughout the game to keep you on your toes like that.</p>
<p>For people who enjoy twin-stick shooters, and love the constantly changing upgrades in titles like Vampire Survivors, you're going to love it. You gradually level up during your run to unlock temporary upgrades like explosive bullets, longer bullet range, a drill that drops down automatically every so often, periodically throw bombs around, more bullets per second and the list goes on. You can unlock more of these upgrades as you complete each island too, so the game keeps giving you more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20733946481709921821gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20733946481709921821gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Then there's the permanent upgrades you can do outside of runs with more health, more bullets per second, your magnet range for picking up gems and more. You'll also find some unlockable characters too as you progress through the little story and quests, each with their own unique abilities.</p>
<p>Since you're a dwarf, there also of course had to be goblins to fight at some point. Some of the battles can end up quite a challenge too, because of the constant race against time on your fuel, along with needing space to fight as some blocks can take a while to destroy while you end up surrounded by enemies. Not even just that - everything hurts you. Bump a wall? That's a health point gone, and you don't start with much.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16294434941709921878gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16294434941709921878gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You won't be disappointed with this one if you like easy pick up and play games, that you can blast through for as little or as long as you like thanks to runs not lasting particularly long, so not only is it a great game to sink a couple of hours into in the evening but it's fab for coffee breaks all the same.</p>
<p>Good reasonable price point too considering how much time you can spend with it at only £7.99 (outside of discounts).</p>
<p>You can buy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2398170/BORE_BLASTERS/" target="_blank">BORE BLASTERS on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Thief tribute game The Dark Mod v2.12 released with big optimizations</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Inspired by the "Thief" series by Looking Glass Studios, The Dark Mod is a full standalone open source first-person stealth game. Technically, it's a toolkit allowing anyone to create their own stealth missions and campaigns in a Thief-like setting, and there's plenty of content available for it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thedarkmod.com/posts/the-dark-mod-2-12-has-been-released/" target="_blank">The Dark Mod 2.12</a> sounds like a fantastic release, which includes a new culling system to increase performance. This is where your system won't waste resources rendering things that aren't currently seen. The developer said that while some people using TDM were able to achieve similar performance gains, this new system is built-in so all maps can work better. They said that "Players will immediately notice many missions that have made their system struggle with FPS now may be running much more smoothly!".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7300744681709909936gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7300744681709909936gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Not only that but controls should be "more seamless and accessible", mantling should be smoother, faster and work more correctly, leaning works better, there's now more subtitles for "nearly all AI barks", improved text quality, and a nasty bug from the previous release that allowed arrows to pass through AI characters at certain angles was solved.</p>
<p>Overall it seems like a good cleaning up release to make the game work better.</p>

      <title>Proton Hotfix updated for Apex Legends to work again on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A recent update to Apex Legends has been causing some havoc on Linux / Steam Deck, but now Valve have released a fresh update to Proton Hotfix to get it working again.</p>
<p>Before the Proton Hotfix update you were likely to see a black screen, with no ability to actually get to the menu. Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1765895650569486775" target="_blank">noted</a> on X the update about 14 hours ago, although it actually <em>only</em> just got set public (oops). So you should now see a Proton Hotfix update ready in your Steam Downloads.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18781894471709908036gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18781894471709908036gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Nice to see Valve once again react quite quickly for a very popular live-service game to work again (it's constantly in the Top 10 most played on Steam), especially as it's rated Steam Deck Verified. Around two days is not a bad turnaround time, although a shame that EA / Respawn aren't testing to ensure they don't break it, but we likely still need a fair bit bigger user share before such huge publishers will do that.</p>
<p>Valve appear to have set Proton Hotfix by default for Apex Legends, so you shouldn't need to do anything. However if it's not set for you just go into the Properties -&gt; Compatibility menu and set it directly yourself.</p>
<p>Apex Legends is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172470/Apex_Legends/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Metroidvania-inspired action roguelike &#39;An Amazing Wizard&#39; now on Kickstarter with a demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One game you should keep an eye on that was briefly covered here recently is An Amazing Wizard, an upcoming action roguelike that looks pretty fun. The developer just launched a Kickstarter campaign, and there's a demo available - and it has full Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Taking inspiration from Dead Cells, Risk of Rain, Wizard of Legend and more if you like any of those you'll probably feel right at home with An Amazing Wizard. I still think it's a dull name, but at least the game seems like a lot of fun.</p>
<p>"Defeat kings of everchanging worlds to recover your lost memories. With each difficulty level, the world becomes more and more distorted by Chaos. Break cosmic rules by designing your own Magic — add special effects to spells and merge them as you desire!"</p>

      <title>Steam Deck hits over 14,000 games rated Playable or Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another milestone for Valve here, as the Steam Deck has now managed to hit the 14,000 mark for games that are rated either Playable or Verified.</p>
<p>Using the list from <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified&amp;refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B1%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Playable" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> since that includes games you may own on Steam that have been delisted from the store, but are still playable, it's an impressive number and there's going to be something for everyone. Although, Valve's rating system is just one measure, even some Unsupported games can be made to run - and you can install and play anything, this is just what Valve have actually tested.</p>
<p>The numbers are at time of writing with 14,010 overall Playable + Verified: </p>
<ul>
<li>Verified: 4,604</li>
<li>Playable: 9,406</li>
<li>Unsupported: 3,920</li>

      <title>Command &amp; Conquer The Ultimate Collection launched on Steam (and other classics)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>EA just surprised launched the Command &amp; Conquer The Ultimate Collection on Steam in a big bundle, along with a few other classic titles. As someone who grew up playing Command &amp; Conquer, I love to see them all revived like this making them really easy to pick up properly.</p>
<p>The downside to how EA have done it; you have to buy them all in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/39394/Command__Conquer_The_Ultimate_Collection/" target="_blank">one big bundle</a>.</p>
<p>Command &amp; Conquer The Ultimate Collection includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Command &amp; Conquer</li>
<li>Command &amp; Conquer: The Covert Operations</li>
<li>Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert</li>
<li>Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert: Counterstrike</li>
<li>Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert: The Aftermath</li>
<li>Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian Sun</li>
<li>Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian Sun Firestorm</li>
<li>Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2</li>
<li>Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2: Yuri's Revenge</li>
<li>Command &amp; Conquer: Renegade</li>
<li>Command &amp; Conquer: Generals</li>
<li>Command &amp; Conquer: Generals: Zero Hour</li>
<li>Command &amp; Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars</li>
<li>Command &amp; Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars: Kane's Wrath</li>
<li>Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3</li>
<li>Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3: Uprising</li>
<li>Command &amp; Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight</li>
</ul>
<p>Writing about it on Steam, EA's Jim Vessella (Producer on C&amp;C Remaster), wrote in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/36135791/view/4119176366786018866" target="_blank">announcement</a> about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How did this come to happen? Well, a while back I heard some team members at EA had the desire to launch some of our classic titles on Steam. After hearing about this initiative, several of us proposed we include the C&amp;C Ultimate Collection. We knew this has been a request of the C&amp;C community for over a decade, and has been an equal goal of us passionate C&amp;C folks around the company. As such, a dedicated strike team here at EA has been pushing to make this a reality - but we knew we couldn't do it alone. So in the spirit of our community collaboration from the Remastered Collection, we reached out to a small group of the C&amp;C Community to understand how we could best deliver the Ultimate Collection on Steam.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition they've launched the map editors FinalSun and FinalAlert 2 as open source under the GPL, these can be launched directly from Tiberian Sun and Red Alert 2. The source code appears packaged with the games on Steam in the installed folder.</p>
<p>If C&amp;C is not your thing, a bunch of other EA classics also launched on Steam including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2741560/Sim_City_3000_Unlimited/" target="_blank">SimCity 3000 Unlimited</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2203860/Populous/" target="_blank">Populous</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2616450/Populous_II_Trials_of_the_Olympian_Gods/" target="_blank">Populous 2: Trials of the Olympic Gods</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2616430/Populous_The_Beginning/" target="_blank">Populous: The Beginning</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1996630/Dungeon_Keeper_Gold/" target="_blank">Dungeon Keeper Gold</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2616460/Dungeon_Keeper_2/" target="_blank">Dungeon Keeper 2</a></li>

<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/24880/The_Saboteur/" target="_blank">The Saboteur</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to Valve's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a>, some of them should be playable on Linux / Steam Deck too in only a few clicks. Although it seems a few of them do have problems running right now, so hopefully we will see Valve implement some fixes. For any problems you do encounter, remember to check for a post on the <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues" target="_blank">Proton GitHub</a> and add your log files.</p>
<p>Let me know how you get on with them in the comments.</p>

      <title>Retro-gaming Linux distribution Batocera 39 released </title>
      <author>nwildner</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://batocera.org" target="_blank">Batocera</a> is a well-known retro-gaming distribution that was forked from <a href="https://www.recalbox.com/" target="_blank">Recalbox</a> back in 2016.</p>
<p>Since then, Batocera has become one of the best turnkey solutions to bring old PCs back to life as emulation powerhouses, or to provide SBCs like Raspberry PI, Steam Deck, arm-based Android TV boxes and <a href="https://batocera.org/download" target="_blank">many others</a> a way to easily bundle all emulators, a nice GUI with Emulation Station and supplementary scripts for global and standalone emulators configuration, all in one Buildroot based Linux distribution.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5480247401709900984gol1.jpeg"/></p>
<p>Version 39 was released and while the complete changelog <a href="https://batocera.org/changelog#collapse0" target="_blank">is here</a>, let's highlight some of the more relevant items on this release: </p>
<p><strong>Special notes and Hardware:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wine now uses GE custom runner by default.</li>
<li>Due to some emulators being windows-only (Xenia, BigPemu, FPinball and Model2Emu), bottles will be provisioned in a different filesystem path because of the GE changes.</li>
<li>Completely disabling the TPM module will also be needed since even with Secure Boot disabled some interactions are mate with that hardware. See more <a href="https://wiki.batocera.org/secureboot#tpm" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
<li>Multiple hardware got initial support added including: AYN Loki MiniPro, Anbernic RG353V, ASUS ROG Ally, Raspberry Pi 5, Steam Deck OLED, Le-Potato v2 and a plethora of RK3568 based boards.</li>
<li>Support for Thunderbolt 3 / USB4 eGPU chassis.</li>
<li>Expanded steering wheel support.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>System related:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Kernel to 6.7.2.</li>
<li>Mesa to 23.3.4, VKD3D-Proton to 2.11.1, Xorg Server to 21.1.10, XWayland to 23.2.3.</li>
<li>SDL2 to 2.28.5, Sound Open Firmware to 2023.12, Bluez to 5.71, Pipewire to 1.0.0.</li>
<li>NVIDIA to 545.29.06 and NVIDIA legacy driver to 470.223.02.</li>
<li>Vulkan stack to support 1.3.275.</li>
<li>Wine Tricks to 20240105 and Proton &amp; Lutris replaced by the Glorious Eggroll custom WINE runner.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, if you need to dual-boot your current distribution with Batocera, while there is no graphical installer to help you on that matter, there is a documented step-by-step <a href="https://wiki.batocera.org/dual_boot_ubuntu_batocera.linux" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Fixes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fallback to OpenGL if Vulkan is configured as API but no Vulkan-enabled GPU is provided.</li>
<li>Hostname was not sent to DHCP server and hostnames from DHCP were not honored.</li>
<li>Multiple bugs on Install-to-disk feature.</li>
<li>Multiple storage related bugs (NVMe automount, ANYEXTERNAL storage for ROMs and BIOS).</li>
<li>Prime for NVIDIA and AMD defaults index to 1(eGPU).</li>

      <title>Fedora Workstation 41 will drop GNOME X.Org session as fallback option</title>
      <author>nwildner</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While defaulting to <a href="https://pagure.io/fesco/issue/1615" target="_blank">Wayland</a> since version 25 of <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/WaylandByDefault" target="_blank">Fedora Workstation</a> (GNOME), and Fedora version 34 for the KDE <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/34/ChangeSet#Wayland_by_Default_for_KDE_Plasma_Desktop" target="_blank">Plasma Desktop</a> spin, this Linux distribution intends to completely ditch X.Org session as fallback for GNOME on release 41.</p>
<p>Quoting Jens Petersen from the change number 414 of fedora-workstation <a href="https://pagure.io/fedora-workstation/issue/414#comment-899128" target="_blank">Pague</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fedora Workstation WG discussed this today and we agreed we should do this for Fedora 41, since it is really too late already for F40 and it should really be handled as a System Wide Change anyway.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on that message we can conclude that while it is too late to have that change merged into Fedora 40, it is likely that this will be the default for Fedora 41, making GNOME completely bound to Wayland with no X.Org fallback.</p>
<p>While one user on that same discussion <a href="https://pagure.io/fedora-workstation/issue/414#comment-899421" target="_blank">stated</a> that screen reader users will still rely on the X11 session because of some <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/at-spi2-core/-/issues/163" target="_blank">GNOME</a> bugs, it is likely that any software still using X11 by default will not be distributed with the installation ISO as <a href="https://pagure.io/fedora-workstation/issue/414#comment-899438" target="_blank">pointed out</a> by Neal Gompa.</p>
<p>Other than that, no matter if you are an <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/nvidia-550-40-07-beta-driver-released-with-fixes-for-vrr-and-wayland/" target="_blank">NVIDIA</a>, Intel or AMD user, this might be a really good move starting with Fedora because GNOME developers can focus on fixing existing Wayland bugs instead of wasting time with three layers (X.Org, Wayland and in some cases XWayland).</p>
<p>The ChangeSet page for that <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/41/ChangeSet" target="_blank">Fedora 41</a> was not updated with this change as per the date of this article.</p>

      <title>Squad-based shooter Enlisted: Reinforced from Gaijin is coming to Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Enlisted: Reinforced is a World War II squad-based shooter from War Thunder publisher Gaijin, and it was recently revealed to be finally coming to Steam.</p>
<p>Quite different to other shooters out there as you're not just commanding a single character, but instead the whole squad. When your current character dies, you'll swap over to another in your squad. You won't just be playing as infantry on the ground though but there's also around 350 vehicles including tanks, armoured cards, aircraft (both fighters and bombers) and more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="69OwvpQAgIo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/25e94491de482a304a6d2b526052226d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/69OwvpQAgIo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release: "Enlisted: Reinforced will include all maps, soldier squads, weapons, ground vehicles, aircraft, and gameplay features that have been added to Enlisted as the game expanded and evolved. Players will experience WW2 as soldiers of all major powers (USA, UK, Australia, USSR, Germany, Italy and Japan), will see key battles and theaters of war (Pacific, Normandy, Berlin, Stalingrad, Moscow, Ardennes and Tunisia), and will use hundreds of realistically recreated weapons and vehicles, which are grouped into four convenient tech trees. Improved matchmaking system chooses opponents with an arsenal of approximately the same level."</p>
<p>Not only is it coming to Steam, but they recently updated the system requirements to note Linux support too. I've reached out Gaijin to confirm on that. So will update on any reply received. <strong>Update 15:52 UTC</strong>: Gaijin replied to confirm the "developers are working on Linux support" but couldn't say anything else for now.</p>

      <title>KeeperRL 1.0 is out now, merging Dungeon Keeper and a little Dwarf Fortress</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Something around 11 years later, KeeperRL 1.0 has officially been released! A good choice perhaps for people who find Dwarf Fortress a little too much, and enjoy dungeon building.</p>
<p>More about it: "KeeperRL is an ambitious dungeon simulator with roguelike and RPG elements. Take the role of an evil wizard and study the methods of black magic. Equip your minions and explore the world, murder innocent villagers and burn their homes. Build your dungeon, lay traps and prepare for an assault of angry heroes.</p>
<p>When you control your minions the game changes into a classic roguelike, with turn-based and very tactical combat. You can also play as an adventurer and assault dungeons made by you or other players."</p>

<p>It's not the end though, as the developer clearly has plans to expand it further. They said a 1.1 version is due later this year that will "contain more content and gameplay that didn't make it to the 1.0, including another playable keeper faction".</p>
<p>KeeperRL has Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified! The code is also <a href="https://github.com/miki151/keeperrl" target="_blank">open source</a> under the GPL.</p>

      <title>Nintendo DS emulator DraStic became free of charge after Yuzu case</title>
      <author>nwildner</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After Yuzu emulator<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/yuzu-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-2-4-million-and-will-entirely-shut-down/" target="_blank"> owners agreed</a> to pay Nintendo $2.4 million USD and EmuDeck also announcing Yuzu and Citra<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/emudeck-removes-yuzu-and-citra-emulator-support/" target="_blank"> removal</a> right after the court settlement became available on the internet, Nintendo DS emulator DraStic turned free on Android Play Store (previously $4.99).</p>
<p>The developer Exophase wrote “I want to make it clear that I don’t have any kind of financial incentive”, stating that the Yuzu situation made it more urgent for this software to go free and opensource due to the implications that legal case could cause to DraStic. Quoting the Developer post on DraStic Discord server:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I just changed the app on GPlay to free. I don’t intend to even have it on there for that much longer but I want to make it clear that I don’t have any kind of financial incentive to not opening the source. Releasing the source in short order is something I fully intend on doing.</p>
<p>This change can’t be undone, so that’s it. I was already planning on this a while ago so it’s not simply due to the Nintendo stuff, that just made the whole process more urgent which I guess is a good thing because I’m terrible at doing things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that Drastic also has a<a href="https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/DraStic" target="_blank"> "Linux" version</a> for Raspberry Pi devices usually distributed with retro-gaming focused distributions like<a href="https://wiki.batocera.org/systems:nds#drastic" target="_blank"> Batocera</a> so, this source code release might be a starting point for this emulator to be ported to other architectures like x86_64.</p>

      <title>FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage updated with Steam Deck support and no more DRM</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now known as FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage Collector's Edition, this classic racer has received a fresh big upgrade to ensure it runs nicely and is now Steam Deck Verified. This update is thanks to <a href="https://www.zoom-platform.com" target="_blank">ZOOM Platform Media</a> / Jordan Freeman Group, who run their own store that keeps updating old games, but they've recently been getting more of these updates onto Steam too.</p>
<p>The latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/12360/view/4148449764353159269" target="_blank">update</a> on Steam mentions these improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The game is now Steam Deck Verified!</li>
<li>Removed Games for Windows LIVE DRM.</li>
<li>Added Achievements.</li>
<li>Added Czech, Hungarian, Polish, Russian, French, German, Italian, Spanish</li>
<li>Fixed bugs, crashes, and improved loading times.</li>
<li>The launcher is now optional, pressing play launches you directly in-game.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Nice to see more classics updated like this. Hopefully more will also see the same kind of treatment. There's such a huge list of classic games on Steam that could use a bit of TLC.</p>

      <title>Plasma 6 lands in Arch Linux, KDE neon teething issues and Plasma 6.1 heating up</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The dust is starting to settle now <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/the-future-has-arrived-kde-plasma-6-desktop-released/" target="_blank">the huge KDE Plasma 6 release</a> is out in the wild, with it beginning to land for more distributions but there's been some issues. Thankfully, the release wasn't anywhere near as troublesome as KDE Plasma 4, which I'm sure some readers have memories of.</p>
<p>Firstly, for people using KDE neon, it looks like they had some problems. As mentioned in a <a href="https://blog.neon.kde.org/2024/03/02/megarelease-teething-problems/" target="_blank">news post</a>, the developers of KDE neon apologised for packaging problems in the "User Edition", with more fixes coming as they continue putting out the fires of the new release.</p>
<p>Plasma 6 has also now <a href="https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/plasma-meta/" target="_blank">landed</a> for Arch Linux, so if you run updates you should see it available. Arch is a rolling distro, so it's no big surprise to see it be one of the first to fully roll it out. Much like the KDE neon update, you can expect some issues here and there while things become a bit more tested.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20617199111709811422gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20617199111709811422gol1.png"/></a>Pictured - KDE Plasma 6</em></p>
<p>Also, the first Plasma 6 point release is out with <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/6/6.0.1/" target="_blank">Plasma 6.0.1</a>. It's only a small one but with some necessary bug fixes.</p>
<p>Development on Plasma 6.1 is already heating up too. As Nate Graham has been <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2024/03/02/this-week-in-kde-a-smooth-release/" target="_blank">blogging</a> about recently like the addition of a new KWin effect called Hide Cursor, that allows you to automatically hide the cursor after a certain period. Plus an option to allow XWayland apps to eavesdrop on mouse buttons, various UI improvements are coming too like the newer Cube effect not working with fewer than 3 virtual desktops actually now telling you why and prompting you to add more. A previous <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2024/02/23/this-week-in-kde-real-fake-session-restore/" target="_blank">blog post</a> also highlighted a big fun new feature for Plasma 6.1 with a "fake" session restore (while they wait for the Wayland protocol to be finalised) that re-opens apps you had at the last logout, so all apps should <em>properly</em> re-launch on login and this works on X11 too.</p>
<p>Have you been testing out Plasma 6? What do you think? Let me know in the comments.</p>

      <title>Horizon Forbidden West system requirements up, devs mention &#39;portable gaming devices&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition lands on PC soon on March 21st, with Nixxes once again handling the porting of this previously PlayStation exclusive. The system requirements are also now up so we can see what to expect.</p>
<p>Interestingly, they clearly mentioned in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2420110/view/4174344193760832124" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam that they've included various graphics presets to ensure the game runs on "a wide variety of PC hardware, including portable gaming devices". So, hopefully, this means it will actually run on Steam Deck. Although we're probably looking at 30FPS there. You'll want to ensure you've got plenty of space free too - at 150GB it's quite a big one. The previous game in the series did have quite a few rough spots on Steam Deck though.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10909246421709809257gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10909246421709809257gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Specifications from Nixxes and Guerrilla.</em></p>
<p>As long as Valve get any fixes needed in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a>, at least Desktop Linux PC players shouldn't have much trouble with that. And with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/proton-90-has-another-beta-release-fixing-deathloop-and-warhammer-40000-darktide/" target="_blank">Proton 9.0 currently in progress</a> hopefully it will be in a good state.</p>
<p>Plenty of PC features coming with it like ultrawide support, NVIDIA DLSS 3, AMD FSR and Intel XeSS.</p>

      <title>Ghost of Tsushima comes to PC on May 16</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another PlayStation exclusive is heading to PC! Ghost of Tsushima DIRECTOR'S CUT has been announced with a May 16th release date. Great to see more console games coming to PC like this.</p>
<p>Nixxes are once again handling it after previously porting two Spider-Man games, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart and the upcoming Horizon Forbidden West. They will include plenty of PC features like ultrawide support, NVIDIA DLSS 3, AMD FSR 3, Intel XeSS, Steam Input support, and they even mention "portable PC gaming devices" (Steam Deck?).</p>
<p>More about it: "Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut is an action-adventure game set in feudal Japan. Protagonist Jin Sakai was raised and trained in the ways of the samurai. His world is shattered when a Mongol invasion defeats the samurai army of his home on Tsushima island, and he is faced with a difficult decision: honor the tradition and customs of his upbringing and maintain a fight he cannot win, or deviate from his samurai path to protect the island and its people by any means necessary.</p>
<p>In his quest to reclaim Tsushima, Jin seeks the guidance and support of old friends and new unlikely allies. He must break away from tradition, become a new kind of warrior, and protect what’s left of his home at all costs. "</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EzWBNwhb870"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/917587cd15a8fb992c160dac4d4734a1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EzWBNwhb870" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>No system requirements have been shown yet, so it's unclear if it will run on Steam Deck at all, but so far most Nixxes ports generally run around 30FPS on Steam Deck. Things will be different on Desktop Linux PCs of course, as long as <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> works with it, hopefully we won't have too much trouble. I've no doubt Valve will quickly patch-up Proton if there's problems like they've done before for other releases.</p>
<p>Available for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2215430/Ghost_of_Tsushima_DIRECTORS_CUT/" target="_blank">pre-purchase on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>EmuDeck 2.2 adds a new Pegasus Frontend, better Linux support, new emulators</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.emudeck.com" target="_blank">EmuDeck</a> 2.2 has rolled out, for those of you that want easy installs and configurations of emulators across various different systems like Steam Deck, Desktop Linux PCs and more.</p>
<p>One of the bigger changes this release is the inclusion of the <a href="https://pegasus-frontend.org" target="_blank">Pegasus Frontend</a> as an alternative to <a href="https://es-de.org" target="_blank">EmulationStation-DE</a> (now called ES-DE). EmuDeck 2.2 <em>also</em> comes with a new redesigned UI theme too as standard. You also get a theme selector for both of the front-ends.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3337045001709748100gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3337045001709748100gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Pegasus Frontend, from their website.</em></p>
<p>For Linux fans it sounds like a good one with direct ChimeraOS support, along with better support for a wide variety of Linux distributions. </p>
<p>There's also new emulators supported including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flycast</li>
<li>BigPemu</li>
<li>Sega Model 2 &amp; 3</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll get new Steam Input profiles, the ability to swap between Xbox and Nintendo button layouts, preliminary support for setting emulator languages through the EmuDeck, an emulator resolution selector and lots more tweaks and improvements all across the app itself and various emulators that got fixes. Dolphin for example got all profiles switched over to SDL, which they said "fixes the long-standing issue of controllers not working after waking up the Steam Deck from sleep". RetroArch also had its Input Driver switched to SDL and loads more.</p>
<p>Something that may prove a little controversial is that EmuDeck will still work with both Citra and Yuzu, as long as you have them installed, but EmuDeck will not provide them directly after <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/yuzu-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-2-4-million-and-will-entirely-shut-down/" target="_blank">they were both shut down by Nintendo</a>. They also won't remove them for people who had them installed initially.</p>

      <title>Crusader Kings 3 adds plagues, a legitimacy system and male pattern baldness</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oh hey, some representation for me, I can be as bald as real life in Crusader Kings 3 now with the latest free update adding a bunch of new features. Oh there's also a big new DLC too.</p>
<p>The 1.12.1 Scythe update sounds like quite a fun one that actually might pull me back in again. Adding in Plagues that can spread across the map, along with plenty of events to go with it. There's also Legitimacy, a new system to "measure the perception of your right to rule", some new graphics and visual effects, a few new animations and my then there's the new balding hairstyles along with male pattern baldness - goodie.</p>
<p>On top of that the new expansion, Legends of the Dead, is out too adding the likes of:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Legends: Commission an epic retelling of your family history or build your own heroic reputation through great deeds. Promote this legend, far and wide, and see how the stories of the past reverberate through the centuries, and add even more glory to legendary dynasties.</li>
<li>Legendary Playstyle: Leverage your living legend status through new Decisions and actions, keeping the stories of your family in the minds of a continent, strengthening the legitimacy of your rule and allowing further choices. </li>
<li>Legendary Buildings: Your legendary reputation gives you access to new elite buildings, cementing your legacy for future generations.</li>
<li>Legendary Feasts: Poets and bards can ornament your celebrations with songs and odes to your greatness, inspiring your guests to spread the tale of your legendary generosity.</li>
<li>Court Chroniclers: Hire an official historian to spread the story of your dynasty’s great accomplishments, or use your poets and musicians to turn your actions into art.</li>
<li>Two New Legacies: A new Heroic dynastic Legacy for the heirs of legendary characters, even using the great deeds of ancestors to justify claims from the distant past, as well as a Legitimacy Legacy that promotes your dynasty as the true rulers of the realm.</li>
<li>Illness and Mourning: New diseases like the Bloody Flux, Measles and Holy Fire may ravage your court, but you can honor your deceased loved ones with dignified Funeral rites, according to your faith.</li>
<li>The Black Death: The greatest scourge of the Middle Ages strikes down noble and commoner alike, radically transforming the political and social environment. Prepare your realm and prepare your soul, because a rampaging plague may be the strongest enemy facing your rule.</li>
<li>New Art: Both life and death are given new energy with the celebrated art style that Crusader Kings III fans have come to appreciate. A new exclusive Map Table, new varieties of clothing, unit models and holding designs for extra flavor.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Wine Direct3D 12 to Vulkan translation library vkd3d v1.11 released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Valve continue pushing forward for gamers with <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton" target="_blank">VKD3D-Proton</a>, the Wine team continue building up their own separate Direct3D 12 to Vulkan translation library with a new release out now.</p>
<p>vkd3d v1.11 brings these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial support for compiling legacy Direct3D bytecode to SPIR-V.</li>
<li>Initial HLSL compiler support for compiling effect profiles.</li>
<li>Miscellaneous bug fixes and performance improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p>The full complete changelog with all additions can be found on the <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/vkd3d/-/releases/vkd3d-1.11" target="_blank">Wine GitLab</a>. </p>
<p>So why the two projects? Well, they have quite different goals overall.</p>
<p>Valve want things ready a lot faster, and with dedicated support for all the latest games in Proton. Valve are a lot more aggressive on getting all the newest possible stuff inside VKD3D-Proton. Meanwhile Wine directly has a much wider software target, including various applications (not just games).</p>

      <title>Albion Online is finally getting a server for Europe</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Albion Online is one of the few MMOs with Linux support, and it's set to have a big change soon with the introduction of a server for Europe.</p>
<p>Previously the game only had one single server for everyone, which wasn't particularly great for ping times in various places. Eventually it split into East (Asia) and West (Americas) and now it's splitting again for people across Europe. As mentioned in the <a href="https://albiononline.com/news/coming-to-europe" target="_blank">announcement</a> this means a fresh new world for players, with better connection and pings for European players, along with event timings that actually fit the region.</p>
<p>The EU release is a little while away though, not due to throw its doors open until April 29th, with special Founders Packs and a Beta with Early Access due a few weeks before.</p>
<p><span style="background-color:var(--article-main-background); color:var(--font-color); font-size:16px">On Steam the game regularly sees around 10,000 concurrent players each day, but it's actually a </span><em style="background-color:var(--article-main-background); color:var(--font-color); font-size:16px">lot</em><span style="background-color:var(--article-main-background); color:var(--font-color); font-size:16px"> bigger than that.

      <title>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor gets Steam Deck Verified after an update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor, one of the most popular recent Early Access releases that follows the trend set by Vampire Survivors has been marked Steam Deck Verified after a recent update.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2321470/view/4185603192846049004" target="_blank">patch</a> released on February 27th the developers noted various improvements like UI sizing, specifically "in an effort to get Steam Deck Verified" and their work has paid off as Valve gave it the full green Steam Deck Verified tick. It also has a Platinum rating on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/2321470?device=pc" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> with many Linux users on a PC noting how well it runs.</p>
<p>Players seem to love it too with a Very Positive user rating, and it's regularly seeing a peak player count over around 20,000 each day. Although in this case, the game is spin-off of an already popular game so it was kind of to be expected that Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor would do quite well.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wKCsLITjd4A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7505b4540957d53e9f16dcd2b1fa871e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wKCsLITjd4A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Have you been diving down into the depths? Let me know what you think in the comments. It's one I'll be taking a proper look at sometime soon since I love these survivor-likes and the demo was awesome.</p>

      <title>Buy rude games on Steam without fear - Valve rolls out enhanced privacy</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You! Yes you! You can now buy as many of those rude games as you like without fear of prying eyes, as Valve just rolled out some enhanced privacy features to Steam. Noted in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/4149575031731807335" target="_blank">news post</a> on Steam Valve said the latest shopping cart update is now out of Beta, and available to everyone across all platforms.</p>
<p>What's included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inline gifting: Gift to multiple friends in one go, with streamlined messaging for hassle-free checkout.</li>
<li>One cart across all devices: Your cart now follows you seamlessly anywhere you're signed in to Steam (including Deck and mobile), ensuring a unified shopping experience wherever you go.</li>
<li>Private purchasing: Maintain your privacy by marking games as private before purchase, giving you control from the start.</li>
<li>Private Apps: Mark selected games as private so they are only visible to you, giving you more control over what you share with friends. This lets you keep your Steam Library visible to your friends, so they can see what you are playing and join in, yet also keep a few of those games just to yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Valve said they did make changes since the Beta based on feedback like DLC for private games also being set to private, although it's configurable. You also get a privacy indicator on your friends list when playing a private game so you know it's working.</p>
<p>We all know why Valve added the private game feature don't we? There's a rising amount of sex games on Steam, so it was inevitable really. </p>

      <title>GNOME pulls in experimental variable refresh rate (VRR) support for GNOME 46</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After years of waiting, experimental support for variable refresh rate (VRR) has landed for GNOME, and thankfully it will be in the GNOME 46 release. The GNOME 46 release is due out around March 20th as per the <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/FortySix" target="_blank">release schedule</a>, but a Release Candidate was just released for testing that also includes this new VRR code.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/-/merge_requests/1154" target="_blank">Merge Request</a> for "backends/native: Add support for variable refresh rate" that's been open since March 2020 was accepted and pulled in on March 2nd, 2024. Thanks to the approved <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/Teams/Releng/freeze-breaks/-/issues/175" target="_blank">Feature freeze exception</a>, it was also accepted into GNOME 46.</p>
<p>Since the feature is noted to be experimental, it's currently hidden behind a gsetting. So unless GNOME user specifically set, they won't see the setting and Mutter's behaviour will remain the same. But if used you will end up seeing it in your GNOME settings for your monitor as per the <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/Teams/Releng/freeze-breaks/-/issues/174" target="_blank">UI freeze break request for Variable Refresh Rate</a>:</p>

<p>Really good to see. Linux desktops in the last year have really begun to feel properly modern with more expected features being pulled in.</p>

      <title>AMDGPU driver for Linux 6.7 enforces lower power limits from vBIOS</title>
      <author>nwildner</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Starting with Linux kernel 6.7, users of the AMDGPU driver are not be able to set power limits below the recommended values advised by the AMD Engineering team on the hardware itself. The new low-power limits are intentionally enforced and set based on each card vBIOS specification.</p>
<p>While before the recent 6.7 kernel release the maximum power limit was on-par with what is specified at the vBIOS, but the driver didn't enforce any lower power limits, making the driver really good for fine-tuning it for power saving purposes. However, setting lower power limits that didn't match with what is specified at the vBIOS might harm the GPU as stated on the <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/2992#note_2310545" target="_blank">bug report</a> that lead to this implementation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This has been discussed on the<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/amd-gfx/6e93a748-786e-4aca-9b97-65b25e664436@leemhuis.info/T/#m88ef9189ceaff46e9b7be387784c7409af3ba755" target="_blank"> amd-gfx M/L,</a> and the conclusion was that under-powering outside of the bounding box is potentially dangerous and might damage the hardware. This won't be added back in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And from the amd-gfx mail list:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The change aligns the driver what has been validated on each board design.  Windows uses the same limits.  Using values lower than the validated range can lead to undefined behavior and could potentially damage your hardware.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other interesting information extracted from that mail list discussion is that the AMDGPU Linux driver will basically work the same way as the Windows driver, obeying the values stated at vBIOS level.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Opinion:</strong> While the changes seem frustrating at first glance for those who want some extra power saving features for computers running on idle, this is an open source driver and it will likely not take long for third party repositories (aur, ppa, copr) to distribute unpatched versions of this module. This already happened in the past with ZFS, NVIDIA, etc. Although, as mentioned, you run the risk of hardware damage if you do decide to use any that pop up.</p>

      <title>EmuDeck removes Yuzu And Citra emulator support</title>
      <author>Smellbringer</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The news of the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/yuzu-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-2-4-million-and-will-entirely-shut-down/" target="_blank">Yuzu team agreeing to pay Nintendo $2.4 million</a> in damages and immediately shut down all operations sent shock waves through the emulation landscape. Quite awkward for the likes of EmuDeck, who announced that it would no longer support Yuzu or Citra as of the recently released Version 2.1.5.</p>
<p>For those not aware, <a href="https://www.emudeck.com/" target="_blank">EmuDeck </a>is a utility that uses scripts to download and configure emulators in the hopes of making things easier for those unfamiliar with emulators. A massive help for those who don't want to spend time learning how to make emualtors work. Due to the deletion of Yuzu and Citra from GitHub however, it's simply not possible for EmuDeck's scripts to download the emulators. So this update, while painful, was of high importance and it is recommended you update as soon as possible.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14342901831709637284gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14342901831709637284gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>News taken from the EmuDeck Discord</em></p>
<p>If you are upgrading from a previous version however then your installs of Yuzu and Citra won't be deleted. So there's no need to fear upgrading to the newest version. New users to EmuDeck however will be completely out of luck.</p>
<p>For now <a href="https://ryujinx.org/" target="_blank">Ryujinx </a>will be the default and only Nintendo Switch emulator for EmuDeck while the Nintendo 3DS will simply have no support sadly. The team has stated that they will look into <a href="https://panda3ds.com/" target="_blank">Panda3DS</a> as a solution and will provide updates when available. Luckily if the memes are to be believed it's surprisingly easy to mod a Nintendo 3DS.</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer Part 39: Beyond Heretic</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-38-the-stagnant-demesne/" target="_blank">Part 38: The Stagnant Demesne</a></strong></p>
<p>I stated before that neither of the contemporary <em>HeXen</em> ports, Linux Hexen and its fork HHexen, supported MIDI music playback through the /dev/sequencer device. This still remains the case, but hiding on the venerable SunSITE network I found the linux-hexen-0.99last.tar.bz2 archive, the only online trace of another early <em>HeXen</em> source port released in December 1999 by Russian programmer Stanislav Nesterov, as opposed to the aforementioned source ports done by Karl Robillard and Dan Olson.</p>
<p>Nesterov had adapted the musserver and sndserver code from Andre Werthmann's Linux Heretic to be usable with <em>HeXen</em>, and it was exactly what I was looking for. It supports running the game with X11, SVGAlib, as well as GGI binaries, and even allows for playing the music off the CD-ROM if you prefer. It seemed my desire to continue the Serpent Riders Trilogy from Linux while still utilizing my Sound Blaster 16 had been fulfilled; that is, until I got stumped by the return of a nasty bug.</p>
<p>First noticeable in sooth when you reach the bell tower on the first map, a few specific sound effects can break in such a way as to interfere with the other sound effects on the level. After a four day troubleshoot I determined this was due to a bad interaction with the sound sequence code, in particular the "StoneMove", "MetalMove", "LavaMove", and "WaterMove" sounds that are all set to "playrepeat" in the sndseq.lmp script included as part of the <em>HeXen</em> WAD file.</p>
<p>The solution I settled on was zeroing the values for those effects in the sound.c source files. This stopped these sounds from playing at all, but as they are mere grinding and gurgling noises which go for the most part unnoticed, I did not find this to be too much of a sacrifice. Even then a few other events still spam the sound server to the point of disrupting other sound effects, such as with one fireball trap in the Castle of Grief, but the "playrepeat" sounds were the worst offenders.</p>
<p>In sorting this issue I found out that SDL Hexen, a further fork of Linux Hexen from February 2000, also suffered from the same problem, but a build of HHexen from June 2000 did not. At this point, and given that I had already made a number of tweaks to Nesterov's build files in order to achieve my desired behaviour, I decided that I had changed the code enough under the hood to now qualify as my own fork. To that end, I am pleased to introduce VoxWare HeXen to the world.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17796757221709580893gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17796757221709580893gol6.png"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8416524201709580896gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/8416524201709580896gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>Also included is a patch file I discovered that allows you to use the xdelta utility to update the HEXEN.WAD file off the CD-ROM to the required 1.1 release. There is no external configuration outside of launch flags, but you can still remap keys by editing the ~/.hexen/hexen.cfg file. It does not use standard Linux keycodes, but by swapping with strafe I managed to reassign jump to be on the Alt key. All seemed well, but little did I know that the level scripting in <em>HeXen</em> would be so janky.</p>
<p>The doors to the Heresiarch's Seminary refused to open when I first reached the hub, forcing me to bypass them by using the Dark Servant artifact to summon a Maulotaur I could hop on from a pillar to fluke my way inside. Then, when I reached the final area of the Gibbet level in the Castle of Grief hub, the Chaos Serpents refused to spawn in after I killed all the Afrits. The event scripting for that room is infamous for breaking, but it is usually done by killing the Chaos Serpents too fast, not the Afrits.</p>
<p>I ended up just loading up my save file from the end of the Seven Portals so I could also unlock all of the secret levels on my second go around, and this time the doors to the Heresiarch's Seminary opened without a hitch and the scripting at the end of the Gibbet worked as intended. Apart from a few glitches with some of the moving sectors and a few of the monsters vanishing everything else was smooth sailing; that is, until I started playing the <em>Deathkings of the Dark Citadel</em> expansion pack.</p>
<p>The Sump and Abattoir levels are impossible to complete due to certain Stalker enemies causing the game to segmentation fault. Unfortunately the worst room for this held the Flame Mask I needed to unlock the final Planet for the first hub, so I had to try some other ports. SDL Hexen had the same problem, while Chocolate Hexen and Crispy Hexen complained that my save files were corrupt, but the final release of HHexen did load my save files and allowed me to resolve those two maps.</p>
<p>Overall I enjoyed <em>HeXen</em>, with it sharing a lot of technical and design similarities with my all time favourite game <em>Blood</em>, but the elaborate puzzle hubs and downright mean enemies do wear you down after a while. This is not helped by the expansion pack doubling down by spawning even more enemies into already cleared maps; repopulating levels with Slaughtaurs and Stalkers is an affront to good taste no matter how patient you are. I think I need to blow off a little steam.</p>

      <title>Yuzu agrees to pay Nintendo $2.4 million and will entirely shut down (Citra for 3DS too)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/nintendo-goes-after-switch-emulator-yuzu-in-new-lawsuit/" target="_blank">recently filed</a> a lawsuit against the Yuzu team, it was pretty much inevitable this was going to happen wasn't it. <em>The end of Yuzu is officially here.</em></p>
<p>Nintendo and Tropic Haze LLC (Yuzu) filed a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.rid.56980/gov.uscourts.rid.56980.10.0.pdf" target="_blank">joint motion</a> for the court to enter Final Judgment and Permanent Injunction, so as I understand it's not quite final until the judge stamps it.</p>
<p>As a result the Yuzu team have announced their intention to shut <em>everything</em> down, and have agreed to pay Nintendo $2.4M USD in damages. As per the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.rid.56980/gov.uscourts.rid.56980.10.1.pdf" target="_blank">other document</a>, Yuzu will also transfer the <a href="https://yuzu-emu.org" target="_blank">domain name</a> used over to Nintendo and they have agreed to delete <em>every single thing</em> related to Yuzu that they have.</p>
<p>Writing in the yuzu Discord (and <a href="https://twitter.com/yuzuemu/status/1764733659444064671" target="_blank">posted</a> on X) the developer bunnei said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello yuz-ers and Citra fans:</p>
<p>We write today to inform you that yuzu and yuzu’s support of Citra are being discontinued, effective immediately.</p>
<p>yuzu and its team have always been against piracy. We started the projects in good faith, out of passion for Nintendo and its consoles and games, and were not intending to cause harm. But we see now that because our projects can circumvent Nintendo’s technological protection measures and allow users to play games outside of authorized hardware, they have led to extensive piracy. In particular, we have been deeply disappointed when users have used our software to leak game content prior to its release and ruin the experience for legitimate purchasers and fans.</p>
<p>We have come to the decision that we cannot continue to allow this to occur. Piracy was never our intention, and we believe that piracy of video games and on video game consoles should end. Effective today, we will be pulling our code repositories offline, discontinuing our Patreon accounts and Discord servers, and, soon, shutting down our websites. We hope our actions will be a small step toward ending piracy of all creators’ works.</p>
<p>Thank you for your years of support and for understanding our decision.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Update 05/03/24</strong>: While "support of Citra" was a bit ambiguous, it's now <a href="https://citra-emu.org" target="_blank">confirmed</a> Citra is also gone. The website is down and replaced with the statement, the GitHub is also gone.</p>
<p>Considering it's open source though, and has been out in the wild for some time now, it's unlikely this is <em>truly</em> the end because it's been so widely circulated. However, it will make it a lot harder for anyone seeking it out, and no doubt put off anyone from doing anything with Yuzu code they might still have.</p>
<p>For now, the <a href="https://ryujinx.org" target="_blank">Ryujinx</a> project at least still exists and as far as I know hasn't had Nintendo come knocking — yet.</p>

      <title>Sunshine game streaming v0.22.0 adds HDR on Linux, Wayland + NVIDIA improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sunshine along with Moonlight are popular ways to run your own game streaming system (as say an alternative to Steam Remote Play), and the latest Sunshine release sounds great for Linux gamers.</p>
<p>You would use Sunshine to host the stream, like on a good PC, and then run Moonlight on the system you wish to actually play the game on. Moonlight for example works on Linux, macOS, Windows, Android, iOS and more. It does take some setup, but when going it can be vastly better than other solutions and it's open source.</p>
<p>In the latest release of Sunshine v0.22.0 there's some nice additions including:</p>
<ul>
<li>(Input/Linux) Add native/pen touch support for Linux.</li>
<li>(Capture/Linux) Add HDR streaming support for Linux using KMS capture backend.</li>
<li>(Capture/Linux) Add KMS capture support for Nvidia GPUs running Wayland.</li>
<li>(Build/Linux) Add Fedora 39 docker image and rpm package.</li>
<li>(Capture/Linux) Display monitor indexes in logs for wlroots and KMS capture backends.</li>
<li>(Capture/Linux) Improve VAAPI encoding performance on Intel GPUs.</li>
<li>(Linux) Updated desktop files.</li>
<li>(Build/Linux) Optionally, allow using the system installation of wayland-protocols.</li>
<li>(Build/Linux) Make vaapi optional.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17559160191709559259gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17559160191709559259gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Helldivers 2</em></p>
<p>And then some nice bug fixes for Linux too:</p>
<ul>
<li>(Capture/Linux) Fix missing mouse cursor when using KMS capture on a GPU with hardware cursor support.</li>
<li>(Capture/Linux) Fix GL errors or corrupt video output on GPUs that use aux planes such as Intel Arc.</li>
<li>(Capture/Linux) Fix GL errors or corrupt video output on GPUs that use DRM modifiers on YUV buffers.</li>
<li>(Input/Linux) Fix scrolling in applications that don't support high-resolution scrolling.</li>
<li>(Input/Linux) Fix absolute mouse input being interpreted as touch input.</li>
<li>(Capture/Linux) Fix wlroots capture causing GL errors and crashes.</li>
<li>(Capture/Linux) Fix wlroots capture failing when the display scale factor was not 1.</li>
<li>(Capture/Linux) Fix excessive CPU usage when using wlroots capture backend.</li>
<li>(Capture/Linux) Fix capture of virtual displays created by the amdgpu kernel driver.</li>
<li>(Capture/Linux) Fix corrupt video output or stream disconnections if the display resolution changes while streaming.</li>
<li>(Capture/Linux) Fix color of aspect ratio padding in the capture image with VAAPI.</li>
<li>(Capture/Linux) Fix NVENC initialization error when using X11 capture with some GPUs.</li>
<li>(Capture/Linux) Replace vaTerminate method with dl handle.</li>
<li>(Capture/Linux) Fix capture when DRM is enabled and x11 is disabled.</li>
<li>(Tray/Linux) Fix random crash when the tray icon is updating.</li>
<li>(Linux) Use XDG spec for fetching config directory.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Wine pulls in code to eliminate a Vulkan performance issue for wow64</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wine is about to get just that little bit sweeter, with new code recently merged into the project that should work around a performance issue with Vulkan. Specifically it relates to how Wine was previously implementing wow64, a way of supporting 32-bit applications on 64bit.</p>
<p>As per the <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/merge_requests/5128" target="_blank">Merge Request</a> titled "winevulkan: Use VK_EXT_map_memory_placed for memory mapping on wow64" that was accepted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the new extension, we may implement wow64 correctly, without <code class="inline-code">VK_EXT_external_memory_host</code> hacks. This is both more correct and more performant (essentially eliminating Vulkan wow64 performance penalty).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_map_memory_placed.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_map_memory_placed</a> extension was released with Vulkan 1.3.278 spec update on February 16, 2024. The extension "allows a client to request that <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/vkMapMemory2KHR.html" target="_blank">vkMapMemory2KHR</a> attempt to place the memory map at a particular virtual address" and was worked on by Collabora, AMD, NVIDIA, Valve and CodeWeavers.</p>
<p>So once all graphics drivers are released with support for it, and Wine gets a release with it in (along with any needed Proton updates), it should work that little bit better.</p>

      <title>Steam smashes its peak players online record to over 34 million</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Starting 2024 off strong, Valve has seen Steam smash the all-time record once again for users actually online showing that weekends are a busy time for gamers.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/753/charts/" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> the record of 34,649,583 people online was hit Sunday, March 3rd at 2PM UTC and at the time 11,146,564 players were actually in game too. Steam has been regularly hitting over 33 million since January, but managed to first hit over 34 million on Saturday, March 2nd and then smashed the record again on Sunday.</p>
<p>Going by the stats the most popular games were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Counter-Strike 2</li>
<li>Dota 2</li>
<li>PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS</li>
<li>Apex Legends</li>
<li>Helldivers 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Seems like 2024 is going to be another massive year for Valve. 2023 was already pretty crazy with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/steam-users-redeemed-over-80-million-in-physical-wallet-cards-in-december-2023/" target="_blank">Steam users redeeming over $80 million in physical wallet cards</a>.</p>

<p>What were you playing this weekend? As you might have gathered, I was playing plenty of Helldivers 2. Freedom isn't going to bring itself to the galaxy.</p>

<p>Another month down according to Statcounter at least, Linux on the desktop is doing better than ever. Take it with your usual little pinch of salt like any survey sampling though.</p>
<p>We've finally cracked 4%, which for Linux is a pretty big thing. How do they do it? They collect stats from over 1.5 million websites, so they have a pretty good sample size for it.</p>
<p>Here's how things have looked over the last year+</p>
<ul>
<li>January 23 - 2.91%</li>
<li>February 23 - 2.94%</li>

      <title>All older games being sold in Germany on Steam now require a content rating</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For game developers that want to continue selling games in Germany, they'll need to ensure they actually have a content rating, including for older games. Hopefully there won't be any disruption, but Steam has a <em>huge</em> amount of games going back a great many years, so there may be a few that get caught-out in this.</p>
<p>Announced in a Steamworks Development <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/4183351393029705362" target="_blank">blog post by Valve</a>, they mentioned both Brazilian and German laws require content ratings for people to find age-appropriate content. However, there's been an ongoing legal debate as to whether that applied to new games only <em>or</em> to the back catalogue of older games too. Now the German regulatory authority BZKJ has "expressed to us their interpretation of the law applies to all games on Steam, including ones that were launched before the law came into effect".</p>
<p>So developers will now need to ensure their games have a rating to continue to be sold in Germany. The good news for developers, is that Steam has its own built-in rating system they can go opt to use, or game devs can go directly through the BZKJ.</p>
<p>For developers that released a game before January 2020, they may not have filled out the questionnaire for Valve's rating system, so they will need to go back and do it for their games.</p>

      <title>Game over for Roblox on Linux / Steam Deck as it&#39;s now blocked</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, there it is, the update for Roblox has arrived that now forcefully blocks it from working with Wine on Linux systems (like Steam Deck).</p>
<p>It's been a bit of a saga hasn't it? Roblox has always been somewhat iffy to play on Linux, at times being broken while people working on the likes of <a href="https://gitlab.com/brinkervii/grapejuice" target="_blank">Grapefruit</a> and <a href="https://vinegarhq.org" target="_blank">Vinegar</a> repeatedly kept up with changes to make it work. The Roblox developers then introduced Hyperion anti-cheat software, although they continued to make it work <em>unofficially</em> with Wine but that wasn't to last as a developer explained <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/we-can-probably-say-a-final-goodbye-to-roblox-on-linux-with-wine-soon/" target="_blank">that it has caused cheating</a>.</p>
<p>Now if you try to run it, you will simply be told "Wine is not supported.":</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10797727231709299834gol1.png"/></p>
<p>This is an <em>intentional</em> change by the Roblox dev team, to block Wine, as noted in the previous article linked above where a Roblox developer clearly replied to note it wouldn't work in future.</p>
<p>Despite what you may think of Roblox (and it's historically had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gXlauRB1EQ" target="_blank">plenty</a> of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTMF6xEiAaY" target="_blank">problems</a>) as one of the biggest gaming platforms ever, it's certainly a shame to see it go. There's plenty of people out there that have Roblox as their main thing, and so not being able to do it on Linux is quite a loss.</p>
<p>Any game that intentionally prevents it from working on Linux <em>is</em> a loss as it just increases the uphill battle Linux has as a gaming platform. There's not exactly many accessible alternatives to it for Linux fans.</p>
<p>Know any alternatives for people looking? Let readers know in the comments.</p>

      <title>Steam had a bit of a scam problem with fakes of Helldivers 2 and Palworld</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Not the first time it has happened, and likely won't be the last unless Valve implement some more security checks, but recently a few games tried scamming players by renaming into other popular games.</p>
<p>I've seen this a few times now, although it's suddenly coming into focus again because the games being imitated were current massive smash-hits.</p>
<p>The CEO of developer Arrowhead and the Helldivers 2 Creative Director, wrote a <a href="https://twitter.com/Pilestedt/status/1763526653467144241" target="_blank">post</a> on X noting that they were aware of store dupes posing as Helldivers 2. There was also a <a href="https://twitter.com/Bucky_cm/status/1763498651517853709" target="_blank">post</a> on X from the Community Manager at Pocketpair, developer on Palworld, who also spoke about the recent fakers imitating Palworld too. They've now been removed and hidden from the Steam store, but thanks to SteamDB we can go back and look.</p>
<p>A game that was previously called <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2630550/history/" target="_blank">DO NOT SMILE</a> renamed to Helldivers 2, and even changed the publisher and developer to match, it's especially nefarious because the now hidden <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2630550/HELLDIVERS_2/" target="_blank">Steam page</a> clearly looked like it was Helldivers 2. They even copied some of the recent news posts. Another game, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2607830/history/" target="_blank">Figurality</a>, did the exact same thing. Then there's the game <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2607810/" target="_blank">Stolen Mushrooms</a>, which attempted to be Palworld. <em>There may be others, but those I could find quite easily as examples.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4819635471709296151gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4819635471709296151gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Image from SteamDB</em></p>
<p>As you can see above from the shot of SteamDB, the developer changed basically everything they could to make it seem like their game was Helldivers 2. And when you look at the store page (hidden but still exists) it certainly would look like Helldivers 2 if you weren't properly clued up:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16168351011709296498gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16168351011709296498gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><em>Of course now there's no purchase button since it's been hidden, but you get the idea. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240301063242/store.steampowered.com/app/2630550/HELLDIVERS_2/" target="_blank">Wayback Machine</a> archive shows it did have purchases available before being hidden by Valve.</em></p>
<p>It seems it's quite easy to do, as apparently Valve don't have checks in place against this. I've reached out to Valve to see if they have any comment to share on what they will do in future to protect developers <em>and</em> customers from scams like this. Quite a concerning issue.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released the latest stable update to SteamOS for Steam Deck, and it includes quite a healthy dose of bug fixes and general improvements.</p>
<p>This is quite the bumper update that includes WiFi fixes, HDR improvements, incorrect gamma when streaming games, multiple performance improvements Persona 3 Reload and many other bug fixes. Nice to see all the recent Beta versions now rolled out for everyone!</p>
<p>SteamOS 3.5.17 brings all this from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4124805233776242149" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed black screen when launching Forza Horizon 4 and other titles on Steam Deck OLED.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where modifying settings in the desktop partition manager could prevent the SD card from being mounted and visible in Steam.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in desktop mode where dropping a folder on the desktop would erroneously create a shortcut for every item within the folder.</li>
<li>Fixed crashes when streaming to/from the Deck with Steam Remote Play.</li>
<li>Added a timeout to the boot selection screen.</li>
<li>Fixed a WiFi crash occurring where certain bands would cause the driver to attempt to set an incorrect spatial stream count.</li>
<li>Added a slider to control the brightness of the Status LED (Charger LED). This setting can be found under Settings -&gt; Display.</li>
<li>Fixed a case where WiFi would fail to connect in certain conditions.</li>
<li>Fixed a possible session crash when connecting an HDR display.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare session crash on application exit.</li>
<li>Improved handling of GPU crashes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple performance improvements for Persona 3 Reload.</li>
<li>Fixed the performance overlay displaying GPU clock speed as an instantaneous measurement rather than an average, resulting in misleading numbers.
<ul>
<li>This matches behavior of SteamOS 3.4.11.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improved a situation where a game's frame presentation could block because of buffers submitted by Steam or other windows, removing a potential source of game stutters.</li>
<li>Added an additional frame timing plot to the level four performance overlay. When the frame limiter or vsync is enabled, this shows timings of when frames are flipped to the display, rather than application-side rendering times.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue causing stutter in certain games that buffer multiple frames in advance.</li>
<li>Miscellaneous compositor performance improvements.</li>
<li>Reduced stutters when the upscale filter was set to FSR or NIS under high GPU load.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue regarding frame-pacing and stutter, especially affecting some external displays.</li>
<li>Fixed display sometimes getting stuck at 60Hz after returning from sleep on the Steam UI.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where a core could be stuck at 100% CPU if a game's window closed in an unclean way.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Graphics</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed HDR on some external DisplayPort displays being slightly desaturated.</li>
<li>Improved gamut mapping for HDR titles on Deck OLED.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in certain HDR titles wherein wiggling the cursor on the same frame as closing the game would cause incorrect colors in subsequent game launches.</li>
<li>Fixed incorrect colors (gamma) when using Steam In-Home Streaming.</li>
<li>Fixed consistency of application fade-ins/fade-outs.</li>
<li>Fixed slightly blurry image when streaming from the Deck with Steam Remote Play.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved controller's mouse and keyboard emulation when Steam is not running, including including vertical and horizontal scrolling support on left trackpad.</li>
<li>Added support for the HyperX Clutch Gladiate controllers.</li>
<li>Fixed a system restart when Joy-Con controllers are connected.</li>
<li>Slightly improved corner tracking on Steam Deck OLED trackpads.</li>
<li>Fixed a problem with elevated noise levels for trackpad pressure sensors. Affects only certain configurations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Firmware 120 (LCD) / 107 (OLED)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed several USB compatibility issues.</li>
<li>
<p>Developer note:  This changes the default USB mode back to XHCI (host-only) while issues with dual-role device mode are investigated.</p>
</li>
</ul>

      <title>Extraction horror shooter Level Zero: Extraction will get Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Level Zero: Extraction is an upcoming extraction horror game with high-stakes asymmetric PvPvPvE and FPS combat, and according to the developer they will add Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>More about it: "Level Zero: Extraction is a multiplayer extraction horror, a unique take on survival experience which blends the heart-pounding tension of asymmetric horrors with the high-stakes showdowns of extraction shooters. Embark on a dangerous scavenging expedition where 3 teams of up to 3 mercenaries compete for loot, and dare to come back. Or take on the role of two deadly alien monsters and hunt for human prey."</p>

<p>In a post on the official Steam forum a user asked if it will be playable on Steam Deck, to which a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1456940/discussions/0/4339851480051269915/#c4339851480053310622" target="_blank">developer replied</a> very clearly to say: "Hey! Yeah, we plan on adding SD support in the future". And of course since it will run with Proton, it will be playable on Desktop Linux too. Looks like it could be a good one to keep an eye on if you're in the mood for more survival shooters like it.</p>

      <title>Single-player extraction shooter ZERO Sievert adds controller support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ZERO Sievert is a top-down pixel-art single-player survival shooter from CABO Studio and Modern Wolf, and now it should be a lot nicer on Steam Deck or Desktop PCs with controllers.</p>
<p>It already worked quite well with Proton 8 on Linux, but it wasn't great on Steam Deck due to the lack of controller support. That's much less of a problem as of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1782120/view/4123679333853656818" target="_blank">latest update</a> as it adds full controller support to all actions, plus various parts of the UI were updated to work properly with it and just be more intuitive overall. The developer also said clearly they're now working towards making the game fully Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Testing it on Steam Deck myself it is vastly better, although the new controller support takes some getting used to, and some bits are a little tricky it's now properly playable.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="YN0tFfx72uU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/72efe24c759901d7366c292f16f4dda4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/YN0tFfx72uU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer also improved inventory sorting, AI combat is more realistic with weapon recoil, no more insane accuracy leading to your death. Overall, a pretty great update for an already incredibly fun game.</p>
<p>Seems like loading time and performance has improved a lot since I last played it too, it's looking really good now.</p>
<p>Available in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1782120/ZERO_Sievert/" target="_blank">Early Access on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>The HDMI Forum rejected AMD&#39;s open source HDMI 2.1 implementation</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you were hoping at some point to see HDMI 2.1+ on Linux with AMD + Mesa, you're out of luck right now as it's simply not going to be happening.</p>
<p>There's been a bug report on the Mesa GitLab of "<a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/1417" target="_blank">4k@120hz unavailable via HDMI 2.1</a>" that's been open for a few years now, with lots of comments and chatter about the issue. The problem is that HDMI is a proprietary interface, whereas DisplayPort is run by the international non-profit VESA, so it's much more complicated for HDMI support.</p>
<p>In an update on the bug report, AMD engineer Alex Deucher <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/1417#note_2303163" target="_blank">commented</a>: "The HDMI Forum has rejected our proposal unfortunately.  At this time an open source HDMI 2.1 implementation is not possible without running afoul of the HDMI Forum requirements."</p>
<p>So if you're on Linux, it's going to continue to be best to buy hardware that uses DisplayPort.</p>
<p>On the NVIDIA side though, it seems like it <em>may</em> not be an issue, as developer Karol Herbst wrote on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@karolherbst@chaos.social/112014061485741219" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>: "Even though AMD might not be able to add support for HDMI 2.1, nouveau certainly will as Nvidia's open source driver _also_ supports HDMI 2.1 so there is no reason to believe that at least some drivers can't support HDMI 2.1</p>
<p>It's quite backwards, but apparently having all the logic inside firmware (like Nvidia does) will probably help us implementing support for HDMI 2.1"</p>
<p>So perhaps in future AMD may be able to do something similar with their firmware.</p>

      <title>Open-source Vulkan driver for NVIDIA hardware in Mesa, NVK, is now ready for prime time</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The future of NVIDIA hardware on Linux is here with the open source Vulkan driver NVK in Mesa, as there's now a <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/27832" target="_blank">Merge Request</a> to have it shipped by default. Once approved and merged into Mesa, this should then ship with the Mesa 24.1 release due out hopefully at the start of May.</p>
<p>NVK is also now a conformant Vulkan 1.3 driver on Turing (RTX 2000 and GTX 1600 series), Ampere (RTX 3000 series), and Ada (RTX 4000 series) GPUs. From developer Faith Ekstrand in the Collabora <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/nvk-is-now-ready-for-prime-time.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>, "Not only have we jumped forward three Vulkan versions, but the new test runs were done with the GSP firmware enabled and includes Ampere and Ada GPUs. Also, unlike the initial 1.0 run, there are no hacks this time. Every test we passed in those conformance test runs also passes on upstream Mesa".</p>
<p>Ekstrand also mentioned lots of work went into ensuring DXVK (part of Proton for D3D9, D3D10 and D3D11 to Vulkan) would run completely out of the box with Mesa, and work continues on D3D12 to Vulkan work via VKD3D-Proton. </p>
<p>Additionally, the OpenGL support, they're still expecting Zink + NVK to be the plan, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/nvidia-open-source-driver-to-use-nvk-zink-for-opengl-on-newer-gpus/" target="_blank">as noted in our previous article</a>. Because it's much more performant than the old original nouveau OpenGL driver and should keep improving too on features, performance and stability.</p>
<p>So in later distribution releases, you should hopefully get access to it out of the box with no configuration required if you have an NVIDIA GPU that's currently supported.</p>
<p>What a great time for open source. Fantastic work by all involved in this project.</p>

      <title>Valve fixes Remote Play on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After recently releasing a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/valve-release-big-stable-steam-client-update-for-steam-steam-deck/" target="_blank">big Stable Steam Client update</a> for Steam Deck and Desktop PCs, I highlighted that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/remote-play-broken-on-steam-deck-with-the-february-stable-update/" target="_blank">Remote Play was broken on Steam Deck</a> - and so Valve has now fixed it.</p>
<p>Initially putting out a quick Beta update, and then <em>very</em> shortly after putting it into Stable so all users will be able to update now and have working Remote Play. I've tested it across a couple titles from my desktop Linux PC to the Steam Deck, and yup — visual, audio and input are all working properly with no more infinite Steam loading screen.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4124805233776542002" target="_blank">changelog</a> is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the 'Verifying Installation' message incorrectly showing on every startup.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Remote Play</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed infinite loading animation when streaming from another PC</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see Valve get such a big feature fixed up, still a shame to see the initial update rolled out with it broken though. So hopefully checks will be done to prevent this in future.</p>
<p>This is great, as Remote Play is such an incredibly useful feature for when you want to run some bigger games smoother on Steam Deck and you have a PC, so you can sit somewhere super comfortable and just stream it instead of sitting at a desk.</p>

      <title>5 years later Valve finally gives Windows compatibility tool Proton a logo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Can you believe it? <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a>, the compatibility layer that allows Windows games to run on Steam Deck / Linux PCs didn't actually have a proper logo for over 5 years.</p>
<p>Not everything actually <em>needs</em> a logo of course, but it did feel somewhat odd for a piece of software so essential to Valve's plans to just be completely blank on that. With all the entries of Proton in Steam just showing up blank with their name and version, it was about time Valve made it at least a tiny bit <em>prettier</em> don't you think?</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7085450281709146217gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Proton logo - Valve</em></p>
<p>Proton has been around <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2018/08/valve-officially-confirm-a-new-version-of-steam-play-which-includes-a-modified-version-of-wine/" target="_blank">since August 2018</a>! 5 and a half years! Hard to imagine trying to game on Linux without it now, it's so incredibly useful and just amazing tech. The Steam Deck obviously wouldn't have been such a success without it, and it's crazy to think the original Steam Machines launched as they did with so few popular games. Proton is a true blessing, enabling tens of thousands of games to work on Linux systems like the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>I guess I can finally retire the silly little <a href="http://www.gamingonlinux.com/uploads/tagline_gallery/proton.jpg" target="_blank">placeholder</a> logo I threw out a long time ago when I needed <em>something</em> for it. Rest easy my child, your time is over.</p>
<p>Also, in case you missed it, Valve also recently launched the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/proton-9-now-in-beta-with-improved-game-compatibility-for-steam-deck-linux/" target="_blank">first Beta of Proton 9.0</a> and a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/proton-experimental-updated-with-proton-9-adds-fixes-for-helldivers-2-and-more/" target="_blank">new Proton Experimental version</a>. Be sure to also read the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/5-years-ago-valve-released-proton-forever-changing-linux-gaming/" target="_blank">overview I did back when Proton turned 5</a> which nicely sums things up.</p>

      <title>Lots more content is coming to Last Epoch and controller support improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Last Epoch recently released on Steam with Native Linux support, an offline mode and controller support but the developers at Eleventh Hour Games plan to keep improving it all.</p>
<p>In an update posted on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/899770/view/4194610392091503963" target="_blank">Steam</a> the developer noted that there's patches due soon for lots of reported issues, and they plan to continue weekly updates to keep fixing up issues and acting on player feedback.</p>
<p>There were quite a number of server issues though, as it was a lot more popular than expected. It's another early 2024 Steam hit, seeing a peak player count of 264,708 players online at the same time 3 days ago. Things are calmer now but it did show up some "unanticipated bottlenecks" in their backend and they said to expect more information later about the cause. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18224783921709140675gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Some more good news is that we can expect to see more localization improvements, major content planned for a 1.1 update including more work from player feedback and a "heavy emphasis on expanding end-game content" as they said they are "wholly committed to making the best ARPG in the genre, and listening to our amazing community is a big part of that".</p>
<p>For players on Steam Deck or PC with a gamepad, expect more improvements there. While the 1.0 release had an "immense amount of gamepad updates" they have "a lot of updates coming before 1.1 that will improve the experience even further, including better navigation of certain panels" as they plan to release LE on consoles so they're going to ensure gamepad is a "top notch" experience.</p>

      <title>nullptr is an action puzzle hacking game where every second counts</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Due to release sometime in Q3 2024, developer Jeferson Silva has recently put up a demo for their action puzzle hacking game nullptr.</p>
<p>A fast paced action puzzle game where you play the role of a hacker. Take down megacorporations by invading their servers, downloading their data and getting out without being detected. Outwit defensive sentry programs and expose the perfect route to access the databases. Once you're connected to one of the servers ports, you have 20 seconds to hack security systems, reprogram the server to evade sentinel programs and download data. Your goal is to find or create safe routes to download all databases in each server without being traced.</p>
<p>Check out the gameplay teaser:</p>

      <title>Lots of exciting updates coming to the free &amp; open source RPG Veloren</title>
      <author>nwildner</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Veloren, the free and open source action-adventure role-playing voxel game made in Rust keeps evolving. Since its last public <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/07/multiplayer-voxel-rpg-veloren-v015-is-out-adding-the-first-world-boss/" target="_blank">v0.15 release in July 2023</a>, much has changed and lots of improvements were made so far.</p>
<p>This is a compilation of what is considered important by the core contributors on the game so far:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13106773381709124909gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13106773381709124909gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Discord links and Gitlab merge requests to have bi-directional linking for better tracking of feature requests.</li>
<li>A draft version of a Roadmap was added to Gitlab defining priorities and project focus.</li>
<li>Translation can now be done through <a href="https://translate.codeberg.org/engage/veloren/" target="_blank">Weblate</a>, and it is fully integrated with the project Gitlab.</li>
<li>A branch was created for food diversification so, expect a lot of new foods to be implemented in-game.</li>
<li>Craftable shovels used to dig up mud and graves for loot.</li>
<li>Network Library update.</li>
<li>Locations now available during character selection.</li>
<li>Better cursor locking on Wayland.</li>
<li>Singleplayer map GUI with map selection for easier world selection.</li>
<li>Frost Giga boss rework and testing.</li>
<li>Toolchain update to keep it as compatible as possible with all OSs supported.</li>
<li>Melee, Projectile and Beam attacks benefit on critical by precision when attacking from behind, or partial precision when attacking from sides. Aiming for the head with projectiles can also trigger precision events that will lead to critical hits.</li>
<li>Server configuration settings moved from<code class="inline-code"> server/server_config/settings.ron:metrics_address</code> to <code class="inline-code">server-cli/settings.ron:web_address</code></li>
<li>A merge was made to enable plugin-defined items for those who want to modify the game.</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">WGPU</code> added support to OpenGL3.3 so, if you have a more modest PC with no Vulkan support, you might be able to run Veloren, while modern PCs running Vulkan or DirectX 12 will see a slightly increase in performance.</li>
<li>Cliff towns and mesa biomes (those look beautiful),</li>
<li>More potions were added to the game.</li>
<li>Fixes related to armor buffs. </li>
<li>Re-enabling kelp on sea and crustaceous taming. </li>
<li>Wiki tool integration to track drop related data from mobs showing item name, rarity (percentage) and quantity.</li>
<li>Over the shoulder aiming for ranged attacks, customizable in the game settings. This was done because the contributors didn't like the way third person camera handled aiming. This implementation ended up fixing some crosshair issues as well.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8678306741709125315gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8678306741709125315gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>While it is hard to provide a curated list of everything that was implemented, these are some "minor" implementations that are scattered throughout all the blog updates and reflect the constant maintenance of the project and their continuous effort in making this game awesome:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mob related improvements: new mobs, AI, models, code refactor, random bugfixes like "division by zero", item quantity display, animations, pet bugs, etc).</li>
<li>Updates in scenario related stuff (points of interest, outpost, abandoned ruins, vampire castles, terracota ruins, airships, textures, etc).</li>
<li>World generation overall fixes.</li>
<li>Seasonal events like Halloween and Christmas.</li>
<li>Shaders, test on rendering algorithms, faster colour mapping, screenshot conversion optimization, performance optimizations overall.</li>
<li>Loads of translation fixes, group and NPC chat fixes, death message improvements.</li>
<li>Unmerged fixes, which are the ones that might land in game soon or need further testing.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6543669351709125393gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6543669351709125393gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Truly amazing how quickly this game is evolving lately and the passion of the contributors to keep improving the game in every aspect.</p>

      <title>Remote Play broken on Steam Deck with the February stable update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/valve-release-big-stable-steam-client-update-for-steam-steam-deck/" target="_blank">just recently launched</a> a big stable update to the Steam Client for both Steam Deck and Desktop PCs, which has come with one big issue for Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Sadly, it seems Remote Play on Steam Deck is now broken. Trying to play a game from a Linux or Windows host just results in a spinning Steam logo screen on the Steam Deck. Weirdly, in my testing, the Steam Deck did get audio but no visual or input — the only choice is to press B to exit the stream.</p>
<p>The thing is, this has been a <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/10461" target="_blank">reported bug</a> since at least February 3rd, when it was noticed from people on the Preview / Beta update channels with multiple confirmed reports.</p>
<p>Hopefully Valve will solve it. Although, other reports have noted that it does work again in the current Release Candidate update available via Developer Options (for the next upcoming major update), which is not meant for any normal users so I <em>wouldn't</em> recommend changing it as enabling the advanced update channels could cause future problems.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3289557211709123917gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3289557211709123917gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Steam Big Picture Mode</em></p>
<p>A shame to see such a useful feature broken in this way. Hopefully Valve will ensure this feature is fully tested when rolling out future updates to the Steam Deck. Remote Play has always bin a bit iffy in my testing, something with it always seems to be broken but this is the first time I've seen it entirely broken like this.</p>

      <title>The future has arrived - KDE Plasma 6 desktop released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The KDE team announced "MegaRelease 6", a big upgrade that includes Plasma 6, Frameworks 6 and Gear 24.02 with tons of improvements to this popular desktop environment that's used on the Steam Deck for Desktop Mode. <em>Hopefully we will see Valve give it an update in the next major SteamOS release.</em></p>
<p>Bringing the future to a desktop near you, the tech under the hood has gone through some <strong>major</strong> upgrades with updates to Qt and Wayland support (with Wayland also now the default). The developers say "We have done our best to ensure that these changes are as smooth and unnoticeable to the users as possible, so when you install this update, you will see the same familiar desktop environment that you know and love" and that the upgrades "benefit Plasma's security, efficiency, and performance, and improve support for modern hardware".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1228818921709045295gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1228818921709045295gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>There's a lot of big stuff on top of Qt and Wayland upgrades including:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Desktop Overview effect that combines the Overview and Desktop Grid.</li>
<li>Partial support for High Dynamic Range (HDR).</li>
<li>Refreshed Breeze theme.</li>
<li>Improved system settings app to make it more user friendly.</li>
<li>Improved fingerprint unlock from lockscreen.</li>
<li>Plasma Search now lets you customize the ordering of search results. Plus it's faster and performs better.</li>
<li>Lots of improvements to various apps like the popular video editor Kdenlive.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh and my favourite, the Cube has returned! All hail hypnocube!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1861896241709045623gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1861896241709045623gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Lots of smaller but still useful changes have made it in too, like the controversial single-click to open files and folders has been moved to a double-click which better matches Windows and other desktop environments.</p>
<p>Probably one of the most exciting Plasma updates I've ever seen, and I can't wait to get my Kubuntu install on my desktop upgraded. I'm <em>really</em> keen to see how much Wayland support has improved, and should hopefully properly make it my own default now too.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/megarelease/6/" target="_blank">full release page</a> for all the info. There's simply far too many goodies to list here.</p>

      <title>Nintendo goes after Switch emulator yuzu in new lawsuit</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, here we go. Nintendo have formally filed a lawsuit against the creators of the popular open source Switch emulator <a href="https://yuzu-emu.org" target="_blank">yuzu</a>. <em>Nintendo certainly aren't holding back on this one either.</em></p>
<p>Looking over the <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/709016504/Nintendo-of-America-Inc-v-Tropic-Haze-LLC-1-24-Cv-00082-No-1-D-R-I-Feb-26-2024" target="_blank">document</a> filed February 26th, Nintendo give an example in their complaint with The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom saying that it was "unlawfully distributed a week and a half before its release by Nintendo" and that copies of it were "successfully downloaded from pirate websites over one million times before the game was published and made available for lawful purchase by Nintendo".</p>
<p>A major part of the argument is how Nintendo say that "Yuzu unlawfully circumvents the technological measures on Nintendo Switch games and allows for the play of encrypted Nintendo Switch games on devices other than a Nintendo Switch". Nintendo go on to talk about how yuzu allows working around all the protections they put in place, and that "to be clear, there is no lawful way to use Yuzu to play Nintendo Switch games, including because it must decrypt the games’ encryption".</p>
<p>To work yuzu needs certain things from a Switch console, of which the early models had an exploit where this was possible. The yuzu install guide mentions specifically you need a "HACKABLE Nintendo Switch", which Nintendo argue in the suit that "Users obtain the prod.keys either through unlawful websites or by unlawfully hacking a Nintendo Switch console". Because of how yuzu works Nintendo state it "turns general computing devices into tools for massive intellectual property infringement of Nintendo and others’ copyrighted works".</p>
<p>What's not particularly great for the yuzu team is a quote included in the suit from the project lead Bunnei, where Nintendo quote Bunnei saying "users probably just pirate a yuzu folder with everything" when replying to another user about the Quickstart Guide as it can be confusing for people. For context, this is a quote from the yuzu Discord server, but a follow-up post from another developer mentions directly after it "just to clarify on that last statement, we do not endorse, nor support piracy and the users who do won't receive assistance". Still, it's giving Nintendo easy ammo.</p>
<p>Nintendo are going after damages (which look to be quite high in monies), plus they want the yuzu website domain transferred to Nintendo control and the total shut down of yuzu as a whole.</p>
<p>This is going to get messy for yuzu, and for the future of emulation.</p>

      <title>shapez 2 demo is sticking around for another month - you need to try this</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>shapez 2 is absolutely going to be a big success when it hits Early Access later this year, and you can try out the demo for a good while longer now so the developer can ensure they get it right.</p>
<p>It's a <em>pure</em> factory-building game. No aliens, no combat, just you and your conveyor belts spreading across a huge map. The first game in the series had a great idea with you cutting up shapes to make different shapes, and this simply builds upon the basics of it in a much more visually rich setting, along with plenty of new game mechanics.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below if you haven't seen it before:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0VO_52LJ268"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/95d1a2afb300507942c52c325258bf32.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0VO_52LJ268" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Currently no changes are planned for the demo, as the developer continues working on the full game. They are working through feedback to improve various areas of the game like the reusability of shapes and production lines. Thankfully the dev said there was "very little negative feedback" so overall they're onto something good.</p>
<p>As of late last week, the demo had been played by over 109,477 unique people - impressive.</p>
<p>The Native Linux demo is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2162800/shapez_2/" target="_blank">available on Steam</a> until March 25th.</p>

      <title>Streets of Rogue 2 is going to be massive and I&#39;m hyped</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Matt Dabrowski recently did a fresh developer video on the upcoming Streets of Rogue 2, and it's really going to be massive.</p>
<p>What is it: Streets of Rogue 2 is a crazy, immersive RPG sandbox set in a vast randomly generated open world where freedom and fun are dialed up to 11. Fight, sneak, hack, farm, build, steal, or talk your way to power as you try to topple a corrupt president in countless possible ways – solo or with friends.</p>
<p>The sequel is going to be a much bigger game, with the developer mentioning in the latest developer video below that even the default map size is "meant to be like a scaled down version of a very small country, which still ends up kind of enormous". Dabrowski then talks a bit about how that's actually done using various algorithms for random generation, a fun look behind the curtain. It all sounds pretty complicated but Dabrowski does a really fun job of breaking it down into the basics to show how the world map is actually built, and shows a little on how you'll be building your own stuff.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nGahQVeBoTY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ecb88b3e077bd2a72745641de687d287.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nGahQVeBoTY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The first is one of my favourites to play with others so I really can't wait to play Streets of Rogue 2. It's due out sometime later this year. Will you be picking it up?</p>

      <title>PC and handheld gaming with Linux levels up with Bazzite v2.3.0</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bazzite version 2.3.0 has been released, and it should make installing it a whole lot easier across different devices from PCs to handhelds. The developers think it's the "next generation of Linux Gaming".</p>
<p>Reminder on what it is: Bazzite is a custom image of <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/" target="_blank">Fedora Atomic Linux</a> utilizing Universal Blue's image framework designed to bring users the best in Linux gaming for their PCs, including the Steam Deck and other handhelds. So think of it like a <em>much</em> fancier more customizable version of SteamOS.</p>
<p>With the new release of Bazzite version 2.3.0 it includes offline ISOs, which should be faster and fix issues people had where it wouldn't boot and they've also managed to get <a href="https://ventoy.net" target="_blank">Ventoy</a> support in too (which is a great tool for booting almost any ISO). More installer improvements are planned too, this is just the start.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9600528121709038514gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9600528121709038514gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Steam Big Picture Mode.</em></p>
<p>Some of the other improvements in Bazzite 2.3.0 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A warning when the currently booted image is over a month old.</li>
<li>Automatic nested desktop resolution handling for a number of handhelds.</li>
<li>Improvement to support for GPD Win Mini, GPD Max 2, GPD Win 4.</li>
<li>Added joystickwake to keep screen alive from controller input.</li>
<li>Added support for the AYANEO Air Plus.</li>
<li>Defaults to X11 on NVIDIA now.</li>
<li>Support for REALTEK RTL8814AU and RTLXXAU devices.</li>
<li>BoxBuddy included pre-installed for a Distrobox UI.</li>
<li>Improvements to the upgrade system.</li>
<li>Lots of bug fixes everywhere.</li>
<li>+ plenty more.</li>
</ul>
<p>The developers said they also plan to support the MSI Claw and Orange Pi Neo, with Steam Deck OLED support currently stuck due to issues with newer Linux kernels (but the original Steam Deck LCD is supported).</p>

      <title>Free and open source evolution sim Thrive gets big new gameplay features in v0.6.5</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Thrive is a free and open source evolution sim from Revolutionary Games Studio that's currently in-development, and a new release has rolled out with v0.6.5 bringing some gameplay additions.</p>
<p>What many people like to compare to the cell stage in the classic Spore, not many games have attempted anything really like this so it's great to see it continue to expand.</p>
<p>One of the major new features in this release is a part unlock system, so some of the organelles are locked behind specific conditions giving you more to actually do to progress in the game. There's also a fog of war on the patch map, which is where you see different biomes / areas in the early parts of the game. Some big performance improvements have come along too including more multi-threading and they say they've reduced overall memory allocations by about 75% during gameplay. You'll also find more tutorials and an expanded Thriveopedia for in-game info.</p>
<p>See their new overview trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Hg6jv75cbgU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ee8ec4eb6bc5e183f64c9be7f1380e87.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Hg6jv75cbgU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>See their <a href="https://revolutionarygamesstudio.com/devblog-40-unlocking-potential/" target="_blank">blog post</a> for more on the update.</p>
<p>The developers also mentioned they're about to update from <a href="https://godotengine.org" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> 3 to 4, so that should hopefully come with various improvements too.</p>
<p>You can grab it free from <a href="https://github.com/Revolutionary-Games/Thrive-Launcher" target="_blank">GitHub</a> or buy it to support the developer on <a href="https://revolutionarygames.itch.io/thrive" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1779200/Thrive/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Stardew Valley v1.6 confirmed to release in March, hits over 30 million sales</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The next big free upgrade for Stardew Valley now has a release date in March and there's plenty to look forward to. Stardew Valley also just celebrated its 8th anniversary.</p>
<p>Confirmation of a March 19th release date comes from creator ConcernedApe (Eric Barone), who <a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1762192764899627457" target="_blank">posted</a> on X:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="It's the 8th anniversary of Stardew Valley. Thank you for all the support over the years! Today I am announcing the PC Release date for the 1.6 update: --March 19th--. Console &amp; Mobile will follow as soon as possible." src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3051831401709033225gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Not only that but in a follow up <a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1762195335936627147" target="_blank">post</a> Barone mentioned that Stardew Valley has also now sold over 30 million copies, which is simply incredible. Last time I remember seeing a sales count it was 20 million <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/stardew-valley-hits-20-million-sales/" target="_blank">back in May 2022</a>. The official <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/press/" target="_blank">press page</a> has also been updated to note the 30 million milestone as of February 2024, with over 19 million of those being on PC.</p>
<p>What to expect from the 1.6 update? Barone previously <a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1707155027914035542" target="_blank">teased</a> in a post on X that it will have a major new festival, two new mini festivals, new late-game content to expand each of the skill areas, new items and crafting recipes, 100+ new lines of dialogue, winter outfits for villagers, 8 player support for multiplayer, a new farm type, new secrets and more.</p>
<p>Will you be jumping back in for the 1.6 update? </p>
<p>Stardew Valley has Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental updated with Proton 9 - adds fixes for Helldivers 2 and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now that the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/proton-9-now-in-beta-with-improved-game-compatibility-for-steam-deck-linux/" target="_blank">testing is open for Proton 9</a>, Valve have now updated Proton Experimental to move over to Proton 9 along with a bunch of extra game fixes for Steam Deck / Linux. Confused about the different versions and want to learn more about Proton? Check <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">my beginner's guide</a>.</p>
<p>On top of all the changes from Proton 9, these are what were newly added with the Proton Experimental update for February 26th. First up, noted as now playable:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Hero's Land</li>
<li>Onimusha: Warlords</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The other fixes and improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Made Helldivers 2 work more reliably on different setups.</li>
<li>Fixed Halo Infinite somtimes crashing during "initalizing data".</li>
<li>Fixed Russian language rendering in Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons launcher.</li>
<li>Fixed green stripe in Greedfall video playback.</li>
<li>Fixed launch failure with STORY OF SEASONS: A Wonderful Life configuration tool.</li>
<li>Updated Wine-Mono to <a href="https://github.com/madewokherd/wine-mono/releases/tag/wine-mono-9.0.0" target="_blank">9.0.0</a>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16809937701708962820gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16809937701708962820gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/793059711708962857gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/793059711708962857gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
Pictured - Helldivers 2 on Linux</p>
<p>And the Wine Mono 9.0.0 changes are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>macOS-related updates:
<ul>
<li>Fixed Mono using direct GS access to read the win32 "last error" value, which does not work in 64-bit Wine on macOS.</li>
<li>Mono now ignores the TMPDIR environment variable, which is not normally set on Windows, but in Wine on macOS it's inherited from the host environment. This had caused errors creating temporary files.</li>
<li>The test suite now has macOS-specific and Linux-specific expected results, and I have verified that the tests pass on macOS with this release. (Full CI for macOS coming soon, I hope.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Many System.Configuration improvements, with much of Mono's code replaced with code from referencesource.</li>
<li>Assemblies installed in the GAC can now use SkipVerification. Mono didn't allow this for reasons that were unclear, and it's hard to test whether .NET Framework matches. This had caused "invalid IL code" errors in 8.0.0 with assemblies installed to the Windows GAC, because that was the first version to inform Mono that those assemblies were in the GAC. Those regressions should be fixed now.</li>
<li>Added Microsoft.VisualBasic.Compatibility.dll.</li>
<li>Fixed the PDB filenames embedded in PE dll's.</li>
<li>FNA now uses D3D11 by default instead of OpenGL. This should fix hangs in some games that use multiple threads with XNA.</li>
<li>Changed the <code class="inline-code">List<t>.Sort(Comparison<t>)</t></t></code> method to not count as a modification. This is a bug in .NET Framework that Shenzhen I/O depends on.</li>
<li>Updated the registry information with a new .NET Framework Release number, which helps the XSplit Broadcaster Installer (but XSplit still doesn't work).</li>
<li>GC invocations and traced methods are now logged to <code class="inline-code">WINE_FTRACE_FILE</code> if it is set in the environment.</li>
<li>The DriveInfo.VolumeLabel property has been imported from referencesource.</li>
<li>Upstream updates:
<ul>
<li>Mono to main branch as of 2024-01-26</li>
<li>FNA to 24.01</li>
<li>FNA.NetStub to master branch as of 2023-10-27</li>
<li>llvm-mingw to 20231128</li>
<li>SDL to 2.28.5</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

      <title>Windowkill is a clever multi-window twin-stick shooter that moves around your screen</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This might be one of the most unique games I've ever played. Windowkill from torcado just released on Steam with Native Linux support and its use of multiple moving windows really changes the bullet-hell genre. <em>Note: personal purchase.</em></p>
<p><em>Made with <a href="https://godotengine.org" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, it's not just a great game but another fun example of what Godot devs can do.</em></p>
<p>An experimental game where the play area is constantly shrinking around you, and you need to move all over your screen in this little window to get at enemies, or away from them. You shoot the window borders to expand it, making it quite chaotic and challenging to do that on top of firing at enemies to not get swarmed. Other windows will spawn on your desktop, with bosses and all sorts. It's just so exceptionally clever and surprisingly works really well too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15918868961708957805gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15918868961708957805gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Windowkill on Kubuntu - KDE Plasma (X11)</em></p>
<p><em>I did also test it on Wayland too with KDE Plasma, and it works fine there too.</em></p>
<p>Part of what makes it challenging, is that your bullets stop at the window edge which is how you expand the window. So to take down bosses like one pictured above, you <em>need</em> to get the windows to overlap. It's a game of <em>constant</em> movement, you're always thinking of where you want to go next and how to get there while avoiding enemies darting at you, bosses firing at you, other enemies sneaking in behind you and more. Pure chaotic fun.</p>
<p>Mechanically it's a twin-stick bullet-hell, that throws in a sprinkle of Vampire Survivor-like popularised gem drops to pick up, to then continually upgrade your little character. Here though, you can power-up <em>whenever</em> you want. The shop is always open at the tap of a button to jump in and spend some purple dots to upgrade. You can get more health, multi-shots, shots that pierce through multiple enemies, splash damage from your bullets and so on.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vA60y3bpKBs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7afdfb35287f999ccdc8f713894bbf48.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vA60y3bpKBs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Defeating each boss will drop down a special upgrade item too, allowing you to pick something extra. There's some fun options here too like an an extra window that will have an area on it that just constantly damages enemies, or giving you the ability (on a cool down) to enlarge the main window to temporarily make it a bit easier and give you more space and so on. So many options that makes it such a fun game to repeatedly jump back into for one more run.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13593976271708959844gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13593976271708959844gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Windowkill on Kubuntu - KDE Plasma (X11)</em></p>
<p>How about on the Steam Deck? So it works quite well on Desktop Linux but I was curious how it would go there. Considering the type of game, I didn't think it would actually really work. Curiously, the Native Linux version would show a Godot logo screen and then my device just reboots. Proton 8 at least got it to launch but the multi-window system didn't work well in Gaming Mode and I couldn't actually do anything. Looking on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/2726450#8CHrZ1K2cS" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> someone else mentioned the reboot issue too. For now, seems you'll need Desktop Mode on Steam Deck to make it work. So I'll just stick to playing this one on my desktop, where I'm massively enjoying it.</p>
<p>This game deserves many more eyes on it and much success. Wonderful idea. This is probably going to take over my free time for a while (when I'm not constantly dying in Helldivers 2). A nice coffee-break game that will make you play a bit too long and have your coffee go cold.</p>

      <title>We can probably say a final goodbye to Roblox on Linux with Wine soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After Roblox recently introduced Hyperion anti-tamper, there were some issues running it on Linux, but there's been workarounds and some of the Roblox staff made it to work on Linux with Wine again, but it seems not for much longer.</p>
<p>This ongoing saga of Roblox working, then not working, then working again and so on looks like it's about to end and not in a good way for people playing it on Linux with Wine. The info comes from the Roblox developer forum (login required), spread across a few posts in the topic "<a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/why-isnt-hyperion-an-anti-cheat/2840095/1" target="_blank">Why isn’t Hyperion an anti-cheat?</a>".</p>
<p>Roblox staff member Bitdancer once again answering lots of questions, and then <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/why-isnt-hyperion-an-anti-cheat/2840095/22?u=sirsquiddybob" target="_blank">this</a> was noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have a similar issue with our unofficial Wine support. We see it being used for cheating, which is heartbreaking, to be honest, as this was a personal effort of our developers under the assumption that folks out there would understand and not misuse it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In reply to a user asking if "Roblox on Linux is likely not gonna last much longer?", Bitdancer <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/why-isnt-hyperion-an-anti-cheat/2840095/27?u=sirsquiddybob" target="_blank">replied</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am very sorry, but you are correct. Unfortunately, we have exhausted our options.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/why-isnt-hyperion-an-anti-cheat/2840095/29?u=sirsquiddybob" target="_blank">expanding</a> on the why:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wine is an excellent tool for reverse engineering. Additionally, we had to disable many antitamper checks to make Hyperion run on Wine. This has allowed interested parties to learn a lot about the internal workings of Hyperion, relevant to both Win32 and UWP. As the initial shock of Hyperion’s release started wearing off, many people have begun discovering the various angles through which one can learn more about the inner workings of Hyperion. Apparently, many have done just that, necessitating us to become more strict.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Continuing across <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/why-isnt-hyperion-an-anti-cheat/2840095/33?u=sirsquiddybob" target="_blank">another</a> post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason I gave above is one, rather significant, reason but not the only one. There have been many contributing factors. For example, the increased detection of cheating on Wine, the floundering of Wine-based Roblox exploits on different Discord servers, and the question of maintainability. Hyperion is a complex piece of software; we introduced more than one bug in Hyperion because we wanted to make something work on Wine. Ultimately, every responsible company must ask whether it is worth the effort. Who is responsible when things go wrong? What does unofficial support really mean? How many users of other platforms will be inconvenienced by our decision to support Wine? How can we make features such as kernel components work, and so much more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As they explained in the quotes above, it doesn't necessarily mean Linux players specifically are the ones actually cheating, but the way they enabled it to work has allowed cheat makers to look a bit more behind the scenes to enable cheats even on Windows.</p>
<p>So, if you are playing it on Linux, or you were wanting to, it certainly sounds like it will be entirely blocked at some point. A shame, considering how massive a platform Roblox is. It's good to see their team be so clear and open about the issues though, rather than just blocking it and not giving an answer like plenty of other games do.</p>

      <title>Upcoming GZDoom shooter Selaco will have Steam Workshop support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Selaco looks absolutely incredible, a first-person shooter built on GZDoom that I've covered a few times because the demos were so much fun. And at the Early Access release in May, it's going to have Steam Workshop support.</p>
<p>Building up some more excitement for what I fully expect to be quite a big hit in the shooter space, the official Selaco X account posted about the upcoming modding support via Steam Workshop. Noting in a <a href="https://twitter.com/SelacoGame/status/1761426428170494456" target="_blank">thread</a> that Selaco will have support for new maps, weapons, enemies, gameplay changes and more — a lot of it thanks to GZDoom already having such an active modding scene so it's modding support in general is great. Can't wait to see what people create for it!</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below if you missed it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nUbF8Ytadx0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f9d495c1130ff6c161a0637adada5e7c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nUbF8Ytadx0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A lengthy story-driven campaign - Selaco is a story-driven experience, and we don't say that lightly. A dedicated writer has been brought on board to assist with creating an engaging and believable sci-fi story and world.</li>
<li>Intense Action set pieces - Turn the entire world into confetti with the destructive power of your weapons. Every single bullet will react properly with any materials or objects you hit. Our artists have created many different variations for each (voxel)object to ensure that the aftermath of each encounter is palpable. That once lavish office space now nothing but a pile of rubble with broken paintings, smashed tables, screen, chairs, smoke, and chunks of debris.</li>
<li>Custom AI - With our FEAR influence, writing proper AI was a goal from the get go. The enemy is fully aware of each other's presence and work together to take you down. They will keep their distance if you apply constant pressure on them, will rush you if you hide or run out of bullets, toss grenades if you use the same cover for too long, and much more. Hundreds of custom lines have been written and acted out, providing hints to the player about their current plans and tactics.</li>
<li>Full soundtrack - Selaco is accompanied by a full length original soundtrack composed by an experienced musician who has worked on many games in the past.</li>
<li>Professional voice-acting - To help immerse players in the story and atmosphere of Selaco, professional voice actors have been brought on board. Dawn will be voiced by the incredibly talented Melissa Medina, with other casting choices revealed at a later date.</li>
<li>Extra Gamemodes - Completing levels allows you to replay that level in Incursion Mode, an expanded version of that map where your skills will be tested against a near endless onslaught of enemies. Win incursion maps to gain bonuses to aid you throughout the campaign. New exclusive Incursion Levels and new mutators will also be unlocked as the campaign progresses.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can follow Selaco along on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/" target="_blank">the Steam page</a>. It will have full Native Linux support at the Early Access release on May 31st.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve announced that Proton 9.0 is now available for testing, with lots of game compatibility improvements for Steam Deck and Desktop Linux thanks to it now being based on the recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/wine-9-0-brings-much-improved-windows-app-and-game-compatibility-to-linux/" target="_blank">Wine 9.0 release</a>.</p>

<p>Then you can selectively set games to Proton 9.0 in the Properties -&gt; Compatibility options for each game.</p>
<p>Valve said that the public beta will be "updated more regularly with regression fixes prior to the Proton 9.0-1 release".

      <title>Discord Overlay for Linux v0.7.0 should improve idling and on battery power </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Discover, not to be confused with the KDE Discover software store, is a Discord overlay for Linux and the first update in a while is out now with version 0.7.0.</p>
<p>What does it actually do? It allows you to easily have a configurable on-screen Discord overlay to show who is currently talking, or to display text and images from selected channels.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://github.com/trigg/Discover/releases/tag/v0.7.0" target="_blank">release notes</a> for 0.7.0 the developers mentioned: "This update brings in a bunch of changes which remove our previous reliance on timeouts. For most users this will seem to do absolutely nothing, but for users where this program is idling and on battery power it will allow the OS to scale down battery usage much further than previously able."</p>
<p>Here's all the changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fix rendering title with incorrect font.</li>
<li>Fix accidentally using None in dud voice data.</li>
<li>Included a lot of RPC documentation to README.</li>
<li>Differentiate Text &amp; Notification window titles for better catching by window managers.</li>
<li>Catch monitors layout change and monitor resolution change and re-render overlays.</li>
<li>Reduce reconnect rate when local discord goes away.</li>
<li>Cache user access token and attempt to reconnect quicker using it.</li>
<li>Changed connection origin to localhost.</li>
<li>Rewrote entire connection handler core to remove timeouts that never stopped.
<ul>
<li>Removed 60hz tick for reading local connection to discord.</li>
<li>Removed 1hz tick for re-rendering voice overlay even if data remained the same.</li>
<li>Removed 1hz tick for re-rendering notification overlay even if data remained the same.</li>
<li>Add a one-off timeout after render where data is expected to auto-hide itself.</li>
<li>Implemented socket read and reconnect login in GLib main loop.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a community made project, not affiliated with Discord, made due to "the shortcomings in support on Linux by the official discord client".</p>

      <title>Palworld has now sold over 15 million copies on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Palworld continues to be an insane success, as Pocketpair just <a href="https://twitter.com/Palworld_EN/status/1760682105171062876" target="_blank">revealed</a> it has now seen over 25 million players for their Early Access game. 15 million of those copies were on Steam, with another 10 million on Xbox.</p>
<p>As we saw from the recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/steam-users-redeemed-over-80-million-in-physical-wallet-cards-in-december-2023/" target="_blank">Steam 2023 Overview</a>, a lot of games are managing to find success. It has slipped down the Steam charts a bit now though thanks to the recent releases of Helldivers 2, Last Epoch, Pacific Drive and others. And it was only natural it would calm down after the initial rush and hype period but no doubt it will rank back up again on the first major content update.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10584836511708711592gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10584836511708711592gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's funny really when you see Ubisoft makes <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-ceo-defends-skull-and-bones-70-price-despite-its-live-service-leanings-calls-it-quadruple-a/" target="_blank">claims</a> about their Skull and Bones being a "quadruple-A game", when for the price of that one game you could almost afford <em>both</em> Palworld and Helldivers 2, which have seen glowing reviews and huge player numbers.</p>
<p>Have you been playing Palworld? What are your thoughts on it now after many hours?</p>
<p>Also, in case you missed it, some <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/palworld-is-getting-external-anti-cheat-but-it-will-be-mostly-optional/" target="_blank">anti-cheat for Palworld is on the way</a>.</p>
<p>Palworld is currently rated Steam Deck Playable and works great on Desktop Linux thanks to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a>.

      <title>NVIDIA 550.54.14 driver released as stable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA today launched the 550.54.14 Linux driver as stable coming with a whole bunch of fixes and improvements, so here's all that's changed.</p>
<p>Seems NVIDIA took on what I said to them about their recent changelogs being confusing for end-users (noted in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/nvidia-550-40-07-beta-driver-released-with-fixes-for-vrr-and-wayland/" target="_blank">the previous NVIDIA Beta article</a>), so now they're including a note on changes between this version and the last in the same series. </p>
<p>So the changes from the previous 550.40.07 Beta to this stable version are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused HDMI FRL displays to flicker or blank when enabling VRR with 8 bits per color channel.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression introduced with the 550.40.07 beta driver which caused corrupted window decorations in some applications when running on GNOME.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where vkAcquireNextImageKHR() was not returning VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR when it should with WSI X11 swapchains.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where fences passed to VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoEXT could signal earlier than expected when a WSI X11 swap chain becomes out of date.</li>
<li>Fixed Xid errors on Hogwarts Legacy and Forza Horizon 4.</li>
<li>Added support for the VK_KHR_video_encode_queue, VK_KHR_video_encode_h264, VK_KHR_video_encode_h265 and VK_KHR_video_maintenance1 extensions.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression which prevented some Vulkan applications from receiving VK_DEVICE_LOST upon a VT switch, which could lead to the application hanging or behaving incorrectly.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented nvidia-installer from honoring the --gbm-backend-dir command line option.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile the changes on top of that when going from the 545.29.06 driver to this version are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that sometimes caused Wayland applications to run at less than one frame per second on Maxwell, Volta, and Pascal series GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused an intermittent drop in desktop framerate.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused “Flip event timeout” messages to be printed to the system log when displays are hotplugged when nvidia-drm is loaded with the <code class="inline-code">fbdev=1</code> kernel module parameter.</li>
<li>Fixed intermittent Xid errors on Horizon Zero Dawn, Metro Exodus, Forza Horizon 5, and Halo Infinite.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which prevented the “NoMaxPClkCheck” mode validation token from working on single-link TMDS (e.g. DVI, HDMI) outputs.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that allowed VRR displays to be driven below their minimum refresh rate, resulting in a blank or flickering image.</li>
<li>Added an application profile to improve Kwin performance on hybrid GPU systems by setting <code class="inline-code">OGL_DEDICATED_HW_STATE_PER_CONTEXT=ENABLE_ROBUST</code>.</li>
<li>Updated the build process for NVIDIA kernel modules to honor the <code class="inline-code">INSTALL_MOD_DIR</code> Kbuild environment variable.</li>
<li>Added support for R8, GR88 and YCbCr GBM formats.</li>
<li>Optimized the X driver headless framerate limiter to more closely mimic upstream behavior and prevent it from activating in inconvenient situations. Added a new X config option <code class="inline-code">LimitFrameRateWhenHeadless</code> to disable the headless framerate limiter.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented Gamescope from running when using the NVIDIA Open GPU Kernel modules.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented the installer package from being unpacked on systems where zstd is not installed, when /tmp is mounted noexec.</li>
<li>Use transparent huge pages when available for the .text section. This is done through <code class="inline-code">madvise()</code> calls, and requires <code class="inline-code">CONFIG_READ_ONLY_THP_FOR_FS</code>.</li>
<li>Changed the name visible in /proc/devices of NVIDIA devices and the NVIDIA control device from “nvidia-frontend” to “nvidia” and “nvidiactl”. Scripts which parse /proc/devices (such as udev rules) may need to be updated. Note that the conventional /dev device paths like /dev/nvidia0 and /dev/nvidiactl remain unchanged.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause some multi-GPU systems to crash on suspend.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause the system to crash when an application is run with <code class="inline-code">__NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1</code>.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which prevented application profiles from getting applied to PRIME Render Offloaded applications running via Wine.</li>
<li>Disabled PRIME Display Offload Sink support for virtual displays on datacenter GPUs. This prevents unusable desktop layouts from getting automatically configured on systems with a mix of physical and virtual displays.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused high CPU usage during system suspend, which could lead to the system not entering s2idle in some cases.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused the nvidia-settings control panel to crash when running on Wayland with newer versions of libwayland-client.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's <em>more</em> listed on the official changelog, but a bunch of those were available in older NVIDIA driver releases, as NVIDIA list all changes since the previous Production release.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA open source driver to use NVK + Zink for OpenGL on newer GPUs</title>
      <author>nwildner</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/27628" target="_blank">recent merge</a> request on the Mesa Git repository added the initial support for allowing drivers to chose Zink as the translation layer for handling OpenGL. This basically does an OpenGL-on-Vulkan implementation making it easier for newer cards to support OpenGL through a generic implementation, reducing duplicate code and making it easier to keep OpenGL around since while not yet deprecated it is being less used on modern games.</p>
<p>The merge allows owners of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 20xx series GPUs and newer to opt to use Zink instead of relying on the default NVC0 Gallium3D implementation to handle OpenGL requests. Those who want to give it a try, it should be as simple as setting the <code class="inline-code">NOUVEAU_USE_ZINK=1</code> environment variable after updating Mesa 24.1 when your distribution receives the update that is currently only on the main branch of Mesa repository.</p>
<p>Since the merge from branch <code class="inline-code">airlied/zink-driver-choice</code> to <code class="inline-code">main</code> was merged <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/27628#note_null" target="_blank">2 days ago</a>, most distros might not be distributing those patches yet. For those who use source-based distros or any source-base package building system like AUR, the package <code class="inline-code">mesa-git</code> is <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mesa-git" target="_blank">available</a> as a means of tracking the main branch and testing these bleeding-edge features.</p>
<p>While NVK as a technology is still in-development with plenty left to do, there has been lots of improvements being implemented on the last year. Related articles:</p>

      <title>Snap store from Canonical (Ubuntu) hit with another crypto scam app</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/snap-store-from-canonical-hit-with-malicious-apps/" target="_blank">Not the first time</a> this has happened, but recently the Snap store from Canonical hosted a scam bitcoin app that claimed to be "Exodus wallet" that caused a user to lose money.</p>
<p>Posting on the Snapcraft <a href="https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/exodus-movement-exod/38904" target="_blank">forum</a> an unfortunate user noted their wallet has been emptied after using it, and a day later a Canonical staffer <a href="https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/exodus-movement-exod/38904/5" target="_blank">mentioned</a> it had now been removed and they were investigating the incident.</p>
<p>Mark Shuttleworth, CEO of Canonical, has now jumped into the discussion in another <a href="https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/should-unverified-cryptocurrency-apps-be-banned/38919/4" target="_blank">forum post</a> to note that while "cryptocurrency is largely a cesspit of ignoble intentions even if the mathematics are interesting", Shuttleworth doesn't think that "banning cryptocurrency apps helps" as "If anything, it would make using Linux much worse.".</p>
<p>Additionally, Shuttleworth also opened an additional <a href="https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/stronger-identity-verification-for-all-publishers/39061" target="_blank">forum post</a> to discuss requiring "more comprehensive proof of publisher identity for every publisher" for Snaps. So if you have good ideas for them to implement, to make Snap publishing more secure - drop a reply in the linked post.</p>
<p>Hopefully Canonical come up with a good solution, because repeating issues like this reflect pretty poorly on Snap, Canonical and Ubuntu.</p>
<p>Alan Pope (formerly of Canonical, now Axiom) wrote up two blog posts on it "<a href="https://popey.com/blog/2024/02/exodus-bitcoin-wallet-490k-swindle/" target="_blank">Exodus Bitcoin Wallet: $490K Swindle</a>" and the follow-up "<a href="https://popey.com/blog/2024/02/exodus-bitcoin-wallet-follow-up/" target="_blank">Exodus Bitcoin Wallet: Follow up 2.0</a>" that you may want to read for a little more background.</p>
