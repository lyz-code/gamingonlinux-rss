      <title>The supervillains won, so fight back in superhero strategy game Capes - out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From Spitfire Interactive, former members of Defiant Development who made Hand of Fate, comes the superhero strategy game Capes. <u>Note</u>: a key was provided before release.</p>
<p>Story: Twenty years ago, the supervillains won. Since then, they’ve created a dystopian city where developing superpowers is a crime and no one has dared oppose them. Until now! Assemble a diverse team of heroes while fighting to take back their city, now controlled by evil despots! Play across the dark and gritty campaign and patrol assignments, push the story forward and reveal the truth behind the horrific Enhancement program of The Company that is pulling the strings behind the scenes.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Z-VDKNTUIa4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f02c624a4b0241d75e63bdbb46cd50e6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Z-VDKNTUIa4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Inspired by XCOM, here you get a cinematic and rather action-packed turn-based strategy game, that mixes in team management with a little comic book flair. So if you love superheroes and anything resembling XCOM, you're going to feel really at home with this one. Capes is all about rising from the ashes, as you build up a ragtag group of new Capes (their word for heroes) to hopefully take back the city, taking down The Company. And hopefully find out what they've been doing to all the captured heroes.</p>
<p>Capes is a pretty <em>intense</em> and brutal strategy game and not one to beat around the bush with the setting either. Even from the intro section you're greeted with supervillains and their goons gunning down civilians right in front of you — and of course you get the blame for it.</p>
<p>It's not as open as XCOM in how you play as it's a linear game, since it's firmly based on playing through the acts of the story, and certainly not on the level of graphical quality of Marvel's Midnight Suns (another superhero strategy game) with it being from a small team, but there's a huge amount of charm to it thanks to the strategy involved with each individual character. The combat is just a whole lot of fun but it does take a little learning, and a bit of trial and error, due to how unique each character you recruit is.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8381240701716923452gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8381240701716923452gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Not only can you move and attack in any order, as long as you have the points, but each character has multiple unique abilities. Some can teleport, create crystals to block line of sight or stop people in their tracks, use telekinesis to launch objects at enemies and telepathy to mess with minds and more.</p>
<p>The beauty in it though is how the abilities of the individual characters work together with the special link system, where multiple heroes link together if they're close enough to do a slightly more special attack. There's a good number of those team ups too and they really are powerful, but needing to keep your people close enough together can also be a big issue and your downfall on some missions. Adding to that, each character <em>also</em> has a unique <em>ultimate</em> ability that you have to charge up during a mission, with each charging up a different way based on their main abilities.</p>
<p>Another element to the battles are the need to disarm enemies, as various thugs that carry weapons can have it knocked right out of their hand either through the specific disarm ability if you're close, or by using some special hero abilities that disarm enemies in addition to taking down their HP. Needed often too, since weapons will cause more problems for you from enabling enemies to have range (terrible for low-HP heroes) and sometimes extra attacks on you.</p>
<p>There's another layer to the game with your base of operations, that sees your team hidden in the old spot where the original strongest heroes would meet up. Although it's looking a little worse for wear. Here you can upgrade your heroes and there's a good few different ability upgrades for each of them, along with unlocking entirely new abilities. Although, even with plenty of upgrades, they never really feel over-powered against enemies. You're still going to need to think tactically during every single mission making good use of all their abilities together.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18206920631716927060gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18206920631716927060gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Like me, you'll probably end up with some favourites for their abilities, as well as their link team-up abilities, and you'll end up hardly using some others. The best bit though? There's no random hit chance. No 99% miss. No lurking behind cover either it's all about the movement, positioning and using the abilities together.</p>
<p>There's an interesting challenge system to this as well. Each character has an <em>individual</em> set of challenges, doing each one will unlock more SP points, which you can then use to upgrade their abilities some more. It ranges from simply using abilities to more interesting challenges like hitting a certain amount of enemies in one go, knocking enemies off ledges and so on.</p>
<p>A useful feature is that you can also re-play missions, enabling you to "simulate" them to ensure you complete all the available optional bonus objectives. Some of them are pretty difficult too and nicely varied so they don't feel like a boring chore to get through, so you might end up going back a fair bit because you actually <em>want</em> to. And because it never gets old seeing all the special abilities smashing through multiple enemies. Completing them all fully allows you more time to level all your heroes up, to proceed further into the story if you need to. Or just practice time to mess with the various abilities if you need it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/554498811716987087gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/554498811716987087gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some missions will be straight-up fights, some (like pictured above) make you sneak around stealthily, some have you protect a specific character and so on. There really is enough variety there that it does keep you nicely on your toes. And you don't have to sit waiting either, as you can fast-forward the enemy AI turns to get control of your team again a bit quicker, which I do wish some other strategy games had — nice touch.</p>
<p>Those damn challenges though, some feel impossible without first levelling up your heroes, which I feel is part of the point but I was determined in some cases and ended up replaying through a few missions many times to do them. There's so many fun ways to do the missions once you get more heroes and upgrade them.</p>
<p>Lots of nice little details to it too, like the main cut-scenes having their speech bubble tail moving around with character's mouths as they're talking. All the little comic-book animations during conversations and through the UI really help bring it to life.</p>
<p>Issues: one real nuisance quirk I did have on Kubuntu Linux 24.04 (KDE Plasma), was having to switch between borderless and windowed mode to get it to actually fill the screen properly. First launch had the bottom cut, after that it kept going into a small window. Thankfully, <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gamescope</a> entirely solved that issue forcing it into a 1440p full-screen window. Apart from that, it worked beautifully (no other Linux issues noticed, that is).</p>
<p>Another issue, much like other similar games, is sometimes the camera angles during attacks get a bit weird. Not too often, but you probably will see a good few times that something is covering up the screen during an attack.</p>
<p>Performance all maxed out at 1440p on my Ryzen 5800X and Radeon 6800XT desktop has been great, constantly above 100FPS. No complaints there.</p>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Be Mighty: Play as heroic protectors of the innocent, each with unique skills and powers. Master your hero and unleash devastating ultimate abilities!</li>
<li>Assemble Your Team: Select the right team for the right mission. Combat isn’t based on random numbers, so choose wisely to win the day!</li>
<li>Level Up: Complete challenging missions and side-quests to improve your heroes with new abilities and powerful upgrades!</li>
<li>Defeat Evil: Face down vile villains and criminal corporate henchmen. Do you have what it takes to free your city from the clutches of villainy!?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Capes has Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>If you love strategy games with a dark but fun story to follow, this is pretty much an essential purchase. The depth of the characters, along with all their abilities together is a <em>lot</em> of fun to smash through all the villains. Fun style too, although some of the characters look just a <em>bit</em> plastic, almost toy like in some cases, but it doesn't distract from the overall experience which is thoroughly enjoyable.</p>
<p>A firm recommendation to go and buy. Only a villain would pass up on playing Capes.</p>
<p>You can buy Capes on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/capes" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2081080/Capes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Quest Master is basically Zelda-maker and it&#39;s now in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Giving classic Zelda vibes meets Mario Maker styled creation, Quest Master gives you plenty of tools to make dungeons, for you to go alone or in local co-op.</p>
<p>After releasing a demo that proved to be pretty popular, players ended up making over 250 dungeons for people to play through. With it now in Early Access the demo is still live, but the tools available in it are restricted. Seems fair.</p>
<p>Forge the story of Lanze, Javelynn and Shiv — the hero, heroine, and furry sidekick — by creating hand-crafted dungeons in a vibrant pixel art setting reminiscent of ‘90s top-down adventure classics. Fashion story-rich adventures or skill-testing obstacle courses for up to three adventurers at once, then share creations online with the Quest Master community complete with filtering options and ratings.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QVpz8sWWn0U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4a35c26a0f40c4b6f0be0fe01e61b75c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QVpz8sWWn0U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Not only will you be making dungeons like you always wanted, and playing through the creations from everyone else, there's also a Castle Town to explore full of mini-games and side-activities.</p>
<p>They've got a pretty exciting sounding roadmap to keep expanding it during Early Access including more themes, more enemies, more items, expansions to Castle Town, a full proper single-player campaign, expanded lore and possibly even online multiplayer which they're only tentatively saying for now.</p>
<p>“The reception of Quest Master's demo has been incredible. 260 dungeons have been created since the demo launched 3 weeks ago. Now that the Early Access launch has landed, we’re diving deep into new features for 1.0,” said Julian Creutz, Lead Developer of Quest Master. “This is just the beginning for our fans, new and returning. We’re crafting an experience that we believe will inspire dungeon designers for years to come.”</p>
<p>You can check it out in Early Access <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094070/Quest_Master/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">now on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support. Currently it has no Steam Deck rating.</p>

      <title>Historical 4x strategy game Old World - Behind the Throne DLC brings plenty new</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Old World is a quality historical 4x strategy game that you should not pass up, especially if you love you Civilization styled games and this latest DLC adds in plenty of new content. The game has only continued to get better and better since it jumped from the Epic Store to Steam back in May, 2022. <em>It's probably one of the best in the genre.</em></p>
<p>Old World - Behind the Throne is the 5th main DLC for the game with this focusing on character interactions and court politics.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19304364571716985578gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19304364571716985578gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of what's included:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>350+ new events centering around court politics, intrigue, and personal ambition. The world behind the throne is a complex web of deceit, personal goals, and opportunities.</li>
<li>New historical characters
<ul>
<li>Alcibiades, Athenian statesman, and notorious political double-crosser.</li>
<li>Enlil-nadin-shumi, usurper of the throne of Babylon.</li>
<li>Harpagus, Kingmaker of Akkad.</li>
<li>Bardaisan, scientist, scholar, and philosopher of Assyria.</li>
<li>Mago the Author, Carthaginian writer on agriculture.</li>
<li>Avicenna, famed philosopher from Persia.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New projects and improvements
<ul>
<li>Estates, expensive new, improvements with a wide variety of benefits.</li>
<li>Opulence, a new project made possible by Estates. Use your wealth to generate additional victory points.</li>
<li>Slums, which balance faster population growth with risk of rebellion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New Gameplay mechanics
<ul>
<li><strong>Rising Stars</strong> - Powerful non-leader characters who present dangers and opportunities as they accumulate experience, triggering a wide range of events with both negative and positive effects. If they become too much of a nuisance, there’s always ways of “dealing” with them.</li>
<li><strong>Stress &amp; Revelry</strong> - Stymied ambitions, jealous lovers, raging barbarians, and much more can all take their toll on a ruler. Will your ruler indulge in hedonistic pursuits to escape the stress?</li>
<li><strong>The Grand Vizier</strong> - Take the minutiae of managing your cities off your plate, handing control to Viziers who will manage based on their personalities. Wise Viziers will focus on culture, courageous ones will recruit military units faster, while disciplined ones create specialists and special projects faster. Be warned, though – power corrupts, and a trusted Vizier might turn their gaze towards your throne.</li>
<li><strong>New Political Eras</strong> - Civil wars, grand reforms, and periods of corruption and decadence will bring forth new challenges for your empire as a whole.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Old World has Native Linux support, and last I checked it ran really well on Linux. To go with the new DLC release the base game and previous DLC are all on sale.</p>
<p>Created by Mohawk Games based in Baltimore, Maryland (USA) the studio is led by Leyla Johnson and Soren Johnson, the lead designer of Sid Meier's Civilization IV and co-lead designer of Sid Meier's Civilization III. Mohawk Games previously released Offworld Trading Company.</p>

      <title>Puppygames bring massive-scale asynchronous PvP battle simulator Battledroid to Kickstarter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Puppygames are launching a new game with Battledroid, a massively multiplayer online asynchronous PvP battle simulator that has a rather big scale to it.</p>
<p>For those who don't immediately recognise the name, Puppygames made the likes of: Revenge of the Titans, Titan Attacks!, Droid Assault, Ultratron and Basingstoke. Revenge of the Titans is a bit of a classic! One from the second Humble Indie Bundle which had the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131020134018/https://www.puppygames.net/blog/?p=914" rel="noopener" target="_blank">source code released</a>.</p>
<p>Using their own "state-of-the art custom voxel graphics engine" they call VOXOID, they wrote it from scatch in Java and OpenGL to allow them to "create spectacular battles" which they say supports "massive super-detailed landscapes, thousands of battling droids, and millions of particles to create explosive effects". Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8AWQFimTZOA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fc9c40f7f7c46e9bb1bacaeedd385e82.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8AWQFimTZOA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The trailer does a pretty poor job of showing off what the overall gameplay will be like but imagine an auto-battler on a massive scale as you will battle for territory across 250,000 tiles set across a persistent open world map of the real Earth, using actual terrain and environmental data.</p>
<p>You set up all your units (in defence, or attack), tweak their parameters a little, and then launch your attack - and sit back to watch them blow each other to bits. Winner keeps or takes the territory. There's a lot more explained and shown via gifs and screenshots on the Kickstarter.</p>
<p>They've been building the game on and off now for around 14 years from the initial designs back in 2010, to having a Beta available on Steam now (for backers). They're hoping to raise at least £27,600 from the new Kickstarter, so they can get working on it full time to push it over the finishing line.</p>
<p>Features at release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Free to play!</li>
<li>Massive battles with up to 1000 units on each side.</li>
<li>Asynchronous online multiplayer - you can play even if your friends are offline.</li>
<li>Voxels! Voxels! Voxels! State-of-the art custom voxel graphics engine, with destructible scenery.</li>
<li>Editable environment and weather system with realistic fog, mist and volumetric lighting.</li>
<li>Tiny download, quick startup, and free to jump in and start blowing stuff up!</li>
</ul>
<p>Battledroid will have Native Linux support just like their previous games.</p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/puppygames/battledroid/description" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Kickstarter</a> and follow on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/247710/Battledroid/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Bella Wants Blood is a bite-sized &#34;roguelike terror defense&#34; game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After releasing the roguelike tower defense Core Defense in 2020, and then the rogue-lite survival base builder Landnama in 2023 developer Sonderland is back with something weird with Bella Wants Blood. <u>Note</u>: developer provided an early review key.</p>
<p>They're calling it an "absurd bite-sized roguelike terror defense game", which in a few ways builds on the ideas from Core Defense but puts it into a darker setting and gives you a Slay the Spire style path system to progress through.</p>
<p>"Trapping you in their world, the god-like Bella demands you play their game to feed them blood. Lay down gutters and destructive terrors to obliterate Bella’s friends and their grotesque minions. Just don’t let them reach the end of your maze or Bella will get upset. And if Bella gets upset, Bella might just keep you there forever."</p>

<p>Bella Wants Blood has Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3007660/Bella_Wants_Blood/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a>. There's no current release date mentioned other than sometime "soon".</p>
<p>Who are Sonderland? Three dads and close friends from Germany, France and Canada with different backgrounds and perspectives on gaming, united by the desire to make beautiful, minimalist games they love to play.</p>

      <title>Steam Beta adds Bluetooth device battery info for Steam Deck, various desktop PC updates</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another round of Steam Client Beta updates are here with Steam Deck and Desktop PC seeing lots of improvements and bug fixes, and it's especially nice for people using Bluetooth on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>These are just for the Steam Deck from the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/4177730135016134612?snr=2___" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Show battery information for connected Bluetooth devices under Settings-&gt;Bluetooth and in the Quick Access menu.</li>
<li>Added a per-device toggle to Settings-&gt;Bluetooth that controls whether a device is allowed to wake Steam Deck from sleep.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that would cause the UI to show stale data for Bluetooth devices.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see on the Bluetooth changes, especially as you needed to use a plugin before to get better settings for Bluetooth devices. The Bluetooth device on wake though as far as I know, is still only on the OLED model.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/4146204937627686655?snr=2___" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the rest</a> of the Steam Client Beta for everyone on Steam Deck and Desktop PCs:</p>

<li>Fixed playtime limits sometimes being applied even if "set playtime limits" was not selected in the settings UI.</li>

<li>Display a copy count badge on game capsules for games that have more than one copy in a Steam Family.</li>

<li>Allow external gamepad controllers to load the same guide button configuration they would normally load on Desktop</li>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Inventory management games are becoming another popular thing at the moment. We've had all those survivor-like bullet-heaven games and now another genre is springing to life. NEODUEL: Backpack Monsters looks like a sweet spin on the idea.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/backpack-battles-is-another-clear-indie-steam-hit/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Backpack Battles</a> that released back in March is a current favourite of mine, but NEODUEL: Backpack Monsters brings with it a nice twist with you stuffing monsters into your pack.

<p class="plain-list-title">More about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>A multi-player, monster trainer themed, inventory management &amp; auto-battler game!</li>
<li>Choose your monsters, place and combine them, create synergies and beat your opponents!</li>
<li>After every battle, choose new monsters for your team and try to create the ultimate combo.</li>
<li>NeoDuel: Backpack Monsters is an asynchronous multiplayer game, meaning that time is on your side.</li>
<li>Need a break? Go ahead and take a sip of coffee for us. Your progress will be here when you return, your opponents will be ready and waiting still.</li>
<li>Use crystals to evolve your monsters to their stronger forms and fuse different monsters to discover unique creations.</li>

      <title>Zelda 64: Recompiled, the Majora&#39;s Mask PC port v1.1 brings various upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Zelda 64: Recompiled was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/zelda-majoras-mask-gets-a-pc-port-with-a-new-open-source-tool-for-nintendo-64-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pretty interesting news recently</a>, a PC port of Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask using the new <a href="https://github.com/N64Recomp/N64Recomp" rel="noopener" target="_blank">N64: Recompiled</a> tool and now a fresh update is out to improve it further.</p>
<p>It was already impressive, and now even more so. It's only going to keep getting better thanks to it being open source. Linux players especially might want this one, due to a SDL crash fix. As a reminder, you do need a copy of the game to work with Zelda 64: Recompiled, since it does not provide that for you (obviously).</p>
<p>Version 1.1.0 brings:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added an analog "free" camera in the style of later entries in the series. Moving the right stick will allow you to freely rotate the camera, and pressing the Target button or going through an entrance will switch back to the normal camera.</li>
<li>Improved motion blur effect at high framerates by using a high precision internal framebuffer (won't be enabled on machines with less than 1GB of VRAM).</li>
<li>Implemented N64 noise dither (affects the motion blur scenes).</li>
<li>Extended Dawn of the X Day screen to account for faster load times to match console timings.</li>
<li>Added a configurable scaled deadzone option to the menu. (<a href="https://github.com/Zelda64Recomp/Zelda64Recomp/pull/257" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#257</a>)</li>
<li>Added the option to remap the menu button on controllers. (<a href="https://github.com/Zelda64Recomp/Zelda64Recomp/pull/181" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#181</a>)</li>
<li>Added an automatic save backup system to reduce chance of losing data if saving gets interrupted. (<a href="https://github.com/Zelda64Recomp/Zelda64Recomp/pull/260" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#260</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed a Linux crash on startup by forcing SDL2 video driver selection to X11. (<a href="https://github.com/Zelda64Recomp/Zelda64Recomp/pull/197" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#197</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed the Skull Kid "curse" effect in very wide aspect ratios. (<a href="https://github.com/Zelda64Recomp/Zelda64Recomp/pull/259" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#259</a>)</li>
<li>Added a main volume slider. (<a href="https://github.com/Zelda64Recomp/Zelda64Recomp/pull/267" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#267</a>)</li>
</ul>

      <title>VoxeLibre (formerly MineClone2) v0.87 released moving away from Minecraft</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>VoxeLibre (formerly MineClone2), a free and open source sandbox game, has a brand new release available as they begin more movement to end the Minecraft clone wars. Well, as much as they can anyway, because it still looks and acts like Minecraft and is one of the best free alternatives.</p>
<p>Not only is this the first release with a new name, but it also has plenty of new mechanics and some new mobs included too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13774213861716915765gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13774213861716915765gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the highlights of this release include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A rewrite of the Potions and Effects system. This includes new effects, new potions and brewing recipes being added.</li>
<li>Rewritten Nether Portals making them work better, and now they connect up properly.</li>
<li>Improvements to the mob spawning system.</li>
<li>New mobs:
<ul>
<li>Rover is a new mob, replacing the enderman.</li>
<li>Stalker is another new mob, replacing the creeper.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Eating is now delayed instead of instant and has a first-person animation.</li>
<li>Multiple new blocks.</li>
<li>Capes are included in the character customisation.</li>
<li>Cherry blossom particles.</li>
<li>Leather armour can now be coloured (and washed).</li>
<li>Sign text editing.</li>
<li>+ much, much more.</li>
</ul>
<p>This sounds like a pretty exciting release for the project! Have many of you been playing it, what are your thoughts?</p>

      <title>Terraria: The Board Game live on Kickstarter - goal met almost instantly</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Terraria the smash-hit indie game is being turned into a tabletop experience with Terraria: The Board Game. It's crowdfunding on Kickstarter, and obviously it was going to do well.</p>
<p>Their goal was met almost instantly! At time of writing the main goal is £19,850 and they have £223,697 pledged. So yeah, clearly a lot of people are wanting in on this one and who could blame them? It looks great! Official too of course, made by Paper Fort Games in collaboration with Re-Logic!</p>
<p>With this adaption it will be playable for 1-4 people (solo play is an option) with world exploration, co-op play, dice-based combat, deck-building and little miniatures for bosses you can paint too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OrX4wCKiVmA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e28e9b334e26b58c644f02a6b03406a4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OrX4wCKiVmA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's certainly not cheap though at £62 to get it (not including shipping), but this is a special game adaption, it's quite different to just going into a local store and picking up a copy of Monopoly. You're paying to support the creators as much as you are getting a board game for you to play.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/paperfortgames/terraria-the-board-game" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full project on Kickstarter</a>.</p>
<p>Will you be jumping in for this one as well?</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

      <title>MangoHud performance monitor v0.7.2 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>MangoHud, the performance monitor you can put on top of games on Linux has a brand new release available with new features and fixes. This is the tech that powers the performance overlay on Steam Deck!</p>
<p>So with this you can get a readout of GPU and CPU use, RAM and VRAM use, FPS, frame timings and so much more. It's incredibly useful for tracking game performance across various settings, one of those now-essential tools.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20883821101716895919gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20883821101716895919gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
Pictured - MangoHud 0.7.2 (top right) on Dying Light 2</em></p>
<p>The main changes in version 0.7.2 are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">time</code> now has a label (you can remove this label with <code class="inline-code">time_no_label</code>)</li>
<li>Wayland keybinds have been added</li>
<li>rewritten exec function to have a persistent shell. Should reduce frametime spikes when using exec</li>
<li>exec is now right aligned to conform with every other item</li>
<li>meson options <code class="inline-code">with_x11</code> and <code class="inline-code">with_wayland</code> actually have a purpose now</li>
<li>added Pop!_OS and SteamOS to build script</li>
<li>added a mutex for config to prevent some crashes when accessing config at the same time as reloading</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">winesync</code> and <code class="inline-code">refresh_rate</code> have been changed to small font</li>
<li>added more stats to log summary</li>
<li>stop using <code class="inline-code">intel_gpu_top</code>, as it was causing too many issues. We can still get GPU load but the rest we'll have to wait for to be exposed in sysfs</li>
</ul>
<p>The fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>frametime color wasn't being correctly inherited, the user was not able to change it's color</li>
<li>fixed a crash when pressing Shift_R + F9</li>
<li>config options now correctly override preset options</li>
<li>fixed RPM and % being incorrectly assigned for GPU fan speeds</li>
<li>graphs had incorrect padding at start of graphs</li>
<li>fixed a crash when reloading the config while logging</li>
<li>check that cpu input gives a non-zero value</li>
<li>fixed minecraft-launcher crashing</li>
<li>graphs had incorrect padding leading to a smaller graph</li>
<li>fixed a build issue where some meson options would exclude opengl files incorrectly</li>
<li>fixed presets not working with <code class="inline-code">MANGOHUD_CONFIG</code> env</li>
</ul>
<p>Parameters</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">time_no_label</code> removes the label before <code class="inline-code">time</code></li>
<li><code class="inline-code">network</code> shows the throughput in kb/s for all interfaces or a specified list of interfaces e.g <code class="inline-code">network=eth0,wlo1</code></li>
</ul>

      <title>Co-op tower defense beat &#39;em up ChronoDojo adds various Steam Deck improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ChronoDojo blends together two genres that I didn't think would work. Putting together tower defense and a beat 'em up sounds a bit odd, but I've seen a lot stranger. It reminded me of the classic Awesomenauts a bit, only co-op tower defense rather than a MOBA.</p>
<p>While it has no current official Steam Deck rating from Valve, the developers are clearly fans of the Linux-powered handheld. Writing in a post on Steam they <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1428300/announcements/detail/4164219336136067403" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mentioned</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We so love playing and developing games for and from our couch! So naturally, we had to pick up a Steam Deck for ourselves and play ChronoDojo all over again!</p>
<p>While we're happy to say that it feels right at home on the deck, along the way we noticed many little tweaks, minor issues and opportunities for improvement.</p>
<p>So! We bashed out this latest build and are happy to share it with everyone out there looking for a great game for their Steam Deck!</p>

<p>More about it: "Play solo or party with friends in this cute, cooperative combination of tower defense and beat 'em up action! Travel through time, leap through levels, quickly construct trusty towers, and battle against wave after wave of zany enemies!"</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>

      <title>Physics-based roguelite bullet-hell Cosmo Rider improves Steam Deck controls</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cosmo Rider is a physics based roguelite bullet-hell-and-heaven horde-survivor action game. Upgrade your spaceship and traverse procedurally generated galaxies in this space survivors game. It has Native Linux support but no Steam Deck rating from Valve yet.</p>
<p>Recently it had a major upgrade to bring in randomized weapon attributes, and a new reinforcements system to help you out which sounds pretty fun. That was on top of a graphics upgrade back in April. They also recently added in key rebinds, along with better detection for Steam Deck controls, an updated tutorial, improved UI navigation and more.</p>
<p>Most recent trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vv1njbYLg4k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c015db3c6a8830a138aa41c10cabca53.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vv1njbYLg4k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Looks like a whole lot of fun if you like space shooters, along with survivor-like gameplay too.</p>

<p>After more than a year of work, the team has completed the first version of the in-game <strong>Editor</strong>. The Editor is available on all platforms and is <strong>integrated into the game</strong>. You can access it by clicking on the canvas with a globe in the bottom-right corner of the Main Menu. The Editor works only with the full version of the game - <em>"Price of Loyalty"</em>. It is not supported in the demo or <em>"The Succession Wars"</em> versions.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7416667021716892163gol1.png"/></p>
<p>The team redesigned the whole editor from the ground up to ensure that it is user-friendly and provides a smooth experience for map makers. A key feature we've added, which was missing in the original Editor, is the <strong>display of object passability</strong>. Now you can see the whole map and how the heroes will navigate around objects.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2836204501716892219gol1.png"/></p>
<p>The Editor uses a new map format - <em>.fh2m</em> . This license-free format is different from the original game's map format. It is very scalable, and we plan to expand it in future releases, offering map makers options to fine-tune many objects, add custom events, set unique loss and win conditions, and more. This also means that you can freely share your creations with others, and in the future, we are going to supply the engine with new maps.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the current version of the Editor <strong>lacks a few features</strong>. This was a deliberate decision to balance the release timeline and deliver well-tested and polished code rather than providing everything in a semi-finished state. <strong>Quality</strong> has always been our main priority. We will cover the missing features in the next release.</p>
<p>Additionally, the team enhanced AI on the Adventure Map, redesigned multiple UI dialogs and also updated several translations.</p>

<em>"Event" object new dialog.</em></p>

      <title>No leaving a Steam account in a will after you die according to Valve</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Doing the rounds right now is a post from Valve's Steam support (thanks <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/after-you-die-your-steam-games-will-be-stuck-in-legal-limbo/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ars</a>), when a user asked about what would happen to their Steam account when they died and it's not great news for anyone hoping to pass on your Steam account.</p>
<p>This comes from a post on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/to-anyone-who-is-curious-no-you-cannot-transfer-your-steam-account-via-a-will-you-can-only-take-your-games-to-your-graves.875634/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Resetera</a>, where the user asked if a Steam account could be transferred via a will. The Steam support staff member replied to note very clearly Steam accounts are plain and simply "non-transferable".</p>
<p>It's not exactly something new, or surprising, given that Steam's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Subscriber Agreement</a> clearly notes "You may not reveal, share or otherwise allow others to use your password or Account except as otherwise specifically authorized by Valve.". </p>
<p>Still, nothing actually technically stops you just writing down your details for someone and leaving it in a safe space, it's not like Valve actually go and confirm your identity. You also have the newer Family Sharing system, so someone could quickly go in and share it to your personal account and get <em>most</em> of the games.</p>
<p>It's also another reminder that on Steam, you <em>don't</em> own any games on it at all. Once again, as per the Subscriber Agreement, "Content and Services are licensed, not sold" and your "license confers no title or ownership in the Content and Services". </p>
<p>This will be the same across <em>nearly all</em> web stores that offer digital products you "buy", they're not yours. Epic Games Store is exactly the same as per their <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/eula" rel="noopener" target="_blank">EULA</a> which notes "All rights granted to you under this Agreement are granted by express license only and not by sale". Ubisoft are exactly the same in <a href="https://legal.ubi.com/StoreTermsofSale/en-GB" rel="noopener" target="_blank">their terms</a> as well noting "we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensed, non-commercial and personal license". Think GOG are any better? They're not, as per GOG's <a href="https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/16034990432541-GOG-User-Agreement-effective-from-17-February-2024?product=gog" rel="noopener" target="_blank">agreement</a> "Your GOG account and GOG content are personal to you and cannot be shared with, sold, gifted or transferred to anyone else." and they make it clear multiple times you get a license again, not ownership of anything sold.</p>
<p>If you go through most other places, they all use similar language and we're not talking just game stores here but anywhere you digitally purchase movies, TV series and so on. You get the idea. You might be buying the item, but you have no ownernship at all.</p>
<p>Really, the only time this will change is when physical media properly dies off and people cause enough of a fuss that governments and legal bodies around the world put in new laws around digital ownership, which is not likely for a long time.</p>
<p>So, you probably should go and clear that backlog of games you've built up.</p>

      <title>2 Ship 2 Harkinian, another unofficial PC port of Zelda: Majora&#39;s Mask is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While we only recently had the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/zelda-majoras-mask-gets-a-pc-port-with-a-new-open-source-tool-for-nintendo-64-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Zelda 64: Recompiled release</a>, we've now also got another PC port of Zelda: Majora's Mask thanks to the Harbour Masters team with 2 Ship 2 Harkinian.</p>
<p>This one is from the same team that made <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/ship-of-harkinian-a-pc-port-of-ocarina-of-time-has-a-feature-filled-upgrade/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ship of Harkinian</a>, a PC port of Ocarina of Time, and so they've expanded their work to Majora's Mask. You do need a ROM file, so you'll need to actually have your own copy of the game to be able to play it. So much like the previous two links above, hopefully Nintendo won't come along and nuke it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9746723931716827021gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9746723931716827021gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>With this first release the main highlights are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Support for higher frame rates<br/>
Similar to SoH, 2Ship allows you to up the framerate to as high as you want using Matrix Interpolation! The game logic still runs at 20 FPS, so this is all purely visual and won’t change any authentic game behavior.</li>
<li>Frame buffer effects - We hacked our way around needing to solve this in SoH, but with 2Ship we have a working frame buffer implementation that allows us to accurately recreate these effects like Motion Blur or capturing images for the PictoBox. You can read our blog post about this <a href="https://hmdev.blog/posts/frame-buffer-effects" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
<li>Free look - More camera freedom by allowing you to control your third person camera with the right analog stick.</li>
<li>Save related enhancements - Added the ability to auto save at timed intervals, back-ported "pause saving" from OoT, and preventing Owl Saves from being self-destructed when you load in.</li>
<li>Binary Save Import - While on file select screen, drag and drop save files from Recomp or Emulators to import your save into 2Ship. (Works with all of the save formats we were able to get our hands on, if you have something that doesn't work please create an issue on GitHub!)</li>
<li>DPad Items - Equip any item or mask to any DPad slot!</li>
<li>HUD Editor - Allow you to move and scale all elements of the hud. Includes presets for 4:3 (original) and widescreen HUDs.</li>
<li>Support for both N64 1.0 USA and GameCube USA roms!</li>
</ul>

      <title>The Rogue Prince of Persia arrives on Steam, devs will &#34;constantly&#34; improve it on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Rogue Prince of Persia is now in Early Access on Steam, and the good news is that it should already work well on Steam Deck but the developer plans to keep improving it. So that's good news for desktop Linux players too. Since it uses Proton, as long as it performs well on Steam Deck, it should be no problem for a bigger desktop Linux PC.</p>
<p>It was entirely developed by Evil Empire, who previously maintained the very popular and rather brilliant Dead Cells, and you can definitely see they've learned some valuable lessons from their time working on it. Nice to see a developer who knows their stuff working on such a classic game series, one I started all the way back on the Amiga.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LoYIyvwI__E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9143698811e2083e72c6c07705335f31.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LoYIyvwI__E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking in a post on Steam the developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2717880/discussions/0/4335356530803068912/#c4335356530803077171" rel="noopener" target="_blank">noted</a> "We will be constantly working on optimisation for the Steam Deck throughout Early Access too :)" and that they're waiting for Valve to verify it right now.</p>
<p>Early Access should last for around a year, and they have a lot of plans to expand it with double the current content planned for the 1.0 release. They said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Right now we have a fun solid nugget of a game - we're very confident that the acrobatic platforming and the combat moveset is a blast to play with and is a great base to build off during Early Access (and the music ain't half bad too, thanks ASADI! ;D).</p>
<p>We're well aware that we need to add more meta progression, upgrades, enemies, weapons, difficulty settings, other features and of course biomes, bosses and story acts, before the game can be considered complete.</p>
<p>But this is what Early Access is for, and our philosophy is that this is the best environment for us to build all of that in and to arrive at v1.0 with the best game possible, by working alongside a player community and in a fluid 'experimental' way.</p>

      <title>The Cozy Space Survivors post-release update has some simple lessons for indie devs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Released on May 3rd, Cozy Space Survivors is a cute survival roguelite in space, one for those of you who don't have a lot of free time. It's a little gem and the developer has posted up some post-release thoughts.</p>
<p>As a tiny niche game, the developer clearly didn't have high expectations for it. They only expected about 10% of the release-day wishlists to actually be converted into sales. Showing just how truly <em>vital</em> wishlisting is on Steam, the developer had 1696 wishlists at release and ended up selling 1608 units, with 58 refunds. Not bad for such a game with basically no real marketing.</p>
<p>Have a look below if you missed it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0WskX_VnYFQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8de7d43247a822a05a511bdba3f7ce20.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0WskX_VnYFQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Against how long it took to make though over 10 months, about 650 hours they said (outside of their main job), with a pretty fun breakdown of how they spent that time with the vast majority of that time directly in <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot</a>. But a good few hours spread across Blender, sorting out audio, looking up tutorials and guides and so on.</p>
<p>Nice to see GamingOnLinux (that's us!) get a mention too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I did not expect, that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/cozy-space-survivors-is-a-sweet-time-survival-roguelite-in-space/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">an article about my game on a Linux gaming website</a> would be the biggest boost for my wishlists (before release). I also did not expect, that at/<strong>after release</strong> the spike would be the biggest ever. Makes no sense to me because the game did cost only $2 at release (May-03-2024) – I expected that people either buy immediately at such a low price or that they are not interested at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14009772811716823306gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14009772811716823306gol1.png"/></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, quite funny how they <a href="https://simonschreibt.de/gat/cozy-space-survivors/#giveaway" rel="noopener" target="_blank">tracked down</a> someone that tried selling a key they gave them on G2A. That was a real <em>gotcha</em> moment. It's a reminder to game devs: Steam Curators do not need keys, you send the game directly to their curator page (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4218320-GamingOnLinux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">like ours</a>!).</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2657850/Cozy_Space_Survivors/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy Cozy Space Survivors on Steam</a>. It's only £2.49 and there's a demo available. It has Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Besiege: The Splintered Sea is out now with a free major sound system update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Remember Besiege from 2020? A physics building game about constructing mechanical machines to annihilate armies, obliterate castles and overcome challenging obstacles. Well, now you can go sailing in it.</p>
<p>I'm not sure sailing is the right word here. Besiege: The Splintered Sea allows you to make all sorts of crazy boats and ships to smash through things and it looks like a great addition to the main game. You can expect to see lots of new aquatic blocks, a new campaign and as you can imagine - lots of explosions with a brand new sandbox.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="79YkuLfpiAc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/35a5c146406898036b9e471c059f5a1e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/79YkuLfpiAc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The base game had a free update too which gives the sound system a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/346010/announcements/detail/6792069174998570968?snr=1_5_9_" rel="noopener" target="_blank">huge overhaul</a> to add in lots of new sound effects, collision sounds are now proportional in magnitude to the velocity of an impact and various different types of materials have new sound effects for actions. The biggest change is how each type of sound has its own independent track, which enables things to just sound a whole lot better to your ears instead of them all fighting for your attention.</p>
<p>Besiege has Native Linux support and it's rated Steam Deck Playable by Valve. You can buy Besiege from:</p>

      <title>TUXEDO Stellaris Slim 15 revealed for high performance in a small package</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another new laptop is on the way with the TUXEDO Stellaris Slim 15, the second revealed in the 6th generation of new Stellaris laptops from TUXEDO. This follows on from the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/tuxedo-announce-the-desktop-replacement-stellaris-17-gen6-notebook/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Stellaris 17 gen6 notebook</a> they revealed earlier this month.</p>
<p>So if the Stellaris 17 was too big for you, maybe this smaller one will be what you're after. This one also comes in two different editions with either AMD or Intel depending on who you prefer. And of course, full proper Linux support as standard with you able to pick between a few different Linux distributions.</p>
<p>From their email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The AMD base configuration with the Ryzen 7 8845HS, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060, 2x 8 GB 5600MHz DDR5 RAM, a 500 GB Samsung 980 SSD as well as TUXEDO OS pre-installed starts at 1.699 EUR (incl. Tax for german customers only) and around 1.430 EUR for customers outside europe (excl. Tax)<br/>
<br/>
The Intel base configuration with the Intel Core i7-14650HX, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060, 2x 8 GB 5600MHz DDR5 RAM, a 500 GB Samsung 980 SSD as well as TUXEDO OS pre-installed starts at 1.749 EUR (incl. Tax for german customers only) and around 1.470 EUR for customers outside europe (excl. Tax)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can upgrade the Intel model to an Intel Core i9-14900HX, and both models can also be upgraded to an NVIDIA 4070. Both come with a 15.3" screen at 2560 x 1600, 16:10 and 240Hz. The screen has 100% sRGB colour space coverage and a brightness of around 500 nits.</p>
<p>They also put together a new promotional video for this unit:</p>

      <title>Steam Deck hits 15,000 games rated Playable and Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve's popular Linux-powered gaming handheld the Steam Deck has hit a new milestone, with 15,000 games now rated either Playable or Verified. And it continues to sell well. Valve only <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/steam-deck-hits-14000-games-rated-playable-or-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hit 14,000 back in early March</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/steam-deck-officially-hits-over-13000-games-playable-and-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">13,000 back in January</a>.</p>
<p><em>For lots more Steam Deck news be sure to follow our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/Steam_Deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated Steam Deck tag</a>, it even has its own RSS feed.</em></p>
<p>The important thing to remember is that Deck Verified only includes what Valve have put through testing. Games not yet tested can still be played, you can try to play anything. Additionally, there are times the rating is wrong, like Unsupported games actually being fine or Verified games having poor performance (but we're talking a tiny percentage wrong here).</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's the current numbers of games rated by Valve</p>
<ul>
<li>Verified: 4,898</li>
<li>Playable: 10,102</li>
<li>Unsupported: 4,033</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some recently Steam Deck Verified games that look great include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/813230/ANIMAL_WELL/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ANIMAL WELL</a></li>

</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17692038591716481592gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17692038591716481592gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1438480/Saviorless/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Saviorless</a>, Credit: Empty Head Games</em></p>
<p><em>Random shout-out to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/616620/Forest_Fortress/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Forest Fortress</a> (NSFW) </em><em>as becoming number 15,000 in the list. Bet Valve love testing all those games huh?</em></p>
<p>There's certainly no shortage of truly excellent games for the Steam Deck. There's more supported games than any one person can play, which is a pretty good place to be for a platform overall. You can see the proper numbers on <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5BappType%5D%5B0%5D=Game&amp;refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified&amp;refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B1%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Playable" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, since that includes delisted games you can still play if you own them (which Valve still verify).</p>
<p>That leads me to the elephant in the room though: anti-cheat. What a pain in the ass it is. Various developers still have not enabled support via Easy Anti-Cheat and BattlEye including Rust, PUBG, Rainbow Six: Siege, Destiny 2 and more. And recently we've had <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/ea-sports-wrc-is-adding-ea-anticheat-breaking-another-game-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">EA expand their own EA anticheat</a> breaking multiple games which is not looking good for their future titles on Steam Deck and Linux desktop. Hopefully Valve will eventually be in a position to do something about all that.</p>
<p>Additionally, while we don't get sales numbers from Valve on anything, we can see overall the Steam Deck has been selling well. Especially since the release of the Steam Deck OLED. Looking at the global <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topsellers/global/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">top sellers</a>, the Steam Deck constantly ranks quite high. While the Steam Deck is much more costly compared to regular games, remember those top games sell often tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands and more constantly. So it's clear Valve are shifting plenty of units.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's how it's doing on sales position over time:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6722300811716468205gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6722300811716468205gol1.png"/></a></p>

      <title>KDE Plasma 6.1 Beta released with Wayland Explicit Sync support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Time for testing, especially for those of you with an NVIDIA GPU as the KDE Plasma 6.1 Beta is now live with some new features. Currently the roadmap shows that KDE Plasma 6.1 will be released as stable on June 18th. So you have a good while to report any unexpected issues from testing.</p>
<p>Here's all the main stuff that's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Triple buffering in KWin for smoother rendering and animations</li>
<li>Support for the Wayland Explicit Sync protocol, which should improve life for NVIDIA users in particular</li>
<li>Support for the Input Capture portal</li>
<li>Remote Desktop system integration to allow RDP clients to connect to Plasma desktops, plus a new page in System Settings for configuring this</li>
<li>New UX for Plasma's edit mode to make its modality more obvious and visually fancier</li>
<li>Added a configurable edge barrier between screens, to make it easier to hit UI elements touching the edges between screens. This also allows auto-hide panels on edges between screens to work properly</li>
<li>Fake session restore on Wayland that at least re-opens apps that were open last time, even if they don't get positioned in the same place. Support for real session restore is still being worked on</li>
<li>Support for syncing the color of your keyboard's RGB backlight with Plasma's accent color</li>
<li>Support for using the color profile embedded into the display, for displays that bundle these</li>
<li>Support in Discover for replacing end-of-support Flatpak apps with their replacements</li>
<li>Support for the battery conservation mode features on many Lenovo IdeaPad and Legion laptops</li>
<li>Support for passwordless screen locking, for using it as a screensaver in an environment without security concerns</li>
<li>You can now middle-click the Power &amp; Battery widget to block and unblock automatic sleep and screen locking, and scroll over it to switch the active power profile</li>
<li>Slightly rounder corners, and more consistency between corner radius everywhere</li>
<li>Better window layout algorithm for Overview</li>
<li>The "Shake cursor to find it" effect has been enabled by default</li>
<li>New off-by-default effect to hide the mouse pointer after a period of inactivity</li>
<li>System Settings Keyboard page has been rewritten in QML</li>
</ul>

      <title>Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers puts a new spin on Blackjack for deck-builder fans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers is a different kind of deck-builder and given the popularity of Balatro, this could be another fun one to try.</p>
<p>Set in a tavern packed with the rough and ready, where everyone plays a very different version of traditional Blackjack. Players will have to try their hand at this newfangled card game in order to take down the greedy capitalists exploiting the Blackjack-addicted townsfolk.</p>
<p>Recently Yogscast Games picked it up to become publisher, and they've been jumping in to help development with some brand new art. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Q3IzShOv9Fk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1e3674b9344aa1701e2537aba3945eee.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Q3IzShOv9Fk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“From the moment we first saw it, we knew there was something very special about Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers, so I’m relieved to be able to finally talk about our partnership,” says Simon Byron, managing director, Yogscast Games. “It’s been a real collaboration between us and Purple Moss Collectors and a genuine honour to help Mike bring the game to life. With the demo now live, I can’t wait for players to experience Dungeon &amp; Degenerate Gamblers incredible twist on a classic card game ruleset, which results in a fantastic roguelike deckbuilding adventure unlike any other. Yes, including that one.”</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>4 unique play styles based around card suits.</li>
<li>Unlock new starter decks when you complete runs, for a whole new way to play!</li>
<li>Over 250 unique cards!</li>
<li>60 characters to defeat.</li>
<li>Unique grimey pixel art aesthetic.</li>
<li>All the degeneracy from a seedy casino but with no risk to your finances, mental health, or your loved ones.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can try out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2400510/Dungeons__Degenerate_Gamblers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new demo on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support with a release due later this year.</p>

      <title>Insane FPS &#39;MULLET MADJACK&#39; gets updated for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Quite a popular recent Steam release is MULLET MADJACK, a very vibrant single-player FPS set inside a retro Anime. It looks absolutely wild and the developer has made improvements to it on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>With a unique fusion of elements influenced by classic 90s FPS games, strategy, and intense action, this game promises to keep players entertained for hours on end. It arrived on May 15th and quickly shot up to an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam.</p>
<p>In the recent <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2111190/announcements/detail/4182233099914510465" rel="noopener" target="_blank">patch</a> the developers noted they "fixed bugs between save interactions carried out from pc to steam deck and vice versa messing with the game". Additionally they also added more resolutions to work with other handheld gaming devices too. Plus other bug fixes and optimizations.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kEtCK7U34Pw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dc34f4ed90cb9d203bfb019636a537b7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kEtCK7U34Pw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exciting</strong> and dynamic combat: Race against time and infiltrate a building alone, overcoming each floor until you reach your objective.</li>
<li><strong>Campaign</strong> mode: Clear floors filled with robots, and in crucial moments, execute ultraviolent finishes on your enemies to survive.</li>
<li><strong>Survival</strong> mode: Utilize your skills in an endless mode and outdo your friends.</li>
<li><strong>Unique visual </strong>and art style: The contrasting colors between black and vibrant neon evoke the aesthetics of violent and adult anime from the era of VHS tapes.</li>
<li><strong>Engaging</strong> narrative: Set in an Old School cyberpunk world full of robots, the aesthetics of 90s anime merge with an action-packed environment.</li>
<li><strong>Nostalgic</strong> <strong>soundtrack</strong>: Inspired by the synthwave genre, the soundtrack sets the tone and urban atmosphere of the game.</li>
<li><strong>Evolve your character:</strong> Enhance your character with smart choices so that you can reach the top floor in the best possible time or you'll have to try again, all in the best Rogue-Lite style. But remember that each upgrade will affect how the game is played. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Always good to see developers put some more effort into ensuring their games work well on Steam Deck. Valve haven't yet rated it officially but on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/2111190?device=any" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> it has a Platinum rating so on deskop Linux you're good to go, and with this recent patch maybe it will see an eventual Deck Verified rating.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2111190/MULLET_MADJACK/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Ruins To Fortress is a PvP and PvE side-scrolling post-apocalyptic survival game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ruins To Fortress is a side-scrolling multiplayer PvP and PvE survival indie game set on an atmospheric dystopian island. A bit like a side-scrolling Rust. Your journey begins as you hang and glide from a drone, landing on an island shrouded in mystery and inhabited by outlaws and corporate security guards, beckoning you to uncover its secrets.</p>
<p>An interesting idea for a survival game, that seems it may feel just a bit like Kingdom series (Kingdom Two Crowns, Kingdom: New Lands). If you love multiplayer games this could be a good one, especially since you can directly host a game yourself or set up a dedicated server for it too.</p>
<p>Check out their cinematic trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ElGXcyXS0CY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/aad17249828bcc61ef1ea6f15fe80bee.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ElGXcyXS0CY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Developed by NimbleBeasts, this is the same small team that created Moonshot - The Great Espionage.</p>
<p>There's a demo available with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2585860/Ruins_To_Fortress/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Native Linux support on Steam</a>. The full game is due out sometime this year.</p>

      <title>Try the demo for Dreaming Isles, a farming life sim and a high-seas adventure</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love Stardew Valley and want something different? Dreaming Isles seems like a truly wonderful idea blending the farming life sim with a high seas adventure. It has a demo available with full Native Linux support, and it's due for release in October.</p>
<p>More about it: "Dreaming Isles is an upcoming cozy farm life sim that combines high seas adventure, relationship building, and Zelda-like sword and sorcery. Grow your own ammo (YawningDad is not liable for any damage to your farm or ship caused by the mishandling of frost berries, fire melons, or any other volatile plant life), win the hearts of the Islanders (with the possible exception of the Witch of the Woods, who has been known to turn suitors into toads), bring peace and prosperity to the land (or become a pirate and bring more of a mayhem-ey sort of peace and prosperity)."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer, it's a bit older but it's the latest they have that should give you a good idea of what to expect from this cute upcoming game:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="tiepN9PCqpM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4d323555e05b07f0390b6eb9f9c6fb5f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/tiepN9PCqpM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Really seems like a fun blending of ideas here. From a solo developer too, which is always impressive to see. And nice to see proper Linux support again for another sweet game too. With full controller support, it should also be a good one for Steam Deck players.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2258320/Dreaming_Isles/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Action-adventure game &#39;Inside The Crystal Mountain&#39; looks wild and has been overlooked</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Inside The Crystal Mountain from Intrugli Games released back in March, and it seems nearly everyone missed it and it looks pretty crazy. It has a demo available and Native Linux support, with a style that reminds me of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/05/resolutiion-is-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Resolutiion</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/the-gorgeous-looking-lilas-sky-ark-is-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lila’s Sky Ark</a>.</p>
<p>Inside The Crystal Mountain is an action adventure game with fast-paced combat and soulslike elements where you explore a mysterious world filled with ambiguous characters and challenging enemies.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aveF3WMAF4Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2376c6b3dbd5a2e6f04dab6cb852a275.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aveF3WMAF4Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the developer: "Explore a small, but dense, world filled with objects to find, characters to talk to, and new abilities to unlock. Featuring fast-paced and precise combat, every movement is critical, demanding skill and strategy to navigate through intense battles. You will progress through the experience gained, incremental upgrades, shortcuts, and secrets. As if that wasn't enough, you will be involved in a science fiction story that slowly reveals its secrets, challenging you to piece together its hidden narrative."</p>
<p>The developer told me it was developed on Linux too!</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2713740/Inside_The_Crystal_Mountain/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">out with a demo on Steam</a>. The full game is £6.69.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Warhammer Skulls Showcase has come along again, and we've got multiple new announcements plus you can grab a free game! <em>Here's just some of the announcements that were made.</em></p>
<p>Firstly, you want the freebie right? Warhammer 40,000: Gladius - Relics of War from Proxy Studios is 100% free for keeps on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/489630/Warhammer_40000_Gladius__Relics_of_War/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>. The first turn-based 4X strategy game set in the Warhammer universe and a lot of fun, it has Native Linux support too. Plus there's a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2932380/Warhammer_40000_Gladius__Demolition_Pack/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Warhammer 40,000: Gladius - Demolition Pack DLC</a> adding in 11 new units.</p>
<p>We have a fresh game announcement too with Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus II now on the way:</p>

<p>After millennia of slumber, Vargard Nefershah mobilises her dynasty’s legions to annihilate the Adeptus Mechanicus interlopers who unknowingly settled upon her world. Across the galaxy, Magos Dominus Faustinius is summoned to bring his hard-won expertise to bear and ensure the Necrons do not succeed. The conflict soon becomes a crucible of unanticipated significance, drawing to it external actors stranger and more deadly still. </p>
<p>In an exciting addition for the sequel, players will not just be battling as the Adeptus Mechanicus against the awakening of a Necron tomb world, but will also be able to fight as the Necrons for the resurgence of their dynasty , with both sides now fully playable over multiple campaigns.</p>

      <title>Atari acquires Intellivision brand and over 200 games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Since you all love reading about games industry consolidation, here's more for you! Atari have acquired a whole lot from Intellivision.</p>
<p>Atari have been making quite a few moves lately. They revived the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/atari-revives-infogrames-and-acquires-totally-reliable-delivery-service/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Infogrames brand and acquired Totally Reliable Delivery Service</a>, they also bought up <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/atari-acquires-awesomenauts-swords-soldiers-and-digital-eclipse/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Awesomenauts, Swords &amp; Soldiers and Digital Eclipse</a>, and even <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/atari-are-acquiring-night-dive-studios/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nightdive Studios are now owned by Atari</a>.</p>
<p>Clearly they're trying to make one heck of a comeback.</p>
<p>Now they also own the Intellivision brand, so Intellivision Entertainment LLC will now be rebranding to continue on with their AMICO console. The <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/05/23/2887219/0/en/Atari-Acquires-Intellivision-Brand.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release</a> noted this deal includes giving Atari "the rights to more than 200 titles from the Intellivision portfolio and the Intellivision trademarks".</p>
<p>So now with that Atari plan to expand both digital and physical distribution of classic Intellivision games, and of course look to use their newly acquired IP for potential future games and licensing.</p>
<p>“This was a very rare opportunity to unite former competitors and bring together fans of Atari, Intellivision and the golden age of gaming,” said Wade Rosen, Chairman and CEO of Atari.</p>
<p>“Uniting Atari and Intellivision after 45 years ends the longest-running console war in history,” said Mike Mika, Studio Head at Digital Eclipse, an Atari-owned game studio.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental adds D3D12 support in OpenXR, Fixes for Foundry and Ubisoft Launcher</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Steam Deck and desktop Linux fans have more testing to do, with Valve releasing a new Proton Experimental update today fixing games, launchers and more.</p>
<p>Firstly, Valve noted <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2075070/KinitoPET/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">KinitoPET</a> as now playable as of this release. Sounds weird: "A psychological horror experience that takes place through Kinito, an early 2000s virtual assistant.".</p>
<p>On top of that Valve added support for D3D12 in OpenXR. Which is great to see for VR, after bumping up OpenXR support to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/proton-experimental-openxr-command-conquer-the-desolate-hope/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">version 1.1.36 in a previous update</a>.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The other fixes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Previously in Proton Hotfix: Fixed <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2073850/THE_FINALS/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Finals</a> crashing on launch after a recent game update.</li>
<li>Fixed hosting multiplayer games in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/983870/FOUNDRY/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Foundry</a>.</li>
<li>Fixed Ubisoft Launcher not starting games with a fresh Proton prefix.</li>
<li>Fixed outdated Nvidia driver warning in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2215430/Ghost_of_Tsushima_DIRECTORS_CUT/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ghost of Tsushima</a>.</li>
<li>Fixed issue causing no audio being played while <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1250410/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_40th_Anniversary_Edition/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft Flight Simulator</a> displays developers logos.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4382395031716477545gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4382395031716477545gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured - Foundry</em></p>
<p>See the full Proton changelog on <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>It's interesting to see more VR improvements like this. Not only are we seeing OpenXR get improved in Proton, but we've also seen <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/steamvr-25-released-with-multiple-linux-fixes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">multiple SteamVR fixes lately for Linux too</a>. Hopefully this is the start of more VR work for Linux and dare I say it, the long-rumoured Deckard VR kit from Valve eventually? One can dream.</p>

      <title>Mighty Marbles is an upcoming physics game that looks like a fusion of kids toys</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I remember playing with various crazy Marbles games when younger, and again with my own small person and now one developer is making a whole game about messing with them in Mighty Marbles. The plan is to release it into Early Access sometime this year. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Welcome to Mighty Marbles, a cute physics based game where you control the level to guide the marble to victory. Inspired by the desire to see real life physics toys as a video game! Each level is a playground of diverse puzzles, each with its own unique set of controls. Fear not; an intuitive on-screen controller showcases how to navigate each puzzle, granting you the freedom to switch between challenges at your whim!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the trailer: </p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="PVstJrsnIBw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c678fdfb9a4c37eb5f8896f26a3b556a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/PVstJrsnIBw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>PUZZLES - Prepare for a series of interconnected puzzles in every level, each presenting distinct challenges that put your mastery of physics to the test. Losing your marble leads to a swift rescue thanks to the adorable Bobby Copters, getting you back in the action quickly.</li>
<li>CAMERA - Tailor your gaming experience to your liking: opt for the close-up camera, immersing yourself in a detailed view of the puzzle, or switch to the bird's eye perspective for a comprehensive overview of the entire level. Can't settle on one? No problem! Switch effortlessly between the two views with a simple button press, ensuring you have the perfect perspective for every moment.</li>
<li>COURSES - The levels are organized into courses. Each course has 9 levels sharing the same theme with new puzzles introduced each level. Initially for early access there are 3 courses, toybox, machines and mini golf. Additionally each course can be played with different game modes to explore new and challenging ways to play.</li>
<li>COLLECT - No marble game is complete without the joy of collecting marbles! Completing fast times on each course and each mode will unlock new and exciting marbles. Once collected, these marbles become yours to choose from, allowing you to personalize your experience by selecting any of your acquired marbles before embarking on a course.</li>
</ul>
<p>The developer has been testing it working well on Steam Deck too:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="I9cR0Za_Cq0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/78af2d96dc63e0d287ec0c573a0605ad.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/I9cR0Za_Cq0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Looks like good fun, could be a great one for kids too. A nice family-friendly playground.</p>

<li>Lots of items and weapons.</li>
<li>Highly interactive maps.</li>
</ul>
<p>The demo has local multiplayer and online support, but no public lobbies in the demo. It's only a small slice of what to expect but seems pretty funny and worth a look.</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2643290/Oblin_Party/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">out on Steam</a>. </p>

      <title>DAVE THE DIVER gets a free to keep (but time-limited) Godzilla DLC</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is a bit unusual. DAVE THE DIVER from developer MINTROCKET has a new Godzilla DLC out now, which is entirely free to claim but it's not sticking around forever. DAVE THE DIVER is rated Steam Deck Verified and Gold on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1868140" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a>.</p>
<p>The DLC will only be available to claim until November 23, 2024. After that, no one else will be able to claim it. If you do claim it though, it's yours to <em>keep</em>. The gaming industry does some weird stuff at times. Why put all the effort into a collab to pull it away so quickly? Anyway, since it's free to keep you got nothing to lose.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="494_fDRoTHo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/28f9f6a7f57d2bd427beb01b49ea5bf1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/494_fDRoTHo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A truly wonderful game, and now with some extra free content too. Nice. There was also a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1868140/view/4145079037715714518" rel="noopener" target="_blank">patch</a> to fix some issues.</p>
<p>DAVE THE DIVER is currently 25% off on:</p>

      <title>Wraithbinder is a new metroidvania-inspired action RPG from the dev of Songbringer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wraithbinder is an action roguelike RPG with metroidvania-inspired ability progression. It's just about to enter Early Access with Native Linux support from Wizard Fu (Songbringer) and Double Eleven. <u>Note</u>: developer sent a key to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4218320-GamingOnLinux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our Steam Curator</a>.</p>
<p>The Early Access release is scheduled for May 27th.</p>
<p>Each run you build a different sequence of weapons, abilities and relics. Abilities unlock new areas by allowing you to progress beyond where you could before. You get to keep your armour, status and gold across runs to keep pushing further. Right now it has solo play but the developer is also working to add in online co-op as well. Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="fjKYZGE9rcA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5d4e1d0f530adafd24a92d11bf3fbb5a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/fjKYZGE9rcA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Seems like a lot of fun if you love action-RPGs like this. Each run through gives you a randomly-generated dungeon to crawl through while building a new sequence of weapons and abilities. When you discover a new ability you get to choose between multiple, allowing you to craft your experience. New abilities will unlock previously inaccessible areas in a Metroidvania-like fashion.</p>
<p>There's some interesting character customisation on offer too:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12811614141716463596gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12811614141716463596gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>In my own early testing the game runs <em>great</em> on Linux with the Native build, tested on Kubuntu 24.04. So far, I'm really liking what I'm seeing here with the theme and the combat, worth a look. It's going to be in Early Access for about a year, as the developer plans to add in all sorts like:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Online co-op multiplayer.</li>
<li>Cutscenes and other story elements.</li>
<li>New biomes, enemies, minibosses and bosses.</li>
<li>Many more relics, scrolls, armor and weapons to find.</li>
<li>New abilities, gameplay mechanics and objects.</li>
<li>A reliquary and bestiary.</li>
<li>Additional language support.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>With Linux support and full controller support it should also run great on Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Crownfall Act II and Update 7.36 are a big change for Dota 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The way you play Dota 2 is about to change in multiple ways, with Crownfall Act II and Update 7.36 out now and it sounds pretty exciting actually.</p>
<p>Crownfall Act II is an expansion to the new overworld map you can explore to do little quests, which was a fun addition in the last major update. This second part adds in a new overworld map taking place in the unforgiving deserts of Druud, along with a new story, new characters, new cosmetics, new mini-games and some "surprises". You'll be able to play all acts up until it's eventually removed when Crownfall is finished.</p>
<p>The biggest change is to the gameplay though with Update 7.36 adding in Innates Abilities, giving each hero a new ability for the entire game from beginning to end and every hero ability is unique. Some Innates grant a hero a unique effect. For example, Dawnbreaker reveals the whole map to allies when the sun rises.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10206956271716460074gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10206956271716460074gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Another big addition are Hero Facets. These are hero customizations to change the playstyle of any hero to better match up to player preference. Each hero has at least two possible Facets, and you can pick the one you want during strategy time or at the start of a match. For example: Viper can choose between adding an AoE damage burst to Poison Attack, or increasing defensive buffs while Viper remains in Nethertoxin.</p>
<p>Main gameplay changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Innate Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Innates are abilities that are present on the hero for the entire game, from the very beginning of every match. Every hero has a unique Innate</li>
<li>The Innate for each hero can be viewed on the Hero page, or in-game by hovering a new icon between the hero talents and abilities</li>
<li>There are two types of Innates:
<ul>
<li>Some Innates grant a hero a unique effect. For example, Faceless Void slows enemy attack projectiles within range, and Dawnbreaker reveals the whole map to allies when the sun rises</li>
<li>Some Innates change a hero ability to have five levels and get a free ability point at level 1. For example, Kunkka's Tidebringer and Legion Commander's Moment of Courage now start at level 1, and can still be upgraded four more times like normal</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Facets</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Facets are a hero customization choice that provide the ability to better align the playstyle of a hero with a specific match or player preference. Facets are specific to heroes: Each hero has at least two Facets, and every player can choose the Facet they prefer during strategy time at the beginning of each match</li>
<li>Hero Facets can be viewed on their hero page, below the hero name and tags. They can also be viewed in-game by hovering a new icon between the hero talent and abilities, on the scoreboard, or on the top bar when holding Alt</li>
<li>Facets are set for all players after the strategy time, and cannot be changed during a match. Facet choices aren't revealed to the enemy team until after the game begins</li>
<li>Facets can have a variety of effects, for example:
<ul>
<li>Viper can choose between adding an AoE damage burst to Poison Attack, or increasing defensive buffs while Viper remains in Nethertoxin</li>
<li>Wraith King can choose between summoning skeletons, or dealing additional curse damage when attacking</li>
<li>Leshrac can choose between his attacks restoring mana, or changing Diabolic Edict to explode faster but deal no damage to buildings</li>
<li>Lone Druid can choose between an improved Spirit Link, granting lifesteal in both directions, or allowing True Form to be cast on the Spirit Bear</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Strategy time is extended by 15/10/5 seconds for the 1/2/3 weeks immediately after a numbered patch</li>
<li>Glyph of Fortification no longer refreshes when the first Tier 3 tower is destroyed</li>
<li>Glyph of Fortification now refreshes when the first Melee Barracks is destroyed</li>
<li>AoE Bonuses now affect all auras and Cleave sources</li>
<li>Dominated Creeps no longer allow players to bypass Backdoor Protection</li>
<li>Hero Denies now grant experience to the hero who created the deniable debuff.</li>
<li>Mana Bars are always visible for enemies</li>
<li>Fountain Buff grants Couriers haste movement</li>
<li>If Courier has no items, pressing the Deliver Courier button sends the Courier back home</li>
<li>Mana Cost Reduction effects no longer work on abilities that drain mana over time</li>
<li>Attack Speed Display is no longer normalized to 1.7 BAT. This means heroes’ max attack speed is always 700, and a buff that grants 20 Attack Speed will display as +20 always instead of a different number based on the hero’s BAT (No actual gameplay change, just a display change)</li>
<li>Spell's Cast Range is now always listed with the new icon, which is located near Mana Costs and Cooldown</li>
<li>Holding Alt displays the vision range of all Watchers in the map</li>
<li>Experience gain from Abilities and Wisdom Rune will now show up separately in the post-game XP Breakdown for Dota Plus users</li>
<li>Added a "LEVELS WITH:" parameter for ability descriptions to show which ability needs to be upgraded to level this one</li>
<li>Ability tooltips now show icons next to ability values, indicating that those are upgraded by Aghanim's Shard/Scepter, Talents, or Facets</li>
<li>Updated spectator view controls for live and replays to match vision unlinking</li>
<li>Using Radiant/Dire Fog will now correctly hide members of Radiant/Dire that have had their vision unlinked and are not visible</li>
<li>Using the player perspective on a player whose vision is unlinked will correctly hide units they can no longer see</li>
<li>Pinging items of enemies that can't be seen currently no longer reveals information on whether those items were consumed or not</li>
<li>In demo mode -createhero command supports facets by adding facet name or its number at the end of the command</li>
<li>New Dota Labs Feature: "Persistent Range Indicators" -- If you hold Alt while right-clicking on either your experience indicator, attack range indicator (the stats part of portrait), or an ability/item, the game will draw a persistent range indicator in the world for it. You can only have at most one active at any given time, but it updates automatically when your attack/cast/AoE range changes</li>
<li>New Dota Labs Feature: "Dynamic Health Bar Focus" -- The health bar of any hovered unit will always draw on top of other health bars</li>
<li>Added the ability to type in a hero name to jump to that hero when viewing patch notes in the client</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ability Draft</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Innates have the following rules for Ability Draft</li>
<li>Innate abilities that do not appear on a hero's ability bar will be automatically assigned to the hero when spawning in, but cannot be drafted</li>
<li>Innate abilities that can be leveled with skill points are draftable, but will not be automatically assigned when spawning in</li>
<li>All other innate abilities are disabled for Ability Draft</li>
<li>Facets have the following rules for Ability Draft:</li>
<li>You can choose any hero facet belonging to your assigned hero during strategy time</li>
<li>Facets that grant new abilities are disabled</li>
<li>Facets that replace abilities will work if you draft the ability that is being replaced</li>
<li>If a facet has no effect on your hero you can still select it. In game, the facet will notate it has no effect</li>
</ul>

      <title>Microsoft&#39;s new Recall AI will take screenshots of everything you do - freaky</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This will be preaching to the choir for some readers, as you didn't exactly need another reason not to use Windows right? Microsoft's new Recall AI will take screenshots of everything you do and that sounds truly terrible. <em>Spyware as a service, courtesy of Microsoft's push to stick AI into everything.</em></p>
<p>You might think I'm being perhaps a bit sensational here or even clickbaity, but no, this is actually genuinely what Recall does. As Microsoft said: "Recall uses Copilot+ PC advanced processing capabilities to take images of your active screen every few seconds", and not only just on their new ARM PCs, they said it will roll out to x86 platforms too via a Windows update.</p>
<p>What's the point? It's to give you a special timeline of your day (it stores up to 3 months worth of what you do), allowing you to go back through it and find things, highlight things, open the original application shown in pictures and <em>eventually</em> open up whatever you were working on in the right application with the right content at the time. Basically, some fancy-pants AI search going over everything you've done.</p>
<p>Microsoft do say the storage is local to your device, and is "protected using data encryption on your device" and even using BitLocker if you're on Windows 11 Pro or an enterprise Windows 11 SKU. Microsoft also claim it doesn't share it anywhere else, at all, no advertisers or Microsoft themselves. But, how far do we trust data being fed into a black-box AI that no one can really see what it's doing huh?</p>
<p>Here's the thing: straight from their own <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/copilot-plus-pcs#faq2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FAQ</a> (scroll down) it notes how "Recall does not perform content moderation" and it will "not hide information such as passwords or financial account numbers". Oh wow, that sure sounds good for your privacy doesn't it. But don't worry it "does not take snapshots of certain kinds of content, including InPrivate web browsing sessions in Microsoft Edge" and "material protected with digital rights management (DRM)" is also protected. We can't have Netflix or Disney getting annoyed with it taking a shot of that movie you watched, nope.</p>
<p>I'm not even what you may call a "privacy nut". I use big-name stuff all the time, my main browser is plain ol' Google Chrome and you get the idea. But still, this is super weird.</p>
<p>What happens if someone else gets access to your device? Lost, stolen, sold (and you forgot to wipe) and so on. If you get hacked, they'll end up seeing everything, it's another major attack point. Yeah great it's stored on your device, but people and companies get broken open all the time, malicious orgs will have a real party with your data. There's plenty of other times people may end up with access to your device to think about, I'm not going to list them all of course.</p>
<p>You can hear Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speak about it to The Wall Street Journal, skip to 3:23:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uHEPBzYick0?rel=0&amp;start=203"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a8affdd649ddde347c3fb6cb90475bed.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uHEPBzYick0?rel=0&amp;start=203" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>No thanks. I'll pass, forever. I never want this. It feels creepy and gross.</p>
<p>The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) is already <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/news-and-blogs/2024/05/statement-in-response-to-microsoft-recall-feature/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">looking into it</a>. No doubt others will be too. A privacy nightmare for everyone.</p>
<p>If you wish to try Linux, I can recommend <a href="https://kubuntu.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kubuntu</a> which is my daily-driver.</p>

      <title>Racing game BlazeRush ending support for Linux, macOS and SteamVR</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Targem Games just announced their racing game BlazeRush is getting a big upgrade for the tenth anniversary but they're going to sunset their Linux, macOS and SteamVR support.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/302710/view/4190115033974331871" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam they didn't go into detail on the exact reasons other than some vague note about issues. Here's what they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello, intergalactic racers!</p>
<p>Due to technical difficulties, support for the game on Linux and Mac systems will be discontinued and the SteamVR version will also become unavailable.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, downloading and running BlazeRush on Linux, Mac and SteamVR will soon be impossible.</p>
<p>This will not affect players who use Windows systems. In addition, we are happy to announce that a major update for the Windows version will soon be released to celebrate the tenth anniversary of BlazeRush! Stay tuned!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently, the game has a Native Linux version and it is Steam Deck Verified. Valve's verification for Steam Deck was done on the Native Linux version too, so Valve will end up being <em>forced</em> to re-test this one on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> if it's to keep the Verified sticker.</p>
<p>What the developer said above is <em>technically</em> incorrect though. Even if they entirely removed the Linux version, all you'll need to do is use Proton, so it won't be as "impossible" as they say. If they do plan to just entirely remove them, that's a whole 'nother problem though which just <em>shouldn't</em> be a thing. Delisting so they're not advertised and updated? Fine, but completely removing is <em>incredibly</em> anti-consumer.</p>
<p>Still a shame to see this happen at all though, as I've played it a good few times over the years in local multiplayer and it's an absolute riot. It's a <strong>really</strong> fun game. So I'm thankful Proton from Valve exists yet again.</p>
<p>The game is available to buy from: <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/blazerush?ref=gol" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fanatical</a> | <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/blazerush?partner=gamingonlinux" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> | <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/302710/BlazeRush/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a></p>
<p>I did a video of this one a whole 5 years ago:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="RJ6uynCjVIs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8731201266cfc2a0d5c3728d29a8529d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/RJ6uynCjVIs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Update 24/05/24</strong> - The developer has released another Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/302710/view/4190115033981265543" rel="noopener" target="_blank">news post</a> to clarify the situation a little. Here's what they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the last news we indicated that the version for Mac and Linux systems will become completely unavailable. This message was incomplete and contained an error!</p>
<p>We would like to correct ourselves and make things clear: the version for Linux and Mac OS will not receive the upcoming update. However, users of these operating systems will be able to continue to download and play the current version of BlazeRush.</p>
<p>We apologize for our mistake and wish you the wildest interplanetary races!  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>At least on Linux / Steam Deck, you will be able to just run the updated Windows version with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>. But still, Valve will need to re-verify it for Steam Deck now too, which the developer did not mention.</p>

      <title>Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader updated for Steam Deck UI and Font improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader from Owlcat Games got updated this week to improve the experience of playing it on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Currently, it's rated Steam Deck Playable by Valve and Platinum on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/2186680" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> from users. For Steam Deck, Valve noted it had issues with small text, manual graphics tweaks being needed and you need to manually bring up the on-screen keyboard (STEAM + X).</p>
<p>At least some of those issues have been worked on now with the May 20th patch <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2186680/announcements/detail/6488076199785150488" rel="noopener" target="_blank">noting</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added a number of improvements and optimizations to UI and fonts for Steam Deck and controller interface;</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That was amongst a whole bunch of bug fixes and improvements across the whole game. Nice to see, hopefully they will have a few more improvements coming there. It really doesn't take all that much to properly support the Steam Deck, as long as it performs well enough.</p>

      <title>Tchia updated to improve text on Steam Deck plus performance improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tchia is a cute looking tropical open-world adventure from Awaceb and Kepler Interactive that released in March and now it should look better on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>"Join Tchia on her tropical open-world adventure as she sets off to rescue her father from the cruel tyrant, Meavora, ruler of the archipelago. Climb, glide, swim, and sail your boat around beautiful islands as you explore a physics-driven sandbox. Face the fabric soldiers created by Meavora in open encounters where your creativity gives you the edge. Take control of any animal or object you can find, make new friends and jam on your fully playable Ukulele. A poetic coming-of-age story inspired by New Caledonia."</p>

<p>In an update released yesterday, May 21st, the developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1496590/announcements/detail/6010694637981385481" rel="noopener" target="_blank">noted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed some performance issues, especially one occurring during the rain.</li>
<li>Made some texts more readable, especially on SteamDeck.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently Valve has rated it only as Steam Deck Playable, due to those two issues above. So perhaps it might now be able to get Steam Deck Verified once it gets a re-test. For desktop Linux players, it has a Platinum rating on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1496590" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> from crowd-sourced user reports.</p>
<p>You can buy it from:</p>

      <title>Cyberpulse is an arcade twin-stick thrower where you smash everything into the wall</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Blending together the visual style from the likes of Geometry Wars and other similar retro arcade experiences, Cyberpulse gets you to throw enemies around and smash them into the wall. <u>Note</u>: key provided to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4218320-GamingOnLinux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our Steam Curator</a>.</p>
<p>So it's not a twin-stick shooter, but a twin-stick thrower with you using the power of cyberkinetic forces. Quite a fun and different spin on the bright pulsing neon arcade game, and one you can bring a friend a lot with too. There's a full campaign mode to smash through, where you can bring a friend. And on top of that there's a multiplayer mode where four players can dash around various arenas to try and destroy each other.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SGLn-XL-Ft8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/73fa060d611218e95960498ffcb06256.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SGLn-XL-Ft8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I've tested a fair bit thanks to the developer sending a key, and it's actually great fun. Perhaps just a tad too fast for my tastes that really took some getting used to on some levels, but the idea is really entertaining and unusual in how you combat swarms of enemies. Across 50 levels in the non-linear campaign, there's a lot of different types of standard enemies, bosses and various secrets to collect as well. The developer said the levels are hand-crafted too, but with just a little randomness to keep it all fresh to chase high scores.</p>
<p>Nice to see more games like this appear that are trying to do something just a little different, it reminds me a bit of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/09/breakpoint-is-an-arcade-high-score-seekers-dream-and-its-ridiculously-fun/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Breakpoint</a> which had a similar style and overall theme but you used melee weapons and now here we're using kinetic forces to throw things around. Pure joy.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A blend of genres: twin-stick shooters, shmups, arena battlers, and even metroidvanias contribute their mechanics creating a unique gameplay experience.</li>
<li>Innovative game physics: rather than shooting bullets, you control cyberkinetic forces to hurl your enemies into molten firewalls.</li>
<li>50+ hand-crafted levels in a non-linear campaign full of collective secrets to reward exploration.</li>
<li>Local two player co-op: coordinate your movements and try not to toss your teammate into a firewall (or throw them around just for the laughs).</li>
<li>Four player versus: dunk your friends in 100+ exhilarating versus arenas.</li>
<li>Customizable multiplayer experience: tweak dozens of settings to create exactly the kind of gameplay experience you want, from a crazy party game to a competitive arena brawler.</li>
<li>A modern take on retro classics with amazing vector-like graphics and an original synthwave soundtrack.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1318820/Cyberpulse/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">now on Steam</a> with Native Linux support. Another easy recommendation for arcade smashing fun.</p>

      <title>Braid, Anniversary Edition updated to improve Steam Deck OLED support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Braid, Anniversary Edition (which released recently) got updated that should make it feel better specifically on the Steam Deck OLED model, and the frame limiter. </p>
<p>I missed the release on this one, as Thekla, Inc. (Jonathan Blow) were originally going to support Linux and macOS with it as I covered in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/08/braid-is-getting-a-much-upgraded-anniversary-edition-releasing-in-2021/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the original announcement</a> article. However, on November 8th, 2023 the website was updated to remove mentions of Linux and macOS (see the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20231105024859/http://braid-game.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Archive</a>). So now for Linux / Steam Deck you'll need to use Proton, as the original Braid on Steam has been <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/26800/Braid/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">delisted</a> (although it's still on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/braid" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a> - for now).</p>
<p>Anyway: there's been multiple updates since the May 14th launch, but for the Steam Deck OLED update on May 16th it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/499180/view/6215608421519021097" rel="noopener" target="_blank">noted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Restored World 4 audio timings to their OG speeds.</li>
<li>Restored the OG Chinese translations for the story text.</li>
<li>Fixed flickering ladders in World 1-1 at some frame rates.</li>
<li>Fixed confusing World 8 commentary door order.</li>
<li>Fixed falling through the floor after completing the game and playing a commentary in World 0-0.</li>
<li><strong>Improved support for OLED Steam Deck and for Steam Deck frame rate limiter.</strong></li>
<li>Enabled variable frame rate when vsync is explicitly disabled.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Control the flow of time to solve subtle platform puzzles in this update of the indie classic "Braid," featuring refreshed artwork and seriously in-depth creator commentary. Travel from a city house through a series of interconnected worlds where time behaves strangely, searching for an elusive Princess. Along the way you'll explore memories and regrets that still haunt you. This Anniversary Edition remaster of the award-winning platformer contains fully repainted high-resolution graphics, new sound effects and extensive audio commentary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Braid, Anniversary Edition is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/499180/Braid_Anniversary_Edition/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: On May 3rd, Jonathan Blow <a href="https://x.com/Jonathan_Blow/status/1786169573152117044" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted</a> on X (formerly Twitter) "Proton. We will do Linux port later." in reply to a user question about it. So perhaps we may still see an official Linux version. Blow has GamingOnLinux blocked on X, so I missed it until it was <a href="https://x.com/jajdorkster/status/1793246624367419541" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pointed out</a>.</p>

      <title>Little-Known Galaxy is Stardew Valley blended with Star Trek</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you enjoy a space sci-fi theme and like your chilled games, you may want to take a look at the new release of Little-Known Galaxy. It's a cozy single-player RPG space adventure where you'll meet various friendly characters, go exploring, do a little crafting and of course farming too.</p>
<p>"Join Space Alliance as a new captain-in-training and work with your quirky crew to solve the mysteries of an ancient relic found on the Grey Planet. What mysteries will it uncover? What kind of adventure lies ahead? And who will you meet along the way? It’s up to you now Captain. Remember to support your crew, follow your heart, and always take care of each other."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="MWE6eBt9Qyc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/629dbfc201fd0bb15eb42999293397bc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/MWE6eBt9Qyc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The game released on May 20th and the developer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2521600/view/5991554339551136776" rel="noopener" target="_blank">noted</a> they're waiting for verification from Valve on Steam Deck support but they mentioned how it's "100% Steam Deck compatible" including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Runs smooth.</li>
<li>Easy to use controls.</li>
<li>Steam Deck control button prompts.</li>
<li>Adjustable user-interface scaling. (if needed)</li>
<li>Text legibility.</li>
<li>Native resolution support with additional zoom options.</li>
<li>Re-bindable controls for your convenience.</li>
<li>Virtual keyboards for text input.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Given that it works well on Steam Deck, it will also work great on desktop Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>. Nice to see more developers hooking up good support!</p>
<p>Features include plenty of space customization, crafting / farming / cooking, story cinematics, various objectives to go through, the ability to befriend and romance, you can hatch and raise various little alien creatures, space exploration and much more. Sounds real sweet.</p>

      <title>ELDEN RING Shadow of the Erdtree gets a new trailer ahead of June release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I know a great many of you are impatiently waiting for ELDEN RING Shadow of the Erdtree, so maybe this new story trailer will keep you going just that bit longer.</p>
<p>ELDEN RING is Steam Deck Verified and runs great on desktop Linux with Proton. It is also repeatedly one of the most-played (by hours) games on Steam Deck as it was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/steam-deck-most-played-for-april-2024-has-plenty-of-fallout/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">6th in April</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/heres-the-most-played-steam-deck-games-from-march-2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">5th in March</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/heres-the-most-played-steam-deck-games-for-february-2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">4th in February</a> and I fully expect the expansion release on June 21st will bump it back up again. It's also just one of the best reviewed games on Steam overall.</p>
<p>FromSoftware didn't say much about the new trailer only: "The shadow of the story can now be told. Learn the history of the Realm of Shadow." so have a look below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6uT8wGtB3yQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2b8c8a3a0ea7103c2a95888eed997860.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6uT8wGtB3yQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>The Shadow of the Erdtree expansion features an all-new story set in the Land of Shadow imbued with mystery, perilous dungeons, and new enemies, weapons and equipment.</p>
<p>Discover uncharted territories, face formidable adversaries, and revel in the satisfying triumph of victory. Dive into the riveting interplay of characters, where drama and intrigue intertwine, that create an immersive experience to savor and enjoy.</p>

      <title>Nightdive Studios confirm Linux and macOS ports of System Shock are cancelled</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The System Shock remake from Nightdive Studios was originally funded on Kickstarter, and after delays it was eventually released on May 30th, 2023 but two platforms have been missing - Linux and macOS.</p>
<p>For their crowdfunding campaign, the Linux and macOS versions were a stretch-goal. The base goal for the campaign was $900,000, but they put both Linux and macOS together on a $1.1 million additional goal which was hit, as the campaign finished on around $1,350,700.</p>
<p>Nightdive were pretty silent on both platforms for a long time, especially after they ended up having a lot of issues actually making the game, at one point they entirely <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2018/02/development-on-the-new-system-shock-has-been-paused/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">paused development</a> on it.</p>
<p>In a new Kickstarter <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1598858095/system-shock/posts/4106201" rel="noopener" target="_blank">update</a> posted May 21st, 2024 they confirmed neither versions will happen now:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is System Shock still coming to MacOS and Linux?</p>
<p>Unfortunately no, plans for MacOS and Linux releases of System Shock have been shelved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>macOS is not exactly surprising, Apple are notorious for making things more and more difficult for developers. On the Linux side, it's also not overly surprising given that we have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> now which enables the game to run with a tick of box on Steam. I even <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/new-system-shock-remake-demo-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">showed it previously</a> running really nicely on Steam Deck with Proton using the demo.</p>

      <title>Kickstarter will now allow late-pledges for finished campaigns</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kickstarter, the popular platform for crowdfunding all sorts of things including video games and board games, is expanding with some new tools.</p>
<p>Announced May 21st in an official <a href="https://updates.kickstarter.com/a-new-vision-for-kickstarter/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a>, one major addition that many have been asking for is a direct way to support a Kickstarter campaign after it has already finished. Creators have already been doing this via external means like the popular <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BackerKit</a> for quite a long time now.</p>
<p>Kickstarter have been testing this Late Pledge system with a select few since April, noting how creators have used these third-party services to collect more funding. Clearly, Kickstarter want more people to stay within their own system, and this feature just makes sense for them to add and so now it's available to all creators globally.</p>
<p>They've also formed a "Kickstarter Performance team", dedicated to help with marketing to promote campaigns. Kickstarter say this team "provides support every step of the way, from creative services and pre-launch marketing support to ad measurement and execution" and a select group have already been using it which they say has helped creators "raise nearly $1 million in pledges".</p>
<p>On top of that they're improving their survey system, which again creators often ended up doing outside of Kickstarter to collect info for special pledges. Kickstarter say their revamped tool will allow creators to gather your address, item preferences (like size, edition, colour etc), deal with add-ons and so on. Once again, it makes sense for Kickstarter to have all this themselves.</p>

      <title>IGN acquired the Gamer Network including RPS, Eurogamer, VG247 and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's not only game publishers that have been consolidating their power buying up lots of developers and other publishers, it's also happening in gaming media with IGN <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ign-entertainment-acquires-eurogamer-gi-vg247-rock-paper-shotgun-and-more" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buying up</a> the Gamer Network.</p>
<p>This means IGN Entertainment now control GamesIndustry.biz, Eurogamer, Rock Paper Shotgun, VG247, and Dicebreaker. They also hold shares in Outside Xbox, Digital Foundry, and Hookshot (which operates Nintendo life, Push Square, Pure Xbox, and Time Extension). They were purchased for an "undisclosed sum".</p>
<p>IGN didn't say in their own news post on it but right away they fired a bunch of people, as confirmed by GamesIndustry.biz in <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ign-entertainment-acquires-eurogamer-gi-vg247-rock-paper-shotgun-and-more" rel="noopener" target="_blank">their article</a> as they noted "As a result of the acquisition, some redundancies have been made across the UK-based organisation.".</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>As for why they are doing this? Well, the internet sucks right now. </em></p>
<p>More websites are employing the use of AI, pushing out actual people. Spamming search engines, which pushes down everyone else and it's only going to get worse as AI is pushed more and more. This feels like IGN ensuring people come to them, as eventually the only sites that may be able to weather the AI storm are those that are just too big to fall.</p>
<p>It's just another reminder to directly support those you find useful and whose content you enjoy.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA 555.42.02 Beta driver out bringing Wayland explicit sync</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The driver release many NVIDIA fans have been waiting on is here today. NVIDIA released the NVIDIA 555.42.02 Beta driver with some necessary upgrades for Wayland support.</p>
<p>Since it's a Beta driver, it should go without saying that there may still be some lingering issues and bugs. This is for testing, but it shouldn't be too long before NVIDIA push out a stable driver with a small version number bump for when it's ready for everyone. Not that this will stop you right? You all want to try it.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>The main changes are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The GSP firmware is now used by default on all GPUs which support it. It can be disabled by setting the kernel module parameter `NVreg_EnableGpuFirmware=0`.</li>
<li>Added support for the linux-drm-syncobj-v1 protocol for Wayland explicit sync in EGL.</li>
<li>Added immediate presentation mode support to Vulkan Wayland WSI. This presentation mode instructs the compositors not to wait for a vertical blanking period to update the application's surface content, which may result in tearing.</li>
<li>Removed support for Base Mosaic on GeForce, which was previously available only on select GPU boards with some motherboards, and limited to five display devices.</li>
<li>Enabled HDMI 10 bits per component support by default; disable by loading nvidia-modeset with `hdmi_deepcolor=0`.</li>
<li>Added an interactive prompt to nvidia-installer to allow selecting between the proprietary and open kernel modules, on systems where both kernel module types are supported.</li>
<li>Added support for using EGL instead of GLX as the OpenGL ICD for NvFBC.</li>
<li>Changed the minimum required Linux kernel version from 3.10 to 4.15.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>The bug fixes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused "Failed to apply atomic modeset" and "Flip event timeout" messages to be printed to the system log when a DRM client such as ddcutil drops "master" permissions while a framebuffer console is being initialized.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug, when nvidia-drm is loaded with the fbdev=1 module parameter on some kernels, that caused incorrect colors to be displayed.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression that led to Xid errors when loading the NVIDIA driver on some notebook systems with RTX 4xxx series GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused driver build failure when using separate kernel source and output directories on Linux v6.6 and later.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that incorrectly allowed `nvidia-smi -r` to reset the primary GPU when using the open kernel modules.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceSupportKHR to incorrectly report support for Wayland surfaces when nvidia-drm is not loaded with modeset=1.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause the display to lock up when suspending on a kernel with CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE_DEFERRED_TAKEOVER enabled with nvidia-drm loaded with modeset=1 and fbdev=1.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could lead to a system hang and "Idling display engine timed out" messages when VT switching on an HDMI Fixed Rate Link (FRL) display.</li>
</ul>

      <title>King under the Mountain (Mountaincore) went open source as developer shuts down</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><em>King under the Mountain</em> from developer Rocket Jump Technology, a simulation-based settlement-building strategy game, that was going through a big upgrade and re-brand with <em>Mountaincore</em> ended up shutting down and being open sourced.</p>
<p>This is actually news from back in <em>January</em> that I missed (thanks for the tip, Sin), because there's just so much news all the time and smaller games end up getting a bit buried. Which, is actually part of the issue here, although only part of the problem though.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4387070301716294327gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4387070301716294327gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - King under the Mountain</em></p>
<p>You see King under the Mountain was picked up by a unnamed publisher, who helped finance a big upgrade to the game. 9 months into expanding the game — the publisher <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/930230/announcements/detail/3684547928703321045?snr=2___" rel="noopener" target="_blank">backed out</a>. Why? As the developer said "They were worried that a number of similar games that have released in the time between would cause it to struggle to stand out.".</p>
<p>The developer mentioned they were able to continue it on, and eventually re-released it as Mountaincore. That didn't go well either, as the developer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2370310/view/7217647935762367813" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted</a> on Steam back in January, with the release being so small they didn't pull in enough revenue to "keep even a single dev employed working on the game".</p>
<p>As a result the developer "had to be declared insolvent", and so they no longer exist to continue developing it in their free-time.</p>
<p>In this case though, it's <em>somewhat</em> a happy ending, and probably one of the best endings you can hope for, as the original game King under the Mountain was made fully <a href="https://github.com/rossturner/king-under-the-mountain" rel="noopener" target="_blank">open source</a> under the MIT license. So anyone who wants to hack away on it, or build something from it, can now do so. The upgraded version with Mountaincore couldn't be released as "the legal ownership of Mountaincore itself is still unclear".</p>
<p>Real shame this, as no one wants to see a developer have to shut due to low sales, but in this case it's also partly because the publisher backed-out after making them go silent on it for so long.</p>

      <title>It&#39;s beeautiful! APICO 4.0 brings automation machines to the chilled beekeeping sim</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>APICO is a chilled beekeeping sim from TNgineers that just got a little bit more industrious, with the free APICO 4.0 update giving you some fun new tools. Update 4.0: A Hive of Industry, is the final update for the game and they're going out with a bang on this one with an automation system, seasonal events, new crafting materials and even pets.</p>
<p>The developers supports bee, beekeeping, pollinator and conservation-based charities with a portion of proceeds from each sale too. Gotta save the bees right? Where would we bee without them. Anyway, check out the update trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5WysLxj7yQU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/14028ccec353a5b13eed88ce69d47695.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5WysLxj7yQU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of what's new includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automation Machines: </strong>Craft the Auto-sawmill, Auto-centrifuge, and Auto-squeezer, along with eight new automation machines — Hoppers, Shredders, Loggers, Pickers, Sprinklers, Condensers, Ploppers, and Shippers — on your new Crystal Workbench, which can be purchased from Bobbee, to bring your thriving industry to new heights.</li>
<li><strong>New Resource — Honeycore Crystals: </strong>Use the newly-added resonance meter and engage in its new mini-game to seek out different sounds throughout the various environments that will help you locate six different types of crystals. Melt them down in the forge and craft new crystal items, including Crystal chests, the Crystal axe, hammer, shovel, and more.</li>
<li><strong>Pets:</strong> Choose from 16 different adorable little companions to accompany you on your expeditions, including your very own tiny dinosaur!</li>
<li><strong>New Seasonal Events:</strong> Celebrate Hivemas, active during the month of December, and Hallowbeen, active during the month of October, in the world of APICO with the NPCs! Each event brings new decor, new paints, and secret easter egg items for you to enjoy. There’s no need to bee patient waiting for each event, as you’ll be able to toggle each event in the settings menu!</li>
<li><strong>…and so much more:</strong> TNgineers have added ten new quests, new decor, paints, new environmental events, and of course, new bees and pollinators! There’s also a new 100% completion surprise that the most dedicated beekeepers can uncover through the Hive Mother’s door.</li>
</ul>
<p>Available with Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>PERIMETER: Legate Edition released on Steam with Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>K-D Lab have revived their classic RTS, with PERIMETER: Legate Edition now available on Steam with full Native Linux support and it's even open source. This latest version of the game includes numerous enhancements, along with bundling the Emperor’s Testament expansion.</p>
<p>Nice to see more classic games getting a revival with some extra features!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-lrTdw7DSKc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1b7162d84d4a3eb9a3b9b1f9edf41713.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-lrTdw7DSKc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features from the newer edition:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Cross-platform compatibility: Windows, Linux.</li>
<li>"Emperor’s Testament" add-on included in the main game.</li>
<li>Support for widescreen monitors with almost any resolution. You can change the resolution without restarting the game, and in windowed mode, changing the window size dynamically adjusts the game resolution.</li>
<li>Full support for online multiplayer gaming.</li>
<li>Capability for multiplayer with more than 4 players (on special maps).</li>
<li>Enhanced textures and models.</li>
<li>Support for custom mods.</li>
<li>Improved game balance.</li>
<li>Availability of all frames from both Geometry of War and Emperor’s Testament, as well as electro-technologies in battles and multiplayer. New player colours added.</li>
<li>Numerous minor improvements and bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Picking up a copy for myself, I can confirm it runs out of the box on Kubuntu 24.04 and performance is really good. Currently, there's no Vsync option, so it will run at multiple hundreds of FPS. So on Linux you may want to use <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gamescope</a> to manually limit it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2399507761716287535gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2399507761716287535gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2530170/PERIMETER_Legate_Edition/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>. With the source code (GPL) on <a href="https://github.com/KD-lab-Open-Source/Perimeter" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>Intel Lunar Lake arrives Q3 2024 as Intel jump more into AI</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oh yay, more AI stuff. Intel have <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intels-lunar-lake-processors-arriving-q3-2024.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> that Lunar Lake is due to arrive in Q3 2024 and it will include a neural processing unit (NPU) for AI fans. This will be their latest line of CPUs designed for laptops, so even if you're not into AI there's a good bet if you go for a new laptop next yeah that it may have Intel Lunar Lake.</p>
<p>"With breakthrough power efficiency, the trusted compatibility of x86 architecture and the industry’s deepest catalog of software enablement across the CPU, GPU and NPU, we will deliver the most competitive joint client hardware and software offering in our history with Lunar Lake and Copilot+" – Michelle Johnston Holthaus, Intel executive vice president and general manager of the Client Computing Group</p>
<p>Intel say that starting in Q3 2024 ready for the holiday season, more than 80 new laptop designs will arrive from 20 different vendors.</p>
<p>It's not all AI though of course, these new chips will come with an improved CPU and GPU, with Xe2 graphics so we should hopefully see a good boost in efficiency and power for those of you on the go. As Intel say: "Lunar Lake is expected to be a groundbreaking mobile processor for AI PCs with more than 3 times the AI performance compared with the previous generation. With more than 40 NPU tera operations per second (TOPS), Intel’s next generation processors will provide the capabilities necessary for Copilot+ experiences coming to market. In addition to the higher performing NPU, Lunar Lake will also be equipped with over 60 GPU TOPS delivering more than 100 platform TOPS."</p>
<p><em>Get ready for a while lot more AI AI AI to come out of Intel, and AMD too.</em></p>

      <title>The KINGDOM HEARTS games are finally coming to Steam in June</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>About damn time right? After being Epic Exclusive for multiple years, KINGDOM HEARTS is finally coming to Steam and there's a lot of it. This will make it so much easier to play on Steam Deck / Linux thanks to Proton.</p>
<p>In the official <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/kingdom-hearts-pc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> they stated the release is for June 13th. It will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>KINGDOM HEARTS HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMIX.</li>
<li>KINGDOM HEARTS HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue.</li>
<li>KINGDOM HEARTS III + Re Mind DLC.</li>
<li>KINGDOM HEARTS INTEGRUM MASTERPIECE (bundle that includes all the above compilations).</li>
</ul>
<p>Quite a big list when you scroll to see what's inside each one. As <strong>KINGDOM HEARTS HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMIX</strong> actually includes all this:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>KINGDOM HEARTS FINAL MIX</strong> - The game that started it all, remastered with HD visuals, improved controls, a remade soundtrack, and more. This is the game that introduced us to Sora - a brave lad with big feet and a bigger heart.</li>
<li><strong>KINGDOM HEARTS Re:Chain of Memories</strong> - Set directly after the events of the first game, Sora, Donald and Goofy enter the mysterious Castle Oblivion, and stumble into an adventure that’s forgettable in the best possible way! …That’ll make more sense when you’ve played it.</li>
<li><strong>KINGDOM HEARTS 358/2 Days (HD Remastered Cinematics)</strong> - This story focuses on Roxas, a new character with a special connection to Sora. The compilation features cinematics from the original game, enhanced with additional text and remastered in HD.</li>
<li><strong>KINGDOM HEARTS II FINAL MIX</strong> - The second numbered game reunites Sora, Donald and Goofy in an epic adventure across some of the most memorable and unexpected Disney worlds in the series. Like Tron - Tron’s in here!</li>
<li><strong>KINGDOM HEARTS Birth by Sleep FINAL MIX</strong> - Prequel time! This game turns back the clock to before Sora ever wielded a keyblade and shifts the focus onto three new characters: Terra, Ventus and Aqua. It’s an emotional adventure with a wildly entertaining battle system - there’s a reason it’s a real fan favorite.</li>
<li><strong>KINGDOM HEARTS Re:Coded (HD Remastered Cinematics)</strong> - This hi-tech tale takes Data Sora into the digital world to seek an answer about a cryptic message. The compilation features enhanced cinematics only.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Then you have <strong>KINGDOM HEARTS HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue</strong> that includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>KINGDOM HEARTS Dream Drop Distance HD</strong> - Sora and Riku take their Mark of Mastery exams to become true keyblade wielders. Things do not go as planned - if you thought your exams were stressful, you ain’t seen nothing yet.</li>
<li><strong>KINGDOM HEARTS 0.2 Birth by Sleep -A fragmentary passage-</strong> - Made specifically for this collection, this episode gives you control of Aqua, following the dramatic ending of Birth by Sleep. It’s a short and sweet adventure that leads directly into KINGDOM HEARTS III.</li>
<li><strong>KINGDOM HEARTS χ Back Cover (movie)</strong> - An HD movie that goes back in the timeline even further than Birth by Sleep. It tells the story of the Foretellers - but who are they and what will they mean for the KINGDOM HEARTS series?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And then <strong>KINGDOM HEARTS III + Re Mind (DLC)</strong> to finish it up.</p>
<p>The one that's missing from this series to come to Steam appears to be Kingdom Hearts Melody of Memory, which is a  rhythm action game set after the Re Mind DLC. So hopefully that will eventually come too. There's no Steam pages actually live yet, and the trailer for the Steam release isn't live for another few hours:</p>

      <title>Men of War II out now on Steam with Native Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Men of War II is officially here from Best Way and Fulqrum Publishing, and serves as a great intro into historical real-time strategies games for newbies and veterans alike. <em>Note: key provided by Evolve.</em></p>
<p>I should note, I haven't actually played any of the previous games, so my views on it are not tainted by nostalgia for older entries. Just taking the game exactly for what it is: a competent and quite exciting RTS, that's full of content to play through that will keep you entertained for <em>many</em> hours. Here you get three different story campaigns (Germany, USA, USSR), but then you also have the larger-scale historical campaigns to play through and multiple special one-off bonus missions not related to the campaigns.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17963111801716231291gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17963111801716231291gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>On top of that (and this is still single-player) there's the big Conquest game mode to play any time, which sees you battle for territory across a wider map with multiple regions. It's like playing tug-of-war, as you and the AI take turns attacking and defending regions. And then there's the Raid mode which gives you a dynamic campaign across 16 battles with a technology tree to go through. That's before even getting to the multiplayer, of which there's multiple modes there too!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2YdpMrNxIf0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/01d4f0a7d8b669052370d6b7aaa141da.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2YdpMrNxIf0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What you get is a pretty-great looking game, one that's often quite brutal in the challenge. It only takes one little wrong move to get properly annihilated. So, like any good strategy game then, except the time period makes it all that much more brutal when you have people running through trenches getting smashed to pieces. It firmly reminds me of Company of Heroes, with a similar cover system and all.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14221913871716231005gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14221913871716231005gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's some real nice attention to the finer details too, especially when it comes to all the vehicles. You need to think about their armour, getting them into the right position not to expose their rear or sides if you can. Some vehicles can have their turret moved fully without adjusting the angle of the vehicle and so on. All the little details you would hope to have are there. And honestly, I love watching some armoured vehicles tear through a whole bunch of infantry from afar, the effects are pretty great. It does make me wish you could zoom out further though, as the zoom level is a bit limited.</p>
<p>You know what my absolute favourite feature is though? Direct unit control, allowing you at any time at the tap of a button to just assume control of a particular vehicle or person and basically become them from a top-down perspective. It takes a little getting used to, but when you get to grips with it there's so much fun to be had there, especially when you're direct-controlling a really big tank.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16530897041716232217gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16530897041716232217gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Direct control is useful in so many situations, from sniper fire to getting a vehicle to a pin-point position in cover, it's such joy to mess around with. Men of War II is just this big open battleground of fire, explosions and people running for cover that you want to pick up to play more again and again.</p>
<p>The Battalion system is real interesting too, which acts sort-of like a card system, you pick your unit types to bring into a battle and you can edit them to your liking. These are split across different specialisations like infantry, tanks, artillery and so on giving you so many options to play it differently each time.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2926585941716232835gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2926585941716232835gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The UI for it all takes a bit of learning, but it's worth sticking to set everything up how you want,</p>
<p>One thing that did bug me was the tutorial, it's slow and nonreactive to what you're doing. So instead of progressing across the next thing to teach you when you've done something, it just sits waiting at times. Like just zooming the camera, you do it and then sit and wait until it decides to tell you the next step. Annoying. Real minor, but still dumb. Another is the voice-over dialogue in the campaigns, it's…not especially great, and made me cringe multiple times.</p>
<p>The stupidest decision taken here though was launching it with forced online connections. They've repeatedly said this makes it so "no-one can cheat in multi-player matches" (debatable) but they <em>are</em> working on a proper offline mode which will "take some time to implement". The result is that a large portion of loading time is server-related. Quite a nuisance. Worse so when actually trying to play online, and you get stuck with a waiting for server loading screen again, which can at times take multiple minutes of waiting.</p>
<p>Overall, I've <em>really</em> enjoyed my time with it, and the Linux version has been running beautifully on max settings on Kubuntu 24.04 with my AMD Ryzen 5800X and Radeon RX 6800 XT. Aside from some bugs and initial stuttering that goes away very quickly, which the developer is working on (with a first post-launch patch already out), there's no Linux-specific issues I can think of to note. It works well and if you like strategy games (and especially full Linux support) it's an easy recommendation to go and buy.</p>

      <title>Monster collecting game Cassette Beasts free multiplayer update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Collect and transform against friends in the Cassette Beasts free multiplayer update, which is now officially available. Easily one of the best modern monster catching / collecting games and now you don't have to play it alone which is always a bonus.</p>
<p>What's new in the update includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Party-up with up to 8 players, all visible in your world as you travel!</li>
<li>Battle your friends in 1v1, and even assign custom rules to your battle such as enabling/disabling sticker attributes!</li>
<li>Trade tapes with each other, including any stickers you’ve applied!</li>
<li>Team up for raid battles against Rogue Fusions to receive Cyber Material to help you obtain Bootlegs faster!</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the update trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="B-iBugwjaKI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a2bb18245f3341b5d4019d3a408e7667.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/B-iBugwjaKI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Love this one, especially with the unique fusion system allowing you to combine any two creatures together to create something new and unique. The retro tapes transformation system is real sweet too, and as someone who grew up playing cassettes it speaks to me. Pretty cool soundtrack too and they recently had a <a href="https://youtu.be/zmzYVkEKf7U" rel="noopener" target="_blank">special acoustic version</a> of one track done and it's awesome.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support (made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot</a>) and it is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

      <title>Arctic Eggs is thoroughly weird physics-based dystopian cooking game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Arctic Eggs is a thoroughly unique and terribly odd sounding game about cooking up some eggs, to eventually win your freedom while you're stuck in Antarctica. It has Native Linux support made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>.</p>
<p>There's certainly no shortage when it comes to unique gaming experiences available on PC, and indie developers keep coming up with the strangest possible things they can imagine. If you like odd stuff, this is definitely as quirky as it gets. With the game dev describing it simply as: "A Sci-Fi Cooking game where you take up the role of a Poultry Peddler stuck in Antarctica and longing for a way out. Cook your illegal eggs for those who look hungry."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="L2msqOoW96Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3fda32de3b4e725d8436ba0cdd3bf485.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/L2msqOoW96Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I decided to pick this one up and it's as peculiar as you can imagine. They win plenty of points for originality here. You walk around slowly, talking to hungry people and get cooking. However, that's easier said than done. The frying pan is a real challenge, I don't want to tell you how many eggs I've sent flying across the world due to the tricky physics system partly because it's embarrassing and it's <em>so many</em> I lost count in the first 5 minutes.</p>
<p>You move an egg around the pan which generates the heat to cook it, then you have to flip it over to cook both sides. This is where the fun begins, because you absolutely will launch them everywhere, because you have to flick your wrist with the mouse to flip items. To help with this you use the scroll-wheel to adjust the pan movement sensitivity and that's pretty much it. Now you have to cook up for a whole bunch of people. I've no doubt plenty of players will easily pick it up, but not me, I'm apparently the worst egg fryer ever.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21356882571716204419gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21356882571716204419gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>They have some odd requests too. Eggs and cigarettes together? Well, okay, you're the boss. It's a challenge because you have to keep different items on the pan, while cooking both sides. Something falls out? Start again. As aggravating as it is, I couldn't help myself to play more.</p>
<p>I have absolutely no idea what's going on in the world, everyone is super weird here. Someone said something about flamingos being banned and now they no longer exist? Some real dystopian stuff right here. And then I had to fry up another egg, this time with what I assume are sardines in a tin, and then the tin pops open and you have to cook each of them on both sides while not dropping anything?!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4660911711716205098gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4660911711716205098gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8011207601716205099gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/8011207601716205099gol1.jpg"/></a></p>

      <title>Netris is an open-source cloud gaming platform with Stadia-like features using Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're a fan of cloud gaming, you may want to take a little look into Netris. The developers say it's a GeForce NOW alternative, one you can self-host with it being open source. They're also keen to highlight some Stadia-like elements of it too.</p>
<p>Available to play in Chrome-based browsers, you don't have to self-host it as they will be offering it as a service you can pay for too. It does all this by linking up with your Steam account, and with their service using Linux behind the scenes it's also making use of Proton to run the games. Specifically, they say they're using GE-Proton / Proton-GE.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4948747191716201837gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4948747191716201837gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The service is heavily inspired by Stadia, but since it's open source and utilising Steam (along with self-hosting options), you're not going to lose anything as the games are <em>yours</em>. Although, self-hosting <em>requires</em> an NVIDIA GPU.</p>
<p>Features they offer from their website:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Social Sharing - Share your epic moments with the community. Post clips, screenshots, and live streams directly from your game session.</li>
<li>HD Streams - Experience games in stunning high definition with Real-Time Ray Tracing ensuring crisp visuals and vibrant colors.</li>
<li>Shareable Progress - Your progress is saved in the cloud, allowing you to share your game progress with friends with just a link.</li>
<li>Customizable Controls - Tailor your gaming experience to fit your play style, whether you're on a keyboard, gamepad, or touchscreen.</li>
<li>Steam Library Sharing - Grant access to your Steam library, so everyone on your team can join in on the fun without additional purchases.</li>
<li>Customizable Gaming Experience - Enhance and personalize your gaming experience with mods to suit your style or add new challenges.</li>
<li>Parental Controls - Keep gaming safe and fun for everyone. Set playtime limits and content restrictions to ensure a family-friendly environment.</li>
<li>Lowest Latency - Say goodbye to lag. Enhanced by QUIC, our optimized network infrastructure ensures your gaming sessions are smooth and responsive.</li>
<li>Multiplayer &amp; Co-op - Connect with friends and gamers worldwide in Netris Parties. Dive into multiplayer battles or join forces in co-op adventures.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Certainly seems like an interesting attempt to mix-up the cloud gaming space. Early days for it yet though, but the idea is at least quite promising. They may have a bit of a fight on the naming though, since netris already exists <a href="https://www.netris.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">elsewhere</a>.</p>

      <title>Ubuntu 24.10 roadmap includes Wayland by default for NVIDIA</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It seems 2024 truly is the year of Wayland on the Linux desktop huh? Even Canonical are now planning to have it by default for NVIDIA for Ubuntu 24.10. Canonical developer Oliver Smith, who is now the Interim Engineering Director for the Ubuntu Desktop team, posted a fresh <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-desktop-s-24-10-dev-cycle-the-roadmap/45120" rel="noopener" target="_blank">roadmap</a> of what's to come and it all sounds quite exciting.</p>
<p>One thing to note is that the last release caused some priorities to shift due to the enablement of framepointers by default, 64-bit time_t on armhf and the need to react swiftly to the xz-utils vulnerability so a lot of rebuilding had to be done. But now that's all sorted Smith said "this next cycle is as much about taking the time to polish what we’ve already landed as it is about re-introducing some of those deferred priorities".</p>
<p>Some of the plans for Ubuntu 24.10 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expanded hardware support for TPM-backed Full Disk Encryption.</li>
<li>A more fully-featured first boot experience.</li>
<li>Support for third party deb installation in the App Centre.</li>
<li>Making even more use of <a href="https://flutter.dev/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Flutter</a>.</li>
<li>Wayland by default for those with NVIDIA graphics cards.</li>
<li>More progress on the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/canonical-planning-an-immutable-desktop-version-of-ubuntu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ubuntu Core Desktop</a>.</li>
<li>Various improvements for Windows Subsystem for Linux with Ubuntu.</li>
</ul>
<p>On top of all that they are also looking to continue to expand the Ubuntu Desktop team "by at least another 50% over the next year", so it's clear Canonical is putting a true renewed focus on the desktop now and they "think the future is bright for the Linux desktop".</p>

      <title>EA SPORTS WRC is adding EA anticheat, breaking another game on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, here's another game that EA will be breaking on Steam Deck / Linux, with EA anticheat rolling out to EA SPORTS WRC when it goes live in June.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2829107951715974655gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2829107951715974655gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - EA SPORTS WRC, credit: Codemasters / EA.</em></p>
<p>It's worth noting that it's currently rated as Steam Deck Unsupported, but Valve's official rating is only what they've actually tested, not if something will actually work at all (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/ghost-of-tsushima-single-player-only-on-steam-deck-due-to-playstation-network-features/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">like the Ghost of Tsushima situation</a>). As announced on the EA <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/ea-sports-wrc/wrc/news/ea-anticheat" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website post</a>, this change will arrive with the 1.9.0 update in June but they've haven't given the exact date just yet.</p>
<p>They are at least aware of Steam Deck as they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Additionally, <em>EA SPORTS™ WRC</em> will not run on the native Steam OS for Steam Deck following the release of EA anticheat.</p>
<p><em>EA SPORTS™ WRC</em> has officially been categorised as "Unsupported" on Steam Deck since its release in 2023.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The game actually has a Platinum rating on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1849250?device=any" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a>, the crowd-sourced user-reports website, because it does run quite well from various reports on both Linux PCs and Steam Deck. So presumably this will break the entire game, not just multiplayer, since EA anticheat will run from the moment you hit play.</p>
<p>Sadly this follows on from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/battlefield-v-now-broken-on-steam-deck-linux-with-ea-anticheat-live/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Battlefield V</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/plants-vs-zombies-garden-warfare-2-adding-ea-anticheat-breaking-it-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2</a> that added it after release. Along with other titles including EA SPORTS FC 24, EA SPORTS FIFA 23, Battlefield 2042 and Madden NFL 24 that all have it. I actually <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/ea-anticheat-could-spell-trouble-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wrote back in September 2022</a> how EA anticheat could end up problematic and it's a shame to see I was right.</p>
<p>I'm just waiting for it to inevitably get added to Apex Legends, although that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/apex-legends-upheaval-update-live-with-eos-anti-cheat-breaking-it-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently had a small hiccup</a> when moving from the old Easy Anti-Cheat to the newer EOS anti-cheat but it still works for now since both types of EAC are supported on Linux / Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental improves Halo Infinite, Call of Juarez: Gunslinger and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Proton Experimental was updated today by Valve for Steam Deck / Linux PCs which includes some more improvements for gaming.</p>
<p>Noted as now playable as of this May 17th <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" rel="noopener" target="_blank">update</a> is Planet of the Apes: Last Frontier.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's some of the other improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved Chinese font rendering in Cosmoteer Starship Architect &amp; Commander.</li>
<li>Improved font rendering in Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop on Steam Deck.</li>
<li>Fixed Descent 3 not working in GL mode.</li>
<li>Fixed Bloons Monkey City thinking it's offline with IPv6 support disabled.</li>
<li>Fixed Halo Infinite rendering using a weird resolution on a Steam Deck.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus they're also now limiting the CPU cores seen by Call of Juarez: Gunslinger as well to make it playable on high core-count CPUs. They did the same fix for Command &amp; Conquer and The Covert Operations in a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/proton-experimental-openxr-command-conquer-the-desolate-hope/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previous Experimental update</a>.</p>

      <title>Cute open world pirate adventure Seablip is out now on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Available now in Early Access is Seablip, an open world pirate adventure with a cute style to it from solo developer Jardar Solli and it comes with Native Linux support. I completely missed the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jardar/seablip-a-pirate-adventure" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> for this one from 2020 where the developer pulled in around £13,603.</p>
<p>Roam the high seas in a vibrant open world containing a series of islands to discover and enemies to defeat. Drawing inspiration from titles such as Faster Than Light and Sid Meier’s Pirates!, Seablip offers the freedom to explore, build and even fish!</p>
<p>Check out the launch trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="tdgUJf4QHGk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/817e748a5ebabefd75347012524c9469.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/tdgUJf4QHGk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the developer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ahoy, everyone! I want to thank all the followers who have supported my journey from the start. From the day I didn't know how to code, to this day when I released my first game.</p>
<p>5 years ago I was unhappy with my life, nothing big and dramatic, but there was a tiny voice inside that was displeased. Playing games has always been my joy so I started to learn to code and slowly Seablip became my dream project.</p>
<p>This journey from 5 years ago to this day has been like a rollercoaster, but I got backed up and supported by an incredible group of followers. I could not make it without you!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The best way to play currently is mouse and keyboard, but they are looking for feedback on how they can improve controller support. That would be good, as it looks like a great game to play on Steam Deck so hopefully they get that properly sorted.</p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1471270/Seablip/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Steam page</a>.</p>

      <title>Manjaro Linux devs show off the OrangePi Neo prototype handheld with gameplay</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The OrangePi Neo is an upcoming gaming handheld powered by Manjaro Linux Gaming Edition, and now we have some rough demo footage of a prototype actually playing games.</p>
<p>The quality of the actual video is not exactly the best, the Manjaro team are not exactly YouTuber pros but it's still quite an interesting look at the early unfinished device for those interested in more Linux gaming handhelds. Have a look at the video below:</p>

<p>It's somewhat amusing to see that on Windows handhelds, certain vendors have made their own UI to make Windows slightly better for a handheld and here we have the Manjaro team doing a UI pop-up on top of the Steam Big Picture mode for their settings. Hopefully the final release is a bit smoother than that, but as a reminder this is early stuff we're seeing.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago the Manjaro team also did a quick rough demo of the early Manjaro Gaming Edition installer on YouTube as well:</p>

      <title>Soulstone Survivors has a new character that looks suspiciously from Deep Rock Galactic</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Soulstone Survivors, easily one of the best action roguelite horde-survival bullet heaven games (hi Vampire Survivors), has a new major update out with a suspiciously Deep Rock Galactic looking Dwarf in it.</p>
<p>In the Master of Machines update they've added the Engineer, and they look…yeah. Rock and Stone!</p>
<p>"The master of machines seeks Soulstones to power his latest creations! Use powerful turrets and mechanical allies to decimate the corrupt creatures of the Void! Supply yourself and your allies with endless ammunition and even launch portable nukes for ultimate destruction!" </p>
<p>Not only that the update added in a new upgrade mechanic. When you've unlock all weapons for a character, you can now upgrade them to make them much more powerful. Check out the update trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Dh6TQSgs618"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ea755fc80930ee25228ec55cb3305690.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Dh6TQSgs618" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Soulstone Survivors has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Playable, not Verified due to some smaller text which hopefully the developer will solve eventually. The game is still in Early Access so it's not quite done yet.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2066020/Soulstone_Survivors/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>. It's 30% off until May 20th.</p>

      <title>NVK driver gets DRM Format Modifiers to work with Gamescope in Mesa 24.1</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just recently NVK, the open source Nvidia Vulkan driver, merged in a new Vulkan extension that is rather important and means it will work properly with Gamescope.</p>
<p>The extension is <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_image_drm_format_modifier.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VK_EXT_image_drm_format_modifier</a> which was worked on by developers from Google, NVIDIA, Intel and Arm. That has now been <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/24795" rel="noopener" target="_blank">merged</a> into NVK in Mesa, and backported to the Mesa 24.1 staging branch ready for the Mesa 24.1 release that <em>should</em> arrive on May 22nd.</p>
<p>Writing about the work involved in getting this into NVK, Collabora developer Faith Ekstrand wrote up a <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/implementing-drm-format-modifiers-in-nvk.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fresh blog post</a> going over the details of it. As said by Ekstrand:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DRM format modifier support is one of the most important features we've landed in NVK in a while. Though it's not a very interesting feature to most Vulkan applications or game developers, it's very important to the Linux display pipeline. Importantly to users, this is the last piece required to support GameScope. It's also an important piece in making Zink+NVK a robust OpenGL solution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like it's been a bit of a complicated journey. The blog post is worth a read if you like the technical stuff.</p>
<p>This is particularly exciting to see, given how popular Gamescope is and how useful it is. Additionally, Ekstrand mentioned how this was also "the last major piece required for competent OpenGL support through Zink" — awesome!</p>
<p>It's just another step towards getting NVK in shape to be a fully-featured and performant driver on Linux, for those who wish to run their NVIDIA GPU with open source rather than NVIDIA's proprietary driver, although even NVIDIA have been making <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/nvidia-switching-to-open-kernel-modules-by-default-in-future-driver-update-for-turing/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">more open source steps lately</a>.</p>

      <title>Athenian Rhapsody is a rather unhinged Undertale-like and stupidly funny</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Athenian Rhapsody might just be my new favourite release of 2024. Taking inspiration from the likes of Undertale and Earthbound and turning the ridiculousness up a few notches. Developer Nico Papalia has crafted something brilliant here. <em>Note: key provided by Top Hat Studios.</em></p>
<p>I played it on Steam Deck (and a little on desktop Linux) using Proton 9 and it worked great and looks fantastic.</p>
<p>While the inspiration is obvious for anyone who has played the aforementioned games, it's still a very unique experience. One that honestly had me laughing a fair bit even in the first few minutes. From the ridiculous personality quiz you do at the start to the completely unhinged dialogue between characters, it's total joy to play.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11096039601715865084gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11096039601715865084gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>You know you're in for a good time when you get this to start with…</p>
<p>A top-down classic adventure RPG, that is a lot of fun, but it can get quite difficult with all the different mini-games you need to play. Each time you have a battle with a creature you get the option to fight them to level up, befriend them or to run. How you approach all the encounters will change a number of things in the game, like who will follow you along and the ending (there's multiple). It's one of those quirky adventures that you'll probably want to play more than once to see it all. Because certain decisions can prevent you doing certain things and no doubt your first run through will have you miss plenty.</p>
<p>I just love the dialogue more than anything in this, it's such dumb-fun.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21114629001715874736gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21114629001715874736gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>The combat is more than a <em>little</em> Undertale inspired though. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery as they say. With lots of mini-games, some of them really quite challenging too across multiple stages, with various attack patterns. Combat isn't always the best route, but then it does depend on what you want from it. Even if you don't choose to attack, you still have to defend as you often run around this little area while they attack you.</p>
<p>It helps that you'll end up with multiple characters, and who you get depends on who you befriend and help along the way. Like a lost dog searching for a home. During combat, you will get to swap between characters, with each having their own special buffs available to help. You may be able to heal, speed yourself up, boost your attack or defence and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10927703401715874876gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10927703401715874876gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>As funny as it is, the game can be really difficult at certain points. It's <em>supposed</em> to be a challenge but thankfully there is what it calls the Chill Mode, which gives you a helping hand during the combat with a little invincible time between attacks. It just makes it that little bit more accessible while still being somewhat a challenge.</p>
<p>There's no real guide as to what you're doing either. You're just aimlessly wandering through the world, talking to everyone you can to see their hilarious dialogue and continuing on your path with the help of a few weirdos, one of which keeps screwing with you and trying to kill you. <em>At one point early on they try to drop a piano on you.</em></p>
<p>Here you just end up talking to everyone possible, which you probably wouldn't do in other similar RPGs. Which is why it helps that the writing is such an odd mixture of everything from telling you to slow down and take things in, to just straight-up insulting you and of course many stupid jokes.</p>
<p>One of the key points to the game is the Rhapsody system. As you progress you're writing your own Rhapsody, which is a retelling of every choice you made and you can share these with friends online. Just a fun little bonus feature.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SLk4FajFGTI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c4e7e71c7112210d62ab30adc9962e72.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SLk4FajFGTI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore the colorful world of Athens, and hop from town-to-circus-to-UFO-piloted-by-cats-in-the-sky as you write your Rhapsody.</li>
<li>Answer a deep, meaningful personality test that reveals your deepest, darkest desires (such as wanting to be a bus driver).</li>
<li>Party members galore! 16 potential companions await, each with a bold personality and some being a little bit more unhinged than others.</li>
<li>Tons of enemies for you to FIGHT or BEFRIEND! This world has no shortage of intense battles with opponents that range from weird, wacky, tough, cute, and outright goofy!</li>
<li>Figure out why everyone's crazy for hoarding EXP (hopefully it doesn't have any side effects) and engage in tough Souls-like dating mechanics(?).</li>
<li>Minigames that'll challenge your limits, like having to spell your own name, dodging space invaders, copying the circus mimes, and paying your taxes.</li>
<li>A branching narrative with different endings depending on your choices, friendships, and other stuff that just happens in life.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's pretty rare that I pick up a game and get pulled in <em>instantly</em> like this. The only part that <em>doesn't</em> work are the Steam Achievements which don't seem to unlock with Proton but the developer is looking into it. Even with Steam Achievements not currently working, it's a solid recommendation from me. Wonderful.</p>

      <title>Towerful Defense: Prologue is like Brotato and Vampire Survivors had a TD baby</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm apparently a total and complete sucker for anything that allows for short rounds of gameplay, that mixes in elements of Brotato and Vampire Survivors to let me customize my run and Towerful Defense: Prologue has plenty of that.</p>
<p>Available free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2949250/Towerful_Defense_Prologue/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> ahead of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2453610/Towerful_Defense_A_Rogue_TD/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full game</a> releasing at some point later this year, it's definitely giving me that feeling of needing just one more run. It's really nothing to look at, with the most basic graphics possible but the key is in the gameplay here.</p>
<p>It's a tower defense action roguelike where you control a single tower to fight against hordes of aliens coming from all directions. Pick your tower, equip up to 4 skills, and choose from a variety of traits and items to craft powerful builds that lead you to victory. So, it's a bit like the rather fun <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/heretics-fork-is-an-unholy-blending-of-deck-building-and-tower-defense/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Heretic's Fork</a> but without the deck-building. Instead here you get the shop system after waves like you do in Brotato to build up your tower.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="COBJMngzY_w"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bb58ab3f25662b7585a5fe933f0ab1cc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/COBJMngzY_w" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The Prologue (a glorified demo) gives you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast run roguelike tower defense (about 30 minutes for a run) with 19 normal waves and a partial boss wave.</li>
<li>3 Towers with different buffs, and play-style-changing effects.</li>
<li>3 Skills with upgrades, enhancements, and unique traits.</li>
<li>100+ artifacts and support units to help you craft unique powerful builds.</li>
<li>Auto Skill with customizable targeting behaviors.</li>
</ul>
<p>It has Native Linux support and is good fun to try out different combinations.</p>

      <title>Ultimate Chicken Horse gets its biggest sale yet with a new content update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ultimate Chicken Horse is easily one of the funniest and stupidest party-platformers I've ever played, and it just had a free content update with a big discount.</p>
<p>This is no ordinary platformer. You and friends build the level as you play, as you each try to reach the end of the level. You take it in turns to place down various different types of platforms and traps. It's all about scoring enough points to beat your friends. It gets weird.</p>
<p>They just released the Pandamonium Update which brings in a new Panda character, 4 new skins, 2 new levels, 2 new outfits, 3 new music tracks and an assortment of other improvements and bug fixes.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="YY76Of-9_F8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/379249b38b66b0e563d74699e0208609.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/YY76Of-9_F8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Really great fun and it has both local and cross-platform multiplayer so you can play with pretty much anyone. I don't have a single bad word to say about this one, it's well worth your time. I've played quite a lot with my own family and it's always a riot.</p>
<p>Ultimate Chicken Horse has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>To go along with the update it's 65% off now, which is the biggest discount it's had since the 2016 release.</p>
<p>You can buy it from:</p>

      <title>Caves of Qud gets a huge new Beta released with the big UI redesign</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>An update many have been waiting for, Caves of Qud, one of the best roguelikes ever has a Beta available that includes a huge overhaul to the UI. Much better for gamepad and Steam Deck players.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Caves of Qud is a science fantasy roguelike epic steeped in retrofuturism, deep simulation, and swathes of sentient plants. Come inhabit a living, breathing world and chisel through layers of thousand-year-old civilizations. Decide: is it a dying earth, or is it on the verge of rebirth?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They said this transformational UI design works fully with mouse or gamepad (on top of keyboard) and is much prettier. It's not entirely done with some more polish to come but it's fully functional. Also added in this update are Steam Cloud saves, good for those hopping between systems, they've refreshed the starting town, there's hundreds of new sound and visual effects plus new narrative touches, big bug fixes, &amp; performance improvements.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The award-winning mining sandbox adventure game Core Keeper is now getting ready to leave Early Access with the big 1.0 arriving on August 27th.</p>
<p>With the 1.0 update it will bring with it new content, features and quality of life improvements. The Summer Update that was planned to arrive before that is now just going to focus on quality and bug fixes, with the new content left for the 1.0 update to ensure it's ready. They said to expect a 1.0 content reveal trailer later in June but for now they did put up this new trailer too:</p>

<p>"We are so excited for the full release of Core Keeper on consoles and PC this August," said Vincent Coates, Senior Brand Manager at Fireshine Games. "It's been amazing to see over 2 million players discover the charm, mystery and fun of Core Keeper throughout the game’s time during Steam Early Access, and we can't wait for even more to discover everything it has to offer with the full launch. From building, farming and fishing, to hatching pets, battling huge bosses and exploring mysterious lands, Core Keeper combines so much of what players love into a compelling package that they can play entirely as a single-player adventure or together online with friends."</p>

      <title>SAMURAI WARRIORS 4 DX arrives on Steam and it&#39;s Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SAMURAI WARRIORS 4 from Koei Tecmo is a hack and slash game originally released in 2014. And now the much expanded enhanced version is here with SAMURAI WARRIORS 4 DX. There was also SAMURAI WARRIORS 4-II that came to Steam in 2015, which was more of a side-story with DX directly building on 4.</p>
<p>This version includes over 150 previously released DLC items like costumes, weapons, editable parts, scenarios, background music, and more. Plus it has full Steam Deck Verified support right out of the gate. This is basically the final definitive edition of the game.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="psEN_sukaCI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0b6d1888a094ad3c70bfefe61b52458d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/psEN_sukaCI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>SAMURAI WARRIORS 4 DX includes everything fans have been craving to play in one complete edition. In addition to the main “Story Mode” featuring “regional stories” and the “story of unification”, the DX version allows players to choose from a variety of different modes, including “Chronicle Mode”, a mode that enables players to travel around the SAMURAI WARRIORS world, accomplishing quests in various regions while meeting officers and collecting items. In addition, players can now discover over 50 playable officers in SAMURAI WARRIORS 4 DX along with exhilarating action systems such as “Hyper Attack” and “Rage” as they journey to the heart of Japan’s Sengoku period.</p>
<p>SAMURAI WARRIORS 4 DX features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over 150 downloadable pieces of content – Downloadable content initially available on other platforms at the original release of SAMURAI WARRIORS 4 has been integrated, including scenarios, costumes and weapons.</li>
<li>Optimized for PC – The graphics settings can be adjusted to match the PC specifications of each player. Mouse and keyboard controls are supported and key assignments can be changed. Most controllers are supported.</li>
<li>SAMURAI WARRIORS 4 DX is now available in English in addition to Japanese. The language can be changed in the settings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since it's Steam Deck Verified, there should be no problems playing it on desktop Linux with Proton. For the verification Valve picked <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/proton-9-0-released-with-expanded-game-support-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the new Proton 9.0</a>.</p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2719200/SAMURAI_WARRIORS_4_DX/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Steam page</a>.</p>

      <title>Back 4 Blood gets Denuvo Anti-tamper removed and an anti-cheat fix for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For those of you who wait until Denuvo Anti-tamper gets removed from games, you'll be pleased to know Back 4 Blood is now free of it. Plus the developers fixed the anti-cheat recently.</p>
<p>As shown on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/924970/history/?changeid=U:48306347" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, the notice about it having Denuvo Anti-tamper was removed and it's no longer noted on the Steam page. Nice to see, especially for Linux / Steam Deck players because swapping around Proton versions can cause you to get locked out for a day.</p>
<p>On top of that on May 15th the developers noted an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/924970/view/4190114399255052787" rel="noopener" target="_blank">update</a> that "addresses an Easy Anti-Cheat issue for Steam Deck users where players could not access the game" (which would have affected desktop Linux players too). So it's good to see that Turtle Rock Studios care about their players on Linux systems.</p>

<p>So what do we have here then? Tony Hawk's Survivors? Motorbike Survivors? This horde-shooter bullet heaven genre mixture is never-ending (and I love it). Motordoom looks like pure insanity.</p>
<p>Combining together high octane, visceral combat with fluid movement and trick mechanics. Whatever will developers decide to stick together next? Perform all sorts of tricks while taking down monsters, along with plenty of character upgrades to keep becoming more and more ridiculous. Oh and of course it features some rather heavy music too so you can rock out with your bike out.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AzkwJAFHFwI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ed836d85316a1a606b723f5df9c4ea67.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AzkwJAFHFwI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Combine your trick combo with kills to earn even more points. Once you land your combo, gain experience points as high as the combo score. Earn enough points and you'll be given the choice of one of three random Demonic Offerings. These upgrades grant you more power to defeat the ever growing horde of grotesque monsters. So jump up in the air, slow down time and shoot these demonic abominations!</li>
<li>Demonic Offerings come in the form of cards. Build your deck by choosing the right cards for your build. Unlock new cards for later runs to be prepared for the horrors Motördoom has to offer.</li>
<li>Ride your chainsaw driven pit bike through a monster filled arena! Perform gnarly tricks like flips, grabs, grinds and manuals and combine them all into the sickest combo the underworld has ever seen. This arcade freestyle sports game should feel very familiar to anyone who ever played any of the THPS games in the past. Find your own style and do the tricks that you want.</li>
<li>Choose from different characters and bikes that suite your play style. Unlock new characters with scrap you collect in runs. Each character has it's unique weapon and play style. Choose which one suits your style the best.</li>
<li>Unlock and equip different bike Add-Ons to aid you in your run. Create different builds that suit your play style.</li>
<li>How about a chainsaw that tears through your enemies?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>How can you not love the idea of this? You get to perform a grind with a BMX that has a flamethrower. It's absolutely absurd and glorious at the same time. </p>

      <title>The Warlords series and the five original Close Combat games appear on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We get a fair bit of news here and there about games getting delisted, publishers moving on from games and shutting them and more but what about game preservation? A nice bunch of classics with The Warlords series and the five original Close Combat games are now on Steam.</p>
<p>Some fun gaming history here, especially for me, as I used to <em>love</em> the early Close Combat games with them being some of the first strategy games I played. Although, I think Dune 2 has that record for being my actual first, they weren't too far behind.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>"We're committed to preserving classic games and ensuring they're easily accessible. The Close Combat and Warlords series were hugely popular in the 90s, influencing many later hits. Their presence on Steam offers a chance to revisit or discover this part of video game history." – says Artem Shchuiko, co-founder of SNEG.</p>
<p>"One of Slitherine's founding values is also to preserve the history and tradition of computer wargames, as we are first and foremost enthusiasts of wargaming. Thanks to Sneg's efforts, both veteran players of these titles and those who want to try them for the first time in their lives will have the opportunity to do so with a version that is as updated and functional as possible on modern PCs, while at the same time not altering the original experience." – Marco Minoli, Director of Publishing Slitherine</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16364457951715802207gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16364457951715802207gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Close Combat</em></p>
<p>Thanks to their work you can now get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Close Combat</li>
<li>Close Combat 2: A Bridge Too Far</li>
<li>Close Combat 3: The Russian Front</li>
<li>Close Combat 4: The Battle of the Bulge</li>
<li>Close Combat 5: Invasion: Normandy</li>
</ul>
<p>Either individually or as part of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/40816/Close_Combat_Classic_Collection/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Close Combat Classic Collection</a>.</p>
<p>And also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Warlords I + II</li>
<li>Warlords III: Darklords Rising</li>
</ul>
<p>Again either individually (well 1+2 together or 3) or as part of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/41580/Warlords_Classics/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Warlords Classics bundle</a>.</p>
<p>From what they said they've been updated to "fully optimized to the requirements of modern computers and operating systems" and they "made every effort to eliminate technical issues, with changes based on fan and community feedback".</p>
<p>I imagine they should work quite well in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>

      <title>SteamOS 3.6.2 Preview for Steam Deck fixes up double-input for external controllers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have issued the first update to the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/steamos-36-preview-for-steam-deck-brings-numerous-big-new-features/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.6 Preview</a> series for Steam Deck, throwing in a couple of needed fixes.</p>
<p>Initially rolling out as SteamOS 3.6.1, it was quickly pulled. But now Valve released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4213757668869574127" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.6.2</a>. Here's the fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where external controller input could be doubled if CEC control was enabled.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where scroll wheel Steam Input bindings weren't functional.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is one known issue at this time noted:</p>
<ul>
<li>Frequent session switches can result in the sound driver crashing, needing a system reboot.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Linux and sound having issues? Never heard that before…</em></p>
<p>Also don't forget to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/collabora-detail-the-improved-updater-for-steam-deck-in-steamos-3-6/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">read up on the improvements</a> to the SteamOS update system which sound great!</p>

      <title>Ghost of Tsushima single-player only on Steam Deck due to PlayStation Network features</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, here's a bit of a nuisance. Ghost of Tsushima DIRECTOR'S CUT is launching on May 16th and the developers have explained how it will work on Steam Deck but it's a mixture of good and bad news.</p>
<p>Sadly on Steam Deck and presumably desktop Linux too, since they both use <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>, you'll only be able to play single-player. At least, for now, until Valve can sort out whatever the issues are preventing the online mode from working.</p>
<p>Here's what the developer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2215430/view/4188987871078331985" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steam Deck support</p>
<p>We know many of you are eager to play Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut on handheld gaming devices like the Steam Deck. We're happy to share that the single player experience, including the Iki Island expansion, can be enjoyed on Steam Deck and similar handheld gaming PCs as we’ve worked extensively to optimize performance and deliver the best possible experience on these devices.<br/>
<br/>
You may notice that Steam marks the game as 'Unsupported' for Steam Deck. This is due to the Legends co-op multiplayer mode requiring Windows to access PlayStation Network integrated features.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20309324711715701319gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>For those confused, the game will have a brand new never-seen before <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/ghost-of-tsushima-pc-specs-revealed-should-work-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation Overlay</a> shipping in this game first, which hooks into the PlayStation Network for things like Friends, Trophies and more.</p>
<p>It may very well be the case that for now, Proton (the Windows compatibility layer), is just missing some features that need to be hooked up in a future Proton release. We've seen this sort of thing happen in the past and eventually Proton updates catch up with what's needed. So, all hope may not be lost, we just have to wait and see what Valve have to say about it. Concerning to see though, because no doubt a lot of future Sony PlayStation titles coming to PC will have this new PlayStation Network overlay. <em>I've emailed Valve for info on this.</em></p>
<p>Worth pointing out at this point too, just like with Helldivers 2, the game has been <a href="https://steamdb.info/sub/962153/history/?changeid=23492090" rel="noopener" target="_blank">restricted</a> on Steam with various places unable to buy it due to the PSN requirement for the online mode.</p>
