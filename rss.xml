      <title>Steam Deck Beta gets some essential bug fixes and new Gyro options</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve put up some nice bug fixes in the latest Preview and Beta updates for the Steam Deck, here's a run over what's new and improved for you.</p>
<p>Some of you may have noticed, at times, the Steam and Quick Access menu would refuse to appear and just instantly vanish. Something that was annoying me a fair bit recently but this latest update should solve it. It's been a problem for quite a while, so good to see it finally solved!</p>
<p>From the October 20th <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3717217413234947322?snr=2_9_100015_" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a case where the Main Menu or the Quick Access Menu would be immediately dismissed after opening.</li>
<li>Fix a case where the client would fail to handle some open URL requests.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Desktop Mode</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed small mode dimensions not restoring correctly if previously sized smaller than the minimum large mode dimensions</li>
<li>Fixed resize grip showing sometimes when windows are maximized</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fix for new Gyro to Joystick modes not applying Horizontal/Vertical settings, or Axis inversion settings or Rotation Output settings.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Valve also continues expanding the Gyro options for Steam Input from the October 19th <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3717217413227884230?snr=2_9_100015_" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Steam</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Modal dialogs now dismiss when you click the background.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fix for PlayStation DualShock 4 gyro sensitivity over Bluetooth for new Gyro Modes.</li>
<li>New Gyro Mode: "Gyro to Joystick (Deflection)". This is most appropriate for simulating Steering and Flight Yokes. This mode will eventually replace Gyro "Joystick". It is the last replacement mode for Gyro functionality. It shares the common Gyro Natural angles system.</li>
<li>Added "Joystick Power Curve" slider to both "Gyro to Joystick (Camera)" and the new "Gyro to Joystick (Deflection)" modes. This allows you to counteract the response curve that many games employ for better precision.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Mosa Lina is pure physics puzzle-platforming chaos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this is certainly an unexpected pleasure to appear. Mosa Lina is pure physics puzzle-platforming chaos and it's out now along with Native Linux support and works great on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>The developer said they created it as a response to all the games that are carefully designed in a way that everything fits together perfectly. Instead, Mosa Lina is "aggressively random". So the level order you get each time is random, as are the item abilities it gives you to beat each level. You get a list of three items each time, and each item has a limited amount of times you can use them. The idea of each level is just to touch the fruit or launch the fruit off the level map somehow and then make it back to the portal.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18707690301697824013gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18707690301697824013gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Easier said than done, and this is where the chaos comes in. Some levels might not even be beatable with the random generation, there’s no specific solution to each puzzle level, just your attempts to beat it with whatever it decides to give you. An interesting idea and it’s completely ridiculous some of the time, but actually a lot of fun to play through and very unusual. If you’re a puzzle-platformer fan, you’re probably going to enjoy this.</p>
<p>It reminds me of the puzzle game Baba is You, where you push around logic blocks to change the rules of the level. Here you’re using whatever tools you have like a rocket to get up high, a ladder to climb, bombs, jumping frogs, abilities that warp the existing blocks on the map, bouncing mushrooms that will bounce anything around and all sorts.</p>
<p>The idea is that this total disregard for being predictable makes you stop worrying about winning and just lets you focus on experimenting, and constantly flicking between failure and success while just being thoroughly entertaining and stupid.</p>
<p>Here's some Steam Deck footage and thoughts:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="9NswiHmxISo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/716e96cba8f5461b1db96c1c49ca779c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/9NswiHmxISo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For playing it on desktop Linux, the only issue I had was the Steam Overlay not appearing, which was solved by using Gamescope. Apart from that, it's fantastic and well worth picking up.</p>

      <title>Check out the first-person dark-fantasy dungeon crawler Ludus Mortis</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Set in a dark-fantasy timeline version of the Roman Empire, Ludus Mortis is a dungeon crawler like the classics but with plenty of modern touches now in Early Access with Linux Support and Steam Deck playable. No official rating yet for the Steam Deck but the developer mentioned it should be just fine.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4nZTlbB8TGs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a151602d281e65e4fd955fb3b882e1a1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4nZTlbB8TGs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<div class="game_page_autocollapse_ctn">
<div class="game_page_autocollapse" data-panel="{" id="aboutThisGame" style="max-height: none;" type":"panelgroup"}"="">
<div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_description">
<ul>
<li>Create your characters choosing from 14 classes</li>
<li>Manage and develop you Ludus (Gladiator School) by improving facilities, acquiring gladiators, crafting new equipment.</li>
<li>Explore catacombs and dungeons.</li>
<li>Manage your party changing formation, equipment and skills: you can try different combinations for every different dungeon.</li>
<li>Turn-based combat: think carefully and use your Action Points wisely.</li>
</ul>
<p>Story: "Rome, 4th Century AD. Over the last few decades the Senate has become corrupt and has progressively lost power and influence, while the Emperor Diocletian and his army ruled unchallenged outside the eternal city.</p>
<p>Seeking to return to a dominant position, the members of the Roman Senate decide to use necromancy to increase their power, creating an army of undead and demons to fight against imperial soldiers.</p>
<p>By waging war on its own emperor, the Senate has caused a rift in the Roman population, which slowly began to live in fear.</p>
<p>Year after year the armies of undead summoned by the Senate have taken over, imposing themselves on the senators and enslaving the Roman population.</p>
<p>In this climate of chaos, an ancient gladiatorial school continued to train soldiers for the games. But the purpose of these gladiators is now different: to rid the city of the undead and invaders...to allow Rome to return to its former glory."</p>
<p>Nice to see more first-person dungeon crawlers like this. So far on Steam it's managed to get a Positive rating, but that's not from many reviews yet. It entered Early Access on September 29th and since then the developer has continued to upgrade it with bug fixes and new features, like a newly added lockpicking mechanic. Looks like it's worth a go if you love these types of games.</p>
<p>Available on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/ludus_mortis" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2197650/Ludus_Mortis/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Gearbits is a fast-paced mecha combat indie game now on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love mecha combat? Gearbits is a new indie release on Steam from Quackpond Games, following on from their early builds on itch.io. The developer mentioned that it was in development for two years, started as they didn't find the exact type of mecha combat game they wanted to play - so they made it themselves.</p>
<p>You go through 20 missions taking down enemies, giving you a chance to unlock 10 different mech to run and fly around in with each machine having their own strengths and weaknesses. There's over 30 weapons to equip, so a little something for every type of pilot from missile launchers to massive beam cannons. The Steam release also just recently got a free update to add in a wave-based survival mode.</p>

      <title>Blender enables Vulkan as an experimental option</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some fun news for Blender fans, as their work to bring up Vulkan support in the project has hit a big new milestone with support now enabled but it's still experimental for now. As noted in their <a href="https://code.blender.org/2023/10/vulkan-project-update/" target="_blank">development blog post</a>, Vulkan support is now available for Linux and Windows Alpha builds.</p>
<p>Why are they doing this? Well, like a lot of other projects including game engines, OpenGL is old. Vulkan is the true next-generation of fully open graphics and it supports a lot of modern features. Eventually, pretty much everything will move over to Vulkan to take advantage of all the new stuff.</p>
<p>The Blender team mentioned that for Apple devices they already support Metal, so they will be going all-in eventually on Vulkan for Linux and Windows. They gave some examples of things that could be worked on utilizing newly available GPU features thanks to using modern graphics APIs like:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improve the viewport performance with huge amount of geometry and complex scenes.</li>
<li>Improving the quality of EEVEE by replacing screen space effects with hardware ray tracing implementations.</li>
<li>Adding support for HDRI displays.</li>
<li>Utilizing the compute power of GPUs in areas like texture painting.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They need your help! As Vulkan is in heavy development, they want to ensure it runs well so check out their <a href="https://devtalk.blender.org/t/blender-vulkan-status-report/25706/21" target="_blank">status thread</a>.</p>

      <title>Begin your industrial revolution in the latest Minecraft Snapshot</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/minecraft-hits-300-million-sales-update-121-announced-with-trial-chambers/" target="_blank">Minecraft Live is over</a> the developers have begun pushing out preview builds ahead of the upcoming release of Minecraft 1.21. A fresh Snapshot was just released with new features like the Crafter block.</p>
<p>The big new addition here with the Crafter block is the ability to begin your industrial revolution in Minecraft, as you can now build up a crafting automation empire thanks to it and Redstone.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8442987421697799394gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8442987421697799394gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
Pictured - A simple contraption for crafting cake using the crafter, credit - <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Crafter" target="_blank">Minecraft Wiki</a></em></p>
<p>What's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Crafter</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Crafter is a new block that enables the crafting of items and blocks via Redstone</li>
<li>The Crafter will eject one crafted item at a time when powered by a new Redstone signal / pulse (not a continuous signal)</li>
<li>Upon receiving this new signal, the Crafter will eject the recipe result from the front face</li>
<li>If the output result has multiple type of items all the result items will be ejected together</li>
<li>The Crafter can be oriented in any direction when placed</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Crafter UI</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Crafter has a 3x3 interactable crafting grid</li>
<li>The Crafter’s crafting grid slots are toggleable, meaning that the player can change the behavior of a slot by clicking or pressing on a slot with an empty hand</li>
<li>A slot that is ‘toggled’ cannot hold any items, and therefore cannot have items placed into it by other blocks, such as Hoppers and Droppers</li>
<li>Unlike the Crafting Table, the Crafter displays a preview of the crafted item which will be crafted and ejected on the next Redstone pulse but cannot be manually taken out by the player</li>
<li>The Crafter UI is shared between all players interacting with the Crafter, meaning that multiple players can interact with the Crafter at the same time, similar to Chests and Hoppers</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Crafter interaction with other blocks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Comparator signal strength is 0-9, where each non-empty or toggled slot adds 1 strength</li>
<li>Hoppers can be used to both insert and pull out items from the Crafter</li>
<li>Droppers can be used to insert items into the Crafter</li>
<li>Moving items in from another block (ex: Hopper, Dropper) prioritizes filling items into slots following these rules:
<ul>
<li>Prioritize the first empty slot (from left-to-right, top-to-bottom)</li>
<li>If there are no empty slots then prioritize the smallest stack of the same item (pick the first if there are multiple)</li>
<li>If there is a toggled slot it will be skipped. The item will then be moved into the container</li>
<li>If the item cannot be moved, it will be ejected into the world</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Vampire Survivors v1.7 is out now with new free content</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The game that spawned a great many clones, Vampire Survivors is back with a brand new free content update for all players. A game that needs no introduction by now right? Run around taking down enemies with weapons that auto-fire on timers, while you collect gems to level up and create a completely ridiculous combination.</p>
<p>Version 1.7.0 the 'Chilling Update' has a snowy theme, check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="czvC_-iXtic"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c20ecf677b5f69010036ee1f1d07ddce.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/czvC_-iXtic" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>Yep, that's about as insane as I would expect from developer poncle by now.</em></p>
<p>New in this version:</p>
<ul>
<li>6 new EXTRA achievements.</li>
<li>1 new bonus stage.</li>
<li>2 new relics to get a new PowerUp and morph an existing character.</li>
<li>1 new weapon with its evolution.</li>
<li>1 new playable character.</li>
<li>1 new music track.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Their next planned updated with "Adventures" was delayed, as it needs more time testing with all the different platforms so they're saving it for a future release. It should be out in "less than a month" if all testing continues to go well. The Adventures update, they said, will remix content of the base game and add in "a bit of new flavour through new stage progression and descriptions" along with giving you a fresh start, while not losing anything you've obtained. Seems like it will have a mixture of free and paid DLC content for it.</p>
<p>It has a Native Linux version but it's not advertised and seems to work just fine. It also works just fine with Proton.</p>
<p>Available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developers of Planetary Annihilation (well, some of them at least) have announced Industrial Annihilation, a full sequel that blends in factory building with the RTS elements. What they've basically made here is Factorio Annihilation.</p>
<p>With the developer now being called Galactic Annihilation, it's made up of people who worked on the likes of Planetary Annihilation, Total Annihilation, Supreme Commander, Command &amp; Conquer:Generals and more. They certainly know their stuff when it comes to strategy games.</p>

<p>Currently they're saying it will be available for "PC", with no mention of Linux this time. It's likely to run with Proton though if they aren't continuing Native Linux support. As a huge RTS fan, I will be keeping an eye on this, although blending it with the factory-building sim elements does leave me a little concerned about it becoming overly complicated. Time will tell. The idea is fun though, building up a big factory to pump out units while building up something massive to take to your enemies.</p>
<p>You can pre-order on the <a href="https://industrialannihilation.com/" target="_blank">official site</a> for $29.99 or <a href="https://www.startengine.com/offering/industrialannihilation" target="_blank">invest</a> in its development, much like what the crowdfunding platform Fig used to offer. Seems the investment side is going okay with $54,241.86 USD so far.</p>
<p>It will hit Steam Early Access in "Q2 2024".</p>

      <title>Relaxing minimalist building strategy game Tiny Atolls fixed up for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tiny Atolls was released at the end of September and while I enjoy it a lot, it did come with a rather broken Linux version, which has now been fixed up. The initial release had lots of missing bright pink textures - but it's looking good now.</p>
<p>Quite a bit like Dorfromantik, giving you an ever-expanding procedurally generated world as you place down tiles. Here you have three different colours and three different types of tiles, and the idea is to build up the biggest score by getting combinations with these tiles. It's really sweet and relaxing and good to see it continue to improve.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1M5FxNfhpb4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9574954a70b38c9df0615ab4cbcff986.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1M5FxNfhpb4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Not only is the Linux version fixed, but they've also addressed some feedback from players too. Now there's a proper expanded tutorial to teach you the game, there's a few tips when hovering over things, they've enhanced the bridge visuals and did a balancing pass over the game. Overall it should feel a lot more welcoming to new players.</p>
<p>If you love casual strategy building games like this, it's one to take a look at.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4825782401697715791gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4825782401697715791gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>They have a good roadmap of what's to come too including more of everything like more tiles, more unique buildings, new tools, biome mechanics, a terraforming tool, interactive island events, wildlife, villager interactivity, a dynamic population system, a creative mode and more. Sounds like eventually it will have a fair bit more depth to it.</p>
<p>Available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246640/Tiny_Atolls/" target="_blank">Steam</a> in Early Access.</p>
<p>Here's a full-screen capture of it on Steam Deck:</p>

      <title>Sweet Dreams Alex is a wholesome puzzle and construction game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mixing together puzzles and room building, Sweet Dreams Alex is a rather wholesome idea for a game about keeping away nightmares and it's out now with Native Linux support.</p>
<p>The idea here is that Alex and her family have just moved into their new home. A big change, a bit scary but also exciting. You are Alex's dream builder, tasked with building various distractions using lots of different tools to delay her nightmares until the morning comes. The game comes with 250+ hand-crafted puzzles to begin with, plus the built-in editor gives you the ability to build and share your own with a simple import/export tool.</p>
<p>A rather peaceful puzzle game to chill with, featuring over 70 minutes of music from popular lofi artist edelwize.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="U_5muiCg8Wo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6efdc4b37875d560f229feeb78e8264a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/U_5muiCg8Wo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Good to see more family friendly puzzle games like this. Should be appropriate for all ages and given the mechanics accessible to most with a bit of a challenge.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/sweet-dreams-alex?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1561090/Sweet_Dreams_Alex/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Chilly survival-adventure Kona II: Brume is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Parabole just released Kona II: Brume, a follow-up to their chilly adventure from 2017 that has you step back into your role as Detective Carl Faubert.</p>
<p>This time you're checking out a rural mining village in the 1970s. Enveloping the settlement is The Brume – a weird mist that is disconnecting the village and its inhabitants from reality and playing merry havoc with the balance of nature. Check out the launch trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ty8Q2NS11_M"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/72240c7f21eb8777b5653d67c4ef20d2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ty8Q2NS11_M" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explore – </strong>go into the vast fictive land of Manastan in Northern Canada and fight your way through the village - or what's left of it. Search for clues in wooden shacks, visit nearby locations on your trusty dog sled and navigate the surrounding lakes.</li>
<li><strong>Investigate - </strong>follow your clues and findings very carefully. Consult Carl Faubert’s Journal and put your detective skills to the test. Can you piece together the mystery behind the brume?</li>
<li><strong>Survive - </strong>the Brume is relentless: a bitter cold blizzard, dangerous wildlife, and troubling nightmares. Prepare to survive against all odds!</li>
<li><strong>Experience – </strong>a rich story unfolds with every step you take. Find and inspect objects, letters and documents, while an omniscient storyteller narrates your journey in Manastan.</li>
</ul>
<p>I liked the first game, but back then it was the earlier days of Unity support on Linux and it had some pretty bad graphical issues on my machine. Hopefully this time around the experience is better. Nice to see they kept up support for Linux though, which going by what they said was mainly to ensure it works well on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>You can buy it with Native Linux support on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1229020/Kona_II_Brume/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma 6.0 now scheduled for release 28th February 2024</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The KDE team are hard at work to make the next major release of the KDE Plasma desktop environment, my current favourite desktop and the one used on the Steam Deck. Now, we actually have something of a proper roadmap to Plasma 6.0.</p>
<p>In an earlier blog post <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/kde-plasma-6-to-launch-in-february-2024/" target="_blank">I covered from developer Nate Graham</a>, it was mentioned that they were going for February but there was nothing really set in stone. Just in the last day though the <a href="https://community.kde.org/Schedules/February_2024_MegaRelease" target="_blank">official schedule</a> was updated from a proposal to have some full dates on it so here's their current plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>8 November 2023: Alpha - KDE Gear 24.01.75 / KDE Plasma 5.80.0 / KDE Frameworks 5.245.0.</li>
<li>29 November 2023: Beta 1 - KDE Gear 24.01.80 / KDE Plasma 5.90.0 / KDE Frameworks 5.246.0.</li>
<li>20 December 2023: Beta 2 - KDE Gear 24.01.85 / KDE Plasma 5.91.0 / KDE Frameworks 5.247.0.</li>
<li>10 January 2024: Release Candidate 1 - KDE Gear 24.01.90 / KDE Plasma 5.92.0 / KDE Frameworks 5.248.0.</li>
<li>31 January 2024: Release Candidate 2 - KDE Gear 24.01.95 / KDE Plasma 5.93.0 / KDE Frameworks 5.249.0.</li>
<li>21 February 2024: Private Tarball Release - KDE Gear 24.02.0 / KDE Plasma 6.0 / KDE Frameworks 6.0.</li>
<li>28 February 2024: Public Release - KDE Gear 24.02.0 / KDE Plasma 6.0 / KDE Frameworks 6.0.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are you excited for the upcoming release? I'm keen to see all the Wayland improvements since I'm running the Plasma Wayland session by default now.</p>

      <title>Check out the XDC 2023 talks on HDR + Color Management for Steam Deck / Linux desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The X.Org Developer's Conference - <a href="https://indico.freedesktop.org/event/4/" target="_blank">XDC 2023</a> has been going on for the last few days, and there's some good talks happening including a nice overview across two talks going over the state of HDR and Color Management.</p>
<p>First talk at about is 42:36 is from Melissa Wen of Igalia:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="description js-mathjax">
<p>A guided tour of the AMD display driver code to identify hardware color capabilities on different versions, connect relevant parts of the shared code to DRM, and ultimately deliver a broader range of color features to the userspace. This work is another step towards advanced GPU-accelerated color management for Linux compositors, and it has already enabled improvements to HDR display support in SteamOS/Gamescope. So, what's the next treasure hunt?</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p><em><a href="https://indico.freedesktop.org/event/4/contributions/186/attachments/138/200/The%20Rainbow%20Treasure%20Map%20-%20Melissa%20Wen.pdf" target="_blank">Slides here</a></em></p>
<p>The second talk at about 1:06:50 is from Joshua Ashton of Valve:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An overview of Gamescope and our journey to support HDR content and color management at scanout and composite for Steam Deck and Desktop.<br/>
Covering the issues we faced along the way from all aspects to UX, to getting HDR and 10-bit on XWayland games/clients, to DRM, and to the future of what we need from the new DRM atomic color management pipeline.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><a href="https://indico.freedesktop.org/event/4/contributions/202/attachments/127/189/Rainbow%20Frogs%20HDR%20and%20Color%20Management%20in%20Gamescope-1.pdf" target="_blank">Slides here</a></em></p>
<p>Full Day 1 video below, which should start at 42:36 just as Melissa Wen starts speaking:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Gg4eSAP1uc4?rel=0&amp;start=2556"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e809bb32c5f9fc8fd883ad3bb9720fff.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Gg4eSAP1uc4?rel=0&amp;start=2556" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>Joshua Ashton's talk especially was quite fun, love their energy. </em></p>
<p>Shows that there's really a massive amount of work going into the HDR and colour management, and just how complicated it actually is with a lot more work ahead to get it all hooked up on traditional Linux desktops.</p>

      <title>Tony Hawk&#39;s Pro Skater 1 + 2 adds offline support for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Activision have released an update for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 on Steam. <a href="https://support.activision.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-update" target="_blank">Patch 1.1</a> is for Steam Deck players so here's what's changed.</p>
<p>This is a really small update too but addresses the two biggest annoyances for those skating on Steam Deck:</p>
<ul>
<li>The keyboard overlay now works properly for Steam Deck users.</li>
<li>Steam Deck users can now play offline.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pretty much my only complaints about it have now been solved, so I really see no reason not to recommend it now. The game performed great on Steam Deck but the initially broken online play and forced internet even for single-player were big problems. Nice to see them solved! Although, a little odd to see it only being done for Steam Deck.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16418166841697657727gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16418166841697657727gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Just a reminder though you'll need Proton Experimental to get the best experience right now, since the latest release of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/proton-experimental-updated-for-tony-hawks-halo-infinite-resident-evil-4-separate-ways/" target="_blank">Proton Experimental from October 11th</a> is what fixed the online play.</p>
<p>Not sure if it was intentional or not, but this patch to fix offline play on Steam Deck went out just after the sale ended. So I wonder how many people refunded it due to the issues, that would now have to buy it at full price…</p>
<p>You may be able to get it to work on desktop Linux too in offline mode by using <code class="inline-code">SteamDeck=1 %command%</code> as a Steam launch option for the game, which likely won't work for Windows since the Steam Deck is just a Linux machine.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2395210/Tony_Hawks_Pro_Skater_1__2/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Cyber Knights: Flashpoint from Trese Brothers is now in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After pushing out some great games like Star Traders: Frontiers and Templar Battleforce, Trese Brothers have really turned up the production values for Cyber Knights: Flashpoint that could end up being the next big turn-based tactics game. <em>Note: key provided by TriplePoint.</em></p>
<p>If you liked what they did before, and how much depth their games offer, you're going to like this a <em>lot</em>. Especially so, if you're an XCOM fan like me. Heck, it's also a fair bit like a more expanded Invisible, Inc. which is also another quality game as this blends XCOM and Invisible, Inc. together into something really interesting.</p>
<p>Check out their Early Access trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DoeJcXZY7Uc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d2cb279df7b9d79f612dc5fbb0312e6e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DoeJcXZY7Uc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I'm really massively looking forward to seeing how they expand it. They've got a solid and entertaining base here, that offers up they say around 15-20 hours of story content already on top of various heists that aren't part of the actual story you can complete. The base building side of wasn't in last I checked though, so I am eagerly awaiting that being added as that should really give it a boost.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>3rd Person Turn-based Squad Tactics</strong>: A modern tactical RPG with some of our favorite elements: gridless movement, environmental cover, specialized overwatch, initiative manipulation and more. Outsmart enemy security with creative stealth &amp; hacking or go loud with powerful weapons &amp; abilities.</li>
<li><strong>Unique Cyberpunk Stories</strong>: Contacts, squad members, and world events will weave together in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1021210/announcements/detail/1701735458164171772" target="_blank">stories reminiscent of the pen and paper cyberpunk RPGs</a> we played for years while building the lore of this world.</li>
<li><strong>Thrill of the Heist</strong>: Choose your jobs &amp; work your network for advantages to pull this off. Get the crew you’ll need &amp; gear them up. Plan your path through multi-stage missions, and finally... look for ways to score a little more while you're there—what’s the worst that could happen?</li>
<li><strong>Power-Player Strategy</strong>: Balance factions, favors, reputation and more. Rivals, fixers, arms dealers and corporate big shots... who you work for, who you fail or betray, all of it can open and close opportunities for you. Watch your heat, and try to make sure more people owe you than the other way around.</li>
<li><strong>Endless Builds</strong>: Experiment with endless combinations of talents, multi-classing, cyberware, weapons and gear to build the perfect team.</li>
<li><strong>Evolving Characters</strong>: The jobs you take have consequences for both your crew and connections. Loyalty, traits, cybernetics and escapes—you might get offworld in the end, but will any of you be the same?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I have no doubt this will be a success, and it deserves to be. It's already a great game and Trese Brothers are a developer worth supporting directly. While the Early Access release is of course unfinished, and there's a few warts, nothing so far has taken the fun away from it. Really good stuff.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1021210/Cyber_Knights_Flashpoint/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a> with Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Moonlight and Sunshine game and desktop streaming updates out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-qt" target="_blank">Moonlight</a> and <a href="https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine" target="_blank">Sunshine</a> are projects that allow you to stream your entire PC over your network, useful if Steam Remote Play doesn't work well and as an alternative to NVIDIA GameStream. Both projects recently had major upgrades.</p>
<p>You would use Sunshine on the host machine, and then Moonlight on the device you wish to play on. Setup can be a little tricky depending on your Linux distro and how you're running Sunshine, so make sure you read the docs.</p>
<p>Moonlight PC v5.0.0 went out with these new features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Custom FPS values</li>
<li>Streaming using the AV1 codec from Sunshine hosts</li>
<li>Horizontal scrolling with Sunshine hosts</li>
<li>Native multi-touch input with Sunshine hosts*</li>
<li>Controller type information is passed to Sunshine for controller type autoselection*</li>
<li>Extended features of PS4/PS5 controllers (touchpad, battery state, gyro/accelerometer motion, and RGB LED) are natively passed to Sunshine hosts*</li>
<li>Support for up to 16 gamepads with Sunshine hosts</li>
<li>Frame pacing support on Wayland</li>
<li>Host-side processing latency is now displayed in the performance overlay with Sunshine hosts</li>
<li>Window title now includes the PC name when streaming</li>
<li>Alphabetical sorting of the PC list</li>
<li>Dynamic decoder detection for improved support of custom FFmpeg builds</li>
<li>Updated Play and Stop button design to improve contrast with app box art</li>
<li>Older log files are automatically cleaned up</li>
<li>The settings page automatically scrolls to the selected element when using keyboard or gamepad navigation</li>
<li>Pressing Share+PS buttons on PS4/PS5 controllers can be used to emulate a clickpad press</li>
<li>Improved audio quality when streaming with a high bitrate from remote hosts</li>
<li>Increased mouse polling rate</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>*Notes only for Sunshine 0.21.0+</em></p>
<p>There's plenty of bug fixes, and a couple of tweaks to the Linux support too.</p>
<p>On top of that the Sunshine 0.21.0 release also went out a few days ago with these new features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>(Input) Add support for automatically selecting the emulated controller type based on the physical controller connected to the client</li>
<li>(Input/Windows) Add support for Applications (context menu) key</li>
<li>(Input/Windows) Implement touchpad, motion sensors, battery state, and LED control for the emulated DualShock 4 controller</li>
<li>(Input) Advertise support for new input features to clients</li>
<li>(Linux/Debian) Added Debian Bookworm package</li>
<li>(Prep-Commands) Expose connection environment variables</li>
<li>(Input/Windows) Implement pen and touch support</li>
<li>(Capture/Windows) Add standalone NVENC encoder</li>
<li>(Capture) Implement AV1 encoding</li>
<li>(Network) Implement IPv6 support</li>
<li>(Capture/Windows) Add option to disable realtime hags</li>
<li>(Graphics/NVIDIA) Add an option to decrease GPU scheduling priority to workaround HAGS video hang</li>
<li>(Capture/Linux) Add FFmpeg powerpc64le architecture for self compiling Sunshine</li>
<li>(Capture/Windows) Add support for capturing rotated displays</li>
<li>(System Tray) Implement streaming event notifications</li>
<li>(UI) Add port configuration table</li>
<li>(Applications) Added option to automatically treat launcher type apps as detached commands</li>
<li>(Input/Gamepad) Allow the Misc button to work as Guide on emulated Xbox 360 controllers</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I've been testing it out today, and one annoying issue I've come across is that on KDE Plasma Wayland, the mouse cursor seems to be invisible which is quite a nuisance. This seems to be a known issue with a <a href="https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine/issues/93" target="_blank">GitHub</a> report giving some temporary workarounds. Hopefully a proper solution can be found and fixed. Wayland seems to add some extra complexity to many things on Linux.</p>
<p>Have you been using Moonlight / Sunshine? What are your thoughts on it? Any good tips to share?</p>

      <title>Mudborne is an upcoming laid-back nature sim about breeding &amp; collecting Frogs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You've seen <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/properly-chilled-beekeeping-sim-apico-30-update-out-now/" target="_blank">APICO</a> where you collect and breed Bees but what about Frogs? Well that's exactly what Mudborne from the same developer will have.</p>
<p>Spawned as an idea from a Game Jam, it uses a similar style and setting to APICO but they plan to take it in a slightly different direction with Mudborne. Frogs, of course, but it will have a whole bunch of other cool features that's worth keeping an eye on.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/422846651697623737gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/422846651697623737gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>"With Mudborne I wanted to play more with the idea of direct manipulation &amp; min/max-ing of genetics to find new species (rather than just slapping bees together), as well as some more interesting nature mechanics - while still bringing the same menu management &amp; crafting minigame vibes you all know and love (along with all the learning I've had making APICO!)" — ellraiser, developer.</p>
<p>Going by the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2355150/discussions/0/3828662662938828928/" target="_blank">roadmap</a> they want to add in some fun sounding stuff like nursery pools for tadpoles, custom houses with decorative items, an alternative dream world, pet frogs to follow you around, ways to display all your various frogs and more. Look, it's a game about collecting and breeding Frogs what more do you want?</p>
<p>Try out the super early prototype <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2355150/Mudborne/" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a> and follow it along.</p>

      <title>Run and gun action game Schizollama now up on Kickstarter with a demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Schizollama is the next game coming from Nicola Piovesan / Chaosmonger Studio after ENCODYA, Clunky Hero, Three Minutes To Eight, and Soul Tolerance. It's a crazy run and gun action game inspired by games like Broforce and Metal Slug.</p>
<p>Filled with completely over the top action and procedurally generated levels, no run will be the same. They're aiming for it to be "one of the most fast-paced games of the genre". With some slick pixel-art it does look like a lot of fun if you're into the genre.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rYp7zt4LMIs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6eb86b17b1e6f65573ead423c47632e1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rYp7zt4LMIs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Main Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>9 different areas divided into 40 procedurally generated levels.</li>
<li>3 main characters to choose from.</li>
<li>6 kinds of alpaca soldiers.</li>
<li>7 kinds of alpaca’s heavy machinery.</li>
<li>9 bosses.</li>
<li>18 foe beasts.</li>
<li>6 weapons.</li>
<li>23 upgrades.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's a demo available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2571500/Schizollama/" target="_blank">Steam</a> which includes Linux support (<a href="https://chaosmonger.itch.io/schizollama" target="_blank">itch.io</a> only has a Windows demo) so you can give it a try and decide if you wish to support it.</p>
<p>They're hoping to get at least €17,500 through the crowdfunding <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/piovesan/schizollama" target="_blank">campaign on Kickstarter</a>. Their previous titles were also funded in the same way, and those that are released have generally favourable reviews.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Shrouded Space was developed for a Game Jam and it's really impressive, and the developer just released an update to it that also includes a Native Linux version.</p>

      <title>Harebrained Schemes and Paradox Interactive to split</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Harebrained Schemes were acquired by Paradox Interactive back in 2018 and now they're set to part ways, after the disappointing launch of The Lamplighters League.</p>
<p>Harebrained Schemes developed titles like BATTLETECH, Shadowrun Returns, Shadowrun: Dragonfall and more but it seems like the partnership with Paradox has not gone well overall. Paradox announced earlier this month on October 10th how bad the launch of The Lamplighters League went noting in a <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/media/press-releases/press-release/paradox-interactive-writes-down-msek-171-of-capitalized-development-cost-for-the-lamplighters-league" target="_blank">press release</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Paradox Interactive has today decided to write down capitalized development costs for the game <em>The Lamplighters League</em>, in addition to the regular degressive amortization done during the game’s first three months. Overall, this will result in that all of the game’s capitalized development costs of MSEK 320 will be recognized as costs in the fourth quarter of 2023. The game’s impact on profit before tax for the fourth quarter is estimated to MSEK -248. The write-down stems from a revised sales forecast, which was established after the game’s release.</p>
<p>“<em>The Lamplighters League</em> is a fun game with many strengths. Even though we see cautiously positive player numbers in subscription services, the commercial reception has been too weak, which is frankly a big disappointment. Game projects are by their nature always risky, but at the end of the day we haven’t performed at the level we should. It is painful but makes us more eager to roll up our sleeves and do better,” says Fredrik Wester, CEO of Paradox Interactive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6355432631697562833gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6355432631697562833gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - The Lamplighters League</em></p>
<p>On Steam, The Lamplighters League has less than 200 user reviews, which is <em>really</em> bad.</p>
<p>With today's announcement, they're going to entirely part ways on January 1st, 2024. Paradox will keep ownership of The Lamplighters League and other games developed by the studio while Harebrained Schemes look towards "new publishing, partnership, and investment opportunities".</p>
<p>From the press release sent out today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Paradox has refocused its strategy towards its core niches within strategy and management games with endless qualities,” said Charlotta Nilsson, COO of Paradox. “We and HBS’ leadership have been discussing what would happen after the release of The Lamplighters League, but a new project or sequel in the same genre was not in line with our portfolio plans. Hence, we believe that a separation would be the best way forward. We’re very happy that this talented, gifted studio has the chance to continue and can’t wait to see what they will make next.”</p>
<p>“Harebrained Schemes will support The Lamplighters League through the end of the year while we seek funding and partnerships for an independent future in 2024," said Brian Poel, Studio Operations Manager of HBS. “Our studio mission remains the same: to make games that challenge your mind and touch your heart.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's other news though, which is that Harebrained Schemes had a significant amount of staff let go before the release of The Lamplighters League. This was shared by a former staff member in a forum post on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/paradox-writes-down-entire-cost-of-the-lamplighters-league-320m-sek-citing-weak-commercial-success-%E2%80%9Ccautiously-positive%E2%80%9D-subscription-players.773480/#post-113276105" target="_blank">ResetEra</a>, confirmed by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/paradox-says-the-lamplighters-league-sales-were-a-big-disappointment-confirms-recent-layoffs-at-developer-harebrained-schemes/" target="_blank">PC Gamer</a>.</p>
<p>So tough times ahead for Harebrained Schemes.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA Beta driver 545.23.06 released for Linux, plenty of new features</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After being a little quiet for a while, NVIDIA released Beta driver <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/download/driverResults.aspx/213007/en-uk" target="_blank">545.23.06</a> which includes a bunch of new features and a few bug fixes too. This is a Beta driver, so it's not meant for those of you who need things stable as it may contain other issues. However, generally, the Beta drivers are okay.</p>
<p>Nice to see so many improvements, and at least they put up the <em>correct</em> changelog this time after putting up the wrong changelog for two recent stable driver releases…they still haven't put up the corrected changelog for the stable release of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/nvidia-vulkan-beta-535-43-09-and-stable-535-104-05-drivers-out-now/" target="_blank">535.104.05</a>, which is exactly the same as <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/nvidia-driver-535-98-now-available-for-linux/" target="_blank">535.98</a> (and 535.98 initially had the wrong one too).</p>
<p>Here's all the changes for 545.23.06 Beta:</p>
<div class="tabcontent" id="tab1_content" style="visibility: visible; display: block;">
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added experimental HDMI 10 bits per component support; enable by loading nvidia-modeset with `hdmi_deepcolor=1`.</li>
<li>Added support for the CTM, DEGAMMA_LUT, and GAMMA_LUT DRM-KMS CRTC properties. These are used by features such as the "Night Light" feature in GNOME and the "Night Color" feature in KDE, when they are used as Wayland compositors.</li>
<li>Added beta-quality support for GeForce and Workstation GPUs to open kernelmodules. Please see the "Open Linux Kernel Modules" chapter in the README for details.</li>
<li>Added initial experimental support for runtime D3 (RTD3) power management on Desktop GPUs. Please see the 'PCI-Express Runtime D3 (RTD3) Power Management' chapter in the README for more details.</li>
<li>Added support for the EGL_ANDROID_native_fence_sync EGL extension and the VK_EXTERNAL_SEMAPHORE_HANDLE_TYPE_SYNC_FD_BIT and VK_EXTERNAL_FENCE_HANDLE_TYPE_SYNC_FD_BIT Vulkan external handle types when the nvidia-drm kernel module is loaded with the modeset=1 parameter.</li>
<li>Added experimental support for framebuffer consoles provided by nvidia-drm. On kernels that implement drm_fbdev_generic_setup and drm_aperture_remove_conflicting_pci_framebuffers, nvidia-drm will install a framebuffer console when loaded with both `modeset=1` and `fbdev=1` kernel module parameters. This will replace the Linux boot console driven by a system framebuffer driver such as efifb or vesafb.<br/>
Note that when an nvidia-drm framebuffer console is enabled, unloading nvidia-drm will cause the screen to turn off.</li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to allow installing the driver while an existing NVIDIA driver is already loaded.</li>
<li>Added support for virtual reality displays, such as the SteamVR platform, on Wayland compositors that support DRM leasing. Support requires xwayland version 22.1.0 and wayland-protocols version 1.22, or later. Tested on sway, minimum version 1.7 with wlroots version 0.15, and also on Kwin, minimum version 5.24.<br/>
Note: Before xwayland 23.2, there is a known issue with HDMI displays where the headset will fail to start a second time after closing SteamVR. This can be worked around by unplugging and replugging in the headset.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented VRR (Variable Refresh Rate) from working with Wayland.</li>
<li>Added support to the NVIDIA VDPAU driver for running in Xwayland. Please refer to the "Xwayland support in VDPAU" section of the README for further details.</li>
<li>Added libnvidia-gpucomp.so to the driver package. This is a helper library used for GPU shader compilation.</li>
<li>Removed libnvidia-vulkan-producer.so from the driver package. This helper library is no longer needed by the Wayland WSI.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that intermittently caused the display to freeze when resuming from suspend on some Ada GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause monitors to flicker when the performance state changes on Turing GPUs.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>See their <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/download/driverResults.aspx/213007/en-uk" target="_blank">driver page</a> for all the info.</p>
<p>The most recent stable release was <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/Download/driverResults.aspx/211918/en-uk" target="_blank">535.113.01</a> on September 21st that noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause GPU memory utilization to be reported incorrectly for Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) partitions on Grace Hopper systems.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that intermittently caused the display to freeze when resuming from suspend on some Ada GPUs.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Slay the Spire devs release Dancing Duelists after abandoning Unity for Godot</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mega Crit, developers of the successful Slay the Spire have released a free new game called Dancing Duelists, after publicly calling out Unity recently (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-attempt-to-clarify-new-install-fees-as-developers-revolt/" target="_blank">as did many others</a>) and moving over to <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>.</p>
<p>Created for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/jump-ship-jam" target="_blank">Jump Ship Jam</a>, a Game Jam for developers to test out something new as it reads: "Curious to set sail in uncharted waters? Your mission: Craft a game using an entirely new-to-you engine or tool based on our announced theme."</p>
<p>So for it Mega Crit created Dancing Duelists, a "deckbuilding autobattler dance off with a BUMPIN' soundtrack". You pick a dancing character, picks some cards and then battle it out. Seems like a really nice idea and impressive what they were able to come up with in only a few weeks.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16644036521697547713gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16644036521697547713gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Dancing Duelists on Kubuntu</em></p>
<p>In the Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/646570/view/6688466724240723355" target="_blank">announcement</a> posted on the Slay the Spire store page the developers said: "Due to recent events, the Mega Crit team has been looking for an engine to migrate our next big game to from Unity, so we've been working on this little game for a few weeks now to acquaint ourselves with Godot, our new official engine of choice! It also just so happens to coincide with the Jump Ship Jam, an event that encourages game developers to branch out and create something with new engines &amp; tools!</p>
<p>We're super proud of how this project turned out in such a small timeframe, and we'd love for you to check it out!"</p>
<p>One of their team, Casey Yano, also wrote a <a href="https://caseyyano.com/on-evaluating-godot-b35ea86e8cf4" target="_blank">Medium post</a> on their thoughts for those interested.</p>
<p>This new free game is available on <a href="https://megacrit.itch.io/dancing-duelists" target="_blank">itch.io</a>. And while you can't pay for it they suggest <a href="https://fund.godotengine.org/" target="_blank">funding Godot</a> instead.</p>

      <title>Spaceship colony building sim Stardeus has a major upgrade out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Stardeus from Kodo Linija and Paradox Arc is a colony building sim set aboard a broken spaceship you need to rebuild, and a fresh major upgrade and overhaul has been released. It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>It looks a fair bit like RimWorld and Prison Architect, with a similar style but in many ways it's much more expansive with a surprising amount of depth to its various systems. It's often been called RimWorld in space by various players. If you love your space sci-fi and building sims, it's a good one to take a look at. This update celebrates the game being in Early Access now for 1 year, bringing with it amongst other things a brand new research system, new tutorials, overhaul fire, refined UI, new content and mechanics and a whole lot more. The developer did a fresh video going over the changes you can see below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="iDS32EMmohw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c366af2ff5fa84de9c98c49198860304.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/iDS32EMmohw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Really easy to lose tons of hours of your time in this one. It can be both really relaxing, and really intense depending on what's going on with your ship at any given time. Nice to see it continue to improve, and the research system changes in particular make it sound a lot nicer to play with far less of a grind feeling.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/stardeus?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1380910/Stardeus/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Ubuntu Desktop 23.10 now available again after the recent hostile translation</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news for those looking to download Ubuntu Desktop 23.10, as the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/ubuntu-2310-download-got-pulled-down-due-to-a-malicious-translation/" target="_blank">recent issue</a> involving a hostile translation has been solved and so the downloads are up again.</p>
<p>Canonical have put out a fresh build of <a href="https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/mantic/release/" target="_blank">Ubuntu 23.10</a> and <a href="https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-budgie/releases/mantic/release/" target="_blank">Ubuntu Budgie 23.10</a> with a fresh Ukrainian translation, which is the one that was hit with some pretty offensive stuff in it. In their updated <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/announcement-ubuntu-desktop-23-10-release-image-translation-incident-now-resolved/39365" target="_blank">announcement post</a> Canonical stated "Going forward we will be drafting new safeguards around translation moderation in Ubuntu Desktop. We will share the outcome of these discussions once they are refined.".</p>
<p>Nothing else has changed, it's the same <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/ubuntu-2310-mantic-minotaur-is-out-now/" target="_blank">Ubuntu 23.10 release announced recently</a> but with the installer translation issue solved.</p>
<p>Hopefully this won't happen again. Real shame it happened in the first place though. Unfortunately, some people will target anything for abuse, even open source projects to spread hate.</p>

      <title>Steam Desktop and Steam Deck Beta add new Gyro Mode and fixes in-game purchases</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a fresh update to the Steam Client for Desktop and Steam Deck, which fixes a couple of bugs while also providing another new experimental Gyro Mode. The changelog across both is the same, since they share the Steam Client code.</p>
<p>Here's the changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Steam Overlay</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fix not being able to complete in-game purchases in some games from a regression in the Beta Client released on Oct 13.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fix for opting into or out of Steam Input on the configurator page not updating the configuration until the next time the configurator was opened</li>
<li>New Experimental Gyro Mode : "Gyro to Joystick (Camera)". This mode re-uses concepts from the Gyro To Mouse system, including Natural Sensitivity, but outputs to Joystick instead of Mouse. It also has the option to "Catch Up" to your desired in game angles in the case of excessively fast gyro rotations exceeding the Maximum Turn Rate. This will replace the old Gyro-&gt;"As Joystick" once there is feature parity.</li>

      <title>Love classic RTS games? Check out D.O.R.F. Real-Time Strategic Conflict</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>D.O.R.F. Real-Time Strategic Conflict is an upcoming RTS based on the OpenRA game engine, and it looks really promising so it's going to be one to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>More about it: "D.O.R.F. Real-Time Strategic Conflict is a return to classic isometric RTS action, featuring elaborate base-building, resource gathering and massive battles with powerful and unique units. Take command of one of three factions, construct your base, gather and consume resources and smash your enemies!"</p>
<p>They showed off some fresher footage during the PC Gaming Show earlier this year that I missed:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-nMW35hGtBU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4791f7ab666d0051454fbd4004aff540.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-nMW35hGtBU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Elaborately detailed isometric sprites that harken back to the classic days of PC real-time strategy, while making use of modern rendering techniques and resolution.</li>
<li>Base construction and resource harvesting, but with a modern twist; resources must get from the refineries to the factories, rewarding players with efficient base layouts.</li>
<li>Pump oil from deposits, mine ore beneath the surface, and gather scrap and debris left over from previous battles to fuel your war machine.</li>
<li>Three unique factions: play as the brutalist battle-hardened Empire, the junkyard jalopy war machines of the Warbands, or the technologically sophisticated and mysterious N.W.O.</li>
<li>A massive arsenal at your disposal: from psychic rogues to multi-turret landships, self-cloaking tanks and giant crushing junk spheres of death, every faction offers their own arsenal of powerful and strange units.</li>
<li>Explore and conquer a twisted vision of Earth’s future, corrupted by genetic experiments, endless warfare and extraterrestrial anomalies.</li>
<li>Have your troops engage in brutal close-quarters fighting by storming enemy fortifications and facilities; capture your enemies factories and use their own technologies against them.</li>
<li>D.O.R.F. will feature an elaborate campaign for each of the game’s three factions, as well as multiplayer with up to 8 players per-match.</li>
</ul>
<p>Going by their own <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2388620/discussions/0/3801653351435882082/" target="_blank">FAQ</a>, it will have Linux support at launch. Not a surprise, since OpenRA has great Linux support, although they using a slightly older version of it with their own tweaks.</p>
<p>As someone who grew up with the original Dune 2, C&amp;C, Red Alert and more I really can't wait to give this a go, it looks like a lot of fun. Love that wrecking-ball unit smashing through walls, brilliant. The whole design of it looks rad. Nice to see more developers use OpenRA like this.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2388620/DORF_RealTime_Strategic_Conflict/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Epic Games launch &#39;First Run&#39; and &#39;Now On Epic&#39; with 100% revenue for devs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Epic Games are trying to pull over more developer to the Epic Games Store, with the launch of two new incentives with the previously announced First Run and the newly announced Now On Epic deals for developers.</p>
<p>The First Run program was announced <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/epic-games-new-exclusive-deal-gives-devs-100-for-6-months/" target="_blank">back in August</a>, which is where developers can launch on the Epic Store as an <em>exclusive</em> for 6 months and get a 100% revenue share instead of their usual 88%/12% split, which it reverts to after the 6 months are up. Developers can still sell directly and use third-party key stores, so this is clearly aimed at getting developers away from the likes of Steam.</p>
<p>Newly announced today though is the Now On Epic deal, where Epic want developers to bring their older games to the Epic Games Store. Similar deal here, with Epic offering six months of 100% revenue and after that it drops back to the 88%/12% split. Developers can opt in on this if their game launched elsewhere before October 31, 2023.</p>
<p>Full <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-first-run-launches-today-and-introducing-the-now-on-epic-program" target="_blank">announcement here</a>.</p>
<p>You can use the <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> or <a href="https://lutris.net/" target="_blank">Lutris</a> for easy installs from the Epic Store, since Epic Games don't support Linux or Steam Deck officially in any way with their own store.</p>
<p>Also, while we have you here, you can currently get both <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/blazing-sails" target="_blank">Blazing Sails</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/bundles/qube-ultimate-bundle" target="_blank">Q.U.B.E. ULTIMATE BUNDLE</a> free until October 19th.</p>
<p><em>ICYMI: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/epic-games-sheds-830-people-due-to-spending-more-than-they-earn/" target="_blank">Epic Games also announced in September</a> they let go over 800 people.</em></p>

      <title>Minecraft hits 300 million sales, update 1.21 announced with trial chambers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mojang has announced that Minecraft has now crossed over 300 million sales, and the Minecraft 1.21 update has been announced that will have some pretty fun additions. Here's a short round-up from 2023's Minecraft Live.</p>
<p>Firstly, the Mob Vote, sadly the Penguin lost although it's not really a surprise as the winner was the Armadillo, which will give players access to craft Wolf Armour. I know, I know, their naming on things makes no sense. Wolf armour from an Armadillo — okay then. There was a fair bit of backlash this year too, with a <a href="https://www.change.org/p/stop-the-mob-vote-put-an-end-to-the-scrapping-of-great-ideas" target="_blank">petition</a> reaching over 500K signatures as the mob vote leaves many good ideas out of the game.</p>
<p>They also released some stats like 300 million sales with a fun graphic:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7208270241697459682gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7208270241697459682gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>As for the upcoming Minecraft 1.21 update, which currently has no code-name will bring Trial Chambers. Structures that are full of traps, trial spawners, mobs, loot, and more. They're procedurally generated, so each time you enter it will be different and the challenge level will be tweaked with their new spawner block that has a spawn limit based on the number of players that enter.</p>
<p>You'll also find a new mob with the Breeze, a hostile creature that uses the power of wind to jump around and shoot Wind Charge projectiles at you that pushes you away with no damage, this Wind Charge will activate certain blocks too like trap doors which could make those Trial Chambers interesting. While the projectiles do no damage it will hurt when the mob hits you directly. Seems like one of the most fun mobs they've added for a while.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5607068971697460559gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5607068971697460559gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's also going to be some redstone updates, to allow for automated crafting with the Crafter block.</p>
<p>Full event is below:</p>

      <title>NVIDIA looking to hook up Reflex support in Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>An NVIDIA engineer has sent in pull requests to DXVK, VKD3D-Proton and DXVK-NVAPI to enable support for Reflex / NV low latency to get it hooked up in Proton.</p>
<p>For DXVK-NVAPI the <a href="https://github.com/jp7677/dxvk-nvapi/pull/147" target="_blank">pull request</a> notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<div class="edit-comment-hide">
<div class="comment-body markdown-body js-comment-body soft-wrap css-overflow-wrap-anywhere user-select-contain d-block">
<p>The intent of this PR is to enable Reflex for all D3D11, and D3D12 titles using dxvk-nvapi. It does this through a new device interface called ID3DLowLatencyDevice, which will be exposed from vkd3d-proton, and dxvk.</p>
<p>To provide compatibility with LatencyFleX this change will only use the ID3DLowLatencyDevice interface when LatencyFleX is not detected.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>For VKD3D-Proton the <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/pull/1739" target="_blank">pull request</a> notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<div class="edit-comment-hide">
<div class="comment-body markdown-body js-comment-body soft-wrap css-overflow-wrap-anywhere user-select-contain d-block">
<p>This pull request implements a new device interface called ID3DLowLatencyDevice, and ID3D12CommandQueueExt using the VK_NV_low_latency2 extension. The purpose of these interfaces, is to give dxvk-nvapi a way to implement the nvapi Reflex interface.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>And then again the <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/3690" target="_blank">pull request</a> for DXVK notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<div class="edit-comment-hide">
<div class="comment-body markdown-body js-comment-body soft-wrap css-overflow-wrap-anywhere user-select-contain d-block">
<p>This pull request implements a new device interface called ID3DLowLatencyDevice using the VK_NV_low_latency2 extension. The purpose of this interface, is to give dxvk-nvapi a way to implement the nvapi Reflex interface.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see NVIDIA jumping in directly to get this support worked on, and also good that they're not trying to overwrite support for the already existing <a href="https://github.com/ishitatsuyuki/LatencyFleX" target="_blank">LatencyFleX</a>, which is an open source alternative to NVIDIA Reflex.</p>

      <title>Modern text adventure [I] doesn’t exist is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>[I] doesn't exist is a brand new text adventure from LUAL Games KIG and DreadXP that pays homage to the classics, taking cues from the likes of The Beginner’s Guide, Stories Untold, Buddy Simulator and Zork.</p>
<p>Utilizing a mix of 2D and 3D perspective through optical illusion, [I] doesn’t exist leads you through a trippy, dreamlike experience crafted to reflect the title's surreal tale. The visuals are quite fun and add a nice little spice to the text adventure, and the language processor seems to work well enough to not make it too frustrating to actually get through but you do still need the right combination of words.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="VwwGDHetfsE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/edc4e05f8a3a9a2287589a0bbc295cb6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/VwwGDHetfsE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While the game does have Native Linux support, currently it seems the sound is broken. However, playing it with Proton 8.0-4 (the current stable Proton), it seems to work fine with that. So keep that in mind if you plan to pick it up that right now, it does need Proton until they fix the Linux version.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1943420/I_doesnt_exist__a_modern_text_adventure/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a> or <a href="https://dreadxp.itch.io/i-doesnt-exist" target="_blank">itch.io</a>.</p>

      <title>Windjammers 2 added lobbies and full cross-play</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Windjammers 2 is a fun PvP sports game about throwing discs around. It's Steam Deck Verified and works great on Linux and the latest major free update sounds great.</p>
<p>Interestingly though, at some point the default version broke across both Steam Deck and desktop Linux. If you try to run it, you'll get a black screen. However, if you pick the second launch option for OpenGL it does work just fine. There's a <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/7166" target="_blank">bug report</a> already open on Valve's Proton GitHub for it.</p>
<p>Haven't seen any notable issues with the OpenGL version. Playing it today it all seemed great, even the new cross-play worked fine playing against someone on Xbox.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Os_jGtikJCw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/92c41cfb5ba264f1778e40bf63ab0f92.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Os_jGtikJCw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What's been added:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full online cross-play with lobbies and quick play.</li>
<li>Spectator mode.</li>
<li>Two new characters.</li>
<li>Two new modes to help you learn how to play.</li>
</ul>
<p>Windjammers 2 is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1114290/Windjammers_2/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It's also 50% off until October 25th so a really good time to jump in.</p>

      <title>Forza Horizon 5 gets a Proton Hotfix to work again on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Valve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/valve-investigating-forza-motorsport-issues-on-steam-deck-linux/" target="_blank">continue investigating</a> the launch issues with the new Forza Motorsport, at least Forza Horizon 5 should work again on Steam Deck and desktop Linux after also breaking recently. Valve continues chasing compatibility, since it seems some developers aren't testing their games for updates. Hopefully more developers will test Steam Deck at least before launching updates.</p>
<p>Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1712965569681723472" target="_blank">mentioned</a> on X on October 13th: "A Proton Hotfix has been deployed for the Forza Horizon 5 launch failure post-update, and will be automatically selected."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11278420721697395759gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11278420721697395759gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>If you find Proton Hotfix is not automatically selected for it here's how to change it below:</p>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Steam Deck</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a game in your Library and head to the little cog icon on the right.</li>
<li>Click Properties, then Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Hotfix from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>On a Linux desktop</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Right click a game, go to Properties.</li>
<li>Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Hotfix from the dropdown.</li>

      <title>GE-Proton 8-17 brings fixes for Alan Wake, Batman Arkham Asylum and more (updated)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A fresh release of the community-maintained GE-Proton for Steam Deck and Linux desktop is out! GE-Proton 8-17 has some nice sounding fixes for running various games.</p>
<p>Reminder: this is the version of Proton <em>not</em> supported by Valve. It may have issues at times the official Proton does not. However, it also at times pulls in fixes a bit quicker and can do things sometimes that Valve cannot do. To sum up: use it if you need it for specific games, otherwise sticking with the official Proton is the best idea. More about Proton can be found in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">my Proton beginner's guide</a>.</p>

<li>Added protonfix for The Song of Saya (thanks R1kaB3rN)</li>

<li>Added upstream patch to allow R6 Siege to launch again (https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/merge_requests/3777) (multiplayer still does not work due to anticheat)</li>

      <title>Microsoft completes takeover of Activision Blizzard as UK CMA approves new deal</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well that's it. Microsoft has completed their acquisition of Activision Blizzard King thanks to the UK's Competition &amp; Markets Authority clearing the way.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/microsoft-concession-a-gamechanger-that-will-promote-competition" target="_blank">announced</a> by the UK CMA, they said the new deal where Microsoft does <em>not</em> purchase Activision's cloud gaming rights, which instead goes to Ubisoft would "preserve competitive prices and better services":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In its original investigation, the CMA found Microsoft already held a strong position in relation to cloud gaming and blocked the deal. </p>
<p>The sale of Activision’s cloud streaming rights to Ubisoft will prevent the distribution of important, popular content – including games such as Call of Duty, Overwatch, and World of Warcraft – from coming under the control of Microsoft in relation to cloud gaming. The restructured deal substantially addressed the concerns that the CMA had following its original investigation, which concluded earlier this year.   </p>
<p>The CMA did identify limited residual concerns with the new deal, but Microsoft gave undertakings that will ensure that the terms of the sale of Activision’s rights to Ubisoft are enforceable by the CMA. </p>
<p>The CMA consulted on these undertakings and is satisfied that this will provide the safety net needed to make sure this deal is properly implemented.</p>
<cite>UK CMA</cite></blockquote>
<p>Microsoft also have their own <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/10/13/xbox-activision-blizzard/" target="_blank">announcement</a> to note it's finished that's just celebrating the deal. In the post they confirmed the plan to add Activision, Blizzard, and King franchises to Game Pass and other platforms.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AYU4q594LJ0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b4f942e2aaf0d441559b02b9573872ae.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AYU4q594LJ0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<hr/>
<p>What are you thoughts on this finally being completed?</p>
<p>Any feelings on Microsoft and Xbox aside, game industry consolidation is worrying. With many publishers and developers getting swallowed up, it hands a lot of power to a few companies. We've seen so many times now what happens like with the troubles at <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/after-eating-up-lots-of-game-studios-embracer-group-set-to-close-a-bunch/" target="_blank">Embracer</a> as just one recent example.</p>

      <title>Godot 4.2 beta 1 is out now for testing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot</a> team are preparing the next release of their free and open source game engine, with Godot 4.2 beta 1 now available for anyone to jump in and test it. This is part of their newer release cycle, to bring point releases more often.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16117167021697206257gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16117167021697206257gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of what's new includes (highlights):</p>
<ul>
<li>Lots of UI improvements to the Project Manager and the Godot Editor.</li>
<li>Implemented optional forced integer scaling. Integer scaling ensures that no matter the aspect ratio you get a square pixel grid without distortions for 2D game development.</li>
<li>Big improvements to Tilemap support.</li>
<li>No more needing to restart the editor when you change the resource import type. This along with a new powerful import pipeline with advanced options.</li>
<li>A fix with Steam Input for some gamepad events running twice.</li>
<li>Big improvements to Android support.</li>
<li>iOS one-click deploy support.</li>
<li>Various rendering performance improvements</li>
<li>AMD FSR 2.2 support added.</li>
<li>A new lightmapper denoising approach.</li>
<li>For Forward+ and Mobile rendering methods this release introduces 2D HDR rendering, unlocking 3D effects, such as glow, for 2D games.</li>
<li>An optional ANGLE-backed OpenGL rendering driver was added for macOS and Windows.</li>
<li>Lots of improvements for the Particles system to give VFX artists more control. It's now possible to directly animate velocity over lifetime, inherit projectile velocity, and change the emission amount of particles.</li>
<li>Shaders: an addition of drop-down list properties to custom nodes and output ports for vector types are now expandable by default.</li>
<li>Scripting: the script debugger now comes with full support for threaded code (GH-76582 by Juan Linietsky), including the execution stack and breakpoints.</li>
<li>Improved XR support with foveated rendering support, ported from Godot 3.x (GH-80881), and access to raw hand-tracking data.</li>
<li>Experimental support for Android (.NET 7.0+ required) and iOS (.NET 8.0 required) export targets</li>
</ul>
<p>See the <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-2-beta-1/" target="_blank">announcement</a> for more.</p>
<p>As for how they're doing after the recent Unity debacle that caused quite a surge in interest: Godot Engine currently has €51,024 in <a href="https://fund.godotengine.org/" target="_blank">funding</a> per month from their dedicated platform, plus their <a href="https://www.patreon.com/godotengine" target="_blank">Patreon</a> also shows £7,257 per month funding.</p>

      <title>Heroes of Might and Magic II game engine fheroes2 v1.0.9 released</title>
      <author>fheroes2</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As usual, after a month of hard work, fheroes2 Resurrection Team released a new <a href="https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2/releases/tag/1.0.9" target="_blank">1.0.9 </a><a href="https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2/releases/tag/1.0.9" target="_blank">version</a> of the Heroes of Might and Magic II game engine, filled with updates, fixes and new features!</p>
<p>Based on feedback from the players the AI has become easier on low difficulties. This makes the game more accessible for more players and at the same time keeps the challenge for those who want on higher difficulties. The AI also got a boost in its battle logic and is smarter on the Adventure Map.</p>
<p>The team reworked the game settings on the Adventure Map. This allows players to change game resolution or language without exiting to the Main Menu. This is more convenient.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4378608021697203895gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4378608021697203895gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Moreover, the Hot Keys dialog was upgraded as well and now it is easy to see all button mappings.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7139929551697203916gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7139929551697203916gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Touch devices have an important update: during battles, players have to confirm actions. The first touch event just places the cursor at the touch point, displaying information about the action being performed. The second touch event is confirmatory and performs the corresponding action if and only if this action corresponds exactly to the action of the first touch.</p>

<p>The "Continue movement" button's logic was enhanced on the Adventure Map. A long press on this button cancels any created path for a hero. If a hero without a planned path stands on an object, then pressing this button will interact with that object.</p>

<p>The work on the Editor continues and is gaining pace. During the past month, the team has been able to implement roads, streams, monsters and heroes placement in the Editor. There are more things to do before making the Editor public.</p>

<p>Besides the major changes, the team updated several translations, fixed multiple issues in the battle's logic and rendering, and closed more than 40 issues since the last release.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your valuable support and we hope you will enjoy the game!</p>

      <title>Diablo 4 now Steam Deck Verified before launch but no Steam keys for Battle.net buyers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news if you plan to dive into Diablo 4 with the Steam release coming on October 17th, as it has been Steam Deck Verified. There's some bad news if you already purchased it on Battle.net though.</p>
<p>For Diablo 4 being Steam Deck Verified, this means everything <em>should</em> just work out of the box directly from Steam and Valve's Diablo 4 verification was done on Proton Experimental. It already worked pretty great on Steam Deck anyway, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/diablo-4-on-steam-deck-released/" target="_blank">as I showcased previously</a>.</p>
<p>The bad news? Well, if you were hoping to simply transfer your Battle.net purchase over to Steam, it's a solid nope. Even though Steam keys cost developers / publishers nothing, Blizzard aren't going to provide you with one. As <a href="https://twitter.com/PezRadar/status/1712535492716335558" target="_blank">mentioned</a> on X (formerly Twitter) by Adam Fletcher, the Global Community Development Director on Diablo, in reply to a user asking about having to buy it again Fletcher replied: "Yes. Two different store fronts run by two different companies."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14920300971697202489gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Why don't some publishers do this? The reasoning is pretty simple really: Valve take a cut of all sales on Steam, including DLC and micro-transactions. So if you purchased directly before, publishers will want to keep you there so any extras you purchase don't get a cut eaten by Valve.</p>

      <title>Ubuntu 23.10 download got pulled down due to a malicious translation</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Canonical announced shortly after the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/ubuntu-2310-mantic-minotaur-is-out-now/" target="_blank">release of Ubuntu 23.10</a> that the official downloads were pulled, as there was hate speech identified from a malicious contributor in some of their translations.</p>
<p>They posted the <a href="https://twitter.com/ubuntu/status/1712593893319930079" target="_blank">announcement</a> on X, with a link to their Discourse <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/announcement-ubuntu-desktop-23-10-release-image-is-being-updated-to-resolve-a-malicious-translation-incident/39365" target="_blank">post</a> that gave a bit more info. In the post they mentioned it affected a "specific set of translations of the Ubuntu Desktop installer UI" and so they've taken immediate action to sort the situation with the translations being removed and replaced.</p>
<p>Affected downloads were for Ubuntu Desktop 23.10, Ubuntu Budgie 23.10 and the Ubuntu Desktop daily images.</p>
<p>Since it's all open source on <a href="https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-desktop-installer" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, we can go in and check what <em>actually</em> happened. Specifically, the Ukrainian translation has been entirely removed for now and it doesn't really take a lot of thought as to why. I translated a bit of it that I won't repeat here and…yeah. No surprise it has been pulled, it was bad.</p>
<p>Completely ridiculous that someone would target a Linux distribution like this.</p>

      <title>Valve locking down publishing Steam builds with SMS codes due to Malware</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/3749866608167579206" target="_blank">announced</a> recently some new changes for developers publishing public builds to their games on Steam, requiring a phone number and a text message confirmation code.</p>
<p>As the announcement says "As part of a security update, any Steamworks account setting builds live on the default/public branch of a released app will need to have a phone number associated with their account, so that Steam can text you a confirmation code before continuing". The change is due to go live on October 24th and for developers who don't have a phone Valve simply say "Sorry, but you’ll need a phone or some way to get text messages if you need to add users or set the default branch for a released app". It will also be needed for adding new users, and Valve plan to add this requirement to "other Steamworks actions in the future".</p>
<p>Valve didn't mention why, but it didn't take long for the reason to make its way online. It turns some developer accounts were compromised, and used to spread malware on Steam. As <a href="https://twitter.com/simoncarless/status/1711841332124336520" target="_blank">noted</a> by Simon Carless on X, showing a screenshot a developer received:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19275273571697118141gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19275273571697118141gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em>Screenshot via Simon Carless, SteamDB</em></p>
<p>In reply to the X post, developer Benoît Freslon <a href="https://twitter.com/BenoitFreslon/status/1712035226560483479" target="_blank">said</a> "Hey Simon, I'm the developer of this game. ALL my accounts were hacked by a Token Grabber Malware. Unfortunately, the 2FA i s useless if the token is still active. I just used my dev account to release the game few hours before the hack I suppose."</p>
<p>Valve confirmed to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/steam-malware-attack-new-security/" target="_blank">PC Gamer</a> the issue affected less than 100 Steam accounts with the games installed.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck gets a &#39;Laser Pointer&#39; Gyro mode, plus more desktop and SteamVR work</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released some more Steam Deck Beta Client updates recently, one of them including an interesting new Gyro mode so here's all the details on what's new.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3747615443064305418" target="_blank">October 10th</a> update for Steam Deck added in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>New "Laser Pointer" Gyro 3DOF to 2D Conversion mode: The Cursor is driven up, down, left and right due to an imaginary ray pointing out of the front of the controller/through the SteamDeck Screen. This mode is most appropriate for mouse cursor movement/UI interaction.</li>
<li>Fix for SteamDeck Gyro offset angle defaults being set incorrectly.</li>
<li>Minor UI tidying.</li>

<p>On desktop Steam for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053/view/3718342045488479057" target="_blank">October 10th</a>, Valve also noted they fixed "a case where proton related configuration options could show up on Windows based systems", plus there was an update in the client for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/250820/view/3726223344829746949" target="_blank">SteamVR Beta</a> that included:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Desktop View:</p>
<ul>
<li>Restored ability to add an individual desktop window, using a button directly on the dashboard.</li>
<li>Desktop windows now show their actual icon in addition to their name.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">General:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed cases where binding callouts would stay up even when they should be dismissed.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Index Controller Firmware</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where haptics could stop responding after playing certain repeated haptics events.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053/view/3744238376111426183" target="_blank">October 11th</a> across both desktop and Steam Deck (client updates are often the same) there was this update:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for the PowerA Nintendo Switch Nano Wired Controller</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Steam Overlay</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix microtransactions dialog failing to reopen if the overlay was closed without canceling the transaction.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/250820/view/3752119675457313673" target="_blank">SteamVR Beta</a> they also added a clicking sound when typing.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Sadly for me, SteamVR 2.0 Beta still just doesn't work on Kubuntu 23.04. I really hope Valve don't roll this into stable without fixing up that issue. There's various reports on their <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/SteamVR-for-Linux/issues" target="_blank">GitHub</a> with Linux users having it broken entirely.</p>

      <title>Slimbook reveals the new Fedora Slimbook Ultrabook</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In the market for a new light laptop? Slimbook teamed up with the Fedora crew to bring out the new Fedora Slimbook Ultrabook.</p>
<p>The Slimbook team say it is optimized to give a smooth out-of-the-box experience. Fully tested with a standard Fedora Workstation install, with a Fedora logo on the back of the lid and on the "super key" so no silly Windows logo. When you buy the Fedora Slimbook Ultrabook, 3% of the revenue goes directly back to the GNOME Foundation, so your purchase will help further development.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6582840541697114009gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6582840541697114009gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Matthew Miller, Fedora Project Leader, Manager and Distinguished Engineer, Red Hat "Installing Linux distributions can be a daunting task and can stand in the way of individuals adopting open source software. The collaboration between Fedora Project and Slimbook has removed this hurdle by providing users with hardware featuring pre-installed Fedora software. Red Hat is excited to see open source communities and hardware vendors working together to make open source software more accessible."</p>

      <title>Welcome to opposite land where Microsoft has a Linux install tutorial</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I think I'm going to need more coffee to process this. Did I wake up in opposite land? Microsoft actually genuinely have a tutorial up on how to install Linux.</p>
<p>This isn't actually all that odd, considering Microsoft have the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) but the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linux/install" target="_blank">actual tutorial</a> isn't just about that although it does come first in their list (because of course it does). However, it also has instructions on using it inside a traditional Virtual Machine and how to install it bare metal on a machine directly and even talks about dual boots. The tutorial isn't even half-bad, pretty reasonable actually.</p>
<p>Really the Microsoft of today is in many ways nothing like the Microsoft of old, although they do still do many questionable things getting into a list of that is not the point of this article.</p>
<p>Just kind of amazing to see how much of a turn-around Microsoft has had overall. There's the famous line from previous CEO Steve Ballmer saying that "Linux is a cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches" back in 2001 to the "<a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/windowsserver/2015/05/06/microsoft-loves-linux/" target="_blank">Microsoft Loves Linux</a>" developer post in 2015. We've seen Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/microsoft-upgrades-xbox-cloud-gaming-for-linux-and-chromeos/" target="_blank">call out upgrades</a> to their Xbox Cloud Gaming for Linux and macOS, they <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/microsoft-chucks-gnome-10000-from-their-foss-fund/" target="_blank">regularly give out money to FOSS</a> projects like GNOME, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/microsoft-edge-available-officially-for-linux-today-as-a-stable-browser/" target="_blank">supporting their Edge browser directly on Linux</a>, Microsoft also <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2018/10/embrace-extend-and-protect-microsoft-joins-the-open-invention-network-to-protect-linux-and-open-source/" target="_blank">joined the Open Invention Network</a> and lots more making Microsoft seem a lot more open.</p>
<p><em>With Windows 10 coming to end of support in October 14, 2025 and the free upgrade path from older Windows is now actually <a href="https://devicepartner.microsoft.com/en-us/communications/comm-windows-ends-installation-path-for-free-windows-7-8-upgrade" target="_blank">finally</a> closed too maybe more people might actually need a free operating system.</em></p>

      <title>Crusader Kings III: Legacy of Persia releases November 9</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The next little expansion for Crusader Kings III with Crusader Kings III: Legacy of Persia has been announced by Paradox Interactive for release on November 9th.</p>
<p>"Inspired by the historical Anarchy of Samarra, Legacy of Persia uses the Struggle System to provide a new setting and new rulesets for the Iranian Intermezzo - a conflict that tests personal, cultural and religious loyalties. Establish your own new dynasty in this cradle of empires - ending Arab domination over Persia, or steer the Caliphate through the crisis, strengthening the power of Baghdad." — Paradox</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kwKbVALjXpE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bc3ad834b805acf1d997e8fd5a17d4b6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kwKbVALjXpE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features it will add in:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>The Iranian Intermezzo: The Abbasid Caliphate is on the decline, and strong-willed Iranian rulers are set upon independence and a new future for the region. Will you forge a new Empire, subjugate the faltering Caliphate for your own benefit, or see a resurgent Caliphate bring order to the region?</li>
<li>More Historical Flavor: New decisions, interactions and buildings for rulers in the Persian region, as well as special content highlighting the importance of clan leadership and protecting the frontier regions.</li>
<li>Changes to Iranian Cultures: New Iranian traditions include innovative Court Scholars, unique Men-at-Arms, and powerful new buildings to bring riches out of barren lands.</li>
<li>New Art and Music: Persian characters get new clothing, Persian buildings get a redesign and the UI can take on a more Iranian appearance in this Flavor Pack. There are also 8 new music tracks, some cued to events and some to set the mood.</li>
</ul>
<p>Will you be picking it up? Crusader Kings III remains as one of the more popular Paradox releases, with it regularly seeing around a 15,000 peak player count each day on Steam.</p>
<p>Paradox said this DLC will be the final piece of the Crusader Kings III Chapter II Pass, which also includes the Tours &amp; Tournaments expansion and the Wards &amp; Wardens event pack.</p>
<p>You can buy Crusader Kings III from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/crusader-kings-iii?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158310/Crusader_Kings_III/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Raspberry Pi OS upgraded based on Debian 12 &#39;Bookworm&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Along with the newer <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/raspberry-pi-5-announced-still-tiny-much-more-powerful/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi 5</a>, there's also now the release of the latest upgraded version of the Raspberry Pi OS based on Debian 12 'Bookworm' giving you a big bump to various software included. While the main OS upgrade won't affect too much, there's a lot of other changes inside this Raspberry Pi OS release to be aware of that their team has been working on to see their debut in this release.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6113267871697032558gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6113267871697032558gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the big changes includes the move to using Wayland with <a href="https://wayfire.org/" target="_blank">Wayfire</a>, which should look mostly the same but the tech under the hood is completely different. With this they also added a small amount of eye-candy like window shadows, window open / close animations and more. There's also the Power plugin enabled by default, along with a new GPU plugin similar to the existing CPU plugin to show system load but that's not on by default.</p>
<p>PulseAudio has been replaced with the newer PipeWire, NetworkManager as the default which brings more functionality like finding hidden wireless networks, VPN support and more. You'll also get a a "Raspberry Pi-optimised" version of Mozilla Firefox, that brings with it enabled V4L2 codec support for better video performance, support for Widevine DRM for video streaming services and work on enabling cameras for video calling.</p>
<p>Sounds like a rather nice upgrade!</p>

      <title>Intel announce and launched the Arc A580 GPU</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A surprise from yesterday (October 10th), Intel announced and made immediately available the Intel Arc A580 desktop graphics. Filling up their hardware roster it slots into the middle of their offerings targetting 1080p gaming.</p>
<p>Here's how they currently stack up:</p>

<p>While those are the reference specs, cards will be available from partners including ASRock, GUNNIR and Sparkle and all three of them are putting out over-clocked versions where they're clocked at 2000 MHz. Pricing starts at $179.</p>
<p>I'm hopeful we will continue to see Intel push their GPU division, as we definitely need more vendors to keep AMD and NVIDIA on their toes. More competition is better for consumers and will keep all vendors pushing forward.</p>

<p>The game is loved by many with an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam from over 50,000 players. It's ranked 77 on the <a href="https://steam250.com/top250" target="_blank">list</a> of the best-reviewed games of all time on Steam, so it truly is one not to be missed. It was even the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/top-steam-deck-games-for-july-2023-dave-the-diver-number-1/" target="_blank">number 1 most played game on Steam Deck</a> back in July.</p>

<p>Listen to their recent dev diary for more about the behind the scenes work on it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="YJ35cAhUShg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5251a7e2137a28c166774e4ba8363d54.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/YJ35cAhUShg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>DAVE THE DIVER is Steam Deck Verified and works great on Linux with a Platinum rating on ProtonDB.</p>
<p>There was a little bit of a blowback recently though, as the <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/goldenjoystickawards/" target="_blank">Golden Joystick Awards</a> for 2023 has DAVE THE DIVER listed as an option for voting in the "Best Indie Game" award. The thing is, a lot of people seem to think it's an indie game, but it's not. The developer, MINTROCKET, is a sub-brand of NEXON a pretty big South Korean video game publisher. So it may "look indie" but it's far from it. What does "indie" even mean nowadays?</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1868140/DAVE_THE_DIVER/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Mining and base defense game Dome Keeper got a huge upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dome Keeper was already pretty great. Giving you a mixture of mining, exploration, base-building and tower defense and now it's quite a lot bigger with a free update out now.</p>
<p>The Double Dome Update was launched on October 5th adding in two entirely new dome types with different armaments, and a new Dome Supplements system that changes how you do upgrades to make it a lot more interesting across all dome types. Have a look at their new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_z4HEQMgzQM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e510f75fb71b76f3d3cdfa3c20a7d783.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_z4HEQMgzQM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of the new content includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added Artillery Dome.</li>
<li>Added Tesla Dome.</li>
<li>Added custom sprites for all primary gadgets per dome.</li>
<li>Replaced cobalt branches in dome tech trees with a new system, the dome supplements.</li>
<li>Added a new chamber type, the power core chambers. Retrieve the core inside to receive a supplement.</li>
<li>Added 6 dome supplements.</li>
<li>Added run modifier that lets you get 3 dome supplements instead of only one.</li>
<li>Added "mine view", where you can watch the mine you dug out after finishing a run and even show the resources you missed.</li>
<li>Added run modifier that lets you play completely without monsters.</li>
<li>Added classic "Dome Romantik" palette (orange, blue, purple).</li>
</ul>
<p>Dome Keeper has Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified. Seems the update has pulled in a lot more players too, with the player-count jump from around 200 to over 2,000 so that's nice to see for the developer. It's currently rated<br/>
Very Positive on Steam from over 7,000 user reviews.</p>
<p>You can pick it up on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1637320/Dome_Keeper/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a> with the <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/dome_keeper?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> version only being for Windows.</p>

      <title>Valve dropped Counter-Strike 2 support on macOS and older hardware</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the release of Counter-Strike 2, it seems Valve are continuing to move away from macOS support <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/05/valve-drops-support-for-steamvr-on-macos-to-focus-on-linux-windows/" target="_blank">just like they did with SteamVR</a>. Thankfully, Valve are still investing in Linux and CS2 is supported on Linux.</p>
<p>It was a little odd to see the Steam page remove mentions of macOS when CS2 launched, and now it has been confirmed via their <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/73EF-08A3-0935-6369" target="_blank">support post</a> that older hardware and macOS support is ending. As they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As technology advances, we have made the difficult decision to discontinue support for older hardware, including DirectX 9 and 32-bit operating systems. Similarly, we will no longer support macOS. Combined, these represented less than one percent of active CS:GO players.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Counter-Strike 2 will exclusively support 64-bit Windows and Linux.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not really <em>that</em> surprising is it? Apple does make things more difficult with the Metal graphics API and their newer processors, and since as Valve said the player-base really was tiny Valve's time is better spent elsewhere. Does make me curious on what the Linux player count is though, but Valve aren't likely to drop Linux considering their continued investments across Steam Deck, SteamOS, Proton, graphics drivers, Linux kernel work and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11466000401697023659gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11466000401697023659gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>They're also offering refunds on the Prime Status upgrade if the purchase was made between the announcement of the Counter-Strike 2 Limited Test (March 22, 2023) and the launch of Counter-Strike 2 (September 27, 2023) if you're affected by it up until December 1st, 2023. Valve put up a legacy CS:GO version for now but support for that will end January 1st, 2024.</p>
<p><em>Perhaps some macOS users may want to give Linux a try…</em></p>

      <title>Valve investigating Forza Motorsport issues on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Forza Motorsport just launched and sadly it appears that it does not currently run on Steam Deck / Linux with Proton, but Valve are looking into it.</p>
<p>This entry in the series comes from Turn 10 with Xbox Game Studios publishing and it seems something about the tech behind it is causing problems with Valve's Proton compatibility layer. In reply to a user on social network X mentioning it not working, Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1711498463559798944" target="_blank">mentioned</a> "It doesn't work in Proton, we are looking into it."</p>
<p>Sadly, it seems Forza Horizon 5 was also updated, and this has also now been broken so we're seeing a bit of a double whammy on compatibility issues with these racing games now.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16000412361697023207gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16000412361697023207gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>While Valve may be able to find the cause of the issues in Proton, it may also require the game developer to do some tweaks on their end, so hopefully Valve will be able to speak to Turn 10 / Xbox Game Studios on the issues. In the past we've seen Xbox Game Studios <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/xbox-game-studios-talk-more-of-their-titles-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">talk-up their titles</a> running on Steam Deck so it would be a shame to see these left broken.</p>

<p>The latest DLC for Placid Plastic Duck Simulator, "<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1999360/view/3730726309750758508" target="_blank">So Many Ducks</a>", made a splash on October 5th, adding 27 new collectible ducks to the breakout hit rubber-duck sim.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with the game, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1999360/Placid_Plastic_Duck_Simulator/" target="_blank">Placid Plastic Duck Simulator</a> (billed as "the ultimate high-tech rubber duck simulation") was released in June of 2022 and is exactly what its name suggests - toy ducks with various designs drop into a swimming pool, and then you get to relax and simply watch them float around and interact with their environment and each other, with the only inputs being for camera controls and making the ducks quack. It's <em>oddly</em> compelling for a completely passive game, and quickly became quite popular with over 9,000 user reviews and an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam.</p>

<p>Official description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ultimate high-tech rubber duck simulation, Placid Plastic Duck brings you dangerous levels of relaxation. With chill music, dreamy 3D graphics, and many different happy ducks, your only priority is to float around. Zero Ducks given.</p>
<p>A relaxing 3D environment where you experience life as a rubber duck, <strong>Placid Plastic Duck Simulator</strong> is an experiment to induce calm and bliss. You're up for a reinvigorating stay at your favorite seaside pool.</p>
<p>You are not alone. Different ducks will slowly and happily fall into the pool with you, each with their own style and demeanor.</p>
<p>Float on the water, sunbathe, dip your beak, go down the slide. The radio is playing a nostalgic tune.<br/>
Here comes the night. Look at the stars. Turn off the radio, listen to the waves in the dark. Dream.<br/>
The sun is rising. The sky is blue. Slide down into the second pool.<br/>
An airplane is rushing somewhere, there's stuff to do.<br/>
Not for you.</p>
<p>Live in the present moment, enjoy life.</p>
<p>Everything is going to be alright.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The game runs perfectly under Proton (Platinum on ProtonDB), and is rated Steam Deck Playable due to some occasional small text and non-Deck controller glyphs, and a need to manually pop up the on-screen keyboard in order to name your ducks.</p>

      <title>Open 3D Engine (O3DE) 23.10 open source game engine released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Open 3D Engine (O3DE) has a big new release out, which includes plenty of new features and fixes for game developers looking to use this free and open source game engine.</p>
<p>It has pretty wide industry support with backers including Amazon AWS, Epic Games, Huawei, Intel, Microsoft, oppo, Heroic Labs, Red Hat and plenty more. O3DE is based upon Amazon Lumberyard (itself based on CryEngine), which AWS contributed that's now under the Linux Foundation banner.</p>
<p>Some of what's new in O3DE 23.10 includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the O3DE 23.10 Release comes several workflow enhancements, including unprecedented automations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Employ prefab overrides to change the details of objects (a car or house, for example) without having to create a new object</li>
<li>Use script canvas for small graph nodes to handle simple arithmetic operations</li>
<li>The document property editor allows tools creators to use data to create their UX rather than having to write the code or understand QT and filtering</li>
<li>Easily and quickly publish content without the command line using automation improvements for installation</li>
</ul>
<p>This newest release introduces a variety of visual and performance improvements to the rendering system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better memory support: Vulkan Memory Allocator (VMA) support and DirectX Memory Allocator (DX12MA)</li>
<li>Mesh instancing</li>
<li>Mobile shader performance improvement</li>
<li>Framework for multi-GPU support </li>
<li>Addition of raytracing reflections</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally they mentioned there's improvements in the export ability for projects built with O3DE in Windows, Linux, Linux Server and iOS, along with build fixes for all platforms, including Windows, Linux and iOS.</p>
<p>Curiously, in their release blog post they included a quote from Lars Gleim a Senior Research Engineer at Huawei who said that O3DE is "the only really open game engine out there, and it’s the only fully open source, royalty-free solution that exists at this time". You'll have to forgive me if I act a little surprised here but…what? It's just not even remotely true. There's quite a few completely free and open source game engines out there. Seems a little shady to include that quote when I'm sure the people involved know it's not true. Their <a href="https://o3de.org/showcase/" target="_blank">showcase page</a> is incredibly bare too.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: they removed the quote mentioned above, with no mention of the post being edited.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://o3de.org/o3de-2310-release-blog/" target="_blank">release blog post</a> for more and full <a href="https://github.com/o3de/sig-release/issues/252" target="_blank">release notes here</a>.</p>

      <title>After over 80 weeks the Steam Deck leaves the top 10 global sellers on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>At one point it seemed like there was just no stopping the Steam Deck but now it seems after being available for 1 year and around 8 months or so, the Steam Deck has started to move down the top sellers on Steam.</p>
<p>That was one heck of a run though right? Going over Valve's own Weekly Top Sellers list from the Steam Deck release up until the week of "Tue, September 26, 2023 - Tue, October 3, 2023", the Steam Deck was always globally in the top 10, where in that week it hit 11th place and the following week "Tue, October 3, 2023 - Tue, October 10, 2023" it hit 15th place. So that's around 83 weeks in the top 10 <em>globally</em>.</p>
<p>Keep in mind Valve's top seller list is by revenue, not units sold. Quite a number of those weeks (around 22) the Steam Deck was even in the number 1 spot globally. Coming up against games that were repeatedly selling in the multiple hundreds of thousands, and in many cases millions, that's a lot of Linux-powered Steam Decks going out into the hands of gamers.</p>
<p>That's only globally though, when going to different regions, the Steam Deck is still in the top 10 for some, but the opposite is also true, in some regions it's also much lower.</p>
<p>Given that handheld PC gaming is still quite a niche overall, with a <em>lot </em>more competition now from other vendors and with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/we-may-see-a-steam-deck-refresh-with-wifi-6e/" target="_blank">rumours swirling of an upcoming refresh</a>, it's perhaps not surprising to finally see it start to slide down a little.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck only continues to mature and get better over time too, with lots and lots of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> updates improving game compatibility and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/steam-deck-os-35-now-in-preview-with-hdr-vrr-and-display-colour-settings/" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.5 now in Preview</a>, there's still constant excitement for the Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>PAC-MAN Mega Tunnel Battle: Chomp Champs heads to Steam in 2024</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Finally! PAC-MAN Mega Tunnel Battle was a lot of fun back when it originally released in 2020, sadly it was exclusive to Google's shuttered cloud gaming service Stadia but a proper cross-platform release is coming in early 2024. Similar also to Pac-Man 99, which was Nintendo Switch exclusive that's also been shut down.</p>
<p>"PAC-MAN Mega Tunnel Battle: Chomp Champs is an online-only PAC-MAN eating competition! Eat your way through multiple interconnected mazes using Power Pellets and a variety of Power Items to chomp the GHOSTS and opponent PAC-MAN players! Be the last PAC standing at the end of each match in this 64-player Battle Royale to be the Chomp Champ!"</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QTVduE2KEjM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ea423bb676a7519904e2988a5a44885c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QTVduE2KEjM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This is a fully online Battle Royale, so no single-player.</p>
<p>Likely no Native Linux support but unless something weird happens, it will no doubt work in Valve's Proton. I'm just excited to see a proper release for it. I fully expect it to work well on Steam Deck too, as long as you have internet connected of course. Could be a good one to play in bed for a few rounds, so I'll be checking it out at release for sure.</p>

      <title>Mini monster-catching MMO &#39;Familiars.io&#39; heads to Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Familiars.io is a very retro-styled mini-MMO about catching monsters and battling, and it's now heading to Steam. It's completely free to play, with the developer noting they don't need funding for it they just want more people to give it a try as they do it for fun.</p>
<p>"It's a compact monster-catching fest in an online multiplayer world. It also has some optional hard stuff for people who like a challenge." — Clay Loam</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yL9HsKAMX0w"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/151e03f2aa24872ecb3b011f2c8d7c01.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yL9HsKAMX0w" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it from the developer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What's it like to play?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 battle = 1 levelup, and the max level is 15. I don't want to waste your time with rpg grinding</li>
<li>with only 20 Familiars in the game, you can max-out and understand all the familiars in the game within a few hours</li>
<li>... and then you're ready for the hard stuff</li>
<li>find hidden portals to other dimensions, where you must manage your familiars' HP and your potion supply in a slew of battles against fairly smart CPU opponents</li>
<li>or, if you want, fight other players you meet in the world to test your mettle</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What else is there to like?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>it's extremely easy to pick up, play a bit, and put down</li>
<li>the only way to communicate with other players is by pressing the "howdy" button repeatedly, or running around in circles</li>
<li>I think the soundtrack is pretty nice</li>
<li>it's free btw</li>
</ul>

      <title>Unity CEO John Riccitiello is leaving &#39;effective immediately&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Unity has <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231009494331/en/Unity-Announces-Leadership-Transition" target="_blank">announced</a> that President, Chief Executive Officer, Chairman and a member of the Company’s Board of Directors - John Riccitiello, is leaving "effective immediately". This follows on from the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-announced-big-changes-following-the-hated-runtime-fee/" target="_blank">ridiculous pricing changes</a> Unity tried recently, with the press release making no mention of it at all.</p>
<p>Riccitiello is no stranger to controversy who said some developers were "some of the biggest fucking idiots" in an interview with <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/interview/79190/unity-ironsource-john-riccitiello-marc-whitten-merger/" target="_blank">Pocket Gamer</a>. Riccitiello was also EA CEO when they first launched loot boxes in FIFA 09, and even went as far as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZR6-u8OIJTE" target="_blank">suggesting</a> gamers would pay to reload their weapons in games like Battlefield. No doubt many will be happy to see Riccitiello leave. From the press release:</p>
<p>“It’s been a privilege to lead Unity for nearly a decade and serve our employees, customers, developers and partners, all of whom have been instrumental to the Company’s growth,” Mr. Riccitiello said. “I look forward to supporting Unity through this transition and following the Company’s future success.”</p>
<p>Perhaps under new leadership, Unity can begin to fix up their image.</p>
<p>James M. Whitehurst has been appointed Interim Chief Executive Officer, President and a member of the Board while the search process begins to find a new permanent CEO. Whitehurst was previously CEO at Red Hat and later President at IBM. Statement from the press release:</p>
<p>“I am honored to join Unity as Interim CEO and President at this important time in its evolution,” Mr. Whitehurst said. “With the Company’s experienced leadership and passionate employees, I am confident that Unity is well-positioned to continue enhancing its platform, strengthening its community of customers, developers and partners, and focusing on its growth and profitability goals. I look forward to working closely with the Board and our talented global team to execute on our strategy, and I anticipate a seamless transition.”</p>

      <title>Humble removing the Humble Games Collection from Humble Choice</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some more changes are on the way for <a href="https://humblebundle.com/choice?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Choice</a>, the monthly curated game bundle from Humble Bundle as they will be removing the Humble Games Collection.</p>
<p>For a brief bit of history: previously Humble Choice (originally called Humble Monthly) had multiple tiers of games to select to keep each month depending on what you paid, along with an ever-growing collection of DRM free games in the Humble Trove. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/humble-bundle-decides-you-need-another-launcher-for-parts-of-humble-choice/" target="_blank">Back in February last year</a>, they made Humble Choice one single tier for less confusion <em>but</em> then also announced a Windows-only launcher. This launcher would contain the newly announced Humble Games Collection (games they published directly) along with renaming Humble Trove to the Vault which would also only be available in their app.</p>
<p>Now they're removing the Humble Games Collection, which gradually had games removed from it until there was only 2 left. From the email they sent out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Humble Choice member,</p>
<p>Starting next month on November 7, we’ll be retiring the Humble Games Collection membership perk. On that day, you’ll no longer be able to access games from the Collection through the Humble desktop app for Windows PC, though you will still be able to access the DRM-free titles available in the Vault.</p>
<p>We’re regularly evaluating our offerings in light of the ever-evolving landscape of gaming and what matters most to our Choice members.</p>
<p>Going forward we’ll be continuing to focus on curating great games that are yours to own, offering you exclusive Humble Store discounts, seeking out unique special offers we think you’ll enjoy, and looking for ways to bring Choice members the best entertainment value we can.</p>
<p> –The Humble team</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also noted in <a href="https://support.humblebundle.com/hc/en-us/articles/115008249667-Humble-Choice-Perk-Humble-app-and-Humble-Games-Collection" target="_blank">their FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>No surprise then, that they recently did a <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/awesome-indies-from-humble-games?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Games Bundle</a> with stuff they publish. It makes business sense when you think about it. What are people more likely to do - use their Windows-only launcher that's easily forgotten about? Or buy their games in main bundles? The games make a bigger splash as part of a proper bundle, not as something buried as part of Humble Choice inside a forced app that hardly anyone will use.</p>
<p>Confused? In short:</p>
<ul>
<li>Humble Choice monthly game picks continues as normal done via the web directly.</li>
<li>DRM free games in the Vault via their Windows app continues as normal.</li>
<li>No more Humble Games Collection as part of Humble Choice.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I give it a year before they entirely retire their Windows app and just stick to the main monthly subscription.</em></p>

      <title>Steam Next Fest - October 2023 Edition is live now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another chance to check out lots of games and fill up your wishlists, and Steam Next Fest - October 2023 Edition is live now. You know how this goes — for a limited time there will be tons of free demos from developers all over the world on Steam to test before they launch, plus developer chats and livestreams.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zQLCg46Q8nY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6c0a64f4969657a1c3d2de7cebdf099b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zQLCg46Q8nY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's a fun event, but it can be quite overwhelming with major FOMO but thankfully you have a good while as the event lasts until October 16 at 5PM UTC. Many games often leave their demos up for a few days or weeks after but that's never certain.</p>
<p>Some of the quick-pick games that I think you should check out include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2321470/Deep_Rock_Galactic_Survivor/" target="_blank">Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1684350/The_Thaumaturge/" target="_blank">The Thaumaturge</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2144740/Ghostrunner_2/" target="_blank">Ghostrunner 2</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/983870/FOUNDRY/" target="_blank">FOUNDRY</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/835960/The_Talos_Principle_2/" target="_blank">The Talos Principle 2</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/763180/Anima_Flux/" target="_blank">Anima Flux</a> (Native Linux)</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2186360/IDUN/" target="_blank">IDUN</a> (Native Linux)</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2452650/Hell_Throne/" target="_blank">Hell Throne</a> (Native Linux)</li>
</ul>
<p>With plenty of filtering options on the event page, you're bound to find <em>something</em> that interests you. I will also admit my immense surprise, that when filtering to just Linux that in the top 5 most wishlisted games is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1853830/A_Shot_in_the_Dark/" target="_blank">A Shot in the Dark</a> (<strong>NSFW</strong>), which looks like hardcore porn gamified into a visual novel style experience (you may see the list differently based on filters). Just goes to show what kind of content can be found on Steam nowadays. A little something for <em>everyone</em> it seems.</p>
<p>This is also one of the best things to happen in recent years, a proper digital event that's easily accessible by the masses.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest" target="_blank">full Next Fest even here</a>.</p>
<p>Be sure to come back and comment with what you find that's fun to try out.</p>

      <title>A live-action Cyberpunk 2077 project is under way from Anonymous Content</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>CD PROJEKT RED announced recently that they've teamed up with Anonymous Content, to develop a live-action project set in the Cyberpunk 2077 universe. Given the success of the Cyberpunk: Edgerunners anime, it's not exactly surprising to see them continue to expand the media. If you haven't watched Edgerunners you probably should, it's really good!</p>
<p>Anonymous Content worked on the likes of True Detective, Mr. Robot, The Revenant and Spotlight. From the press release it noted that "CD PROJEKT RED is working directly with Anonymous Content Studios’ Head of Television Garret Kemble, Director of Development Ryan Schwartz, and Chief Creative Officer David Levine, an industry veteran who was previously HBO’s EVP and Co-Head of Drama for over 10 years, where he oversaw production of series such as True Detective, Westworld, and True Blood. He was also involved in the production of the early seasons of the Game of Thrones".</p>
<p>This new live-action Cyberpunk 2077 project is in the "early development stage" and they've not found a screenwriter yet, so don't expect it to arrive any time soon. It will tell a brand-new story so it's not just going to be the game made into live-action.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk itself didn't start with the Cyberpunk 2077 video game, it was originally a tabletop RPG from Mike Pondsmith. Another board game is also on the way with Cyberpunk 2077: Gangs of Night City, which had a successful <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cmon/cyberpunk-2077-gangs-of-night-city/description" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> back in July 2022.</p>
<p>Are you looking forward to seeing a live-action Cyberpunk 2077?</p>

      <title>Need a new Steam Deck game? Here&#39;s 10 recent Verified titles</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Looking for your next game to pick up on Steam Deck? Valve continues to put hundreds of games through Deck Verified so here's some recent highlights of games that are now Verified. Being Deck Verified means they should just work out of the box, with good performance and everything works as expected.</p>
<p>Some games have been given their first rating, while others have been bumped up from Unsupported or Playable thanks to either <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> updates or game updates. Going over the list of what's been going through verification over the last few weeks here's my suggestions.</p>

      <title>Real-time strategy game Dinolords has you defend against Danes riding Dinosaurs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Featuring a mixture of real-time strategy, city-building, resource gathering and… medieval dinosaurs. Well then, that's definitely a unique mixture and Dinolords went right into my wishlist. Coming from developer Northplay and Ghost Ship Publishing it ticks a lot of the right weird boxes for me.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="58R4f9tN3aE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/abb7aaf74f4241612d9c2acd878895a4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/58R4f9tN3aE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As you take command, you'll gather resources, hunt and tame the land. You'll use your resources to build a thriving settlement, attracting villagers and automating resource gathering and production. You'll construct and upgrade specialist buildings that'll keep your growing population happy and ready to be trained and enlisted in your army.<br/>
Man the ramparts</p>
<p>Construct fortifications and man the ramparts as the enemy attacks with an arsenal of fierce dinosaurs. A shocking new age in medieval warfare. Participate in these battles with strategic commands to your troops and keep your own sword and bow ready. Dinolords merges the strategy of RTS with the immersion of an Action RPG in a brew that's both nostalgic and entirely new.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A modern genre hybrid with a player controlled protagonist in a realtime strategy setting</li>
<li>Gather resources, automate, refine and craft goods and weapons</li>
<li>Build a medieval city with housing, production and specialist buildings</li>
<li>Build impressive fortifications with a modular castle system</li>
<li>Command units and participate in epic medieval battles</li>
<li>Dinosaurs!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Doesn't look like it will support Linux directly, but no doubt it will work with Proton so I'll be happily taking a look when it enters Early Access at some point. It looks too ridiculous to ignore! Can't wait to see some armored-up dinos smashing through my walls — hilarious.</p>

      <title>Trolley Delayma is a short, free and amusing puzzle game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Styled like the absolutely awesome <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/search-articles/?q=baba+is+you&amp;title_only=on" target="_blank">Baba Is You</a>, the short and free puzzler Trolley Delayma is out now and worth a go if you have 30 minutes to spare. Good for a Monday morning with a coffee to start your day.</p>
<p>Developed for the Ludum Dare 50 Game Jam, with a theme of "delay the inevitable". Here you're running around switching rail tracks to save people, save yourself and hopefully just delay the inevitable doom. It's a pretty clever little game with 20 levels to go through requiring some quick thinking and fast reactions to save everyone.</p>

<p>The developer also recently updated it with a fix for Steam Deck control issues. It also has a Native Linux version available.</p>

      <title>ATOM RPG Trudograd gets a Steam Deck and Gamepad upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The popular and positively rated turn-based post-apocalyptic roleplaying game ATOM RPG Trudograd has a big upgrade out now, making it much nicer for Steam Deck and Gamepad players.</p>
<p>What is it: Trudograd is a stand-alone story expansion to ATOM RPG - a turn-based roleplaying game set in post-apocalyptic Soviet Union. It is inspired by classic cRPG titles of the past, such as early Fallout, Wasteland and Baldur’s Gate series.</p>
<p>Nice to see more developers go back to older releases, as this originally launched in 2021. With the latest update they've added in:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A special interface with touch and gamepad support.</li>
<li>Deep optimization of game resource loading.</li>
<li>Optimized textures, shaders, objects, and materials.</li>
<li>Frame rate optimization.</li>
<li>Ability to achieve 60 + fps on Steam Deck.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently the game is only rated as Steam Deck Playable, as it will need to go through verification again on this latest version but it should bump it up to Verified.</p>

<p>Just before the weekend hit Valve released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3747615443050074785" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.4.11</a>, which brings with it the Firmware 116 update that was previously only in the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/steam-deck-os-35-now-in-preview-with-hdr-vrr-and-display-colour-settings/" target="_blank">in-preview SteamOS 3.5</a>. <em>Valve also seem to keep switching between calling it Steam Deck OS and SteamOS.</em></p>
<p>Here's what's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="bbcodes_Header3_KePJs BB_Header3 eventbbcodeparser_Header3_AX80F">Firmware 116</div>
<ul>
<li>Improved robustness of the Firmware Settings Reset chord (Volume Down + Quick-Access + Power) against some boot hang scenarios.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare issue that would set the processor TDP limit too low causing CPU and GPU frequencies to be stuck at 400 MHz and 200 MHz respectively.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue when the charging light would turn back on when plugged in for a while after fully charged.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixed an issue where power button presses could switch games to keyboard/mouse mode.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some nice improvements there, likely work to ensure the SteamOS 3.5 stable release rollout is smooth when it's ready.</p>
<p>On X (formerly Twitter), Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais also recently <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1711242052028207255" target="_blank">mentioned</a> "Flickering on-screen keyboard bug in launchers has been fixed and the update has been pushed."</p>

      <title>Moonring is a free Ultima-like RPG from the Fable co-creator</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a really fun one I came across recently - it's called Moonring, a retro-inspired open-world, turn-based, tile RPG in the style of the classic Ultima games with lots of modern touches from the co-creator of Fable, Dene Carter.</p>
<p>Plays great on Linux with the latest Proton 8. Click and play! Seems like a really good choice if you're stuck for something to play this weekend!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="KBakwSgyroU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2ba78c9467cbf9a6d2776d2ee043d3e4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/KBakwSgyroU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The Story: "Five hundred years ago, the land of Caldera was plunged into endless darkness. Decades later, five moons rose in the sky, bringing light to the world and strange Gods with it. With them came the Dreams: calls to Devotion promising supernatural Gifts.</p>
<p>Thus, the new Calderan civilisation was born; a world of Devotion and Dreamers, Gods and Gifts, with a Dreamless Archon acting as the Gods' mortal representative. But Archons are not eternal, and a successor must be found.</p>
<p>You are Dreamless: free to choose your own destiny, to ask questions others dare not, or even become Archon yourself.</p>
<p>What will you do, Dreamless one?"</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6220891691696605273gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6220891691696605273gol1.jpg"/></a>My character went a little bit insane…</em></p>
<p>Pretty wild that something this interesting is free. Would have quite happily paid for this. Getting quite a Caves of Qud kinda vibe from it. Retro but quite modern at the same time thanks to an easy to understand interface. Plus the setting and visuals are really great if you love the classic style of it.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Large, hand-designed open world.</li>
<li>An infinite supply of dungeons generated using your character name.</li>
<li>Over 100 varied enemy types, from fodder to bosses.</li>
<li>35 unique Gifts from the Gods, their usage changing with the moon phases.</li>
<li>Sailing, ship-to-ship combat and boarding.</li>
<li>A Dungeon Synth OST with over 50 tracks, all made using retro Mod Trackers!</li>
<li>A hidden magic system and many other mysteries.</li>
</ul>
<p>Available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2373630/Moonring/" target="_blank">free on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Shadows of the Afterland looks a bit Thimbleweed Park</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Looking a little like Thimbleweed Park from Terrible Toybox, the developer Aruma Studios recently announced Shadows of the Afterland, a supernatural comedy adventure about identity, courage and destiny. This is Aruma Studios' second game, with their first Intruder In Antiquonia released last year.</p>
<p>Sounds pretty wild too, could be a good one for adventure game fans: "You can’t remember your death; you haven’t even been born yet. In this point-and-click adventure, you'll switch between worlds and take possession of the living to unearth your haunting past. You'll have to confront sinister forces to find out if you are merely a pawn of fate or if you can change your own future."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QTxr7FQXTLg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/819a40f5267844954efe29702dc15365.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QTxr7FQXTLg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore a supernatural murder mystery, blending themes of identity, courage, and destiny with afterlife, reincarnation, and the connection between past and future lives.</li>
<li>Take command of various playable characters using unique possession mechanics.</li>
<li>Explore the intricate stories of eccentric afterlife spirits through meaningful conversations.</li>
<li>Tackle clever and logically sound puzzles intricately intertwined with the storyline. Wield magic, navigate between both realms, and employ possession mechanics to solve them.</li>
<li>Immerse yourself in meticulously crafted pixel art scenes and animations.</li>
<li>Experience an original soundtrack that enhances the game's haunting atmosphere.</li>
</ul>
<p>“We're thrilled to take players on this supernatural journey, where they'll have to confront their fears and make tough decisions about their destiny”, said Rubén López, who wrote the story. "We've poured our hearts into creating a hauntingly beautiful world, with meticulously crafted pixel art and a soundtrack that will send chills down your spine", said Silvia Izquierdo, who is in charge of production.</p>
<p>They also told me over email "Of course, the new game is also being developed on Linux, and will be available for Linux.".</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2506100/Shadows_of_the_Afterland/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Tony Hawk&#39;s Pro Skater 1+2 Gets A Steam Deck Badge and Proton Hotfix</title>
      <author>Smellbringer</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-shreds-on-steam-deck-but-with-two-massive-caveats/" target="_blank">recently dropped on Steam</a> this week and in our opinion it's an incredible game held back by two massive issues; an always online DRM and a bugged multiplayer on Deck and Linux. While the DRM is a feature, the broken multiplayer was an actual bug as Windows players could get online just fine while Steam Deck and Linux fans were left out in the cold.</p>
<p>Luckily, it seems Valve has <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1710091010595041306" target="_blank">listened</a> to the concerns of the community and dropped a Proton Hotfix for the game last night.  I can safely report that the multiplayer now works and you can access the games full online suite on Steam Deck. Sadly, this does not mean multiplayer for all other platforms is fixed. I was only able to test the PS5 version (thank you PS Plus) and it sadly still doesn't log in. So it appears fans on other platforms are stuck with the <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-unplayable-servers/" target="_blank">awful phone fix</a> I mentioned last time.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/46589331696577054gol15416.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/46589331696577054gol15416.jpg"/></a>Multiplayer Gameplay on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>If you are interested in picking THPS 1+2 up on Steam Deck, Valve has rated it as <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable now. The issues holding back full verification being the need to manually pull up the keyboard and hard to read text. It does also note singleplayer gameplay requires an active internet connection too. Maybe Activsion can fix those issues and earn a full verification badge. But given how they continue to ignore the server issue on other platforms even after a year, we shouldn't get our hopes up.</p>
<p>You can pick up Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2395210/Tony_Hawks_Pro_Skater_1__2/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>You can also check out Liam's video for more details and gameplay. Keep in mind that Liam made this before last night's Proton Hotfix though. So it's a tad outdated in that regard, but still worth checking out:</p>

      <title>Terra Nil gets better performance and Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Terra Nil, a building game about restoring nature just got upgraded with better performance they've now officially released their Native Linux and macOS versions too. I thoroughly loved the early builds of Terra Nil before they turned it into a full game, so I will at some point soon be checking it out and it seems the waiting on it has paid off with all the improvements.</p>

      <title>Retro shooter DUSK is getting a full free HD revamp</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Coming around the 5 year anniversary, DUSK HD is going to be a big full visual remaster of the very popular shooter so here's what they've said about it.</p>
<p>It's a free update that will update everything including enemies, weapons, all models, textures — everything they say will be improved. Around Halloween we can expect to get a trailer showcasing an on / off comparison, with a full launch along with their modding SDK and Steam Workshop support around the 5 year anniversary which would be December 10th.</p>
<p>The good news is that it will be entirely optional as the HD content will be available via the Steam Workshop as free downloads so you can keep it as it is if you prefer it. You'll be able to use the old or new HD assets for modding too and upload your own creations.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="80ZFMzXGo-k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/77ba5a7ba3caa6a4a3c8ad1619f6d3fe.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/80ZFMzXGo-k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

      <title>Swords of Freeport is a text-mode social RPG like retro MUDs and BBS door games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now this is certainly retro that slightly older readers might be interested in. Swords of Freeport is a new text-mode social RPG heavily inspired by the style of Bulletin Board System door games from back in the '90s.</p>
<p>The developer, Elissa Black, mentions they were inspired by classics like Legend of the Red Dragon. It is part MUD and part BBS Game, without the need for a BBS. While it is a single-player game it does have some social aspects like seeing other's progress via an in-game news board, you can chat using in-game message boards in taverns, you can see when others are logged in but there's no PvP - it's all for social reasons.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15516225061696512306gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15516225061696512306gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retro play once-a-day style mechanics</li>
<li>Three core starting professions with options for cross-skilling</li>
<li>A whole city and the countryside around it to explore!</li>
<li>Witty, smart humour throughout the game *</li>
<li>All 24 characters and many words of the English language are used to evoke the feeling of really being in a squalid Victorian-adjacent fantasy city!</li>
<li>Addictive turn-based gameplay which limits how much time you can sink into it</li>
<li>Look, it has the Bloatalope - you want to hunt a Bloatalope, don't you? **</li>
</ul>
<p>* This is subjective, of course. But my mum thinks it's funny.</p>
<p>** That'd be something to brag about to your friends. "Gary," you'd say. "You won't BELIEVE what I hunted last night in a text game I've been addicted to!" Gary would no doubt respond with, "My goodness, Charlene, don't tell me it's a BLOATALOPE you went hunting? That's very impressive. Let me buy you a coffee!"</p>

      <title>Dwarf Fortress fixes crashing on Linux, gets an Adventure Mode Roadmap</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news for Dwarf Fortress players on Steam, as a fresh update went out recently that should stop some crashing issues on Linux and there's a roadmap for the Adventure Mode to go through. If you missed it, the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/dwarf-fortress-on-steam-now-officially-available-for-linux/" target="_blank">Native Linux version was released recently</a>.</p>
<p>Firstly for the October 3rd <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/3753244909556346261" target="_blank">update</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">Major bug fixes</div>

</ul>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">Other bug fixes/tweaks</div>
<ul>
<li>Fixed potential problem with doctors vs. multiple hospitals</li>
<li>Ballista arrows etc. that chop down trees now count for treecap diplomacy</li>

<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3095254361696505624gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3095254361696505624gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>As for the Adventure Mode, from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/3753244942577557600" target="_blank">roadmap</a> it's still some ways off and they're hoping to have it out "not-too-late next year". With the new art style they're starting with the basics which will be:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Travel map - we have the world map, but sites need hundreds of sprites to match up with the ASCII that shows individual streets etc. We’ll be iterating on this until launch.</li>
<li>Main interface layout - similar to Fortress Mode, there are tile-based actions, information menus, and other actions like travel. There’s also a day-night cycle and we’ll have a minimap this time around.</li>
<li>Procedural portraits - we need to implement Carolyn’s great portraits for the humans/elves/dwarves/goblins/kobolds, and also get animal people displayed. Every animal person!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They said once they're down for the framework, they will work on supporting mouse and keyboard for all play styles. They say it will be quite challenging though, since there's so many ways people can interact with it from clicking around the play area, through buttons and hotkeys or via full lists. Several actions for each.</p>
<p>After that they also have to go through and implement a lot more like:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Inventory - equipping items and containers are the trickiest parts here. You can wear multiple shirts and nest containers as deep as you like, and the new interface will have to handle this with both keyboard and mouse support.</li>
<li>Combat (striking and wrestling) - wrestling will be a bit of a doozy, as there’s a lot of physical/anatomical complexity that we’re not sure how best to communicate</li>
<li>Conversations - this includes supporting the current Adventure Mode system of interleaving speech and actions, and having three or more participants in conversations</li>
<li>Character generator - you can make a whole party in Adventure Mode and the character creation options are complex. We have to update this system.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's more so read the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/3753244942577557600" target="_blank">roadmap</a> if you're interested. Work on the Fortress Mode also continues in parallel, as they're working on multiple big features of the game at the same time.</p>

      <title>Valve fix up more SteamVR 2.0 Beta issues</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After once again <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/steam-beta-and-vr-updated-its-now-safe-to-take-off-your-headset-valve/" target="_blank">making it safe to take off your headset</a>, Valve put up another SteamVR 2.0 Beta update focused on fixing up more problems and hopefully making it work better.</p>
<p>Here's the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/250820/view/3726222710133084160" target="_blank">latest changes</a> from October 4th:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">SteamVR:</div>
<ul>
<li>Show Multitasking View button on Desktop windows.</li>
<li>Fixed scaling issues with floating dashboard overlays.</li>
<li>Fix for SetSkyboxOverride always showing only the last texture.</li>
<li>Speed up initial load of all web views (settings, etc.)</li>
<li>Fix issues caused by running vrstartup from a different SteamVR install when SteamVR is already running.</li>
<li>Further laser pointer double-click refinements.</li>
<li>Laser pointer no longer jumps when you switch input devices.</li>
<li>Laser pointer is more consistent when dragging outside of overlays.</li>
<li>Typing emojis works in Desktop view.</li>
<li>Move Dashboard slightly further away.</li>
</ul>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">Linux:</div>
<ul>
<li>Fix new VR gamepad UI rendering with a flipped Y-axis.</li>
<li>Fix runtime configuration to launch in Steam Linux Runtime 3.0 (sniper), addressing startup issues on some systems.</li>
<li>Fix vrcompositor to launch under legacy scout runtime, addressing startup issues on some systems.</li>
<li>Fix SteamVR Home to launch under legacy scout runtime.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Sadly, their changes still don't seem to have solved SteamVR 2.0 Beta working for me, it just won't load up as noted in <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/SteamVR-for-Linux/issues/618" target="_blank">this bug report</a>. Hopefully Valve will find the cause of what's stopping it working on some Linux systems like mine, so I can actually go through full testing of it with my Index because otherwise it's an expensive paperweight right now.</p>
<p>Is it working for you? How have you been getting on with SteamVR 2.0 Beta? Let me know in the comments.</p>

      <title>We may see a Steam Deck refresh with WiFi 6E</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While we know that Valve have said repeatedly not to expect a faster Steam Deck 2 any time soon, it appears they may still be doing some kind of refreshed Steam Deck.</p>
<p>This isn't all that surprising though as Valve have been doing a number of tweaks to the internals of the Steam Deck since the original release. We've seen the different fans with one having that annoying high-pitched whine, different types of SSDs, and even <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/12oit67/pictures_of_new_steam_deck_motherboardthermal/" target="_blank">adjustments</a> to the internals.</p>
<p>Now as <a href="https://twitter.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1709643696302346305" target="_blank">noted</a> on X by Brad Lynch, Valve appears to have gone through approvals for a change to the WiFi chip inside the Steam Deck with one that supports WiFi 6E with Dual Band Simultaneous (DBS) and Bluetooth 5.2. Here's two of the images mentioned:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5892309961696502546gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5892309961696502546gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8514409701696502755gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8514409701696502755gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Various documents about this can be quite easily found via search engines, <a href="https://fcc.report/FCC-ID/XMR2023FC66EB" target="_blank">like this</a> that lists plenty including the first shot above taken from <a href="https://fcc.report/FCC-ID/XMR2023FC66EB/6729320.pdf" target="_blank">this document</a>.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what happens here. There's so many ways that Valve could refresh the Steam Deck, without changing the main performance profile with the APU that would be worth upgrading. Imagine a better WiFi chip, a better screen, better battery, updated thermals and more — so many areas Valve could improve on for a mid-gen refresh that would be worth picking up.</p>
<p>Eventually we should find out what <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/more-teasers-appear-for-upcoming-valve-hardware/" target="_blank">Galileo and Sephiroth</a> are that was leaked before. Perhaps it's related to this? What do you think Valve are doing?</p>

      <title>Diablo 4 is coming to Steam on October 17th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Not long after Overwatch 2 released on Steam, we now have Diablo 4 confirmed to be launching on Steam making it easier than ever to play on Steam Deck and desktop Linux. One less reason to boot up and configure Battle.net — hooray!</p>
<p>At least with it being on Steam, the install for Linux desktop and Steam Deck is about to get a whole lot easier. No more messing around with Battle.net directly, it will just be click and play on Steam thanks to Proton. If you're going to play it that is, because you're not still playing Baldur's Gate 3 right? Or Starfield? Or one of the many other interesting game launches this year.</p>
<p>What's surprising though is that Diablo 4 is coming to Steam only a few months after release.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13214677671696449047gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13214677671696449047gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Perhaps this might go a little better than the Overwatch 2 Steam release, which quickly (at the time) <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/overwatch-2-becomes-the-worst-user-reviewed-game-on-steam/" target="_blank">became the worst ever reviewed game on Valve's store</a>. OW2 briefly lost the crown, but it appears according to <a href="https://steam250.com/bottom100" target="_blank">Steam Top 250</a>, it is once again the #1 worst rated Steam game.</p>
<p>The Steam release for Diablo 4 will come at the same time as the Season of Blood update, with patch notes coming on October 10th ahead of the October 17th release on Steam.</p>
<p>Blizzard confirmed on Steam it will have Steam Achievements and integration with Steam Friends, so you can invite people directly to play. Doesn't seem like there's any chance of transferring to Steam if you purchased on Battle.net though, annoyingly.</p>
<p>You can see a previous video I did on Diablo 4 for Steam Deck below:</p>

      <title>EarthBound / Mother styled Dreamed Away has a new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Shown off during the recent "<a href="https://mother4ever.net/mother-direct/" target="_blank">Mother Direct</a>" event that pulled together various games in the spirit of EarthBound / Mother, a new fancy trailer for Dreamed Away appeared. Watch it quick before you wake up. In development by Nicolas Petton, with publishing help from Pineapple Works it will have Native Linux support at release made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>.</p>
<p>More about it: "Dreamed Away is a story-driven action-adventure RPG with dark elements set in France in the 90s. Play as Théo, a boy lost in a mysterious world. Explore a unique reality, duel against darkness and mind your choices."</p>
<p>It does away with turn-based menu-picking combat found in many other similar RPGs, and instead gives you a fast-paced mini-game system with each enemy having different variations of dodging and time-based mini-games of increasing complexity. You have no magic, no weapons and there's no random encounters - it's all about your skill.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="M_msYzID_7c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/54fe9e70c188a9876e65d8e77c060476.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/M_msYzID_7c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Since I last wrote directly about it the developer has put up a few upgrades to the demo that's available too that adds in a new title screen, new translations, improved combat balancing, lots of bug fixes, UI improvements, dialogue improvements and more.</p>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Immersive storytelling that takes you on a journey to solve Théo's dark and unsettling mystery.</li>
<li>Diverse setting: varied colors and environments that bring you from a vibrant, peaceful atmosphere to those dark and mysterious places.</li>
<li>Detailed and aesthetic pixel art setting that is worth exploring.</li>
<li>An original soundtrack by Nicolas Petton.</li>
<li>Unique skill-based combat system.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From what the developer explained previously about the inspiration for the story: Dreamed Away is more than just a game. It’s an intense reflection of the developer's own story, born at the same time as his second child. The game's world is built around the main character, Theo, and his bond with his sister Louise as well as his desire to find and reconnect with her. The story takes place in a cozy little village in Brittany, where the surroundings tell you a story about a safe, calm, and happy place. But mystery steps in. A darkness is encroaching. It's unsettled, shady. It's a game about a young boy questioning his sense of reality and sanity. While trapped alone in a world where he constantly faces his fears. Such an experience of internalizing doubts and fears is how the game was born.</p>

      <title>Check out the demo for Iron Roads, a train network transport sim</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cowleyfornia Studios who previously made Sarawak and We'll always have Paris are branching out from their adventure novel roots into a train management sim with Iron Roads. There's a new demo available and it will be released in 2024 with Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Inspired in parts by OpenTTD, Mini Metro, Two Point Hospital, Lets Build a Zoo and Opus Magnum - this husband and wife team are hoping you might find their latest idea interesting. After checking the demo, I can certainly see a hint of both OpenTTD and Mini Metro inside Iron Roads.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AyUBIn83E50"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0b9414cb87bb730ef0ede9f1aeb8ac58.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AyUBIn83E50" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Current Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transport passengers or cargo, earn money and complete tasks</li>
<li>Enjoy a minimalistic interface that is easy to learn, but that allows for many happy hours optimising and building your networks</li>
<li>Scenarios: handcrafted maps with geographical puzzles designed to stretch your network-building skills</li>
<li>Accept contracts: scenarios come with a grant system where you can follow focussed goals if you wish to earn extra money and get the satisfaction of ticking off a to-do list</li>
<li>Performance graphs: The main goal of Iron Roads is to optimise your network, so you may wish to use the charts to analyse data relating to your finances and passengers</li>
<li>Build large, complex networks. Or small-to-medium sized networks, if that's what floats your boat</li>
</ul>
<p>Planned to add:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sandbox mode: eventually you'll be able to generate random maps</li>
<li>Numerous scenarios: right now there are two scenarios and a tutorial in the demo. Iron Roads is being developed by only two developers, so while we’re working as hard as we can, please bear with us as we</li>
<li>Signals: Train orders such as one-way zones, non-stop zones, and waypoints replace traditional signals in Iron Roads. The idea is that you can do everything that signals can do, but without the steep learning curve</li>
</ul>

      <title>Farming sim with dinosaurs &#39;Paleo Pines&#39; is out now - Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Farming and dinosaurs, that's certainly an odd combination but Paleo Pines looks cute as heck and seems to be another nice title to add to your casual gaming collection. A sweet family-friendly game. The release comes with Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>More about it: "Set off on a lively adventure with your dino pal, Lucky, who you’ve known since she was just an egg. Is she the last of her kind? The other parasaurolophus are missing, and it's up to you and Lucky to uncover their whereabouts. Explore Paleo Pines, a charming island filled with friendly townsfolk and hidden corners. Build a new home, make friends, and unravel the island's lost history. Get ready for a journey filled with delightful discoveries alongside your trusty steed Lucky!"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qEafzEOzDB4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0f7e3a0b81e681bdc9b73c2e5f71964f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qEafzEOzDB4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It has gained a Very Positive rating on Steam so it seems most players are really enjoying it. Good to see more developers also ensuring good Linux support with Steam Deck Verified too! I'll admit that this one somehow flew under my radar, with the release on September 26th and it seems a lot of other skipped over it too with less than 400 user reviews so far.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1202200/Paleo_Pines/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>
