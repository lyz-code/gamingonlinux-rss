      <title>Wine 10.10 brings more Media Foundation work, Mono and Unicode updates</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wine 10.10 is the latest development release of the Windows compatibility layer, which is a big part of Valve's Proton.</p>
<p>For this release the main highlights are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Mono engine updated to version 10.1.0.</li>
<li>OSMesa library no longer needed.</li>
<li>More support for generating Windows Runtime metadata in WIDL.</li>
<li>Locale data updated to Unicode CLDR 47.</li>
<li>P010 format support in Media Foundation.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Bug fixes are noted for Rise of Nations, Braid, Steam, Horizon Chase, F.E.A.R, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly, Eador. Masters of the Broken World, StarCraft Remastered, The Fidelio Incident, Vampyr and more.</p>
<p>For Wine Mono 10.1.0 these are the changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The builtin FNA now uses SDL3. This shouldn't have any noticeable impact, but it does change how rendering backends are selected. FNA3D now has three options for backend: <code class="inline-code">FNA3D_FORCE_DRIVER=OpenGL</code>, <code class="inline-code">FNA3D_FORCE_DRIVER=D3D11</code>, and <code class="inline-code">FNA3D_FORCE_DRIVER=SDLGPU</code>. The SDL_GPU backend can be controlled with <code class="inline-code">SDL_GPU_DRIVER=vulkan</code> or <code class="inline-code">SDL_GPU_DRIVER=direct3d12</code>. The default under most circumstances should be SDL_GPU with Vulkan.</li>
<li>Added a stub <code class="inline-code">msbuild.exe</code>. (<a href="https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=57020" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">wine bug 17020</a>)</li>
<li>Added support for "Recycle Bin" to the VB.NET class libraries. (needed by DayZ tools)</li>
<li>Updates from Framework Mono:
	<ul>
<li>Fixed handling of IPv6 addresses in the Host header in System.Net.</li>
<li>Fixed build with cmake 4.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Upstream updates
	<ul>
<li>FNA updated to 25.04</li>
<li>llvm-mingw updated to 20250417</li>
<li>SDL updated to 3.2.10</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam Deck and SteamOS hit 20,000 playable games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve's rating system for Steam Deck and SteamOS seems to have sped up recently, with 20,000 games now rated at least playable. Previously they hit <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/steam-deck-steamos-hits-19000-games-rated-verified-and-playable/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">19,000 in May</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/steam-deck-hits-18000-games-playable-and-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">18,000 in March</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/steam-deck-hits-17000-games-playable-and-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">17,000 in November 2024</a>.</p>
<p>If a game is at least Playable on Steam Deck, it will also be compatible with SteamOS. The <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/valve-announce-steamos-compatibility-ratings-an-extension-of-steam-deck-verified-for-more-devices/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ratings for SteamOS are a bit different</a> to how it's done on Steam Deck with less being checked. The main point for the SteamOS rating is that the game will actually load up and be playable, but performance and features will depend on the specific device you have SteamOS on. Compared with SteamOS where performance is <em>supposed</em> to be checked along with full controller support, resolution and more.</p>
<p><strong>Games that were recently rated <img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified include:</strong></p>

<p>There have been issues with the ratings in the past. Overall though, the rating is just to show you what should be playable. People have pretty wildly different feelings on what is "playable" though. It's not a perfect system but even on traditional consoles games slip through that don't work well. Hopefully Valve will continue tweaking their tests over time to make them as accurate as possible.</p>
<p>Given the unique nature of Steam for Linux systems like Steam Deck / SteamOS, this is only counting games that have actually been tested. Many more will be playable.</p>

      <title>FBC: Firebreak from Remedy gets Steam Deck Verified ahead of release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>FBC: Firebreak from Remedy Entertainment arrives June 17 and it has been Steam Deck Verified ready to play on the go. Thanks to their work on it the game will be SteamOS playable on other devices too.</p>
<p>The rating isn't actually listed on the Steam page at time of writing, but the official account on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/remedygames.com/post/3lripdbngph2e" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> has confirmed they've received the Verified rating (developers get notice before the notice is published on store pages).</p>
<p>A new video has also been released to show case it running directly on a Steam Deck OLED that you can view below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="IgSQhXRX4R8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5e65e13eeb7bbf620b43a97e243956cf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/IgSQhXRX4R8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Dive into the Federal Bureau of Control’s (FBC) unpredictable and extradimensional headquarters during its darkest—and strangest—hours.

      <title>The Alters from 11 bit studios is out now and Steam Deck / SteamOS playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Alters is a brand new sci-fi game with a blend of survival, adventure, and base-building elements from 11 bit studios.</p>
<p>With the release now available, Valve have rated it Steam Deck and SteamOS Playable. For the Steam Deck, the only note is that it may have some text that's a bit too small but other than that it should run okay. Check out the launch trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="965Km7t6KwM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/363c3b32c727fb63b37c93538bb3a17a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/965Km7t6KwM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Alters is an ambitious sci-fi survival game with a unique twist. You play as Jan Dolski, the lone survivor of a crash-landed expedition on a hostile planet. To survive, you must form a new crew for your mobile base.</p>
<p>Using a substance called Rapidium, you create alternative versions of Jan - THE ALTERS - each one shaped by a different crucial decision from the protagonist’s past.</p>
<p>As you navigate through survival and moral dilemmas, you will explore a branching narrative filled with captivating character dynamics and challenging decisions. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>"With the team steadily growing, the pandemic reshaping the way we work, and all the usual challenges of game development, these past years have been both creatively rewarding and full of hurdles," says The Alters Game Director, Tomasz Kisilewicz. "But now, as we stand on the brink of release, I’m proud to say we’ve delivered a game that stays true to its original vision—thanks entirely to the determination and talent of our incredible development team. They brought The Alters to life, and we can’t wait for players to finally experience it."</p>
<p>I have to admit with the absolute barrage of announcements and releases over the last year, this one completely flew under my radar but it looks really good.</p>

      <title>Starship colony building sim Stardeus gets a free weekend and big sale</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Stardeus is a colony building sim set in space, where you build up your own spaceship to go off exploring and survive.</p>
<p>The developer just put it up for a Steam Free Weekend, so you can download and try the full game entirely free for a few days. If you decide you like it, the game is also on sale with a 50% discount until June 19th. That's the biggest discount it has had to date!</p>
<p>Competition is hot though, with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/rimworld-odyssey-will-bring-spaceship-building-exploration-and-a-lot-more-content/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">RimWorld - Odyssey just being announced</a> that does a very similar thing but there's still a lot of differences between them. <em>I guess this done mean I can't call it RimWorld in space anymore then.</em></p>
<p>Stardeus is much more expansive for the space side of things because that is its focus. Stardeus also added ship to ship combat in an update released <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/rimworld-in-space-colony-sim-stardeus-gets-a-major-upgrade-with-ship-combat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in May</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12149417871749821716gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The basics:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Build a Spaceship - In Stardeus you will build functional spaceships and space bases that will actually fly.</li>
<li>Establish a Colony - In addition to robotic workers that you control, there will be a human colony that you will have to take care of. Or will you?</li>
<li>Explore the Universe - Fly your spaceship and take your colony to the unknown depths of a vast procedurally generated Universe.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Check out the demo for Paris Transylvania, a pachinko roguelike deckbuilder</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another one with a good demo during Steam Next Fest is Paris Transylvania, a pachinko roguelike deckbuilder. The demo has Native Linux support (although it only shows a Windows icon) and the full game will launch with Linux support.</p>
<p>I have a feeling I'm going to be terribly hooked on this one. I absolutely love Peglin and it does give off a similar feeling but comes off quite unique with the deck-building and relic system. So it's a bit more like a combination of Peglin and Slay the Spire in a way and that's great. Being able to play your cards in any order is also an interesting twist, allowing to to plan ahead a little more for some fun combinations.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dynamic Deck Building</strong> - Create a unique deck by choosing cards wisely. Discover hundreds of cards to defeat wicked creatures and regain power.</li>
<li><strong>Pachinko-style Gameplay</strong> - Strategically hit pegs to power up your cards. Uncover game-changing relics throughout the world to enhance your deck.</li>
<li><strong>Ever-Changing Transylvania</strong> - Maps change with each journey. Choose paths, face different enemies, encounter random events, and confront various bosses.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking over email one of the team mentioned they would "love feedback and as a small 2 person team have limited options of game testing on Linux" and that they're "very happy to have Linux users in our community, and solved the first detected bugs fast".</p>

      <title>Nostalgic helicopter shooter Cleared Hot has funny physics and a demo worthy of your time</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you remember the days of Desert Strike or enjoy other more modern helicopter shooters, the demo for Cleared Hot is one for you. I talked about this a bit back in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/cleared-hot-looks-like-the-nostalgic-helicopter-shooter-i-need/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">October 2024</a> and there's now a demo in Steam Next Fest.</p>
<p>What makes this one especially fun is the physics system, as you get to be a bit creative in how you approach it. This actually made me laugh a lot more than I expected with what you can do. There's various objects you can pick up and then just throw across the screen, like enemy bodies. Shoot an enemy, flying over and pick up their body and then throw it at someone else. Hilarious. There's more practical uses though, like throwing a barrel of fuel or a tank on top of people and buildings and watching everything go up in flames.</p>
<p>The demo worked great with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xNuEEqz4aJk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/767b2846986df4955bace4e2948c008f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xNuEEqz4aJk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's a lot more than just the physics going for it though, it's incredibly satisfying even just using your main weapons. The sound they make is glorious as is the destruction you'll cause with it. Absolutely perfect twin-stick controls too, felt great with my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/the-8bitdo-ultimate-2-wireless-controller-is-a-top-premium-feeling-controller/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">8BitDo Ultimate 2 Wireless</a>. At least from the demo, it feels like everything I wanted in a modern version of Desert Strike.</p>
<p>Once you get past the first mission though, the game becomes something a fair bit more than your standard fly around and shoot all the enemies type of shooter. The story with the level system is interesting, which again makes some nice and often hilarious use of the physics system. I won't give it away, but there's chickens involved.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12432612261749820020gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12432612261749820020gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19086714721749820021gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19086714721749820021gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Game Highlights</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fully physics-based action</strong> - Unleash your creativity with physics-powered gameplay! Launch enemies sky-high with rocket blasts or swing rocks into their faces</li>
<li>using your trusty rope!.</li>
<li><strong>Night Missions</strong> - Darkness is your greatest weapon. Fly unseen and engage with precision using advanced night vision or thermal optics!</li>
<li><strong>Protect Your Squad</strong> - Transport your squad to take enemy territory, or position them to defend your own base. Deploy them wisely to complete your objectives, and try not to drop too many along the way.</li>
<li><strong>Use your rope to latch onto anything</strong> - Haul a**…and just about anything else. Redirect heat seeking missiles. Carry a tank to help you assault an enemy base. Pick up enemies and send them flying to their death. You can pick up anything that's not tied down, so get creative.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The full game launches later in 2025. It was already in my wishlist, now it's going up a lot higher. Really can't wait to see a lot more from this one.</p>

      <title>3DMark are planning a Linux version but no date for it yet</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>3DMark just released a version for macOS and they are actually planning a Linux version.</p>
<p>What is it? A tool for benchmarking, testing, and comparing PC performance. It's incredibly popular and certainly would make benchmarking and system comparisons easier on Linux.</p>
<p>The good news is that in the comments on Steam for the macOS release post, a developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/223850/eventcomments/596277504178682293?snr=2_groupannouncements_detail_#c596277504178690051" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed</a> "Linux version is still planned, but unfortunately we do not know yet when". This isn't the first time they've said so, with Linux support mentioned back in <a href="https://benchmarks.ul.com/news/3dmark-steel-nomad-is-out-now" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">May 2024</a> with the release of the Steel Nomad benchmark.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2529235791749810828gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Steel Nomad Benchmark</em></p>
<p>Hopefully it won't be too much longer. </p>
<p>At least for stress testing we have the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/stress-testing-and-hardware-monitoring-tool-occt-has-officially-released-for-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently released OCCT</a> that's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/popular-stress-testing-app-occt-is-coming-to-steam-and-includes-a-special-build-for-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">also coming to Steam</a>. It's nice to see more companies actively working on Linux support for their apps. It's great we have a lot of games now thanks to Proton, but Linux still needs to catch up in other areas like this.</p>

      <title>Steam Beta adds controller support icons for game capsules on SteamOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have updated the Steam Beta for all platforms with bug fixes, and a controller support info tweak for SteamOS.</p>
<p>For devices using SteamOS that aren't the Steam Deck (like the Legion Go S), Steam will now show controller support icons on top of game capsules next to the SteamOS Compatibility rating. It's a small change, but should make it easier to see what's playable on SteamOS with a controller at a glance. <em>I don't have a non-Steam Deck SteamOS device to show right now though.</em></p>
<p>As an example below, you can see the game capsules in Steam Big Picture mode and when you hover over them the types of input they support will show in an icon in the bottom corner.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13728611831749820359gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13728611831749820359gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3602545681749820357gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3602545681749820357gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Pictures show Nubby's Number Factory only supports keyboard / mouse, and Nimrods supports gamepad controllers. So on SteamOS devices, it will show those and now <em>additionally</em> also an icon for SteamOS compatibility next to them. Whereas on Steam Deck, it simply shows the Deck Verified status symbol.</p>

      <title>Battlefield Heroes spiritual successor Heroes of Valor is out in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With visuals closer to the original Fortnite than grittier games like Call of Duty or Battlefield, the new Heroes of Valor is a fresh third-person shooter. Coming from Fancy Cat Interactive, a Belgian indie game studio founded by two brothers who are former developers on Blazing Sails.</p>
<p>It's a competitive third-person shooter but at the same time it feels more on the casual side. Not just because of the more inviting style and bright colouring, but also the mechanics of it. The movement, shooting and health systems are all super-simple and basic, along with character abilities making it more of a class-based hero shooter with a WW2 theme wrapped around it.</p>
<p>There's an interesting battle scale to it as well with troopers on the ground, in vehicles and piloting aircraft. There's always a lot going on.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uerFZsMIdxo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dce495f0d71994b8f17856c2d44c40b8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uerFZsMIdxo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I managed to speak to the developers about Linux, Proton and anti-cheat and here's what they said: "Anti-cheat will be made in-house, no third party anti cheat will be used. We tried to use EAC, but it's far too bloated and inefficient so we decided to slowly but surely increase the anti-cheat by just implementing our own techniques. A lot of the most blatant exploits and cheats have already been countered. With the game going paid and the use of our community banlist, cheaters will not have it particularly easy to practice their craft."</p>
<p>They told me before release that "The game already runs on Linux" and after being sent a preview key, I can confirm there were no problems loading it up and jumping into a match. It appears to work rather well with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the latest Proton 9.0-4</a> overall. And so with that in mind, it's been <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">added to our anti-cheat page</a>.</p>
<p>Game Highlights (from their press email):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Class-Based Mayhem:</strong> Choose from Trooper, Heavy, Recon, or Engineer. Each class brings unique weapons, abilities, and battlefield roles.</li>
<li><strong>All-Out Warfare:</strong> Infantry skirmishes, tank duels, aerial dogfights, and more. Switch roles and tactics on the fly across various warzones.</li>
<li><strong>Objective-Driven Combat:</strong> Just slaying the enemy won’t do. We need to achieve our goals in this war! Conquer those objectives, or your heroism will all be for nothing.</li>
<li><strong>Stylized Carnage:</strong> A stylised, character-driven visual style meets the grit of World War II. It’s warfare with flair and firepower.</li>
<li><strong>Smart Bots,</strong> Relentless Action: Fight alongside or against intelligent bots that flank, fly, and fight with real strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Fully Customizable Battles:</strong> Set match rules, bot difficulty, time of day, and map rotation. Solo, co-op, or chaos with friends.</li>
<li><strong>Hero Customization:</strong> Unlock outfits, weapon skins, emotes, and more to suit your soldier’s style.</li>
<li><strong>Easy to Jump In, Hard to Put Down:</strong> Accessible for new recruits. Deep enough for seasoned veterans. Now enlist already, soldier! What are you waiting for! At this rate we might just run out of enemies!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For the people that care I should note it does use one bit of generative AI with the main menu music being a "placeholder and will eventually be replaced by music from a real composer".</p>
<p>There was actually a game called Battlefield Heroes from EA that launched in 2009 which was shut down back in 2015. It was reasonably popular initially due to being free to play and running on lower-end systems. This is <em>incredibly</em> similar to it, to that point that it's basically a spiritual successor.</p>
<p>A mildly amusing shooter that isn't taxing on your brain or your hardware. The problem for me personally with this one, is that I just didn't find any part of it really hook me in like other games do. I'm a huge shooter fan but it feels like this wasn't made for me (which is fine!), I think sadly I'm just not the target audience for this specific style of shooter. Feels like it was made for a younger more casual shooter fan. The gunplay just felt far too arcade-like basic, but I will admit blowing people up in an aircraft was quite fun. I like the scale and style of it and a few small bits, just not the overall gameplay.</p>
<p>Currently it also requires an internet connection. The Steam page lists "Single-player" as a feature, but there is none. All games require you to "Host" it online, although you can stick a password on it and play with just bots. That's quite misleading though. They have said they do <em>plan</em> to add an offline mode but it's not there yet.</p>
<p>I think the best way I could explain this is that it's like a mini low-poly colourful Battlefield cut to the essentials with support for online play and bot matches. If that sounds like something you would enjoy, then it's one for you.</p>

      <title>Steam adds accessibility features to store pages and filters for searching</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/steam-will-soon-list-what-accessibility-features-games-support-on-store-pages/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve announced back in April</a>, they've now added accessibility feature support to game pages on Steam pages and filters for searching.</p>
<p>Valve said "This update comes after gathering valuable feedback from developers as well as players with disabilities, and over 5,000 applications have added details about their accessibility support (with more developers updating their games each day)".</p>
<p>Using Timberborn as my example, when you scroll down a bit on the right you'll see the Accessibility Features note with the number it has in brackets. If you click it, you will then get the list of what the game supports.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10464027961749748239gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>This is a manual process for developers to tell Valve what their games support. It's not required but Valve highly recommends developers to do it. There's no reason not to add the tags to game pages, it could easily result in more sales.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adjustable Difficulty</li>
<li>Save Anytime</li>
<li>Custom Volume Controls</li>
<li>Narrated Game Menus</li>
<li>Stereo Sound</li>
<li>Surround Sound</li>
<li>Adjustable Text Size</li>
<li>Subtitle Options</li>
<li>Colour Alternatives</li>
<li>Camera Comfort</li>
<li>Keyboard Only Option</li>
<li>Mouse Only Option</li>
<li>Touch Only Option</li>
<li>Playable without Timed Input</li>
<li>Text-to-speech</li>
<li>Speech-to-text communications</li>
</ul>
<p>When you go to search for a game on Steam, you can scroll down a bit and on the right panel there will be options you can tick to filters games based on your accessibility requirements.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15425495271749748357gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>You can read more about each on the Steamworks <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/accessibility_features" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Why now then? Well the <a href="https://accessible-eu-centre.ec.europa.eu/content-corner/news/eaa-comes-effect-june-2025-are-you-ready-2025-01-31_en" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">European Accessibility Act</a> comes into effect June 28th, so this is Valve getting ahead of it coming in and likely being penalised if they didn't do anything.</p>

      <title>POSTAL 2 Redux announced, a full remake of the unhinged classic</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We're getting a full modern POSTAL 2 remake with POSTAL 2 Redux being announced today. Running With Scissors have teamed up with Flat2VR Studios and Team Beef for it.</p>
<p>Originally, there was just going to be POSTAL 2 VR but it seems it needed so much work, they've decided to just go ahead and upgrade everything. They're also moving it all over to the Unity game engine for the remake. To be clear, POSTAL 2 Redux and POSTAL 2 VR are <em>separate</em> games.</p>
<p>"Players begged us to fix the crashes, add modern graphics, and maybe stop the dog from pissing on them every five minutes," said Vince Desi, Founder of Running With Scissors. "We’re doing two of those things."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="__ipxHc6YJ8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/780b32a6f326c96abbdfbdaa4c5c8d8d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/__ipxHc6YJ8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In the press release for supported platforms they said: "POSTAL 2 Redux is gunning for every modern box that’ll boot: Windows PC, macOS, and Linux rigs; PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5; Xbox Series X|S; and even Nintendo Switch devices—so you can raise hell on the D Bus. Final platform lineup will depend on each storefront’s paperwork (and how many stretch goals are achieved), but the plan is wall‑to‑wall carnage wherever you play."</p>
<p>I've reached out for confirmation to find out for Linux if that will be a Native Linux port or ensuring it works in Proton.</p>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>High Res Textures &amp; Dynamic Lighting - Paradise's warped billboards and puddles of questionable fluid finally get the razor-sharp grime they deserve.</li>
<li>Zero-Load Streaming World - Sprint from one end of town to the other without a single elevator, door pause, or immersion-breaker.</li>
<li>Smarter, Freer Crowds - Civilians still snitch, cops still overreact, but improved path-finding means riots spark faster and messier than ever.</li>
<li>Re-forged Arsenal - Weighty ballistics, rag-doll dismemberment, and rounds that punch clean through unlucky bystanders.</li>
<li>Fully Propped, Breakable Interiors - Stores, arcades, and alleyways are stuffed with physics-enabled junk begging to be destroyed.</li>
<li>Champ 2.0 - Pet him, sic him, or let him photobomb your next headshot; Paradise's goodest boy finally earns his kibble.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>“Flat2VR Studios is genuinely thrilled to help write the next chapter of the POSTAL saga,” said Eric Masher, COO at Flat2VR Studios. “Bringing Paradise to new platforms—and putting the shovel in the hands of both longtime fans and first-time troublemakers—is a genuine career highlight for our team.”</p>
<p>“The original code tried to die on us daily. Running With Scissors let us butcher it and stitch it back to life—now with fewer surprise blue screens,” said Grant Bagwell, Co-Founder of Team Beef. “Kickstarter is simply how we shove even more nonsense in before some suit makes us stop.”</p>
<p>It will be going to a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/postal2redux/postal-2-redux" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign</a> for funding which you can follow on the pre-launch page. The campaign will launch "Summer" with no clearer date given.</p>

      <title>The original Silent Hill is getting a remake from Bloober Team</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>During the recent KONAMI Press Start event, they confirmed that the original Silent Hill is now getting a remake too.</p>
<p>Bloober Team will once again be taking charge on this, which is not surprising given the positive reception to the Silent Hill 2 remake that released in October 2024. At least truly patient gamers will <em>eventually</em> be able to play through the remakes in order.</p>
<p>There's no real details on anything for the Silent Hill remake just yet, the teaser for it was brief and simply noted that it was in development. The video was literally just this image below with music from Silent Hill.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13723953181749736420gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13723953181749736420gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Find it at 35:30 in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXaDgU72gRI" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">their video</a>.</p>
<p>You may think it perhaps odd to remake a sequel and then do the first game, but it makes sense given the popularity of the second game. The character Pyramid Head was first introduced in Silent Hill 2 and it has become probably their most popular thing (I see someone dressed as Pyramid Head every time I go to a convention…).</p>

      <title>RimWorld - Odyssey will bring spaceship building, exploration and a lot more content</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ludeon Studios just announced the RimWorld - Odyssey expansion and it's huge. There's also going to be a big update for all players of the game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1172149751749733598gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>It's going to expand RimWorld in some huge ways. No more single map, they've finally answered the calls to expand basically everything. And yes, that includes fishing too. Now you'll be able to build a gravship as a flying home to keep growing it into a full mobile colony, to then travel across the planet and beyond. You can settle new biomes "filled with diverse landforms and exotic wildlife", along with new quests to "hunt the alpha thrumbo or raid ancient cryptosleep bunkers" and even go right up into orbit to scavenge tech from space stations and asteroids.</p>
<p>One bit <em>concerns</em> me with the developer noting "But out in the void, an ancient machine mind stirs…". <em>Eep.</em></p>
<p>The expansion really sounds <em>massive</em> in so many ways. Multiple new unique biomes to explore, a new landmarks system, space exploration, new wildlife, new big quests, new weapons, new traps, new enemies, a new music album and so on.</p>
<p>For the free 1.6 update there's going to be some big performance improvements, better planning systems, easier building upgrades, search bar improvements, reworked map generation, flying animals and the list goes on for a while. See it in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/294100/view/498322216088241321" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18858792241749734067gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I think I might actually have to jump in for this one, it sounds awesome.</p>
<p>There's no release date set for it yet but the 1.6 update has an opt-in Beta test on Steam.</p>
<p>RimWorld has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Go back in time to the land of the dinos in the excellent demo for Theropods</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Theropods is an upcoming point and click adventure that combines puzzles with a cinematic story. The demo in Steam Next Fest is quite impressive. It had me hooked from the intro sequence, not many retro point and click adventures can do that to me.</p>
<p>The way it beautifully blends the pixel art point and clicking with the animations, funny audio and the cinematic aspect to it really could be something special. It has been a long time coming, and seems like the wait will be worth it based on the quality demo.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LY8trKNYsIM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4fba8d6b84eaa6fae84b862794587e94.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LY8trKNYsIM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"We started Theropods as a tiny Flash game in a 2015 game jam," said Kostas Skiftas and Sarah Duffield-Harding, developers of Theropods and founders of Lost Token. "Over the years, we faced numerous setbacks and were driven by passion alone. What carried us through wasn’t a single innovation, but a quiet, persistent belief in the game’s unique voice and its potential to connect with players."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prehistoric Puzzle Adventure</strong> – Explore a lush world where dinosaurs and humans cross paths.</li>
<li><strong>Cinematic Pixel Art</strong> – Hand-animated frame-by-frame, then transformed into stunning pixel art.</li>
<li><strong>Classic Point-and-Click, Modern Feel</strong> – Streamlined, intuitive mechanics with zero hand-holding.</li>
<li><strong>Sci-Fi Surprises </strong>– A layered story that evolves into something far stranger than expected.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Do check this one out. There's a Native Linux version of the demo available now. Initially they had a problem with the Linux launch configuration, but this has now been solved and it runs great.</p>

      <title>Escape Simulator 2 to be Steam Deck optimised for Proton on Linux - releases in October</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>Pine Studio have confirmed their plan to launch Escape Simulator 2 in October, with a note about Steam Deck / Linux support. In case you missed it — they just recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/escape-simulator-drops-the-linux-build-to-focus-on-supporting-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dropped their Native Linux build for the first game</a>.</p>
<p>With the release now confirmed for October 21st, they're giving out more info in an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2879840/announcements/detail/519715574346943256" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ</a> post that notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q: What about Linux and Mac support?</strong><br/>
A: A Mac version is planned. For Linux users, we'll ensure compatibility through Proton, optimizing for Steam Deck support from day one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a shame to see no Native Linux support going forward, but if they do actually focus on making it will well with Proton, at least you'll still be able to click play on Linux systems like SteamOS / Steam Deck. We do find often that Proton gives a better experience than Native Linux builds, as some game engines are not particularly great on Linux.</p>

<p>Other details from the FAQ post note they will add VR support, Escape Simulator 1 is still going to get updated, it has a darker atmosphere but nothing scary as it's still a puzzle game, up to 8 players can escape together and more.</p>

      <title>Great shooter Selaco gets fixed up for Steam Deck and many more bug fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Selaco is by far my favourite upcoming shooter in Early Access. After <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/ace-shooter-selaco-gets-improved-performance-and-a-spiced-up-randomizer-mode/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the recent big update</a>, they've put out some essential fixes. It appears that last update was causing some problems on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>As the developers said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Captains,</strong></p>
<p>We’ve just deployed a patch that addresses numerous issues reported by the community, along with several we caught during internal testing, with Steam Deck and stability issues being the primary focus.</p>
<p>The patch from two weeks ago went mostly smoothly, but as always with a major patch, they come with a few unexpected bugs and stability hiccups. We do not take kindly to those!</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13588379861749719015gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13588379861749719015gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Not just for the Steam Deck though! There's a performance improvement for particle effects, AI tweaks and numerous bug fixes to different parts of the game.</p>

      <title>OrangePi Neo gaming handheld with Manjaro Linux delayed until Q3 2025 with no exact date</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The OrangePi Neo gaming handheld with Manjaro Linux initially sounded quite exciting, but it's now facing delays and won't be here until at least Q3 2025.</p>
<p>When I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/orangepi-neo-gaming-handheld-with-manjaro-linux-now-due-out-in-q1-2025/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">last checked back on it</a> the plan was for a global release in Q1 2025, but it seems after the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/orange-pi-neo-gaming-handheld-to-come-with-manjaro-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">initial announcement</a> in early 2024 it's going to be pushed back further. Manjaro head Philip Müller <a href="https://forum.manjaro.org/t/development-q-a-orangepi-neo-01/156450/105" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">replied</a> on the official forum to note "The release got postponed into Q3. There is no exact date determined yet …", which doesn't sound particularly positive.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5936870851749718199gol1.png"/></p>
<p>About a month ago Müller <a href="https://forum.manjaro.org/t/development-q-a-orangepi-neo-01/156450/103" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">stated</a> that Orange Pi were producing a batch for the Chinese mainland market, while work was going on towards FCC and CE certification and they were hoping "for a release in Q2 rather Q3".</p>
<p>Since then we've had the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/zotac-gaming-zone-handheld-getting-a-ryzen-ai-9-hx-370-prototype-with-a-manjaro-linux-based-os/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">brief announcement</a> and then <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/manjaro-linux-lead-gives-more-info-on-the-new-zotac-gaming-zone-handheld-with-amd/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">more details</a> of the newer ZOTAC GAMING ZONE Handheld that will ship with Manjaro Linux too.</p>
<p>By the time it eventually ships it might struggle to find a footing with many more devices now out, with even more being announced over the last year, all with newer hardware.</p>

      <title>Gears of War: Reloaded first Beta weekend starts tomorrow with SteamOS / Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gears of War: Reloaded has two Beta weekends coming, with the first starting tomorrow and they've announced zero platform restrictions for it. For the Steam release you do need to have pre-ordered it to access it, with the full game releasing August 26th</p>
<p>The dates and times for each of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Friday, June 13 from 7pm UTC (12pm PST) to Sunday, June 15 at 7pm UTC (12pm PST).</li>
<li>Friday, June 20 from 7pm UTC (12pm PST) to Sunday, June 22 at 7pm UTC (12pm PST).</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9845451431749716900gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>On X/Twitter, they did a longer <a href="https://x.com/GearsofWar/status/1932910437370105933" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> explaining that there's no restrictions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are there any platform restrictions?</p>
<p>No, access to the Gears of War: Reloaded Multiplayer Beta will not be restricted to any specific platforms. You will be able to play the Multiplayer Beta on all platforms the full game will be released on, including Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC via Steam - including SteamOS and Steam Deck.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's really great to see! Hopefully it will work well enough and be optimised for at least 30FPS on Steam Deck. The Steam page does also note "Optimized for PC &amp; <strong>Handhelds</strong>" (emphasis mine).</p>
<p>My concern with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/gears-of-war-is-getting-a-remaster-with-gears-of-war-reloaded-releasing-in-august/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">original announcement</a> was the use of Easy Anti-Cheat, which many games still haven't enabled for Linux platforms but seems once again a Microsoft Xbox title will be enabled. Awesome. See more on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat page</a>.</p>

      <title>Supply chain issues are making the Steam Deck OLED go out of stock</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have put up a notice in the USA and Canada, where multiple models of the Steam Deck OLED have now gone completely out of stock. It's going to be a little while before they're back too.</p>
<p>There's been a lot of regional issues, plenty of which is thanks to the Trump administration's ongoing tariff fight. Multiple hardware vendors have faced the same problem, with some putting their prices up.</p>
<p>Currently in the USA and Canada the 512GB and 1TB Steam Deck OLED models are now out of stock.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2992068761749646845gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's what Valve said at the bottom of the page when you expand the details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steam Deck OLED 512GB and 1TB models are temporarily out-of-stock in the US and Canada as we adapt to recent supply chain constraints. We anticipate being back in stock by end of summer, and currently expect prices will remain the same. We'll update here as soon as we have more clarity on what the timeline ultimately looks like.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>At least the prices shouldn't go up.</em></p>
<p>If you're reading from the UK and still want a Steam Deck, act fast as there's the Steam Deck 1TB OLED - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamdeckrefurbished/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Valve Certified Refurbished</a> listing as being in stock right now. All <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">brand new</a> models are also in stock in the UK.</p>
<p>Hopefully this issue won't end up happening in more regions, as that's quite a lot Valve will be missing out on getting the Steam Deck into more hands.</p>

      <title>TerraTech Legion could be the best survivor-like ever with vehicle building</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I cannot stress enough the joy I felt building up a vehicle in TerraTech Legion, another survivor-like game with a build your own twist.</p>
<p>Listen here dear reader, I am on a quest to play basically every Vampire Survivor-like thing that gets created. The original simplicity of the idea has really just hooked its teeth into me. The survivor-like bullet heaven <em>whateveryacallit</em> genre has so much going for it because the games are usually priced cheaply enough, and have hours and hours of entertainment mixed with being able to pick up and play when you don't have a lot of time. I love them. And, I love how so many developers have taken the basic idea and put some sweet new spin on it.</p>
<p>And so, I give you, TerraTech Legion. Coming from Payload Studios, who also made the original TerraTech and TerraTech Worlds. Games where you craft a vehicle using blocks stuck together and go exploring. Payload have taken that building idea and put it into a survivor-like. You start off with a crappy silly looking block on wheels, and gradually level up as you face the hordes and get new blocks to attach stuff wherever you want.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16993353731749643037gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16993353731749643037gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13913353311749643038gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13913353311749643038gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>What makes things really interesting is how your weapons are placed. A lot of the turrets have a single direction of attack, so not only is the direction you place them on your vehicle important, it also makes the direction you face during the battle important. And over time, you just build up some blocky monstrosity. Certain weapons do rotate though, but it's a fun change of all weapons auto-firing everywhere.</p>
<p>This is exactly what the genre is all about. Becoming overpowered to the point it becomes otherworldly stupid. And, now you get to do it in a block of turrets on wheels. What the heck is not to love about that?</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Pbdz3erk1xg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dffe57afccc2130b87a93b5f8bcb4404.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Pbdz3erk1xg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I need <strong>more</strong>, right <em>now</em>. How dare you tease me like this Payload Studios.</p>
<p>Check out the Steam Next Fest demo. It worked perfectly on Desktop Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the latest Proton 9.0-4</a>.</p>

      <title>Craftlings refreshes the classic Lemmings with mini city-building</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I had fond memories of playing tons of Lemmings on the Amiga, and now Craftlings is rekindling my love of it but with a city-building twist. The game currently has a demo available during Steam Next Fest, which worked perfectly on Desktop Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the latest Proton 9.0-4</a>.</p>
<p>If you've somehow never played Lemmings the basics are: your little people are always on the move and they're pretty dumb. So they need you to guide them on their path, and stop them walking off a cliff to their death. If you can imagine it's like a mini god-sim, with you watching over your flock. Not only are you ensuring they don't walk into danger, you're also building up a little village across each level towards the end goal.</p>
<p>The first level, for example, has you build across towards a giant angry octopus that destroyed your ship.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="G5JGBSo_T_8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3c37f4a2a3018a1b944972ce8b490c5a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/G5JGBSo_T_8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>An interesting challenge learning how to properly direct your people across the map and back again into the exact places you want them, especially given how stupid they are. And with resource distribution too, there's plenty of uniqueness to it.</p>
<p>It's wonderfully inventive, thoroughly charming and quite relaxing. I can't wait to see more from it. Love the idea.</p>
<p>Do try the demo!</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>No space for your own aquarium at home? Check out the sweet casual game We Love Fish Tanks and breed your own little world. <em>Note: the developer sent a copy to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4218320-GamingOnLinux/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">our Steam Curator</a>.</em></p>
<p>One for people who need something a little more casual, where you can just sit and relax a bit and watch life find a way. Create, grow, and collect at your own pace with no stress, no consequences, no manipulative game mechanics. Good for kids too then.</p>

<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customize Your Tanks:</strong> Choose from a variety of backgrounds, wall styles, water colors, and lighting options to design up to 9 fish tanks that are uniquely yours.</li>
<li><strong>Fish of All Sizes:</strong> Stock your aquarium with fish of different sizes to create a lively and dynamic underwater world.</li>
<li><strong>No Limits on Fish:</strong> Add as many fish as you want to your tanks—your only limit is how much your computer can handle!</li>
<li><strong>Discover and Collect:</strong> Breed fish to unlock unique colors and personalities, building a vibrant and curated collection of aquatic life.</li>
<li><strong>Stress-Free Fun:</strong> With no losing conditions, and no manipulative game mechanics, the game is all about nurturing your fish, chilling out, and watching your creations flourish.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Created by Bondio.li, the developer told me "Fun fact: this whole underwater world was crafted on Linux by a proud Linux enthusiast. That's right — no Windows, no Macs, just Unity on Pop!_OS and a lot of googling."</p>
<p>Nice to see more games developed directly on Linux.</p>

      <title>Gunstoppable looks like just the right amount of FPS insanity</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a new reveal trailer, Gunstoppable from CAGE Studios is a momentum-fueled rogue-lite FPS that looks pretty insane. Just the right amount of craziness, wrapped up in a colourful package.</p>
<p><em>Another one from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/highlight-announcements-from-the-2025-summer-showcases/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the recent barrage of events</a>.</em></p>
<p>In Gunstoppable you'll be dishing out swift destruction as you build up speed with wall-running and your grapple-hook, to then unleash momentum-based mayhem where damage increases with speed. Combine dozens of dual-wield loadouts with pistols, rocket launchers and katanas, and equip game-breaking augments for deadly weapon synergies. Sounds like a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zgxEIQi0Vwo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5ae1fcfa0f0cdb1b41c955c780921e18.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zgxEIQi0Vwo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's a full meta-progression system in this one, with you earning permanent upgrades at the end of each run. So you'll be able to keep buffing up your character to unleash more chaos by combining elements, attachments and movement buffs. As you progress you "dig through the twisted memories surrounding the protagonist's past, and destroy the architects of never-ending brutality in a blood-curdling odyssey to settle the score" they say.</p>
<p>"Gunstoppable is a perfect blend of what I look for in fast-paced roguelites," said CAGE Studios co-founder Salaar Kohari. "I like my games to feel fast, stylish, and improvisational, and I know I’m not alone. Gunstoppable scratches an itch I believe many FPS players have right now, and I look forward to seeing their reactions to the expressive systems we’ve built."</p>
<p>You'll need Proton to play it on Linux platforms. There's no release date set for it yet.</p>

      <title>Nexus Mods new app gets more UI improvements, performance upgrades and a Linux fix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nice to see the new cross-platform Nexus Mods app coming along. This latest update doesn't add new games but does making using it better.</p>
<p>They've done another big pass over the interface to make everything clearer. Each page now has a proper distinct header, distinct icon and a little bit of flavour text to help you easily know which area of the app you are in and what you can do there.</p>
<p>Toolbars are smarter with this release too as they've been made context aware, showing options that are actually relevant.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9655332321749633758gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9655332321749633758gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>More from the <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/releases/tag/v0.12.3" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>More Features</h4>
<ul>
<li>Reworked file trees in the app to be more performant. This includes the "View Mods Files" and "External Changes" pages.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Technical Changes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Added translations submitted by the community: Russian, Ukrainian, Portuguese (Brazil).</li>
<li>Updated the "Missing Game" flow to try and prevent duplicate reports of missing, unsupported games.</li>
<li>Added the correct headers to API requests for Nexus Mods.</li>
<li>Further developed the backend systems required to create and export collections.</li>
<li>Further developed the backend system to make a game-agnostic load order system.</li>
<li>General performance optimisations.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Improved the way the app registers to handle Nexus Mods downloads on Linux.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where FOMODs would incorrectly report issues with some asset paths.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see the app register fix for Linux too!</p>
<p>Towards the end of May they also had a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15289" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> up giving some background on the work being done, with Baldur's Gate 3 work picking up again to get it properly into their supported games list. Currently only Stardew Valley and Cyberpunk 2077 have <em>full</em> support.</p>
<p>We're still a long way off it replacing Vortex but it's getting there little by little. Having it open source and cross-platform is a nice boost for it.</p>

      <title>Gentoo Rescue is a puzzle game with twists that will melt your mind that I&#39;m too stupid for</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gentoo Rescue from Jagriff seems simple on the surface but it's a real brain melting puzzle game that's well worth your time. <em>Disclosure: key provided by the developer.</em></p>
<p>I think I'm just too stupid for this one, but I enjoyed my attempt at it. When you look at it you might think it's just another block-pushing Sokoban-styled puzzle game. It's anything but that. Well, there's plenty of that sort of thing but it's also a whole lot more. The game is thoroughly deceptive and rewards your time greatly with a real feeling of triumph each time you beat one of the cleverly designed levels.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13573780791749631689gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13573780791749631689gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>A "welcoming vibe" the developer told me, and sure enough it looks cute and inviting but gosh is it a tricky one.</p>
<p>The problem is that you're often moving multiple characters. Not at the same time, but each different type of creature has their own problem you need to solve. It's working out where each needs to be, and how to get them there, that's the problem. And it really did make me sweat and curse at the screen for what seems like it should be obvious, but repeatedly had me furiously scratching my head. </p>
<p>Gentoo Rescue takes place in an open world of nested puzzles, which is where metroidvania elements start to appear with meta-mechanics, recursion, and other surprising twists. The developer compared it to the likes of Baba Is You, Patrick's Parabox and Stephen's Sausage Roll and that's not a bad way to look at it. Simple design, but unless you're some kind of genius you'll probably get stuck a few times.</p>
<p>There were times I simply had absolutely no idea what I was doing, which is not to say the design is overly confusing, it's just I had to walk away and come back with a fresh mind to solve it. The solution was right in front of me, I just couldn't see it. Maddening. </p>
<p>Thankfully, there is a hints system which can give you hints for each level across multiple points. So you could grab just one hint to get you on your way, or grab more to really explain things. It's a nice middle-ground for people who get stuck but don't want the full solution right away. <em>Still didn't help me half the time. </em>The way the creatures wobble when selected, it's almost like they're mocking me.</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Penguins, walruses, and fish! Each introduces opposing win criteria.</li>
<li>Rapidly expanding set of mechanics and interactions.</li>
<li>Over 300 diverse, hand-crafted levels. No filler!</li>
<li>An interconnected network of puzzles with item-based progression and metagame twists.</li>
<li>Journal for tracking mechanics, which also lists entries needed for the current puzzle.</li>
<li>A tiered hint system that teaches a deduction-based approach.</li>
<li>16 biomes distinguishing areas and mechanics.</li>
<li>Original music.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It has Native Linux support and a demo is also available.</p>
<p>A thorough challenge that you need to try. Really great design and the way it blends different puzzle mechanics together is quite amazing. An absolute gem.</p>

      <title>Catch rocks and rockets to throw at your enemies in Galactic Glitch</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Galactic Glitch is a twin-stick roguelite shooter where you get to catch and throw rockets, rocks and enemies at other enemies - and it's damn good. <em>Note: key provided by their PR team.</em></p>
<p>With some incredibly satisfying combat, this is one you need to stick on your list to grab. The battles all take place in small contained arena bubbles, with the game setup being like a space dungeon crawler with some mechanics that aren't too far from the feeling of Dead Cells except it's twin-stick space shooter.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10462109621749629702gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10462109621749629702gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You zip from arena to arena, taking down all the enemies in it and then zip to the next one. With the layout being like a dungeon crawler, rooms are connected in different paths, which you can teleport back to at any time, so the exploring is nice and easy too. Some areas contain upgrades, some have big boss battles or a shop and more. There's a huge amount of variety on offer here that will keep you satisfied for hours.</p>
<p>I can't even begin to explain how fun it is catching an enemy rocket, to throw it back at them, to then zip around to catch a floating rock and throwing that at them too. With all the different enemy types and upgrades you can use to build up your ship during a run, there's so much to like about it. I'm especially a fan of the ability you can get that makes enemies more vulnerable to other types of attacks when you throw a rock at them, makes it all the more fun to do so.</p>
<p>Quite challenging too. The different enemy types you face work well together with some of them making a run at you, others might have a power-attack that needs a small charge up giving you chance to dodge and hit from behind, while others use large area attacks — it's all designed to keep you moving, to make the most of all your abilities. And to ensure you use the floating rocks and other debris to your advantage to block shots, or throw at enemies.</p>
<p>With it being physics-based, I love how enemies can blow each other up too, if you let them. I think my favourite example is one enemy that creates a zone of danger in front of them that's like a space garbage disposal, with two solid lasers that crush from each side of the zone. If you get a few enemies to follow you, then dodge out of the zone, they all get crushed. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2241891501749627498gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2241891501749627498gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>At the start, it might feel like your average space shooter, but once you get further in, the game keeps expanding. It really does feel like Dead Cells with the layout of going through sections.</p>
<p>There's some nice meta-progression too. As you go through a run, you collect blueprints to have more different types of abilities and weapons in later runs you can unlock. Along with different weapons you can start with to unlock as you go through, each with their unique own main attack and special power-attack. On top of that there's also an upgrades system to add even more buffs and additions.</p>
<p>You also get to unlock different types of ships to battle with, each with a different design along with their own strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>My one main issue though, is that overall I did find the game a bit easy. It's really fun, but I do wish there was a bit more of a challenge added to it. As it didn't take all that long to blast through. The bosses, while really interesting to fight, were all also mostly reasonable easy to fight. If they added in some more difficulty options to spice things up a notch that would be good.</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>2D Space-Roguelite</strong> - Experience exhilarating twin-stick shooter gameplay combined with the endless replayability of a rogue-lite and the heart-pounding challenge of permadeath.</li>
<li><strong>Physics-based Combat</strong> - Wield a powerful gravity gun to manipulate the battlefield, hurl massive asteroids, and turn your enemies' own missiles against them.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Part Enemies</strong> - Strategically dismantle foes piece by piece, exploiting their weak spots while avoiding their heavily armored defenses.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Exploration</strong> - Venture into a mysterious, glitched world of star systems, uncovering hidden secrets and valuable items as you chart your unique path.</li>
<li><strong>Abilities and Items</strong> - Customize your approach with diverse upgrade paths in each run. Unlock new Powers and experiment with creative combinations to craft your ultimate build.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Apart from many parts being a bit too easy it's absolutely brilliant. Love going for a run it and a full recommendation from me. One of the best twin-stick space shooters I've played in a while.</p>
<p>Played on Desktop Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the latest Proton 9.0-4</a> paired up with my 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Wireless controller, it has been a flawless experience.</p>

      <title>Spooky 2D co-op submarine sim Barotrauma is getting a big Home &amp; Harbor expansion</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Daedalic Entertainment and developers Undertow Games and FakeFish recently revealed the Home &amp; Harbor expansion for Barotrauma. A large free update for all players will release at the same time. It's not due until next year though.</p>
<p>It's been a while since I played Barotrauma, but I have some fond memories of getting a bit scared and flailing around with GamingOnLinux contributor Samsai a while back. Good fun. Silly and spooky with a lot to do and a whole lot that will go wrong in the deep dark waters.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The DLC will have these main features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Base Building</strong>: For the first time, players can gain ownership of their own outpost. Customize, upgrade, expand, manage, and defend your base, unlocking perks to boost your campaign progress and crafting a true home beneath Europa’s icy seas.</li>
<li><strong>New Faction – The Descendants</strong>: Meet the Descendants, a mysterious, high-tech faction whose origins date back to the earliest days of human settlement on Europa. Their unique storyline introduces new challenges, secrets, and rewards that will reshape how players engage with the game world.</li>
</ul>

      <title>At Fate&#39;s End is the next game from the Spiritfarer team</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From the devs of Spiritfarer, At Fate's End is an action-adventure game where you fight the ones you love and your skill tree is your family tree. Sounds like a really interesting idea and once again for Thunder Lotus, it looks gorgeous.</p>
<p>"With At Fate’s End, we’re taking everything we learned from Spiritfarer — that rich emotional core, that interplay of mechanics and narrative — and pushing it into thrilling new territory," said Nicolas Guérin, Creative Director at Thunder Lotus. "This is a more intense, more action-driven game, but no less intimate. It’s about how families break apart — and how they might come back together."</p>
<p>Could be another one to really make you think. Spiritfarer was all about saying goodbye, this is all about family.</p>

      <title>Manjaro KDE Plasma plans move to Wayland by default</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ubuntu isn't the only Linux distribution <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/ubuntu-25-10-goes-all-in-with-wayland-dropping-support-for-gnome-on-xorg/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">planning a big change</a>, as Manjaro KDE Plasma also now plans to move to Wayland.</p>
<p>In a forum post from Manjaro's KDE head Artem Grinev titled "Manjaro KDE Plasma is planned to move to Wayland", they said "I was using Wayland for quite a while and things are more or less smooth (NVIDIA proprietary driver). I think it’s time for Manjaro to move to Wayland by default for both Plasma session and SDDM.".</p>
<p>It's a short and to the point post, with a small FAQ and some voting options for Manjaro forum members to note how their current Wayland experience is.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8584640821749575093gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8584640821749575093gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

<p>Hopefully when the move is done it goes smoothly.</p>

      <title>Ubuntu 25.10 goes all-in with Wayland, dropping support for GNOME on Xorg</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Canonical Desktop Team have announced that starting with Ubuntu 25.10, they're going all-in with GNOME on Wayland.</p>
<p>In a post on the official Discourse Forum from developer Jean Baptiste Lallement, they stated that with Ubuntu 25.10 they are "taking a significant step forward in the evolution of the Ubuntu Desktop by removing the Xorg-based Ubuntu session" and so it will be exclusively Wayland. Why? They said the decision "follows upstream GNOME’s roadmap and aligns with our long-term strategy of delivering a secure, performant, and modern desktop experience".</p>
<p>And the fact is, Wayland is the future and the more distributions that force it by default, the quicker the Linux world can move on and continue improving.</p>
<p>Since Ubuntu 25.10 is the last interim release before the next LTS (long-term support) with Ubuntu 26.04 next year, this move makes sense. It means they can smoothen any rough edges by the time the LTS releases.</p>
<p>See more in <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-25-10-drops-support-for-gnome-on-xorg/62538/1" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">their forum post</a>.</p>

      <title>The massive Satisfactory 1.1 update is out now with controller support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The first-person open-world factory building game Satisfactory just had a massive v1.1 update, bringing controller support and a lot more. This should make it a lot easier to relax with, and make it better on handhelds like the Steam Deck too (it's rated Playable by Valve).</p>
<p>For players on Steam Deck they said it will "recognize you’re running Steam OS and will default to Controller so things should work out of the box now".</p>
<p>I've always wanted to do a proper run of it, but more and more I very much prefer a controller in my hands. Looks like now I don't have an excuse (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/dune-awakening-is-out-now-and-works-well-on-linux-desktop-but-rough-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">except for playing Dune</a>).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6512429221749572847gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Big features added include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Controller support </strong>allows players to sit back and relax with their preferred device for the ultimate factory-building experience. With Xbox and DualSense™ controller compatibility, players can now enjoy smooth and responsive gameplay all in the palm of their hands, bringing further accessibility and comfort to MASSAGE-2 (A-B)b.</li>
<li><strong>Photo Mode</strong> has received a complete overhaul with Update 1.1, with a refreshed user interface and settings for Pioneers to explore. Players can produce their most imaginative creations with new photo features like colour adjustments, filters, effects, poses, and camera control lenses. This updated Photo Mode also introduces a Dolly Mode, allowing the most artistic Pioneers to create transitions and videos using the in-game system.</li>
<li><strong>Additional conveyor buildings </strong>make production smarter and sleeker than before. The Conveyor Throughput Monitor lets Pioneers run calculations on their production lines to ensure the utmost efficiency. Meanwhile, the Conveyor Wall Hole lets Pioneers maximise their factory floor space, allowing conveyor belts to pass cleanly through walls, without compromising on aesthetics. Last but not least, the Priority Merger enables players to prioritise which active inputs should be output first — perfect for pick ‘n mix production lines.</li>
<li><strong>Changes to railway systems </strong>bring the realism with more complex train mechanics than before. Runaway trains are now here, meaning trains will completely derail if not stopped before the end of the line. The solution is the brand new Buffer Stops which Pioneers can use to halt trains in their tracks… or skip the safety mechanism entirely to create barreling freight trains.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Pioneer travel options </strong>allow Pioneers to navigate their Hypertube systems with even more flexibility. The Hypertube Junction allows players to connect a hypertube to three different paths, while the Hypertube Branch can split into two paths. These additions enable greater control and customisation of Hypertube networks. Meanwhile, the Personnel Elevator enables incremental vertical travel, allowing Pioneers to name floors and customise button icons and colours to easily navigate multi-floored factories.</li>
<li><strong>A mountain of quality-of-life improvements </strong>including Straight and Curved Pipeline build modes, improvements to Nudging allowing for vertical movement and unlimited range, and soft clearance for Conveyor Poles and Pipelines. Alongside this, the highly requested “No Fuel” setting is now available in Advanced Game settings, removing the need to power vehicles to get moving.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Base-building co-op exploration adventure game Necesse hits 1.0 in October</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/the-huge-graphics-overhaul-for-settlement-survival-sim-necesse-is-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">big graphics overhaul last year</a>, the co-op base-building exploration adventure Necesse is set for the big 1.0 in October. The date has been set for October 9th, and it's going to come with some huge new features for the game.</p>
<p>The biggest change being a complete overhaul of the world. They're doing away with the island system, to bring an infinite seamless world where biomes will transition without any loading screens which sounds awesome.</p>
<p>A lot more is coming like settlers now having their own personality traits, and some expansion of the end-game with a final version of their Incursion System. They said a lot more is coming, which will be revealed over time as it gets closer to the release date.</p>
<p>They also have a brand new trailer to show some of it off:</p>

      <title>Direct3D to Vulkan layer DXVK v2.6.2 released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest release of the Direct3D to Vulkan translation layer has been released, with version 2.6.2 bringing assorted improvements. It's mainly a maintenance release so there's no big new features.</p>
<p>For those just joining: DXVK is what allows Proton to run Windows games that use Direct3D 8, 9, 10 and 11 so well.</p>
<p>Here's the changelog for this release:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Bug fixes and Improvements</h4>
<ul>
<li>Added <code class="inline-code">DXVK_FILTER_DEVICE_UUID</code> environment variable to filter devices by their reported driver UUID. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4956" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4956</a>)<br/>
	This may be useful on setups with multiple GPUs of the same model.</li>
<li>Improved vendor ID override logic for D3D9 and added <code class="inline-code">d3d9.hide{Amd,Intel,Nvidia}Gpu</code> configuration options to improve the out-of-the-box experience in games that refuse to run on Intel GPUs, or only run with significantly reduced graphics features. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4869" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4869</a>)</li>
<li>Improved WSI backend selection in dxvk-native.</li>
<li>D3D9 vendor hack features are now only exposed when reporting a GPU vendor that supports the given feature on Windows.<br/>
	This may avoid issues in case games make assumptions based on vendor IDs rather than format queries.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that could lead to one eye not updating properly in some VR games.</li>
<li>Fixed log spam for unsupported D3D8 render states. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4918" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4918</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed log spam for frequent DXGI adapter queries.</li>
<li><strong>osu! stable</strong>: Fixed black screen in D3D9 mode. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/4769" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4769</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4984" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4984</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Pirate Hunter</strong>: Worked around out-of-memory crash. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4922" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4922</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Red Orchestra: Ostfront</strong>: Worked around alt+tab issues. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4919" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4919</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Rocketbirds 2</strong>: Worked around a game bug that would cause the intro video to be garbled.</li>
<li><strong>Thumper</strong>: Worked around track rendering issues on Intel. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/4861" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4861</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4866" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4866</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>As for how to update — you don't need to do anything. Valve's Proton pulls in updates from DXVK directly in future releases.

      <title>Dune: Awakening is out now and works well on Linux Desktop but rough on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dune: Awakening from Funcom has officially arrived, and thankfully it does work rather nicely on Desktop Linux. <em>Disclosure: a key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>How does Dune: Awakening connect to the Dune books and films? It's the same world, but an alternate timeline where Paul Atreides was never born. Here Lady Jessica had a daughter, which pushed things in a different direction. Duke Leto Atreides survived the attempt on his life and is now locked in a conflict with the Harkonnen over Arrakis and its precious spice.</p>
<p>The good news, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/dune-awakening-will-have-battleye-enabled-for-linux-steamos-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">as I shared previously</a>, is that BattlEye anti-cheat is enabled for Linux platforms and so there's no issues playing it. <em>Side-note: check out our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat compatibility page</a>.</em> The game does have a launcher too, which is for once not an annoyance. It loads just fine and I haven't had any problems with that side of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7520636811749465325gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7520636811749465325gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><em>Since this is an absolutely massive game, please do not consider this an attempt at any kind of formal review. It's pretty close to impossible to do that for something this big, which will change often since it's an MMO.</em></p>
<h4>Desktop Linux / General</h4>
<p>Only one Linux-specific problem I've encountered, is that it initially gave a slow hard drive warning, but I've never seen it again since the first time and it hasn't been a problem. I've seen this a few times with Windows games on Proton but it's whatever they use to detect your drive not working well with Proton. Other than that, using the current <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">stable Proton 9.0-4</a> the game really has been running great during Advanced Access.</p>
<p>Start off with character customization, there's a good amount that you can do here. With skin tones, hair styles, vitiligo, freckles, neck size, eyebrows and more you can make some pretty interesting looking people. After actually making your character, you'll then move onto some background details like where you were born to get a special emote and your initial skillset sorted.</p>

<p>Playing this, at least in the early hours, firmly reminded me of the times spent running around in Rust. The initial loop is somewhat similar, especially when you randomly come across a little house from someone and they come running out at you. That, and your bases needing an upkeep. It's a survival game at its heart with a whole lot of MMO features. So you'll be engaging in various events but you'll also need to keep an eye on your character's needs like dehydration. Unlike Rust though, this is a far more forgiving game (for the most part) and I've not had a problem running solo in it.</p>
<p>I'm also feeling a little bit of Breath of the Wild for the climbing. And even a bit Assassin's Creed for the map system. The way you need to survey to actually reveal areas of the map, to then go to new locations for intel and repeat. There's a lot of different gameplay features that have been mashed together here. I do appreciate the survey system is not some static location though. You craft survey probes and fire them up into the sky, wherever you can get high enough.</p>
<p>The sun is definitely not your friend here. It's Dune, of course it isn't. Staying out of the sun is a necessity since it will burn you to a crisp if you stay out too long. Something the tutorial, which is surprisingly good as an MMO walk-through, keeps drilling into you. Add into that the massive Sandworms, you're never a few feet away from immediate danger. I really like it though, this constant sense of urgency you get in Dune: Awakening really keeps you on your toes — but, not in a punishing way, it's more about keeping you focused on it.</p>
<p>Sandworms are an absolute menace in this. It's such a unique feeling threat for an online game. You need to cross over the dunes often, and seeing the middle of your screen show the vibration UI meter wobbling, and then you hear the rumbling - it can end up as a real "oh shit" moment. Doubly so, because it's a really <em>brutal</em> death too. Not just because you're being gobbled up by a massive freaking worm, but you'll lose <em>everything</em>. You're going to see a lot of players running around in their underwear in this one I think. Death by normal PvE or PvP at least won't get you to lose everything but you'll lose some resources.</p>
<p>Getting swallowed by a worm can really set you back a <strong>long</strong> time too, especially if you were carrying some essentials and don't have a good respawn set up. One thing to help with that though: respawn beacons. You can craft them and place them down near enough anywhere. It's like mashing a quick-save button in a horror game, just make sure you have a few ready. I cannot stress enough how setting up a good respawn point is. I messed up at one point, and it set me back a good while. Note: your base is not an <em>automatic</em> respawn point, you need to <em>manually</em> activate it. If you forget, you might be screwed and have a long way to travel. I feel they <em>should</em> tweak this though, that if you only have one it should automatically be a spawn point.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17134198601749485785gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17134198601749485785gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The first time you get swallowed by a worm, it's not as punishing, as you can accept a gift of a speeder (or not - your choice). But that's it. Everything else is still just <em>gone</em>. Don't take anything out with you that you're not willing to lose. I'll admit I shed a little tear the first time it happened. It was quite an event, heart-pumping frightening and maddening at the same time. At least I was still only about 11 hours in, so it didn't reset me too much, but still super frustrating.</p>
<p>A little tip for you: have a chest full of backup equipment. A basic set of weapons, tools and clothing. Always keep it stocked. That will make the experience far less destroying when it happens. And it will happen.</p>
<p><em>It's not just the giant worms you have to worry about though…</em></p>
<p>You also have the weather to face. Sandstorms are a regular occurrence requiring you to seek urgent shelter. There's varying levels of shelter too from partial to water-tight. So you'll need either a good base, a special shield, or just — something that can shield you from the storm. Heck, I've found a few times a tiny little gap in a rock would do just enough to protect me while it flows past.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7821214901749473770gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7821214901749473770gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Each week on Tuesday morning (UTC) there's also a Coriolis Storm, the most intense Sandstorm, which will refresh the <em>Deep Desert</em> with a new generated map. The servers go down for this, which is usually about 2 hours long. This is part of how the developers at Funcom plan to keep players interested, since each week there will be new stuff to explore. Which thankfully means all your hard work building up in the PvE areas is not wiped.</p>
<p>Once you get your first Sandbike, the game really opens up quite a lot. Until that point, you're still in the tutorial. The initial area is quite big and open, but there's not exactly a whole lot there. Once you get into the Vermillious Gap up North, things get bigger and <em>far</em> more dangerous too.</p>
<p>Adding to the existing dangers you'll also deal with Drumsand, which makes extra noise when you cross it and those worms are ready and waiting to pounce. Thankfully with the map scanning system, you can just send up a probe and reveal the area and see where all the Drumsand is to try and avoid it. Easier said than done though. You'll turn into a Rockhopper soon enough when you starting hearing worms coming.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/928657111749486320gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/928657111749486320gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Dune: Awakening has quite an interesting and easy to use building system, which was nice to play around with. You start off building a Sub-Fief Console, which allows you to claim an area of land. You can do this almost anywhere. You can instantly build, but you can also set down blueprints to actually plan your base builds giving you quite a lot of freedom, as long as you're within your claimed area.</p>
<p>Don't get too attached to your first base though, as you progress you actually <strong>have</strong> to completely <em>abandon</em> it as part of the quest-line. That felt a little rough to me, as I put more effort than I should have into the first base and couldn't be arsed with all the backtracking to pick up some stuff left in there. Oh well.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16641141221749472535gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16641141221749472535gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Annoyances with being forced to abandon a base aside, it does make sense. Upkeep is needed with fuel cells to power your base shield, this ticks down all the time and at the start spreading you across more than one would be silly.</p>
<p>You know what makes exploring it great though? The different types of belts you can get. Some can pretty much entirely stop fall damage, others can allow you to float upwards at speed. They all use power though, so you need to have a battery equipped which will drain. All your items can get damaged too, so you'll need to sort out your repair station. There's so many things to keep thinking on when you're exploring and what equipment to take with you.</p>
<p>Not just that, the vehicle system is pretty great too. You can have multiple types of vehicles and easily store them using a device you carry with you, to be able to spawn them in whenever you need. So while the world is big and takes quite some time to cross it, once you get far enough in it's not that big of an issue…unless you're worm food.</p>
<p>There's a definite repeat grind to the game though, it really does take forever at times to do even the simplest thing. That's the way it's designed though, it's an MMO and they need you to keep playing. Especially with the water system, it's not just about quenching your thirst. It's also needed for construction materials too, so you're balancing resources often. It does get easier as you go through the research though. You start off sucking a little water from plants, and eventually you'll be able to carry around containers full of water - but it takes a while and water goes fast.</p>
<p>They do need to tweak NPC spawning though, as I've had hostile NPCs spawn directly inside my base. Perhaps that might be the location I picked, but even so, it just shouldn't happen. It's my base with a powered shield, they need to go away. Just look at how brazen they are, standing in my doorway, acting is if they own the place. Excuse me NPC, that is my humble abode, would you mind dying so I can get in?</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8271203951749490560gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8271203951749490560gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some accidental genius with my base placement though. With a steady stream of NPCs, I can harvest their blood for water on a regular basis. So actually if the developers could <em>not</em> fix the spawning and increase it a little, I'll be <em>swimming</em> in er — purified blood water.</p>
<p>Nice. Don't mind if I do.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2123088161749490669gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2123088161749490669gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Now, let's talk about the combat. I've only done a small amount of PvP, but quite a lot of PvE, mostly because I still have so much yet to explore to see more of the PvP. My first PvP encounter went about what I expected while exploring a crashed ship. I saw someone run past, got scared and asked them not to shoot. I walked closer and then they began firing at me, after I got closer again they pulled out their sword hit me a few times and eventually they just ran away.</p>
<p>Until you see more types of enemies, the PvE falls a little flat though but <em>eventually</em> gets a bit more interesting. When you're trying to dodge multiple different types ranged weapons, grenades and people coming running at you with knives it can get quite frantic.</p>
<p>The enemy AI is often a bit overly <em>dumb</em> though. I've lost count of the amount of times I've been standing directly in front of an enemy, and they just don't react at all until I shove a sword into their chest.</p>
<p>What makes the melee a bit more fun is the shield system. You and enemies can equip a personal shield, which needs to be broken with a power-attack. Shielded enemies can really make things quite difficult when you get surrounded. It's a fun system.</p>
<p>And since it's an MMO, what good is it without a friendly neighbour?</p>

<p><em>Thanks, DoubleFreedom, you're a real one. You saved me from the sands.</em></p>
<h4>Performance</h4>
<p>The Desktop Linux testing was done on Kubuntu 25.04: AMD Ryzen 5800x, Radeon 6800 XT and 2560x1440. With most settings either on High or Ultra, with XeSS upscaling on Ultra Quality and FSR Frame Generation turned on.</p>
<p>Performance is perhaps my biggest surprise here. We have a big-branded MMO that actually works rather well at release. I am shocked. There's areas that <em>will</em> bring the performance down, but I've never seen it dip to a level where I thought it wasn't acceptable. Funcom did quite good here.</p>
<p>So far the only place I've seen it dip below 60FPS was during the fourth trial. But it was still above 50FPS. Overall, the game has been mostly over 90FPS.</p>
<p>The worst performing part of the game? Weirdly, the <em>map</em>. When you zoom in the performance goes right down and it does feel <em>sluggish</em> there. Not exactly a big deal but worth noting. One thing that is annoying, is the cursor seems off position when zoomed in, making placing a marker a bit of a nuisance but it's fine when zoomed out.</p>
<p>Stable too. In many multi-hour sessions, not even a single crash. Actually amazed at that. Which is sad to say, but that's the industry, too many games are rushed out by the people at the top but it seems not in this case.</p>
<h4>Steam Deck</h4>
<p>I was really curious to see how it would go on Steam Deck here, since the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/dune-awakening-looks-like-it-may-be-playable-on-steam-deck-benchmark-tested/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">original benchmark I covered</a> showed a fair amount of promise. For the install, luckily you're fine there as it's a lot smaller than I was expecting at only 41.81GB on disk so it can easily fit alongside your other games. My testing was on the Steam Deck LCD, SteamOS 3.7.8 Stable.</p>
<p>One thing you'll want to do right away is flick on the <em>experimental</em> "Low End Laptop Mode". This reduces the visual quality quite a bit, but does allow the game to be <em>playable</em> to a certain degree. Even flicking about all other settings to their lowest, the performance is still just all over the place. Especially so when you get further in and more is happening, it will still drop below 30FPS repeatedly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6281655031749549343gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6281655031749549343gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6385910371749549344gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6385910371749549344gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12926094721749549344gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12926094721749549344gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18152036691749549342gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18152036691749549342gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><em>I got swallowed by a worm testing this on Steam Deck for you, I hope you're happy. The things I do for you, my dear readers…</em></p>
<p>You're also going to get barely even 1 single hour on battery on the Steam Deck LCD. Probably about 50 minutes tops.</p>
<p>If the Steam Deck is your only way to play, it's <em>playable</em>, but <em>not</em> exactly a <em>good</em> experience. Doing some light casual exploring and resource gathering is fine, but anything more intense I wouldn't exactly recommend on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Other SteamOS systems and Desktop Linux it will be fine, providing your system has the specs for it. But you're not really going to enjoy it on Deck. I mentioned earlier how the map is the biggest performance problem even on Desktop, and that issue is only amplified on Steam Deck with it dropping really low and makes it a nuisance to use.</p>
<p>While it notes it has Steam Cloud, you're going to want to ensure you link up your Steam and Dune accounts from the main menu, otherwise it won't detect your existing characters. It's easy enough to do, it's just signing in with Steam and then entering an email. It's a proper MMO, so that type of experience is to be expected.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ztdVjiRpYfo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/53a50673daca0e8005542034286fc11d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ztdVjiRpYfo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With Advanced Access over, hopefully any server problems have been sorted too, which did cause the game to drop quite quickly into Mixed user reviews. However, Funcom had a rapid turnaround on that and at time of writing it has hit Very Positive. That's at least one upside for this pay-up for Advanced Access model, the people paying extra get to enjoy all the initial issues. And the developers get to solve them before <em>everyone else</em> joins in.</p>
<p>There's plenty of small bugs and quirks, as expected for a big new release but don't let that put you off.</p>
<p>I've repeatedly said to myself, "I'll just play it for a quick hour to do a little more", which seems to turn into 4-5 hours every time. I completely lose track of life whenever I load it up. I was supposed to be making more preparations for Steam Next Fest yesterday and ended up playing well over 6 hours without a break just because I was so entirely sucked into it. Woops.</p>
<p>While the game is an MMO, it is doing a pay-once model. There's no ongoing subscription fees and no micro-transactions. But there will be DLC expansions releasing Q4 2025, Q1 2026 and Q2 2026 included in a Season Pass. Funcom said they plan continuous free updates to the game too.</p>
<p>As far as MMOs and survival games go, this is the most fun with them I've had in <em>years</em>. It's fantastic that such a huge release comes working on Linux out of the box. I couldn't be happier. Surviving the unforgiving desert has never felt so good. I've really thoroughly enjoyed the exploration, unlocking new research and skills and exploring some more. I have a lot of the game still left to cover since it's an MMO though, I'm only really scratching the surface here.</p>

      <title>Steam Beta improves controller support for 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Wireless, 8BitDo Pro 2 and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is great. Valve released a new Beta for Desktop and Steam Deck that brings Steam Input improvements for various controllers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/8bitdo-ultimate-2-is-getting-full-steam-input-support-for-more-buttons/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Back in April I covered</a> that Valve were working to adjust Steam Input to provide support for the extra buttons on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/the-8bitdo-ultimate-2-wireless-controller-is-a-top-premium-feeling-controller/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Wireless Controller</a> and now they have. Not just that though, multiple controllers now have this feature!</p>
<p class="plain-list-title"><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/545611272206420772?snr=2___" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Changelog</a> (it's the same across Desktop / Steam Deck):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added the ability to bind the paddles and L4/R4 buttons on the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Wireless Controller when connected via Bluetooth.</li>
<li>Added the ability to bind the paddles on the 8BitDo Pro 2 Controller when in DirectInput mode.</li>
<li>Added the ability to bind the paddles and C/Z buttons on the FlyDigi Vader series controllers.</li>
<li>Added the ability to bind the paddles on the FlyDigi Apex series controllers.</li>
<li>Fixed input when using the latest firmware for the Mayflash GameCube adapter.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8938944571749547076gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>It's a shame for 8BitDo that you can't do the extra buttons using their wireless adapter, but good to see it here anyway. You will likely need firmware updates to get it working.</p>
<p>Checking it out with my own 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Wireless Controller, there's a new slider to enable Extended Button support in Steam Input. Which then allows the buttons to actually show up in the configurator. Oddly though, the button doesn't like to stay selected which might be a bug. Every time I come back out of the button config, the slider to enabled Extended Button support is unchecked again.</p>

      <title>Stellar Blade gets Steam Deck Verified ahead of release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Stellar Blade from SHIFT UP Corporation has been rated Steam Deck Verified by Valve ahead of the release on June 11th.</p>
<p>Not exactly surprising, since <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/stellar-blade-works-well-on-linux-steamos-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">when I checked out the demo previously</a> I was really properly impressed with the performance of it. Although the defaults aren't the best, it does perform well. Valve noted in their checks that the first-time setup does require an internet connection and it might not default to external controllers, so you need to swap them in the Steam Deck UI. Apart from that, it seems it's good to go!</p>

<p>It goes to show that modern games can still be optimised for the lower-end devices.</p>
<p>About the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The future of humanity is balanced on the edge of a blade. Ravaged by strange, powerful creatures, Earth has been abandoned, and what is left of the decimated human race has fled to a Colony in outer space.</p>
<p>After travelling from the Colony, EVE arrives on the desolate remains of our planet with a clear-cut mission: to save humankind by reclaiming Earth from the Naytiba – the malevolent force that has devastated it.</p>
<p>But as EVE tackles the Naytiba one-by-one, piecing together the mysteries of the past in the ruins of human civilization, she realizes that her mission is far from straightforward. In fact, almost nothing is as it seems…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can't wait to dive into this one fully. Although it's going to be a while for me, the sands of Arrakis keep calling my name.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A celebration of upcoming games big and small and everything in between. Steam Next Fest for June 2025 is now live.</p>
<p>If you've been here before, you know the drill. There's hundreds of new demos that have gone live, and my inbox is positively overflowing with developers announcing demos and upcoming games. It's a good problem to have.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5g7tr5CZOMA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9eddb113fc7aa9f4e39ef63788de6f10.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5g7tr5CZOMA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Here's a few games that I think are likely worth a look (these have Native Linux builds):</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3771400/Horripilant_Demo/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Horripilant</a></p>

      <title>Team Cherry clarify Hollow Knight: Silksong will be out before the 2025 holiday season</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Team Cherry have clarified the release period for Hollow Knight: Silksong, after a bit of confusion thanks to Microsoft.</p>
<p>During the recent Xbox event, Xbox president Sarah Bond mentioned "The highly anticipated Hollow Knight: Silksong will be available at launch and in Game Pass when the Ally releases later this year". Unfortunately, some thought that meant that Silksong was launching with it. That's not the case.</p>
<p>In the official Hollow Knight Discord, Matthew Griffin who does Marketing &amp; Publishing for Team Cherry Games, stated "I confirmed BEFORE Holiday - we are not tied to a console release".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14985686241749482057gol1.png"/></p>
<p>So that narrows it down a bit again, we're getting Silksong before Christmas at least. The Silksong wait continues. The release date has become something of a meme with such wild speculation, with various news sites jumping at the chance to cover even the tiniest little change on SteamDB for it. Quite funny to watch. I bet the stress levels are high over at Team Cherry for how people are waiting on this one.</p>

      <title>Khronos Group announce the Vulkan Video Decode VP9 Extension</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another expansion of the Vulkan graphics API has arrived with the Vulkan Video Decode VP9 Extension. As announced by The Khronos Group today, with the release of version 1.4.317 of the Vulkan specification.  </p>
<p>They said that "This release completes the currently planned set of decode-related extensions, enabling developers to build platform- and vendor-independent accelerated decoding pipelines for all major modern codecs". This joins other supported codecs like H.264, H.265, and AV1 decode extensions.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5315309961749480496gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5315309961749480496gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>More details from the blog post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although VP9 predates AV1 as a codec, the Vulkan VP9 decode extension was developed after the AV1 extension and was able to build upon it. Because AV1 was based in part on VP9 and shares similar coding tools and structural elements, the existing AV1 decode extension provided a useful foundation for implementing VP9 decoding in Vulkan. This reuse of code and design benefits both implementers and users by streamlining development and ensuring consistency across supported codecs.</p>
<p>A key difference between VP9 decoding and the previous video decode extensions is that each VP9 packet is self-contained. Unlike MPEG-based codecs, which use NAL (Network Abstraction Layer) units to break bitstreams into individually parsed segments, or AV1, which uses OBUs (Open Bitstream Units), VP9 encodes all the data for a frame within a single byte array. This design simplifies parsing by eliminating the need to extract and interpret nested sub-units within the bitstream.</p>
<p>In contrast to other codecs supported by Vulkan Video, VP9 does not require global state management through a video session parameters object, making it the simplest codec to implement with a Vulkan decode extension. This simplicity makes VP9 an ideal starting point for new users or implementers looking to get started with Vulkan Video before extending support to more complex codecs. For codecs that do require session parameters, the recently merged <a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Docs/blob/main/proposals/VK_KHR_video_maintenance2.adoc" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">VK_KHR_video_maintenance2</a> extension helps simplify their management, reducing code complexity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right now <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">NVIDIA</a> have a special Vulkan Beta driver out with support added in 570.123.18. For AMD on Mesa + RADV, there's a <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/35398" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">merge request</a> open to add support too so it will come eventually to a later Mesa release.</p>

      <title>Upcoming MMO &#39;BitCraft Online&#39; will be open source</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The upcoming MMO BitCraft Online is doing something very unusual for the genre, it's going to be open source. I'll admit, I hadn't actually heard of it <em>at all</em> until someone pointed it out to me on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@s31bz@social.s31bz.com/114637031720035330" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>. Now, it's clearly on my radar.</p>
<p>It's entering Early Access on June 20th, with support for Windows and macOS. There doesn't seem to be anti-cheat mentioned for it yet, so it will likely work on Linux systems with Valve's Proton. And hey, if the open source it, perhaps community hackers will end up porting it fully to Linux.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="X_YN0Hw6AFM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/474f525bfecf94b0b9de882d8299c3a4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/X_YN0Hw6AFM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The open source note was written in an official news post back in <a href="https://bitcraftonline.com/blog/open-sourcing-bitcraft-online" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">April</a>, with the developer saying the 3 "foundational reasons" for making it open source:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>We want the genre to be more accessible</li>
<li>We think BitCraft will benefit from open source collaboration and exploration</li>
<li>We want to give something back</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Part of their work is already source available, with SpacetimeDB "an all-in-one backend server and database designed for building and running multiplayer games and apps with incredible speed" up on <a href="https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Right now it's not open source but that will be <em>eventually</em>.</p>
<p>For the game itself, they haven't noted a license yet, but they did say it will be "one of the OSI's approved open source licenses".</p>

      <title>ROG Xbox Ally Handhelds announced, the first real Steam Deck competition</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Microsoft and ASUS have formally announced the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X, what is likely the first <em>real</em> competition for the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Every time a new handheld is revealed, certain other news sites seem to clickbait into talking about how they "destroy" the Steam Deck, or they're the real competition or <em>something</em> to that effect. However, they're often with a high price and with a rough Windows experience out of the box. This time, it appears it will be different, since they're officially licensed and branded Xbox units. The first time Microsoft have gone third-party for Xbox like this too.</p>
<p>The <strong>big</strong> announcement here is that they're coming with a tweaked Windows 11 experience, with a new full-screen Xbox app, which also gets rid of various background Windows processes to make games perform better. In a way, it sounds similar to Gaming Mode on SteamOS - focusing just on the games. So Microsoft are directly addressing the biggest complaint about Windows on handhelds. Although, for now, it will be exclusive to these devices while Microsoft continue to work on it. <em>It also won't play Xbox console games, it is still a PC handheld.</em></p>
<p>Microsoft have finally woken up and are clearly trying to fight off Valve here considering the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/steam-deck-sales-still-going-strong-over-three-years-later/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ongoing popularity and sales of the Steam Deck</a>.</p>

<p>Competition is good. But, if the price isn't stupid, it does give me some <em>concerns</em> here for the Steam Deck. Considering Microsoft aren't locking it to the Microsoft Store, allowing other stores to easily be installed, this really could eat into the sales and popularity of the Steam Deck and all of Valve's Linux work for SteamOS and Proton. And as a result, make it even more difficult to get more developers to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">enable their anti-cheat</a>. The upside though, is that it will force more developers to optimize for smaller screens and gamepads.</p>
<p>Especially so, because this will likely be much more widely available in stores compared to the Steam Deck too. And, we shouldn't underestimate their new partnership with Roblox either as it will "For the first time ever" be "playable natively and optimized for gaming handhelds".</p>
<p>They're even doing a program to highlight compatibility on the devices, for games that have been optimized. So they'll have their own form of the Steam Deck Verified system for it.</p>
<p><em>I wonder how long it will be until you can put Linux on these devices…</em></p>
<p>What are your thoughts?</p>

      <title>AMD revealed two more Ryzen Z2 chips for gaming handhelds</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AMD have expanded their Ryzen Z2 offerings, with two more chips designed for handhelds. So we're likely to see even more releasing with AMD's Z2 chips, although it's getting a bit confusing now.</p>
<p>Why is it confusing? All the chips share the Z2 branding, but they're split across different generations of Zen and RDNA. The new top-end chip with the AI Z2 Extreme is exactly the same as the Z2 Extreme, just with an NPU enabled because they simply must have an AI offering for handhelds apparently. The other is the Z2 A, which looks suspiciously like the Steam Deck's APU with an extra possible 5W TDP at the higher-end.</p>
<p>So nothing truly major here, but it could mean we end up seeing more lower-cost handhelds come out with a chip that's very similar the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Here's the new line-up:</p>

      <title>Mesa 25.1.3 emergency update released for AMD Radeon RX 9000 series (RDNA4)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Eric Engestrom announced the release of Mesa 25.1.3, an unscheduled emergency release to fix AMD GFX12 (RDNA4 - Radeon RX 9000 series).</p>
<p>From the release announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is an emergency release, out of the normal schedule, to fix a regression for AMD GFX12 (RDNA4) users who have an old firmware.</p>
<p>The next bugfix release is still due at the previously scheduled date, on June 18th.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The changelog simply notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>25.1.2 - instant crash on upgrade, very first attempt at a new surface</li>
</ul>

<p>With that in mind you'll be okay waiting on the next update if you're not on an RDNA4 GPU. Here's the release schedule:</p>

      <title>Highlight announcements from the 2025 summer showcases</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We had a lot of events over the weekend, so here's a round-up of some interesting game announcements to keep you up to date.</p>
<p>I don't know whose bright idea it was to have event after event after event…and then more events, as if anyone can really keep up with that. All it does is rapidly bury various games, it doesn't give enough time. So silly in fact that Valve made the "Steam's Summer Showcase of Summer Showcases" <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/summer_showcase_2025" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">event page</a>. But anyway, enough moaning from me, I've picked out a bunch you might want to keep an eye on.</p>
<h4><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Hollow Knight: Silksong will release in 2025</a></h4>
<p>From Team Cherry.</p>
<p>Yes, really. At least, that's what Microsoft's Sarah Bond said during their handheld announcement (I'll talk more on that later). Nothing to actually show for this one, as it wasn't a full announcement but I thought you Hollow Knight fanatics would like to see it mentioned. <em>Just keep an eye on the Steam page.</em></p>
<h4><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2001760/Beast_of_Reincarnation/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Beast of Reincarnation</a></h4>
<p>From GAME FREAK inc. (Pokemon developers).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In post-apocalyptic Japan, humanity’s last hope may rest with Emma and her loyal canine companion, Koo. Explore what it means to be human in Beast of Reincarnation, an expansive one-person, one-dog action RPG built around demanding, technical combat. What awaits at journey’s end?</p>

<p>From Coincidence (Zachtronics devs).</p>

      <title>A sports brawler meets a MOBA in Sparkball with a demo coming to Steam Next Fest</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you love sports and fast-paced action, Sparkball will be one you need to check out with a playable demo coming in Steam Next Fest.</p>
<p>What is it? Sparkball pits two teams of four in fast-paced, high-stakes matches where players brawl, block, and score in a futuristic arena. Matches are short, intense, and highly replayable, making the game easy to pick up but tough to master. The game celebrates versatility, rewarding both "ballin' and brawlin'", with the top players effortlessly blending them as each unique situation demands. Whether blocking shots, setting up plays, scoring goals, or simply out-duelling your opponent, there’s something to love for every type of gamer.</p>
<p>For the demo and release, I've been told there will be "no anti-cheat at this stage (regardless of platform)" and their focus is on Steam Deck support for it too. So looks like potentially another fun multiplayer title we can play with Valve's Proton on Linux systems.</p>

<p>Created by Opti Games which has developers who previously worked on the likes of League of Legends, World of Warcraft, Overwatch and more. From the rather brief actual gameplay in the trailer, it looks very chaotic. Exactly my kind of thing.</p>
<p>Highlights from the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A Genre-Bending Mix – A first-of-its-kind multiplayer sports brawler where precision, teamwork, and quick thinking rule the field.</li>
<li>Short, Replayable Matches – Easy to pick up, hard to master — perfect for quick sessions, endless hours of ranked grind, and a rowdy Friday night session with friends.</li>
<li>Something for Everyone – Unique blend of gameplay ensures that no matter your primary genre of choice, you’ll find something to love in Sparkball</li>
<li>Steam Deck Compatibility – Built to play beautifully on the go.</li>
<li>Streaming and Esports Ready – Contagiously fun to watch casually with proven traction in competitive circles with C9, TL, FNC, and more!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>When the demo goes live during Steam Next Fest (June 9th), they will give out an exclusive in-game skin to anyone who plays the time-limited demo.</p>

      <title>Build a kingdom and watch overpowered tiny armies fight in 9 Kings</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>9 Kings is a fast-paced roguelike kingdom builder where you get to watch tiny armies fight and it's surprisingly absorbing of your time. <em>Note: personal purchase.</em></p>
<p>This is not a kingdom / city builder like you may think. It's nothing like say Manor Lords, Crusader Kings, Civilization or anything resembling any of them. It blends in a weird mixture of a kingdom builder, with semi-auto battling and a sort-of deck-builder into something that just isn't like anything else. </p>
<p>You pick a king and then get given a plot of land to place your castle. From there, you have only a few squares to place down cards which form units and buildings to begin building your army. Each turn an enemy king sends their army to fight you, and the battles are mostly automatic apart from you using your castle ability (like throwing a big rock or lightning bolts) as units fight automatically on the field. It's a tug of war game, as you repeatedly expand your little kingdom gradually with more squares to place things down and power up your armies with various cards, to keep up with the next little invasion from an enemy king.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14967877751749223068gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14967877751749223068gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's very much another numbers-go-up type of experience. One where you build up the most insanely overpowered combination that you can, while also getting to watch little pixel people get crushed.</p>
<p>The game just goes on and on and on with each turn being a year, while you pick new cards and upgrades and eventually you'll have amassed a ridiculous assortment of troops of all kinds. From standard soldiers to flying demons there's a lot of variety in how you build your little pixel army. Eventually you come up against the boss battle and if you win it's game over, or you can choose to play endlessly with a warning how it's "experimental" so there will be issues.</p>
<p>As you progress you unlock more kings, each with a different set of cards for buildings and units. You can also level up each king, to put points into meta-progression perks like unlocking more plots at the start to build on or levelling up your castle to higher levels.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="C3kInX4YNUY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/eed52e47597f954112a471bc05156e7a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/C3kInX4YNUY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Another game that's very accessible too, since you pretty much only use the mouse and a single button. And especially nice is that each year (turn) you can just save, quit and come back to it anytime. Great for busy people and people with hours to spare alike.</p>
<p>It's in Early Access, and in my time playing it, there's been a few bugs that have forced me to reload it but it saves often so not a big problem. Hopefully as development goes on they can ensure it's stable. I've seen various reports from others on the same, so it's not Linux specific. Otherwise, it works just fine with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a> on Desktop Linux.</p>
<p>A tentative recommendation because it's enjoyable but a little unstable and the balance needs constant work as they add more to it. I really like it though and think you will too. <em>Now if you'll excuse me my kingdom needs me. Time for another run.</em></p>

      <title>Sol Cesto is a super weird tactical roguelite with rad art all about luck and pulling teeth</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It was the art style of Sol Cesto that first pulled me in, now I'm hooked on the roguelite slot-machine like mechanics of it. <em>Note: personal purchase. It's in Early Access so this is just an initial thoughts review.</em></p>
<p>Luck is the name of the game. You start off by choosing a hero and then descend ever deeper into a constantly-changing dungeon. The hook here is how the dungeon is presented, which is <em>very</em> much like a slot machine full of treasures and monsters. You click a row, and randomly drop into one of the squares and see the result. A chest? More money, a monster? Fight it and potentially lose some health. It's the whole risk versus reward situation having you constantly decide if another click in the current dungeon level is worth it. Pushing your luck can bring great benefits, or death.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3506304231749214546gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3506304231749214546gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>While your movements are completely random, the way it's all presented is perfectly clear. You can tell easily at a glance what each creature can do to you, or any special abilities they have.</p>
<p>On each floor you have to do a minimum amount of successful movements to open the door, which allows you to move onto the next level of the dungeon. This may give you more slot-machine like picks or various other events like a bucket to drop money in to spend on permanent upgrades later, another has you stick your hand into a machine to gain more attack power and so on. I just love seeing all the artwork in this, it's awesome to look at in a creepy sort of way. The music in it definitely helps that uneasy feeling too.</p>
<p>The events system <em>initially</em> bugged me a bit though, since they're all locked behind a star progression system. Once I got the hang of it after a few runs though, their design became clear and it's all part of tickling your brain into wanting just one more run. The bucket event I mentioned, this is the key. When you lose a run and go back to the character screen, you get to spend money on the stars in the sky to expand the game and unlock more of the events system. It's actually a rather interesting progression system. But still, more events open from the start would just really help the experience.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18334209851749216001gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18334209851749216001gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Anyway, what's this about teeth? This game is thoroughly bizarre. One of the events you unlock early on is a statue that gives you a choice between two teeth to pull out, each having various run-altering effects that stack up as you build up your tooth collection.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4545988541749215146gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4545988541749215146gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20262587751749215145gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20262587751749215145gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>You can unlock various characters, each of which have different abilities to aid you in your dungeon crawling. For example: one character can use their ability to drop into any random square vertically, rather than just picking a row and going into any square horizontally. </p>
<p>There's also a shop and inventory system, where you can build up a few single-use items to help you on your run. Like an arrow to fire at a specific square to remove a monster, a health potion, a shield against a single attack and more. This is again where the risk vs rewards system comes into play. Do you save your money for the shop to get items so you can get further into a run? Or, do you put loads of money into the bucket to unlock some stars when you die? Lots to think about during a run even though it's all simple single-clicking (so it's quite accessible too).</p>
<p>The character death animation and voice-over really make me chuckle every time too. So insanely weird. I also love the way the enemy creatures have two different animated styles between them overpowering you and being an easy kill. There's a lot of little touches to love about Sol Cesto.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0X451SngYxY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/202a5a1ccdeee7e4ffc0dde5f38822fe.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0X451SngYxY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's absolutely mesmerising.</p>
<p>Sol Cesto is in Early Access and works great on Desktop Linux with the latest Proton 9.0-4. The Steam Overlay didn't work though, which is a common problem with games built using web tech.</p>

      <title>Net.Attack() is like Vampire Survivors but you program unique attacks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now this is seriously cool! Net.Attack() takes the basics of Vampire Survivors, and gets you doing a little visual programming.</p>
<p>The basics are all here with you moving around an arena, taking down enemies and collecting XP gems to level up and gain some boosts. A major difference here is that your attacks are manually crafted using visual programming with little logic gates, which really makes it stand out in a now very crowded genre.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7600377051749207683gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>How it works — you move around the arena and collect money from hijacking various computer chips by standing on them for a certain amount of time. Then, you move into a node-based attack-building screen (available any time during a run), to buy new blocks and stick them all together. You do so by purchasing nodes, and then connecting them up from your initial OnTick block and then will all execute in order, which enables you to make some truly weird and wonderful combinations.</p>
<p>An example here (click the below image to make it bigger) is that I had an initial run set up to fire a single laser each tick. And, if I got a perfect hit to then fire another from <em>that</em> enemy to another enemy, which has a code block to split into three lasers and at the <em>same</em> time produce a circular electric shockwave from that enemy. The result was quite explosive.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21218131101749209881gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21218131101749209881gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's a few different characters with different starting code blocks too. I think the developer has an absolutely brilliant idea here, and I really can't wait to see more from this one on how many insane builds you can make with the mixture of nodes and level-up buffs.</p>
<p>I tested the demo on Desktop Linux with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a> without a problem.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Near-Mage is a brand new hand-painted adventure from Stuck In Attic, who also made Gibbous - A Cthulhu Adventure. One I somehow missed from the end of last month, it has Native Linux support just like their previous game and it really does look absolutely gorgeous.</p>
<p>Near-Mage is a dark yet heartfelt journey through a fantastical world inspired by the developers’ homeland. Featuring hand-painted visuals and traditional animation reminiscent of Ghibli films, classic Disney, and European comic books, the game blends whimsical storytelling with cosmic horror undertones.</p>
<p>You just turned 18. You’re far away from your parents. You just found out you’re a witch. What could go wrong? Check out the trailer below:</p>

      <title>Dragon Lands is Forager meets a creature collector and it looks real sweet</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One now on my radar is Dragon Lands, a sweet looking mixture of an incremental game about creature collection, farming, crafting and automation.</p>
<p>The developer noted in an email they think it's like a mixture of the game Forager and To The Core for the basics but with creature collecting too. That idea alone had me sold pretty quickly. They mentioned clearly in their email that Steam Deck is a supported platform for the game. So it should run with no problems on Desktop Linux with Proton too.</p>
<p>Check out the reveal trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="oqxOo6bOTtM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/024d37d9e04b8ee3f9505356cbe581fe.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/oqxOo6bOTtM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>And the main gameplay trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NP6bs4TXm88"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fa4cb076cfa679c4b93599bfdf064bdd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NP6bs4TXm88" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>You will start by gathering and collecting resources, from common stone and wood, to rare gems and even dragons! Use them to unlock and craft new buildings, skills and more.</li>
<li>Collect Dragons with unique abilities. As you progress through the game, you will use them to automate your farming and production.</li>
<li>Experiment with a vast crafting system to create tools, buildings, magical items, and more. Uncover rare recipes and push your production to the limit!</li>
<li>Explore the upgrade skill tree, learn new abilities and level-up your Dragons.</li>
<li>This game takes inspiration from masterpieces like Forager, Nova Lands, Outpath, To The Core and Nodebuster!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's quite some ways off though with a release planned for Q2 2026.</p>

      <title>Borderlands 2 is free to claim and keep on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's a big Borderlands Franchise Sale on Steam, and you can get a free to keep copy of Borderlands 2 for a limited time. It's still one of the best co-op shooters around, even with how many years ago it was released.</p>
<p>All you have to do is go to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/49520/Borderlands_2/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> page when logged in and hit the "Add to Account" button. You have until June 8th, 5PM UTC to claim it for keeps. It has an old Native Linux port and it also runs well with Proton.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/179828261749201232gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I wouldn't be doing my duty if I didn't mention the recent reviews situation, as users have pushed it into "Overwhelmingly Negative". A similar situation with other older Borderlands games on Steam with their reviews.</p>
<p>Why? It seems to be mixture of updates to the Terms of Service / <a href="http://store.steampowered.com//eula/49520_eula_0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">EULA</a> by Take-Two Interactive (who own the publisher 2K), along with a <em>stupid</em> comment from Gearbox's Randy Pitchford on X/Twitter in <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1922454876803551555" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reply</a> to a user concerned about the price:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2618464381749201732gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>As for the EULA, I don't know exactly what's different and the games <em>haven't</em> been updated so aren't doing anything they weren't doing so before. It's mostly just the usual lawyer speak for companies to cover their butt, along with keeping up with newer regulations across different regions. Some of the claims I've seen about it being "spyware" are just over-blowing it into pure 100% exaggeration.</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s the games to claim from Prime Gaming for June 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A fresh month and new games to claim via Prime Gaming for June 2025. Here's what compatibility you can expect for Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Interestingly, for June 2025 the list is actually quite <em>short</em>, and there's nothing included across the month from the Epic Store. So we might be seeing an end to Prime Gaming and Epic teaming up for giving away games like this. I've updated the table as it is for today anyway.</p>
<p>I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"/> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play. Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now.</p>
<p>You can install games from Epic, GOG and Amazon easily via <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/heroic-launcher-for-epic-gog-amazon-games-on-linux-steamos-v2-17-released/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Heroic Games Launcher</a> with Prime giving you a code for each game for whatever store it's on. For any games that use anti-cheat be sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat compatibility page</a> to see their status.</p>
<p><em>The table is sorted by the End date with those ending soon at the top.</em></p>

      <title>NVIDIA reveal more GeForce NOW titles for June including Dune: Awakening and FBC: Firebreak</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now that NVIDIA have an official GeForce NOW app for Steam Deck, you can do even more gaming.

<p>As a reminder — with this cloud gaming service you use your own games you have from other stores, so you don't lose anything if you stop paying or if they ever decided to shut it. Your games will still be on whatever store.</p>
<p>Considering quite a few games have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">annoying anti-cheat</a> that blocks Linux systems, it's an interesting way to still play some of the bigger multiplayer games.</p>

      <title>Move over Stardew, it&#39;s time for Cattle Country</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for your next casual game after Stardew Valley? Cattle Country is a good choice with a big sense of adventure.<strong> </strong><em>Note: key provided by their PR team.</em></p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I love Stardew but I burned out on it long ago. It's a great game but I needed something new and fresh and Cattle Country thankfully fits the bill perfectly for me. From Castle Pixel, the team that also made the Blossom Tales series, it's a big mixture of things that will give you a whole lot to do. From tending crops, raising cattle, or rustlin’ up friendships with the townsfolk, there's always something.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qttnZq5qOb4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cc8557717bed734557cddc87afce9580.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qttnZq5qOb4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>If you've played Stardew Valley, Roots of Pacha, Fields of Mistria or any other 2D casual farming life sim, you'll know a fair bit of what to expect. Here though it's a wild-western adventure, with everything fitting quite nicely into the theme and of course that includes a few bandits along with way too. So perhaps a little bit less casual than others, but it's enough to spice things up a little to keep me interested. However, the game does have options when you make a new save to entirely turn off enemies — so you can play it entirely casually without fuss.</p>
<p>For fans of their previous series Blossom Tales, you'll be happy to see their familiar visual style has been kept here although they've clearly upped the production value on it somewhat, with textures that have a fair bit more depth and life to them. It's not quite as retro looking but still pixel art. Lovely though, my first thought when starting the game was just how sweet it all looked.</p>
<p>A nice introduction too, with you being walked to your plot and then given all the basic tools and tent that you'll need to survive. After that, you're basically on your own to do as you see fit, along with a few basic starter quests with more quests available the more you explore and talk to people.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3693734461749125465gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3693734461749125465gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8417097801749125466gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/8417097801749125466gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Thankfully, your tools don't have any durability system as it keeps it all very chill so you can just keep on expanding as far as the land will let you. Although, there is an energy system for your character, with you not being able to actually do all that much in a single day before you'll start doing a rather sweet little yawn and eventually pass out if you don't make it to bed. I'll admit I abruptly laughed the first time my character passed out, the way it's done is just funny. Expensive though, you get hauled over to the doctor and have to pay for the privilege of being carried to their bed. Seems like they took some inspiration from the ridiculous US health system, extortionate pricing for the doc. Going to bed early is definitely the way to go, with no drawbacks I'm aware of.</p>
<p>There's also a health system which you'll need to keep an eye on or it will cost you. For both health and energy, there's various ways to increase them during the day via foraging, making food and more.</p>
<p>Cattle Country's world feels so darn alive too. Everywhere you go you're being watched by rabbits, birds, squirrels, deer and more. Of course there's a fishing mini-game too, which is all about tapping the button in the right places across a few staged to reel it in. Similar to the shooting, which is it's own little mini-game as well. They're not the only mini-games either. Oh, and those animals? Some don't like you very much, like what appears to be a Vulture that will come swooping down to scratch you. Taking them down is easy though, and gives you a few extra useful feathers.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20125403001749125325gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20125403001749125325gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The progress system is a nice one here. After you go through the initial start, you can really do pretty much anything, as long as you've spoken to the right people to get access to what you need. But right from the start you get access to craft and buy as much of anything as you want (funding allowing of course). That said, as you do more and level up, you will get access to more to build and cook so there progression is sprinkled in but not too slowly. You'll also need to level up your relationships with a few people to access more too. So exploring and chatting is <em>necessary</em> here.</p>
<p>And, naturally, what's a good farming game like this without some mining? There's that too. However, unlike others, it completely swaps the viewpoint to be more like Terraria. Not just in style, the mining actually really does more resemble Terraria with platforms and torches too. I really wasn't expecting that, but it's a nice touch to make the game feel like it has that little bit more depth to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11474580041749123096gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11474580041749123096gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's a lot more to it with events that happen as you progress through, which I won't spoil, but it's lovely how the game opens up as you go through it.</p>
<p>It came out of the gate a little rough, but the developers have been releasing update after update with lots of bug fixes and smaller little quality of life features that it now seems like it's in a great state to go and pick it up. </p>
<p>The Steam store page at time of writing this note only states "Partial Controller Support", but it works without problems with my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/the-8bitdo-ultimate-2-wireless-controller-is-a-top-premium-feeling-controller/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">8BitDo Ultimate 2</a>. Although, one little complaint, I really dislike the way you put down crops, water them and put down items, I find it seriously fiddly on a controller to get the right square lined up. </p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ranchin’ &amp; Handcraftin’</strong> - Roll up your sleeves and build your dream homestead from the ground up. Raise cattle, craft tools, and carve out your slice of paradise under those big blue skies.</li>
<li><strong>Swappin’ Stories</strong> - Meet a tough but kind-hearted community. Lend a hand, share a tale, and maybe find yourself a few lifelong friends.</li>
<li><strong>Beware of Bandits</strong> - Not all folks are friendly. Defend your ranch and keep an eye out for trouble brewing on the horizon.</li>
<li><strong>Rodeos to Romance</strong> - From bonds of friendship to sparks of love, get to know 18 romanceable characters and see where your heart leads.</li>
<li><strong>Buried Treasure</strong> - Grab a pickaxe and strike it rich! Explore mines full of rare minerals, secrets, and maybe a bandit stash or two.</li>
<li><strong>Trackin’ Wildlife</strong> - The wilderness is teemin’ with critters. Hunt for survival or simply roam and admire nature’s bounty.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Cattle Country has Native Linux support and Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified. So you're good to go on other SteamOS systems too.</p>
<p>Overall it's a lovely game well worth your time that sticks quite close to the inspiration of other similar casual farming life sims, but thanks to the setting it does enough to keep things interesting with the wild west. Absolutely filled full of charm and an easy recommendation.</p>

      <title>Heroic Launcher v2.17.1 released - fixing games not launching on Linux, SteamOS, Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Heroic Games Launcher has a bug-fix released out with v.2.17.1 bringing some essential fixes, like games not launching.</p>
<p>A change to the way the launcher updated DXVK (Direct3D to Vulkan translator) was included in a previous release, which unfortunately caused a bunch of issues with launching games on Linux systems (like SteamOS / Steam Deck) due to it hitting GitHub's rate-limit and blocking it. This has been reverted since it was problematic, so now all games should launch properly again. </p>
<p>On top of that Proton is now listed first in the Wine list (since that's what most people will be using), and the newer game pages <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/heroic-launcher-for-epic-gog-amazon-games-on-linux-steamos-v2-17-released/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">introduced in the big v2.17 release</a> have an enhanced responsive design.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10862599201749110715gol1.jpg"/></p>

      <title>FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles announced for September 30</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Square Enix have officially announced FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles, which will be releasing September 30th. Yep, it's real and it's getting a Steam release so you'll be able to play the much-loved classic on Linux, SteamOS, Steam Deck thanks to Proton.</p>
<p>More about it: originally released in 1997 for the PlayStation, later gaining a version in 2007 for the PlayStation Portable.  FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles is a tactical RPG that tells the true history of a troubled land. Following the death of the king, a mere boy of two ascends the throne. That means whoever is named regent essentially rules the land. Two dukes vie for the position - Goltanna the Black Lion and Larg the White Lion. These powerful figures are destined to clash, and the resulting conflict would become known as the War of the Lions.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UKRoOtl7weI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/19549066845115a060fdc1a23d3f0475.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UKRoOtl7weI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While the original classic is included, this new edition will have some improvements for those who want it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>A brand-new user interface</strong> - the game’s UI has been completely overhauled to make the game even more approachable and intuitive. It’s now quicker and easier to control your units, see turn order and more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Updated visuals</strong> - the game’s graphics have been reworked to look great on HD displays. The vibrant 3D battlegrounds and detailed pixel art have never looked so good!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Voice acting</strong> - The story now features full voice acting in English and Japanese from a talented cast, including Joe Pitts (Ramza), Gregg Lowe (Delita), Hannah Melbourn (Agrias), Timothy Watson (Cidolfus), Harry McEntire (Mustadio), Ben Starr (Dycedarg), and cameos by Cody Christian (Cloud Strife from FINAL FANTASY VII remake series) and Briana White (Aerith Gainsborough from FINAL FANTASY VII remake series).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tactical View</strong> - this new feature makes it easier to get the lay of the land and plan your actions across the battlefield.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Battle speed</strong> - Speed up battles to fly through them faster. It’s great if you want to blow through easy fights or quickly practice with different team compositions!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>New difficulty levels</strong> - Do you want to really test your tactics, or are you in it more for the story? New difficulty levels let you adjust the game to your playstyle!</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The Steam page is supposed to be live, but seems like they forgot to set it public, so it should be up soon. Looks like it will be about £50. Nice to see we're getting it on PC right away.</p>

      <title>DELTARUNE is now on Steam with Chapters 1-4 available</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer tobyfox has released DELTARUNE on Steam, their follow-up to the smash-hit UNDERTALE and it's a game that's just insanely hard to describe.</p>
<p>Even the creator has a hard time talking about what exactly it is noting "I don't know what you call this kind of game. It's just a game you can play after you complete UNDERTALE, if you want to". Is it actually connected to UNDERTALE? Well, that's not entirely clear either. The developer said "It's a different world that might even have different rules. That doesn't mean there will be no connections at all though". Okay then. It's one of those you just have to play it to get it situations.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yDzgiGdekas"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/68a5be8e3468372eff6d263543189856.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yDzgiGdekas" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's been such a long time coming and such a big event for fans, the developer in the latest newsletter basically told you to stay off social media if you don't want to see spoilers. </p>
<p>You won't get any from me though, I haven't even played Chapter 1. Both this and UNDERTALE just fly a bit over my head. Yeah, yeah — I know, I'm missing out. I'll get around to them one day. Our resident contributor Samsai is the UNDERTALE / DELTARUNE nut who said to me "I have awaited for this day for aeons". Perhaps now there's more of it, I might blast through it in one go, being patient (just kidding, it's a long backlog) sure does pay off.</p>
<p>So what the heck is it? A retro-styled episodic RPG, with battles that you can resolve peacefully or through violence. </p>
<p>It's playable with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a> on Linux systems and Valve just today rated it Steam Deck Verified! As i was writing this the game hit 113,894 concurrent players on Steam — wow, that was fast.</p>

      <title>Monster Train 2 is a seriously incredible deck-builder</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Taking all the good about Monster Train and just making it a whole lot bigger, Monster Train 2 is an excellent deck-building game. <em>Disclosure: key provided by the developer.</em></p>
<p>I have far too many hours to count across many different deck-builders and yet, Monster Train 2 might now be my actual proper favourite in the genre because there's just so much about it to enjoy. Thanks to all the content and the way you play through it, along with the endless mode you really could just put this on that list of games you would take with you onto a desert island. It will keep you going on and on forever, with each play-through feeling thoroughly fresh and exciting.</p>
<p>The sheer amount of options you're constantly presented with and the brilliant way it blends different genres together. It's not just a deck-builder, it's also a bit tower defence too which is what really helps set it apart from the likes of Slay the Spire (that's also just brilliant). Monster Train 2 is all about keeping your train moving by protecting your Pyre at the top.</p>

<p>In most deck-builders of this sort, you're given a few creatures and then your attack cards to battle across a single floor per level (think Slay the Spire again). Unlike others though, in Monster Train 2 you battle across multiple floors at the same time, positioning your creatures in each of them to prevent enemies boarding the train to reach your Pyre at the top. <em>So in that sense, it's a bit like you're playing multiple games at the same time.</em></p>
<p>The battles go on in multiple waves of enemies boarding your train, until their champion arrives for you to kill or be killed. The battle system itself is quite clever too.</p>
<p>At the start of your turn you can place down more creatures in each floor up to a cost limit, use a spell to take down enemy health, buff up a creature with an item and so on. Then when you end your turn, it’s like an auto-battler as each team fights and enemies move on up the floors towards your Pyre. Your Pyre has its own health and attack power, so it’s not the end if enemies get to the top (they will often), it’s about wearing them all down as much as you possibly can.</p>
<p>Between battles you'll be actually moving your train between stations. This is where you then get to pick between different tracks, each of which have their own set of locations to use like merchants to upgrade cards or purge cards, event locations to pick between options and plenty more.</p>

<p>The upgrade system is ridiculous, as you can really make some insanely powerful cards. A fun quick example is the Pyreclasm spell card that causes a lot of explosive damage. I upgraded it to give even more damage, then i paid to make it cost less to use but it would be consumed (only use once per battle), but then pay more again to remove the consumed status and so end up with a single very powerful card ready to help destroy a boss.</p>

<em>Pictured - Monster Train 2 on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>And then, on top of all that, I was able to duplicate the card. I just love the masses of options and upgrades you can do.</p>
<p>Really, I'm barely able to scratch the surface of what the game features and what I think about it in this article. I don't really do hyperbole but I really do think it's one of the best deck-builders ever made. More than a little overwhelming at the start though, especially the way it just throws you in at the deep end with a few helpful hints, it's more like a trial by fire getting into it but it's absolutely worth it.</p>
<p>The greatest thing though? It has an undo button! Hooray! Begone miss-clicks of doom! It winds back to the start of the current turn, giving you a chance at a do-over. Lovely.</p>
<p>If you loved the first game, you'll feel right at home with this as it's basically a no-brainer to go and pick up. For everyone else who just like deck-builders, you can forget about being on the fence — you'll love it too. Works to perfection on Desktop Linux with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a> and is a thoroughly good time on Steam Deck too (Valve rated it Deck Verified). Haven't had any crashes and performance is perfect.</p>

      <title>VacuumTube is the best way to watch YouTube on Steam Deck, SteamOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Watching YouTube on Steam Deck / SteamOS? You need to grab VacuumTube which makes the whole experience a lot nicer. This is <em>not</em> a custom client, instead it wraps Google's own "YouTube Leanback" that's used for consoles and smart TVs in Electron and pretends to be the official YouTube app (as Google block it on PCs).</p>
<p>Quite a clever solution, although one Google is probably not particularly happy to see. Especially since it has a built-in adblocker too. The result is that for Steam Deck, SteamOS and any other media centre PC you just get an overall better experience when compared with running YouTube via the web browser.</p>
<p>It's available on <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/rocks.shy.VacuumTube" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Flathub</a>, so you can install it in Desktop Mode via the Discover store. See <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-extra-software-apps-and-games-on-steamos-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my guide on installing extra software</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18596156551749045309gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>When you've added it to Steam and launch it in Gaming Mode, it feels like it was made for the Steam Deck / SteamOS systems. Controller support out of the box too, making it the perfect YouTube companion for you.</p>
<p>It just goes to show how easy it would actually be for Google to do directly. Just like how we have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-get-geforce-now-on-steam-deck-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an official GeForce NOW app for the Steam Deck</a> too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17830482031749045399gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The code is on <a href="https://github.com/shy1132/VacuumTube" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, it's open source.</p>
<p>Hope you find it useful! I certainly do.</p>

      <title>Ricave is a quirky first-person 3D roguelike dungeon crawler with some fun interactions</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ricave is a thoroughly quirky and unique first-person, 3D roguelike dungeon crawler, now available in Early Access and worth a look. <em>Disclosure: the developer sent a key.</em></p>
<p>From Polish solo developer Piotr Walczak, it's quite impressive what they've built here with all the systems that work together. You will do a big mixture of exploring, fighting, looting, swimming, spell casting, trap setting, discovering secrets and more across various randomly generated dungeons.<em> It's all about outsmarting your enemies in this one.</em></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UPFXckCbqL0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ebdd94e7bab02e4b92cfbf1e4d811321.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UPFXckCbqL0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's entirely deterministic, which is a full utilised feature so you can rewind time to try something else and doing the same thing will always provide the same result. As they said, there's no cheesing your way through this one. Well, I'm sure I'll still find a way to do plenty of stupid things.</p>
<p>The combat and health tracking are quite fun and interesting in this one too. You can directly target body parts during combat, but so can your enemy. Damage to your eyes causes blindness, missing arms limit item interactions, a missing leg will slow you down and so on. And then there's also various status effects from illnesses to starvation. Ricave certainly has a lot going for it.</p>
<p>At its core, it's a roguelike though, and so it can be a thorough challenge. However, it's quite inviting with that challenge thanks to the accessible interface and colourful design. That, and a full tutorial that will teach you the basics properly but naturally there's a lot you're left to discover through trial and error, especially when it comes to all the different items and enemy types.</p>
<p>If you enjoy a good dungeon crawler, it's time to give Ricave a go and see what you think. It has Native Linux support now in Early Access. A game that clearly deserves a lot more attention and sales.</p>

      <title>Tempest Rising is truly an RTS worth your time for C&amp;C fans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tempest Rising is a thoroughly great RTS that's worth picking up, giving us a modern classic that all Command &amp; Conquer fans will love. <em>Disclosure: key provided by the developer.</em></p>
<p>Especially me! After growing up with Command &amp; Conquer, Red Alert and Tiberian Sun I was itching to play through Tempest Rising and when it comes to the single-player it does not disappoint. Thanks to Valve's Proton, it also runs just perfectly on Desktop Linux. A true love letter to the classics, welcoming to newcomers and veterans of the genre alike that's crammed full of action. With an easy to understand UI, along with a campaign that starts slow to ease you in with the controls.</p>
<p>All parts of it truly feel like they took the original Command &amp; Conquer series, and just made it a whole lot more modern with a familiar but still unique story. I could go on and on about how it looks and feels like C&amp;C and that to me is a good thing, it's a genre that just isn't anywhere near as popular as it once was, and many developers have tried to mix up the gameplay mechanics and often fail. Here it just feels like home to me.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="L_w9CLj8P5E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8563d50f68f8c9944798ab9d18b381f8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/L_w9CLj8P5E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Set in an alternate timeline (of course it is) and now in 1997 where the world has been torn apart by the Cuban Missile Crisis, which just kept escalating and so plenty of nukes were fired. What you get is a post World War 3 era that is now being overrun by a mysterious thing called the "Tempest". It looks like a plant, appears to spread like one, but it's not and it has some rather peculiar properties. I don't want to spoil too much of it, but it again goes back to the C&amp;C roots with a bit of mystery and eventually someone else comes knocking at Earth's door.</p>
<p>There's even various optional mission intro cut-scenes, but no real-life actors like the cheesiness from the classics. The animated characters do <em>look</em> great though, the developers did a good job on them but they're not overly interesting or attention-grabbing. However, I did like that you can talking to them and ask a few questions to get a bit more insight into the lore of the world. Thankfully, the actual gameplay is a real blast. I do like the distinctness of the sides too from the units to the cut-scenes, they're very different feeling.</p>
<p>With a clear gameplay loop of base-building, harvesting resources and then sending off your units to go destroy the enemy, it's all very clear-cut in the missions. Like any good base-building RTS, it starts off rather simply as it introduces you to the mechanics but will rapidly expand your arsenal and you'll have a lot to think about.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7848830981749041284gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Partly due to all the different unit abilities and the population cap you have to keep an eye one when building units, sprinkling in a little Starcraft into the mixture which really does add nicely to the experience, and will ensure it constantly keeps your undivided attention. The construction system is a nice touch on it too, instead of clicking through buildings in the side-panel and waiting to place them once money has been put into them, you can place them right away and they'll build one after the other in order as your money ticks down. So you can do a little planning.</p>
<p>With thanks to all the unit abilities, it's not just a straight up attack-move into combat game. It does take time to learn how to best use each individual type of unit, so there's more actual strategy to it all. Rather than just click, move and wait it's more about searching your surroundings and thinking on what unit and abilities will work best - so it's just that bit more interesting. However, that said, it's also not even strictly necessary, you can still treat it like a meat-grinder if you wish, it just might take a bit longer to get through.</p>
<p>On a technical level, the game does perform really well. Surprisingly so for an Unreal Engine game too. It's not a particularly intense looking game graphically, but don't get me wrong the overall design is fantastic. Performance has not been an issue with it smoothly sailing over 100FPS for me on the highest settings. No issues at all with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-4</a>.</p>
<p><em>I haven't tested online play these thoughts are just from the solo campaign.</em></p>
<p>With two different campaigns to play through that give quite a number of hours of gaming, Tempest Rising is fun and explosive base-building strategy in pure form and I loved every second of it.</p>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Classic RTS base building with fast and fluid hard-hitting combat.</li>
<li>3 asymmetrical factions, (2 playable at launch), each featuring distinct economy and play styles.</li>
<li>Each faction offers a unique roster of units.</li>
<li>2 epic single player campaigns with between-mission cutscenes.</li>
<li>Skirmish, custom games, and ranked multiplayer matchmaking with Glicko-2 rating.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Re-establish a haven for the lost dwarven civilization in Regions of Ruin: Runegate</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Regions of Ruin: Runegate has just been announced from Gameclaw Studio, a fresh explorative RPG hack-and-slash adventure full of dwarfs. It was originally going to be called Regions of Ruin 2 by the looks of it.</p>
<p>More about it from the dev: "Regions of Ruin: Runegate - an explorative RPG hack-and-slash adventure where you attempt to re-establish a haven for the lost dwarven civilization. All that remains of the once-glorious people is dust, scattered exiles, and monster-infested landscapes. Journey across varied lands, help those in need, gather resources and fight off goblins and monsters as you slowly rebuild a home for your fellow dwarfs".</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="r7q3I3rdwAE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9f4c3b4181599ab2cfeeedd80ab210be.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/r7q3I3rdwAE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The former land of the dwarves is as diverse as it is vast, filled with rich veins of resources, loyal allies and fearsome foes. Journey through lush environments, treacherous weather, glowing crystal-filled caverns and more in your pursuits for riches and information. And be prepared to carve your path through relentless enemies, hell-bent on sending the last of the dwarves into extinction.</p>
<p>On your travels, you will encounter dwarven allies in need of assistance. Come to their aid, enlist their help and create a safe haven for your people by rebuilding a civilization. By gathering resources and meeting skilled adventurers, you will be able to unlock new facilities and technologies, furthering your pursuits.</p>
<p>Shape your dwarven hero from their appearance to their preferred style of fighting, through a range of weapons, gear and skill trees for you to explore and experiment with. Approach each encounter as you deem best: Dive straight into the fray with a spear in hand or sneak up close and stab a goblin in the back. Just remember - stay vigilant while fighting, for enemies will adapt to your actions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their previous games Meeple Station and Regions Of Ruin have Native Linux support and it appears this will too.</p>

      <title>Dandelion Void from Project Zomboid modders will offer up plant-based horrors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Originating from a team of Project Zomboid modders, Manzanita Interactive announced Dandelion Void featuring deadly plant-based creatures. It definitely has a sort of Zomboid style, which I think is quite charming actually and from the trailer it looks like it works well for the setting.</p>
<p>This is a single-player game, with you trying to survive on the starship<em> </em>Pergola which was supposed to be a "civilization in a bottle". Obviously, everything went wrong and now it's quite a bit overrun with greenery and some of it appears to be quite dangerous.</p>
<p>Keeping to their roots, it will be very moddable. The developers will be providing a map editor and a "robust Lua API for modders". So you'll be able to "Create and modify maps, import custom clothing and weapons, or dream up whole new Lua scripted scenarios and biomes".</p>

<li><strong>Pry open long sealed bulkhead doors</strong> — just pray the void of interstellar space isn’t waiting for you on the other side.</li>
<li><strong>Patch up rotted spacesuits</strong>, lead lined radiation gear, and other protective garments to traverse dangerous new areas.</li>
<li><strong>Stockpile </strong><strong>for the next cold snap;</strong> life support is on the fritz after centuries of neglect, and you can never be sure when it might fail… for days or even months at a time.</li>
<li><strong>The jungle is alive</strong>, and extremely hostile. Will you chance a run through the serrated tendrils of crawling plant life, or barricade up and hide somewhere safe?</li>
</ul>

      <title>SaveState is an open source versatile game save backup manager - now with Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We already have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/02/ludusavi-seems-like-a-pretty-good-open-source-game-save-backup-tool/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ludusavi</a>, but now we also have SaveState, another attempt to create a user-friendly and versatile game save backup manager. About two weeks ago, the developer released version 1.4 that noted "Full Linux Support" that has been "Rigorously Tested".</p>
<p>A useful tool for games that don't support Steam Cloud (or if you just want to be extra careful), and for everything else you'll install outside of Steam including Minecraft and various emulators it can detect.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18255665251749034969gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Just some of the features it has:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Backup &amp; Restore:</strong> Perform compressed <code class="inline-code">.zip</code> backups for selected profiles with a single click. Restore from any available backup.</li>
<li><strong>Automatic Backup Management:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Configurable number of backups to keep per profile (automatically deletes the oldest).</li>
<li>Configurable backup compression level (Standard/Recommended, Maximum, or None/Stored).</li>
<li>Optional check for minimum free disk space on the backup drive before starting a backup.</li>
<li>Optional check for maximum source folder size to prevent accidental backup of huge folders.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Steam Integration:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Scans for Steam installation and libraries.</li>
<li>Automatically detects installed Steam games.</li>
<li>Attempts to identify the correct Steam User ID (resolving profile names if the optional <code class="inline-code">vdf</code> library is installed).</li>
<li>Suggests save game paths based on Steam UserData conventions.</li>
<li>Configure backup profiles for Steam games directly from the detected list.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Drag &amp; Drop Profile Creation:</strong> Drag a game's shortcut (<code class="inline-code">.lnk</code> file) onto the main window to automatically extract the game name and installation path, then initiates a background search for the save location.</li>
<li><strong>Manual Profile Creation:</strong> Easily add any game by specifying a profile name and the path to its save folder.</li>
<li><strong>Minecraft Java Edition Support:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Automatically locates the default <code class="inline-code">.minecraft/saves</code> folder.</li>
<li>Lists all installed worlds, reading the world name from <code class="inline-code">level.dat</code> if the optional <code class="inline-code">nbtlib</code> library is present (falls back to folder name otherwise).</li>
<li>Create backup profiles directly from the detected world list.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Desktop Shortcut Creation:</strong> Create <code class="inline-code">.lnk</code> shortcuts on your desktop for specific profiles. Clicking the shortcut runs a silent backup for that profile using <code class="inline-code">backup_runner.py</code> and shows a desktop notification.</li>
<li><strong>Emulator Support (Experimental):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Automatic detection and profile creation for supported emulators' save data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>User Interface:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Clean and simple graphical interface built with PySide6.</li>
<li>Switchable Dark and Light themes.</li>
<li>Profile list showing name and basic backup info (count, last backup date).</li>
<li>Settings dialog to configure paths, limits, theme, language, and more.</li>
<li>Dockable Log Console displaying detailed operation status and errors.</li>
<li>Basic internationalization support (Italian/English currently included).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

      <title>Pulp adventure thriller The Drifter looks amazing and releases July 17</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Drifter from Powerhoof is an awesome looking adventure thriller and it just got a new trailer, along with a release date reveal of July 17. Native Linux support is confirmed for the release too.</p>
<p>Inspired by the works of Stephen King, John Carpenter and Michael Crichton — it features some fantastic pixel-art and fast-paced gameplay that will work just as well with a mouse and keyboard, as it will with a gamepad. They've even put a demo up for Steam Next Fest so you can check it out right now.</p>
<p>Before you do though, have a look at the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="dAJ1LQVqWWE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e9d1a9280c8998bc8334b1c73222e5af.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/dAJ1LQVqWWE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- squire -->A classic 2D point and click adventure with the brake-lines cut - <em>The Drifter</em> plunges players headfirst into a web of shadowy corporations, conspiracy, murder, and the thousand year obsession of a madman.</p>
<p>Mick Carter's been drifting a while now - moving from job to job, never staying one place long. Jumping a box-car to his old home town, he witnesses a violent murder, is pursued by hi-tech soldiers, thrown in a reservoir and drowned.</p>
<p>Just before his consciousness is ripped away, it is thrust back into his body. Alive again, seconds before his death. Mick is framed for the killing he witnessed, tormented by his own past, and haunted by the feeling that something followed him back from the other side…</p>
<p>The Drifter takes its cues from modern revival of the adventure genre and focuses on serving up a tight, razor-sharp narrative - propelling the player through the story - while grounded, unobtrusive and satisfying investigative puzzles act as the sinew between punchy narrative beats.</p>

      <title>Cyberpunk deckbuilder and dungeon crawler Into The Grid gets a fresh demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Into The Grid is a cyberpunk roguelike deckbuilder and dungeon crawler from Flatline Studios, with a fresh demo up ahead of Steam Next Fest. <em>Time to go crack open some firewalls and destroy some robots.</em></p>
<p>With this big upgrade to the demo they<span style="font-size:16px"> "overhauled most of the graphics, animations, SFX, and VFX, added new mechanics, and rebalanced others". They also said it only contains one of the five planned characters for the game, but the demo will still give you lots of hours to play.</span></p>
<p>There's also a new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="PQJvJnP04w0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/67fce18ef009d108230ae3d4f3271e7e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/PQJvJnP04w0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>An exciting blend of deckbuilding, card battler and dungeon crawler</strong> - Into The Grid introduces a map exploration system to the genre that’s a breath of fresh air. You will need to be tactical and strategical not only in the way you put together your deck and play your cards, but also in how you explore the map and manage your limited resources to find and reach your goal before The Grid kicks you out, sends a private security force to your location, or worse.</li>
<li><strong>A unique dual resource system to diminish RNG and leverage “dead draws”</strong> - Into The Grid introduces a novel combat mechanic called “Commands”, skills you can activate during combat by spending a resource that almost every card in the game generates just by playing them. Commands are designed to have supporting effects that help to play around RNG by letting you, for example, draw or fetch cards from specific places. Their varied effects also enable different archetypes within each character, creating a new fan of possibilities as you change your Commands in between battles and adjust them to your current deck.</li>
<li><strong>5 Characters and Factions to discover the deep lore of the “2112 Universe”</strong><br/>
	​Into The Grid takes place in the year 2112, in a universe that Flatline Studios has been developing for even longer than the game itself. This universe is full of characters and entities with their own agendas and motivations. In gameplay terms, the full game will include 5 different characters, each one belonging to a different hacker Faction that determines the hacker’s ethos and their reasons to be outlaws.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It has Native Linux support for the demo and will for the full game. The release is due sometime in Q3 2025 for Early Access.</p>

      <title>Castle Cab looks like Crazy Taxi but with an unhinged horse and silly customization</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Crazy Taxi delivery sim but with a horse and carriage, plus some over the top physics? Castle Cab really does look like a lot of fun. I'm all for a bit of chaos and the horse customization looks ridiculous too.</p>
<p>Going into more details the developers explain it as: "Castle Cab puts you in the horseshoes of a sentient, indestructible horse running a delivery service in a whimsical medieval kingdom. When wizards enlist your help to overthrow a king bent on banning magic, you’ll find yourself at the heart of a revolution that could lead the kingdom down an unpredictable path. Complete quirky quests, race through winding roads, and uncover hidden secrets."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="o1u0smmioMk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7114369c56d2f361cbd40715fa3812f8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/o1u0smmioMk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"Castle Cab's development has been a wild ride full of fun, hard work, and laughter," shared Royal Reign Studios' studio director Jacob von Appen. "Seeing kids light up while playing it has made it all worth it! We’re so grateful for the love so far, and we can’t wait for more people to jump in, have fun, and share in what’s ahead!"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cooperative Campaign</p>
<p>Join forces with up to 3 other players to navigate the bustling medieval world as a team. Work together to pick up patrons, deliver them (hopefully in one piece), and overcome outrageous obstacles. Collaboration is key—but so is laughing at your friends’ spectacular fails as carts flip, horses stumble, and chaos unfolds.</p>
<p>Competitive Mayhem</p>
<p>Prefer to leave teamwork in the dust? Switch gears and compete against your friends in a variety of riotous modes, where your goal is to outsmart, outrun, and outmaneuver your opponents. Sabotage their deliveries, steal their patrons, or simply cause as much carnage as possible to claim victory!</p>
<p>Deck Out Your Horse and Cart</p>
<p>It’s not just about getting the job done—it’s about looking hilariously good while doing it! Give your hardworking horse some flair with a variety of comically oversized hats, silly costumes, and vibrant patterns. Ever wanted to see a knight’s steed wearing a wizard’s hat? Now you can!</p>
<p>And why settle for an ordinary wooden cart when you can deliver patrons in style? Choose from an outrageous selection of carts, including a giant onion, a sleek sports car, or even a fully functional toilet on wheels!</p>
<p>Fun for All Ages</p>
<p>Designed with simplicity and fun in mind, Castle Cab is a game that everyone can enjoy, regardless of age or experience. The controls are intuitive and straightforward, making it easy for kids, casual players, and first-time gamers to jump right into the action.</p>
<p>At the same time, the chaotic physics and creative gameplay ensure there’s plenty of challenge and depth for experienced players to master. Castle Cab caters to everyone. Its humor, visual style, and gameplay are designed to entertain players of all generations.</p>

      <title>Dune: Awakening will get Private Servers at release but with limits</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some good news for Dune: Awakening, Funcom have announced it actually will have Private Servers you can rent and sort with friends.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1172710/view/546736546679621439" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam post</a> published June 2nd the developer noted "We’ve previously communicated that private servers are for post-launch, but we’re happy to share that progress has been faster than expected". However, it's a bit complicated since it is at its heart a proper MMO so the game as a whole won't be <em>entirely</em> private.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is how the game works. There's many different servers, and a few of them contain different parts of the game. They said that "each server belongs to a World consisting of several other servers, and each of those share the same social hubs and Deep Desert" which "allows us to retain a neighborhood-like feel to the Hagga Basin and provide persistent, freeform building, and other server-demanding mechanics you typically see in survival games". Moving all of this to a private server model "has not been trivial".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10924759871748954547gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Rather than probably incorrectly paraphrasing it due to the mechanics involved, here's what the developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>How private servers work</h4>
When you rent a private server, you essentially rent a server containing one Hagga Basin, just like the official servers. Here you have the full Hagga Basin map, and you can do everything you would do on an official server.<br/>
<br/>
Your private server will belong to a World consisting of other private servers, and you can choose a World for your private server when you rent yours from a provider.<br/>
<br/>
That means that you will still be able to take full advantage of Dune: Awakening’s large-scale multiplayer content and mechanics, including visiting the social hubs and the Deep Desert, to meet and play with people from any private server in the same World.<br/>
<br/>
Players do not rent or control social hubs nor the Deep Desert. These are provided by the server hosting company, who ensures each private server’s World has them.<br/>
<h4>Private server settings</h4>
So, what settings will be available for your private server?<br/>
<br/>
Because your private server will belong to a World of other private servers, and you will be meeting and playing with other people in the social hubs and the Deep Desert, you won’t be able to control every aspect of how your private server works.<br/>
<br/>
Which settings you can configure for your server is ultimately up to the third-party server provider, but these are the settings we are making available:<br/>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security Zones:</strong> you can disable security zones entirely, making all parts of Hagga Basin PvP enabled, or you can choose to have pockets of PvP like on official servers</li>
<li><strong>Taxation:</strong> you can disable taxation on your server</li>
<li><strong>Sandstorms:</strong> you can disable sandstorms, making them not appear on your server</li>
</ul>
<br/>
You will also be able to name your server and set a password for it.<br/>
<br/>
Please note that private servers do not have an admin control panel nor character transfers presently. We will evaluate this functionality post-launch.<br/>
<h4>Visiting other private servers</h4>
<p>Just like how you can visit another server in your World when playing on official servers, you can do the same with private servers.<br/>
<br/>
All you need to do is select the other server in the server selection menu and put in the server’s password when prompted. You can take with you everything on your character, and you are free to do anything you would like on the server. You can even claim land, something you can’t do when visiting official servers.<br/>
<br/>
When you arrive on the other server, you will appear at Griffin’s Reach trade post.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It really does sound complicated and still a little bit confusing. But you essentially get your own private area, that's linked to a much bigger more public area.</p>
<p>Some other good news - their press team has approved my key for it. So I'll be taking a look to ensure it works properly on Linux, SteamOS / Steam Deck. I don't anticipate many problems, especially since they already <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/dune-awakening-will-have-battleye-enabled-for-linux-steamos-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed to GamingOnLinux that BattlEye would be enabled</a>. <em>Check out more <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat compatibility on our dedicated page</a>.</em></p>

      <title>Cyber Knights: Flashpoint is out now, great for XCOM and strategy fans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cyber Knights: Flashpoint is the latest game from Trese Brothers, bringing some excellent squad-based tactics and it's out now. After tons of updates during Early Access, what we have is an impressive and feature-filled strategy game that blends in elements of XCOM and stealth games.</p>
<p>The game also takes on some of the spirit of other great games like Shadowrun and Invisible, Inc., so if you like the sound of those too you'll feel right at here. As a Cyber Knight fitted with a powerful cybernetic spinal implant, you lead a crew as you continue building up your reputation and connections and go on various heists. Featuring grid-less movement, environmental cover, specialised overwatch, initiative manipulation, independent enemy unit AI and more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bzToChIOp2A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/09b347f0ef1dc3aa101e6521f86fe9be.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bzToChIOp2A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's a lot to enjoy with this one, especially with the depth of all the characters to upgrade and set up your squad exactly how you want. I've been looking for something to scratch the itch left by XCOM and this very well may be the one. You're in great hands with the Trese Brothers.</p>
<p>The full release comes with a second origin story to play through, new game character options, a new map, a raised level cap and a few bug fixes.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support and Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Valve fix lag and freezing in games with the Steam Overlay disabled</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>On top of the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/steam-deck-steamos-will-now-stop-bugging-you-to-install-updates-multiple-times/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent Steam Deck / SteamOS update</a>, Valve also released a desktop Steam Beta that should solve issues in games with the Steam Overlay disabled. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/upcoming-steam-update-should-fix-lag-spikes-on-linux-when-the-steam-overlay-is-disabled/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I wrote about the issue</a> with the Steam Overlay, although there was a workaround it's good to see a fix now available for testing.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/545610012180874686?snr=2___" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">June 2nd</a> Steam Client Beta:</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Steam Overlay</strong></p>

<li>Fixed timer continuing to alert after game exit if running in repeat mode.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Fixed intermittent steamwebhelper crash when exiting VR mode.</li>

<ul>
<li>Fixed X, Y, trigger and other buttons being treated as simulated mouse input on the Steam Store.</li>

      <title>Steam Deck, SteamOS will now stop bugging you to install updates multiple times</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a fresh Steam update for Steam Deck / SteamOS and additionally a Beta update too, both of which solve some annoyances.</p>
<p>The first to be released was the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/529847413482980683" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Beta</a> update with these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: This update was re-released with the following additional changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a rare case that could result in multiple prompts to install the same update.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare case that could result in re-triggering the out of box wizard.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added in-game keyboard shortcuts to open the Main Menu and Quick Access Menu.
	<ul>
<li>Default Main Menu hotkey: Shift+Tab</li>
<li>Default Quick Access Menu hotkey: Ctrl+Shift+Tab</li>
<li>Customizable in Settings-&gt;In Game</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improved steam client update installation speed. In some pathological cases this operation could take minutes to complete, when the expected completion time is seconds.</li>
<li>Fixed events showing blurred images in the library for games with adult content.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And then the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/529848048073838040" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Stable</a> update:</p>

<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a rare case that could result in multiple prompts to install the same update.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare case that could result in re-triggering the out of box wizard.</li>
<li>Fixed the 'Battery Charge Limit' option showing on devices that currently don't support this feature.</li>
<li>Fixed events showing blurred images in the library for games with adult content.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I've seen the issue where system updates in Gaming Mode repeatedly appear, asking you to apply them when you've already done them. Hopefully this really will be the end of it now.</p>

It will have Native Linux support at release built with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/godot-engine/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot</a> and the first public demo is live now.</p>
<p>This is one you need to try. I just love how thoroughly unusual it is, can't think of another dungeon crawler that has a mixture quite like this.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BzHhzFOaIyw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ce75adfa576bd4c9ff55cd25f896ab2e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BzHhzFOaIyw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

<li>Upgrade your gear to venture deeper.</li>
<li>Meet god and gain strong boons.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You awaken. An old, battered knight, lost in the darkest corners of an abandoned dungeon, with no memory of how you got there. The stench of decay permeates the thick air. The walls seem to whisper your name.</p>
<p>As you stir, a strange tree sprout catches your eye. You hit it, for the voice demands it of you; a twig breaks off onto the ground. With your newfound resource, you seem to be able to ameliorate your equipment. Distorted moans echo from an empty staircase. The voice calls to you again, beckoning you. You must go down. It is your purpose...</p>
<p>Encounter bizarre characters, solve cryptic puzzles, and survive the horrors that lurk in every shadow. Will you escape this living nightmare, or will it consume you?</p>

      <title>Chilled factory-builder shapez 2 gets a massive upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>shapez 2 was already good and now the huge Dimension Update is out now, it looks like it's going to suck away plenty more hours of your time. Truly a wonderful factory building sim, that really has a clear focus on just letting you chill with it without the hassle of any kind of enemies. Just build the coolest looking shape-cutting thing you can.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The newly launched Dimension Update has some big new features like:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>3D Platform Building:</strong> Build platforms, space belts, space pipes &amp; rails on multiple layers just as you do with buildings.</li>
<li><strong>Trains Rework:</strong> Quick &amp; Wait stops, transfer stations, multiple packages, new colors and more.</li>
<li><strong>Variable Launchers:</strong> Belt launchers, fluid launchers and wire transmitters now have variable range.</li>
<li><strong>New Layouts:</strong> Re-added old T, Cross and L-platform layouts, and added even more!</li>
<li><strong>Space Belts</strong> got a 400% throughput increase.</li>
<li>Allow <strong>searching</strong> for shapes on the map.</li>
<li>Added overflow splitter.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Global Wire Transmitters:</strong> Global Wire transmitters now have two inputs/outputs, one for the channel ID, one for the actual signal. This gives you basically infinite channels and replaces the old color-based system.</li>
<li><strong>Operator Shape Receiver:</strong> To be able to receive the operator shape definition, there is now a new Operator Shape Receiver building.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out their new 7 minute video on it:</p>

      <title>XWVM is a modern Unity engine to play STAR WARS - X-Wing, first Alpha out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>XWVM is a re-implementation mod for STAR WARS - X-Wing made in Unity, allowing you to get a better experience on modern platforms. A first Alpha build has been released for Linux and Windows.</p>
<p>Unlike OpenMW for Morrowind, it's not a <em>full</em> game engine remake. They do supply a HD asset pack though, so you can make it look a lot fancier and more modern, but it's entirely optional. The main point is just to preserve the classic to easily run it on modern platforms. As the mod developers describe on Mod DB:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>XWVM is a facilitator app to play Star Wars X-Wing from Lucas Arts and Totally Games. We are re-implementing the executable to extend the game beyond its original hardware support. The app requires the player to own and have installation of the original X-Wing game, or have the GOG or Steam versions of X-Wing Special Edition (either the 1993 floppy, the 1994 CD, and/or 1998 Windows edition). The team of fans developing XWVM is not associated with Lucasfilm Ltd or Disney, and XWVM is not an official Star Wars product. XWVM isn't a standalone game, or total conversion, but a tool to play the original product. XWVM neither contains nor distributes any copyrighted material. All game resource files (missions, voice overs, SFX, MIDI music, in-game graphics and 3D models, etc) are loaded from the player's copy of the original game, or are replacements originally created by our team, where the original resources are considered inadequate for today's standards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can see some comparisons in the videos they put up:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2pMmNYz4k_o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/86c91bdd10529bfc159de3dc75bee7ef.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2pMmNYz4k_o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AMlzysP0cn4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ee9199b9fe681b9ff8b8f3fb39848c9c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AMlzysP0cn4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">You do need the original game to supply the files it needs. You can buy it from:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/star_wars_xwing_special_edition" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/354430/STAR_WARS__XWing_Special_Edition/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And grab the project itself from <a href="https://www.moddb.com/games/star-wars-x-wing-special-edition" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Mod DB</a>.</p>
<p>Wonderful to see another classic reborn.</p>

      <title>Rock Crusher is an incremental clicker with a huge transformational skill tree</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I have, admittedly, spent far too long playing the demo of Rock Crusher. An upcoming incremental clicker with Leaf Blower Revolution vibes.</p>
<p>Quite a simple game when you first start it that sees you do nothing more that throw your mouse around the screen, to crush rocks and use your blower to push gems off the screen. You have limited health that goes down as you drill rocks, and limited energy. Over time though, you build up into something quite ridiculous with helper drones and all sorts thanks to the rather large skill tree that lets you continually expand.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UldMIgK7UDI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3aa4990a64afa7ce6125fda1e578700e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UldMIgK7UDI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's an odd, slow and very therapeutic game. Although, it does get a bit nuts the longer you play of it.</p>
<p>There's some sort of story to this one too. You're on a mysterious planet and eventually you'll have some combat encounters, and when you beat all the bosses you'll get an ending which will reveal the secret of the planet apparently.</p>
<p>Try the demo that's live on Steam. It has a Linux version.</p>

      <title>Point and click adventure The Mystery of Doomsday Valley confirmed for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another good one for fans of point and click adventures, keep an eye on the upcoming The Mystery of Doomsday Valley.</p>
<p>In development by True Ascension, Doomsday Valley is a mystery point-and-click adventure game that should appeal to players new and old to the genre. It's seeking funding on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/trueascension/the-mystery-of-doomsday-valley" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, with the initial small goal met and there's 9 days left to help it reach some stretch goals to expand it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qdtEYoPJSRU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c213052e8f04efcc2939b1ad8d3a1ae3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qdtEYoPJSRU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The game takes you to a remote town where unsettling events have left the locals on edge, where a doomsday cult once operated. You need to uncover the mystery by exploring strange locations and talking to interesting characters in order to find out what's really going on here. At the heart of the story is a discourse about news, fake news, conspiracy and truth.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Hand-drawn HD artwork and traditional frame-by-frame animation.</li>
<li>Simple one-click interface.</li>
<li>In-game hint system, hot-spots and fast-travel.</li>
<li>Suspenseful and atmospheric soundtrack.</li>
<li>Inspired by classic adventures from the 90's.</li>
<li>Languages: Fully voiced in English and subtitles in English and German.</li>
<li>At least 4-6 hours of varied gameplay.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a demo available on Steam with Linux support.</p>

      <title>Ace shooter Selaco gets improved performance and a spiced-up randomizer mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Selaco continues being one of the best upcoming shooters, with the latest Early Access update making it smoother than ever.</p>
<p>In the v0.90 Update the developers have detailed numerous performance improvements done to the game, with a new particle system to take better advantage of your hardware along with particles looking better. There's some additional upgrades to the effects for smoke, floor decals, blood and even improved AI enemy logic.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1383342151748863194gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1383342151748863194gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Additionally, the "Special Campaign / Randomizer" game mode now has some presets you can pick, instead of having to set everything manually (although that's still an option). There's some new enemy types added in this update with Ammo and Armor Bearers, that will drop what their name suggests on their death. Both enemy types are rare though, so don't expect to see them too often. A Heavy Gunner was also added that are bigger and meaner, a random encounter rework and lots more tweaks for it.</p>
<p>It's quite a long list of what they've done for this release including better swimming, more reactive explosions, interactive bullet casings, some brand new visual effects and so on. My favourite addition though? The Save Scumming mutator, letting you save and reload anywhere.</p>
<p>You can also now disable view bobbing if it was annoying you or causing you issues, along with improved camera tilting on gamepad.</p>
<p>As for what's next? A lot.</p>
<p>They're looking into a Contrast Mode for visually impaired players - nice. They've formally announced a Modding SDK will be coming shortly after the launch of Chapter 2, and they've just released the level editor <a href="https://github.com/fhomolka/UltimateSelacoBuilder" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">source code</a>.</p>
<p>Sadly the story update and Chapter 2 are still some ways off, but they said both are now progressing well, although they said how they've been "underestimating just how much work it takes to make this game".</p>

      <title>Stellar Blade works well on Linux, SteamOS / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Stellar Blade recently had a demo released and thankfully, it does seem to run well enough on Linux, SteamOS / Steam Deck. Great news for the upcoming release, which is soon! The game in full arrives June 11th.</p>
<p>With the demo, progress will carry over to the main game and once you finish the demo, you'll also unlock an additional mode. The developer also worked to remove the region block, so thankfully it's another PlayStation Publishing title that will be available in more locations.</p>
<p><strong>Desktop Linux</strong></p>
<p>My testing with the demo was using the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a>, and there doesn't seem to be any problems. It looks great, seems to perform well on the defaults too. With the Very High graphics preset with AMD FSR 3 set to Quality it's been smoothly over 100FPS at 2560x1440 on Kubuntu Linux 25.04 with my Radeon RX 6800 XT.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15831390941748859137gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15831390941748859137gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19900044891748859139gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19900044891748859139gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15335175821748859140gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15335175821748859140gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16134124941748859140gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16134124941748859140gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For <strong>Steam Deck</strong> there's a dedicated graphics setting, which mostly sets everything down to low except for Character Object Detail they've put to Medium. The main problem with it are the visuals on Steam Deck, FSR3 gives quite a lot of distortion around characters during movement.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8052306141748859467gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8052306141748859467gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Performance though seems pretty reasonable. You're not going to get 60FPS even with the special Steam Deck setting, with lots of it hovering around the 40-50FPS mark on the Steam Deck LCD model. These shots below were on the Steam Deck default preset:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17583831211748860015gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17583831211748860015gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12755565291748860265gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12755565291748860265gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>What was surprising was turning <em>off</em> AMD FSR 3, the game on Steam Deck is <em>still</em> very much playable and you do get a vastly clearer picture during combat and heavy action. The performance obviously drops a fair bit, but still actually above 30FPS. I would much prefer the clear picture and locking it to 30FPS. Thankfully, the developer did not lock the graphical settings so no workaround or launch commands needed.</p>
<p>These shots below are with the Low graphics preset but with Character Object Detail bumped up to Medium with TAA. You can see the FSR distortion is gone, so the picture is much cleaner and enjoyable. Although, you will sacrifice some battery life for it. Either way, you'll only get about an hour.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19172621161748860557gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19172621161748860557gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4468395181748861131gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4468395181748861131gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16010316161748861414gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16010316161748861414gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3984833371748861415gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3984833371748861415gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Appears that developer SHIFT UP actually did a pretty good job on optimising the game across different hardware. But the default trying to push it to 60FPS on Steam Deck just feels silly. Drop it down and enjoy it more. I am genuinely very impressed by how it runs on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Looks like it has a decent set of accessibility options too:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11607207151748859141gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11607207151748859141gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I went into this completely blind, intentionally staying away from videos on it and all the social media chatter around the original release, so I'm quite excited for it. The demo actually was pretty good too so I think I might be sold on it.</p>

My usual advice is to stick with Valve's official Proton, unless there's something specific you need in GE-Proton as there's less support and testing with it.</p>
<p>The main changes in this release are listed below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Proton:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed broken cursor issue with DOOM Eternal, DOOM Dark Ages, and Rocket League in winewayland (Thanks OOOOOF123/Etaash)</li>
<li>Added a stub implementation for amdxc64.dll to enable FSR4. Use FSR4_UPGRADE=1 to upgrade FSR3.1 games to FSR4. Again thanks to Thanks OOOOOF123/Etaash. Instructions: <a href="https://github.com/Etaash-mathamsetty/wine-builds/releases/tag/fsr4" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/Etaash-mathamsetty/wine-builds/releases/tag/fsr4</a></li>
<li>import upstream proton changes</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Protonfixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>fix libcuda for star citizen</li>
<li>remove deprecated fixes for daedalic games</li>
<li>remove deprecated fix for Once human</li>
<li>add fix for The Chronicles of Myrtana: Archolos</li>

</blockquote>

      <title>Linux user share hits a multi-year high on Steam for May 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Linux user share on Steam has been slowly but steadily trending upwards, with May 2025 showing the highest point in years. At least since 2018, this is the highest it has ever been in a long time. When you take into account how Steam is always growing, it's showing that the amount of Linux users on Steam continues to grow nicely too.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Overall user share for May 2025:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 95.45% -0.65%</li>
<li>Linux 2.69% +0.42%</li>
<li>macOS 1.85% +0.23%</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15817071271748857369gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="GamingOnLinux.com Steam Tracker" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15817071271748857369gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>See more on our interactive <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Tracker page</a>.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Even with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/steam-deck-gets-a-big-upgrade-with-steamos-3-7-and-you-can-now-install-it-on-other-amd-handhelds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3 now being a little more widely available</a>, the rise was not from SteamOS directly. Filtering to just the Linux numbers gives us these most popular distributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 30.95% -2.83%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 10.09% +0.64%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 22.1 64 bit 7.76% +1.56%</li>
<li>Freedesktop SDK 24.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 7.42% +1.01%</li>
<li>Ubuntu Core 22 64 bit 4.63% +0.01%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS 64 bit 4.30% -0.14%</li>
<li>CachyOS 64 bit 2.54% +2.54%</li>
<li>EndeavourOS Linux 64 bit 2.44% -0.02%</li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 2.43% -0.18%</li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 2.17% -0.06%</li>
<li>Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm) 64 bit 1.99% -0.28%</li>
<li>Other 23.27% -2.27%</li>
</ul>
<p>One likely reason is how Simplified Chinese as a language option on Steam went down for May 2025, which does usually bring the Linux numbers up too. <em>Linux with Steam in that region just isn't particularly popular.</em></p>
