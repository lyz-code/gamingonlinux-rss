      <title>Prime Gaming - December 12th edition round-up for Steam Deck / Linux</title>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's that time! Yes, again! Each week Prime Gaming, part of what you get with a subscription to Amazon Prime, add and remove various games you can claim to keep.</p>
<p>I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"/> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play. Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now.</p>

      <title>New Arc Line is a promising new RPG about the conflict between Magic and Engineering</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I have very fond memories of a seriously janky RPG called Arcanum from way back in the year 2000, and the release of New Arc Line <em>could</em> end up being the spiritual successor I've been wanting all these years. <em>Note: key provided by the publisher.</em></p>
<p>Now in Early Access from Dreamate and Fulqrum Publishing it's <em>directly</em> inspired by the classic Arcanum through many of the features and the setting. New Arc Line is set in a world on the verge of a massive change, following sorcery being outpaced by technological progress where the two sides are set to violently collide.</p>
<p>The good news, is that as far as I can tell, the initial Early Access release works really quite nicely on Desktop Linux with the<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> latest stable Proton 9.0-4</a> (and worked fine with Proton 9.0-3 before it).</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AXy0JpZVPeg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7afea49ebcdeaf43434b99de6ce7dfed.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AXy0JpZVPeg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In terms of performance on Desktop Linux, no real problems there. Sticking with the High preset overall, the game manages to remain at least around 60FPS at 2560x1440 with my Ryzen 5800x / Radeon 6800 XT.</p>
<p>This definitely ticks a lot of the right boxes for me. A party-based RPG that has an interesting setting, backed up by some pretty good visuals. The graphics are a bit of a <em>mixed</em> bag though. Some parts are quite detailed, others quite lacking. I like it, a lot, especially with all the different interactions you can have with the world. And the way it just sort-of throws you into the thick of it is interesting, as you're then trying to piece together what the heck is going on, before it throws you back in time before the intro began so you can then see what you apparently did.</p>
<p><em>But there's also a lot of issues with it.</em></p>
<p>With it being in Early Access there's a rather large amount of really rough edges. Some quick initial issues I spotted include: the intro video text going too fast to read (and I'm a fast reader), some object interactions need tweaking for where you can actually click on them, various dodgy camera angles when chatting to other characters, some of the English text really needs serious proof-reading, various smaller bugs throughout and so on.</p>
<p>It's not just the quality of the English text but the writing <em>overall</em>, it's just odd, they're going to need a big pass over all of it.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Become the Hero or Villain you want to be</strong></p>
<p>Create your own character as a human or elf, and choose your gender, background, and appearance. Keep in mind that inhabitants of this world might have their own prejudices and will treat you differently depending on your choices.</p>
<p><strong>Gather your Party</strong></p>
<p>You won’t be alone on these shores. Meet &amp; recruit a diverse cast of characters, learn their stories, face their demons together and help them grow, or use them for your own gain and discard them as fits your schemes. Who knows, maybe you will even find your true love!</p>
<p><strong>Master Technology or Magic</strong></p>
<p>Will you master the secrets of Magic to incinerate enemies as a Hellfire occultist, curse them with mystical Voodoo abilities, or assist your allies as a Celestial sage? Or will you rather cast aside the obsolete ways and become a Steampunk mechanic, Dieselpunk engineer or Teslapunk scientist, and turn your character into a walking steam-powered fortress?</p>
<p><strong>Fight for Your Right</strong></p>
<p>Command your party in turn-based tactical battles. Fight head-on and brute-force your way through encounters, or observe and analyse each situation and come up with cunning strategies to conquer even seemingly overwhelming odds. There’s a plethora of skills, spells, crafting recipes and consumables at your disposal to turn the tide of battle in your favour.</p>
<p><strong>Manifest Your Destiny</strong></p>
<p>Make a name for yourself, influence countless lives for better or worse, and watch the consequences of your choices unfold. You may start as only a poor immigrant, but soon your exploits will fill the front pages of newspapers, and the events you set in motion will change the fate of the New World forever.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Early Access release currently only has about a quarter of the main story, which they say is around a third of the overall planned content. So you've got about 10-12 hours worth of exploring here.</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing this one progress as they've got a great foundation here to build a wonderful RPG. They just need to sort all the quirks and bugs on it, and improve the text. Needs a fair bit more time in the oven overall, although it does already have a Very Positive rating on Steam. I can understand what people see in it but it's clearly not ready.</p>
<p>Once finished though, this could be a nice palate cleanser if you've completed Baldur's Gate 3, or you're just in the mood for a party-based RPG with an interesting world.</p>

      <title>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered v1.4 brings various controller fixes plus improvements to AMD FSR and Intel XeSS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just in time for my new playthrough, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered was updated to version 1.4 today bringing with it plenty of improvements and it should work better for Steam Deck / gamepad controller players.</p>
<p>For the controller support they made it so Steam Input now functions correctly if a controller is connected <em>after</em> launching the game, and controllers connected to a Steam Deck now work as intended when using Steam Remote Play. The latter is good, because that's exactly how I was trying to play it recently and my controller was acting a bit oddly. If you're using AMD FSR or Intel XeSS for upscaling, they've also improved it to reduce ghosting on snow particles.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5594669151734016394gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The full changelog:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added outfit transmog functionality.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could occur while applying coils to weapons or outfits with mouse and keyboard.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause Concentration to activate unexpectedly.</li>
<li>Improvements to audio mix to reduce excessive reverb in specific areas.</li>
<li>Audio mix adjustments to conversation dialogue panning.</li>
<li>Various audio loudness and balance improvements.</li>
<li>Mount acceleration now works as intended, incrementally increasing speed when pressing the acceleration button.</li>
<li>Motion aiming now works as intended when riding a mount.</li>
<li>Steam Input now functions correctly if a controller is connected after launching the game.</li>
<li>Controllers connected to Steam Deck now work as intended when using Steam Remote Play.</li>
<li>The Master Vibration Intensity slider will now correctly be applied to in-game vibration when using a DualSense controller with Steam Input.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where loading would sometimes get stuck when using the High graphics preset.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented music from playing during a scene in the ‘Deep Secrets of Earth’ quest.</li>
<li>Resolved a bug at Song's Edge that blocked players standing up from a chair when using mouse and keyboard controls.</li>
<li>Reduced ghosting on snow particles when using AMD FSR or Intel XeSS upscaling.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Nil would disappear after talking to him during Cause for Concern.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes related to Auto Pickup.</li>
<li>Fixes for various bugs and minor visual issues.</li>
<li>Stability improvements.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Inspired by Disco Elysium and Fallout, Weather Factory announce Travelling at Night</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This could be a good one! Weather Factory developers of Cultist Simulator and BOOK OF HOURS just revealed their third game called Travelling at Night. A combat-free game inspired by CRPGs like Disco Elysium, Planescape: Torment, and Fallout 1+2. Much like their previous games it will have Native Linux support.</p>
<p>It's actually set in the same world as both Cultist Simulator and BOOK OF HOURS, although a standalone title. A dialogue-driven choices-matter combat-free CRPG with what they say has "forty-plus hours of notably replayable noir-myth narrative". Here you will guide "an occult carnival on a pilgrimage to locate buried power that could alter the balance of the Cold War". They love Disco Elysium so much they called it a Disco-like.</p>
<p>No trailer available yet so here's a couple of early screenshots:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3142753931734009748gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3142753931734009748gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14476386391734009749gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14476386391734009749gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4407816691734009750gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4407816691734009750gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9760863901734009750gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9760863901734009750gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>CHOOSE your Career and Passions. Are you an exorcist driven by Sorrow, a stage magician seeking to feed your Appetite, or a physician who can't resist Curiosity?</li>
<li>EXPLORE the wonders and horrors of a Europe changed forever by the War in the World and the War in the Sun.</li>
<li>BUILD your character from sixteen very different skills. Dignity is essential for physicians who need to be taken seriously. Spivvery is the only way to ensure a hot meal in a cold world. Any writer will tell you that Sophistication is useful, somehow. And everyone knows Skolekosophy is the study of things that shouldn't be studied.</li>
<li>FIND Memories and Signs as you roam the ruins, or glean them from your conversations with NPCs. Use them to grow your Skills and Passions, developing your character along the lines that run shining into the dark.</li>
<li>CONSPIRE WITH OR BETRAY the Incorporates, the Ministries, the remortals of the old order. Sell them the power you've unearthed, keep it for yourself, or surrender it to something new.</li>
<li>COMBAT? No. After six years of war, there's been enough of that for now. But there are still plenty of ways to die, and as anyone who's lived through the War in the World can tell you, there's worse things than death.</li>
<li>CONCLUDE with your choice of alliance, consequence, destination. Uncover multiple endings; see the consequences of difficult decisions made from different motives in each playthrough.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Going to follow this one along with great interest. The style of it looks great and the story sounds like it could be quite exciting to play through.</p>

      <title>Golf With Your Friends 2 announced for Early Access in 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Golf With Your Friends 2 has been announced by Radical Forge and Team17 bringing the next-generation of golfing chaos.</p>
<p>What to expect from it? So far they've revealed very little in the way of real details. It's going to go into Early Access first for about 6 months, so you're not getting a finished game right away. What we do know is that it will have new game mechanics, a weather system and cross-platform online multiplayer with the ability to build your own courses.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The eventual 1.0 release they say will have: </p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>6 Courses.</li>
<li>Cross-Platform Online Multiplayer.</li>
<li>Cross Platform Level Editor.</li>
<li>New Course mechanics.</li>
<li>Weather Hazards.</li>
<li>New ways to customise your balls.</li>
<li>Level Up and Unlock Rewards!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Only 6 courses seems pretty content-light and the first game ended up with quite a few DLC, with Early Access planned to only have 2 courses, so we'll have to see how this goes.</p>
<p>The announcement trailer was a whole lot of nothing, simply to start the hype machine:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="l7e0BuVs4l8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/34a699b32245944e00eb25716750a81e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/l7e0BuVs4l8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's not entirely clear what platforms will be supported just yet. The first game did have Native Linux support, but we've seen a lot of games drop that in favour of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> for sequels. Either way, it will probably work fine with Proton.</p>

      <title>Taking inspiration from Ace Attorney, point-and-click adventure Paper Perjury is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paper Perjury is the debut title from Paper Cat Games, one for fans of games a bit similar to the Ace Attorney series. Dive into a case log full of mystery and intrigue, where you'll need to uncover the truth through clever deduction, interrogation, and exploration to find the solution.</p>
<p>Paper Perjury stars Justina Smith, a newly hired clerk for the local police department.

      <title>Chrysalis is a unique hybrid of tower defense and rogue-lite RPG action where you possess plants and creatures</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Chrysalis from developer Metamorph Games wins top marks for some originality here, and if you're a fan of cute tower defense games that mix in some exploration this is one for you. <em>Note: the developer sent a key.</em></p>
<p>The whole idea here is that you're defending a Chrysalis and attempting to cleanse a garden of corruption, split across two different game phases. The first is more like an exploration game where as a Wisp you're able to fly around and possess various creatures and plants, as you expand and explore the map to gather resources to build up defences while waiting for the incoming waves. The second phase is tower defense when the timer is up and the waves of enemies begin coming in.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="O68anybvTq4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9fbaa18e43006ff433e0e4508fe7d669.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/O68anybvTq4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Playing like a mixture of a mini-RPG with tower defense and creature collection, it's certainly <em>different</em> with the blend of game mechanics. While you can only directly possess one creature at a time, that you can keep levelling up to access more power and abilities, you can also gain followers that each have their own level as well. They will follow you around and attack enemies with you helping you on your quest to purge the corruption across the map and defend your Chrysalis during enemy waves.</p>
<p>Wrapped up in a slower, sweet garden setting, once the enemies arrive the map and atmosphere warps into something slightly more sinister.</p>
<p>It starts off a little on the slow side as it eases you in, but once you get going the game will keep expanding with new types of enemies, bigger waves and various abilities you can add to your creatures. It's one that's worth sticking with to see how it expands and changes. A little gem.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tower Defense Roguelike Hybrid:</strong> Navigate dynamic, changing environments while strategically building up your defenses. Items you find while exploring have synergistic effects on both your creatures and your plant-based defenses.</li>
<li><strong>Symbiosis:</strong> take control of any friendly plant or animal in the game.</li>
<li><strong>Metamorphosis:</strong> level up your creatures and plants, transform them into more powerful versions, and apply elemental Spirits for further customization.</li>
<li><strong>Mutation:</strong> a complex mutation system combines different species to create new creatures with unique sets of abilities and metamorphoses. You'll still be finding new creatures with new abilities after dozens of playthroughs!</li>
<li><strong>Customization and Randomization:</strong> at the beginning of each playthrough, you choose a Chrysalis that caters to a specific style of play, with unlockable abilities that increase your power as you progress. By defeating waves of monsters, you will earn random Boons which grant additional passive or active abilities, offering further ways to enhance your controlled creatures.</li>
<li><strong>Procedurally Generated Levels:</strong> No two levels are the same - there are endless possibilities each run!</li>
<li><strong>Permadeath - with a twist:</strong> If a creature you possess with Symbiosis dies, the Wisp survives and can possess a new creature. But if your Chrysalis is destroyed, the game is over - it's time to use the knowledge you gained to start a new playthrough!</li>
<li><strong>Save Anytime:</strong> you can save the game at any time and the entire state of the current level is stored, so you can pick up right where you left off!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steampunk bullet heaven auto-shooter Airships: Lost Flotilla releases January 23</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Airships: Lost Flotilla from developer David Stark and Metaroot has been announced for release on January 23, a bullet heaven survivor-like spin off from Stark's previous highly rated game Airships: Conquer the Skies.</p>
<p>It's a fun game and a good mixture of ship types and enemies that make it quite interesting. Enemies have different attack patterns you need to learn, and there's some huge boss fights as well.</p>
<p>The type of ship you pick and customise really affects you run as well. Pick the slow but powerful Battleship, the nimble Copter, or the Science Vessel with its railgun and energy shield. You build up a strategy around each of their strengths and weaknesses. As you progress through a run you improve your ship with new weapons and upgrades to find some fun combinations.</p>
<p>There's a demo available with Native Linux support, which went through a small update to mark the release date being announced. Also a new trailer you can watch below:</p>

      <title>Steam Beta for Dec 11 brings new game update options plus a new downloader style</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest Steam Client Beta for Desktop and Steam Deck has been released, and Valve have given us new options for managing game updates and there's a new downloader style.</p>
<p>For some reason, Valve <em>still</em> won't just give us a "download all" button to then instantly queue everything up to begin downloading. What did we get this time then? It's still quite nice though.</p>
<p>Now in the main settings you get a global option to swap between letting Steam decide when to run updates, or only running them when you go to launch the game. If you just let Steam decide it will update your regular games shortly after they're released, and schedule others for later.</p>
<p>This can be tweaked globally and per-game too. So if there's a game that often has huge updates, you can now prevent those updates until you launch it. Or if it's a regular game you may want updates to be done right away.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15238163511733998156gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15238163511733998156gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8673548121733998157gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/8673548121733998157gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>A fun little detail is the new section "Updates to installed games" which will give the example based on what you last set to download. In my case, the Command &amp; Conquer Remastered Collection.</p>
<p>On top of that the active download in the Steam client has an overhauled style to it. Left shot is the old one, right shot is the new one:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1762870541733998419gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1762870541733998419gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1852933061733998420gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1852933061733998420gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's nice that they've made the installing files section a bit clearer, which will help prevent some confusion when people seem to think it's not doing anything at times for bigger games, a question I've seen come up here and there.</p>
<p>The full Desktop Beta <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/545594976799556398?snr=2___" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>

      <title>Cyberpunk 2077 gets another big upgrade with more customisation and secrets in update 2.2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>CD PROJEKT RED put up another free big upgrade for Cyberpunk 2077, so is it time to dive back into Night City for another run? You may want to.</p>
<p>The developers mention this update was a collab with Virtuos, a studio that has worked on many AAA games across both PCs and consoles. As for what's new, it's all about extended customization and an improved Photo Mode. As they described in their email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As part of Update 2.2, players will access new character customization options — including new variants of cosmetic cyberware, tattoos, makeup options, and more. That’s not the only thing players can now modify — all luxury or sports cars that have partnered with Rayfield now have access to exclusive CrystalCoat technology, meaning players can swap out the colors of select rides. Changes have also been made to Photo Mode, which now boasts additional features — including improved camera modes, the ability to spawn up to three additional characters in the scene, increased camera range, and new lighting options. Players will also be able to enjoy the presence of Johnny Silverhand in the passenger seat as they drive through the city of dreams. On top of it all, Update 2.2 also brings a number of technical improvements and more secrets to Night City.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some nice additions and for those on Intel Arrow Lake based CPUs they say they've optimized the "threading system to improve performance by up to 33%".</p>
<p><span style="background-color:var(--article-main-background); color:var(--font-color); font-size:16px">You can get a full overview in their long update video:</span></p>

<details class="spoiler_container"><summary class="spoiler_header">Click here to open the patch notes</summary>
<div class="spoiler-content">
<p><strong>New Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Rayfield's CrystalCoat™ technology, initially designed for Rayfield vehicles only, has now been adopted by other car manufacturers. You can now change the paint jobs on Herrera, Mizutani, Quadra and Villefort vehicles. Pro tip: Use CrystalCoat™ to fool the cops and lower your NCPD wanted level!</li>
<li>Kiroshi presents TWINTONE™! As CrystalCoat™ continues to in gain popularity, TWINTONE™ takes your paint jobs to the next level. Simply scan a car with your Kiroshi optics, switch to the TWINTONE™ tab, then save the vehicle's color scheme for a small fee. You'll then be able to select the scheme in the TWINTONE™ database under the CrystalCoat™ menu. There, you'll also find generic color schemes for all CrystalCoat™-compatible vehicles as well as unique color schemes exclusive to the vehicle model from which they were copied. Please note that color scheme cloning is not authorized on vehicles that are linked to quests, belong to the NCPD or that are incompatible with CrystalCoat™ tech.</li>
<li>All vehicles compatible with CrystalCoat™ and TWINTONE™ are marked with a spray can icon on Autofixer.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ten most requested vehicles from the streets of Night City are now available for purchase on Autofixer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mizutani Shion MZ1</li>
<li>Mizutani Shion Targa MZT</li>
<li>Thorton Galena GA32t</li>
<li>Thorton Colby CST40</li>

</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Following Act 1, Johnny will now sometimes appear in the passenger seat while V is driving to comment on and react to what's happening.</li>
</ul>
<p>We've overhauled Photo Mode and added multiple community-requested features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drone Camera is now a free camera instead of an orbital camera centered around V.</li>
<li>Increased camera range.</li>
<li>Full Collision (ON/OFF) - determines whether the camera respects in-game object collisions.</li>
<li>Lock Camera (ON/OFF) - locks the camera to avoid misclicking and ruining the frame.</li>
<li>Precise Camera (ON/OFF) - slows the camera down for easier aiming.</li>
<li>Aspect Ratio (PC-only. Custom-resolution screenshots are not available on consoles. Console systems can only export images in the standard 16:9 format.)</li>
<li>Characters tab: Spawn up to 3 NPCs for your photo, with a list of over 20 characters to choose from. You can adjust their expression, pose and position.</li>
<li>Lighting tab: Spawn and adjust light sources.</li>
<li>Fixed the Depth of Field ghosting issue.</li>
<li>Added an Effect Intensity slider.</li>
<li>SmartFrames™ by Kiroshi allows you to display your Photo Mode shots in-game by interacting with the picture frames in V's apartments.

The Gallery pulls .png images from the screenshots folder on your PC or from your console gallery. For more details on SmartFrames™ and the Gallery, see this <a href="https://support.cdprojektred.com/en/cyberpunk/pc/interface-sp/issue/2743/smartframe-and-the-gallery-feature" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Support article</a>.</li>

<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Added more secrets to discover in Night City.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quests &amp; Open World</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Rephrased objectives for quests that tell you to wait a specific amount of time to progress. The game is designed in a way that doesn't always allow players to simply skip in-game time to advance the objective, instead requiring them continue playing to trigger the next event.</li>

<li><em>Gig: Waiting for Dodger</em> - After being freed, Bill and Charles will now be more mindful of their driving and avoid running over Dodger’s goons, preventing any unnecessary combat.</li>
<li><em>Hi Ho Silver Lining</em> - The VIP section in the Heavy Hearts club will now be accessible to players who couldn't meet with Mr. Hands due to a keycard being required to use the elevator.</li>
<li><em>I've Seen That Face Before</em> - The garage door preventing players from reaching the meeting point will now be open.</li>
<li><em>Run This Town</em> - The elevator in the Heavy Hearts club is now back in service, so V can finally meet with Mr. Hands.</li>
<li><em>Somewhat Damaged</em> - Fixed an issue where the prompt to unplug the cables from the Neural Network system was missing.</li>
<li><em>The Killing Moon</em> - Fixed the issue of a wall blocking the path when carrying Songbird to the shuttle.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed one of the katana finisher animations so that it properly decapitates enemies.</li>
<li>Iconic Synapse Burnout and Iconic System Collapse quickhacks will now be properly affected by the RAM cost reduction buff.</li>
<li>The icons for Tier 5+ and 5++ Behavioral Imprint-synced Faceplate will now be visible on the HUD while driving.</li>

<li>Fixed the issue of voiceover cutoff during the Ebunike station announcement on NCART.</li>
<li>Fixed ray-traced shadows for V in Photo Mode.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PC-Specific</strong></p>

      <title>Ballionaire is annoyingly good and I want to play it all the time</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ballionaire from developer newobject and publisher Raw Fury scratches all the right places in my brain, and I want more of it. <em>Note: key provided by Raw Fury.</em></p>
<p>We're certainly not short of excellent games right now are we? A time where the likes of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/path-of-exile-2-now-in-early-access-and-it-works-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Path of Exile 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/marvel-rivals-out-now-free-on-steam-and-works-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Marvel Rivals</a> are here, and I like them a lot, but what's been itching away at the back of my brain constantly has been Ballionaire. It's an itch that feels satisfying to scratch too. You know the kind where something is just burning, and so you have a good <em>hard</em> scratch on it and get that euphoric feeling after. That's Ballionaire — and someone is going to have to take it away from me soon or I'm going to get <em>nothing</em> done.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7899297161733933688gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7899297161733933688gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Ballionaire is a what they're calling an "autobonker", inspired by Pachinko machines originally from Japan. The idea is that you drop a ball down a vertical machine, and watch it bump into everything as it goes down. The fun part here, is that you're sticking all sorts of items onto the board to increase how much you earn from every ball you drop down. You can create some completely ridiculous combinations, and I can definitely see why Pachinko is popular. This has me hooked in something fierce.</p>
<p>It's "brain-tickling fun" the developer describes it as, and they're not wrong, I need more people to play it so they can tell me about the awesome boards they created with it to break the game and make lots of (fake) cash.</p>
<p>You <em>need</em> the cash too, because some weird Elders want a constant tribute, and you're playing the game to keep them all happy. Their demands just keep on increasing, and it's up to you to place down various items in such a way that will cause your balls to bounce about all over the place to create the most insane combinations you can.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-5KylcOuyGI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6148a33cb94fb03751645d5e7042d56a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-5KylcOuyGI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It will eat at your brain more than just the excitement of dropping balls and seeing what happens though, because there's actually a lot of strategy to it. While there's an element of randomness with the physics on where the ball will drop and bounce, there's tons and tons of items to place and unlock to build up all these combinations and quite a lot to learn on how they all work together. Some of the runs I've had in it have been absolutely nuts, balls flying all over the place as I just sit back and watch the fireworks.</p>
<p>Even the meta unlock system leans into the absurdity of it all, acting like one of those toy machines children beg you for a coin to drop some random crappy little toy. It gets you to insert your card, and down will drop a ball that allows you to pick an item to unlock. Love it.</p>
<p>If that intro wasn't clear enough: go and buy it. Ballionaire is excellent. This is going to be a game that I repeatedly go back to for one more run.</p>
<p>Curiously, it does have Native Linux support, but it's not actually advertised on the Steam store page. It's also Steam Deck Verified, which was tested by Valve on the Native Linux version.</p>
<p>The developer also mentioned proper modding and Steam Workshop integration is coming soon too. Can't wait to see what the community cooks up to add into this one.</p>

      <title>Moon Watch mixes up the bullet heaven survivor genre with time-stopping and deck-building into something strategic</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Moon Watch is a new release now in Early Access from developer Jaspel, who also made Backpack Hero, and they're mixing genres together again into something new. <em>Note: their publisher sent over a key.</em></p>
<p>Taking inspiration from all the recent bullet heaven survivor-like games but turning it into something slower, more tactical that requires a bit of planning. This is because you control the flow of time, where the action only happens as you move. So instead of fancy finger-work on your keyboard or gamepad testing your reflexes, it's a lot more about that big beautiful brain of yours.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14210529791733930756gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14210529791733930756gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You get as much time as you want to decide how to approach the waves of enemies. From where you're going to run, to what cards to put into play that form all your attacks and abilities. However, each card uses up a certain amount of power that you recharge as you move, so even though it's slower and time-stopping, it can still remain a bit frantic and challenging. I really do love the idea of this one.</p>
<p>On each level you have a certain amount of time you have to survive, that only ticks while you move too. So you're constantly thinking about just surviving.</p>
<p>After each battle you then get a Slay the Spire style little map to pick a node to travel to which could be another fight, a defence mission where you have to defend an object and other types of events to go through</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="R3Xmn6z98wk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8402de9f4ee4790634c6ba5b7eb4bd28.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/R3Xmn6z98wk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A really fun idea that I can't wait to see expand. It's already fun and has quite a bit of content, but runs often feel a bit too similar right now. The developer said they expect Early Access to keep going for 8-10 months, so they have plenty of time there to add more. Some of what they have planned to add includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Characters:</strong> More playstyles to master.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Cards &amp; Relics:</strong> Expanding your options for deckbuilding and combos.</li>
<li><strong>More Enemies:</strong> New challenges to overcome.</li>
<li><strong>More Rooms &amp; Events:</strong> Expanding the variety of encounters to keep every run fresh.</li>
<li><strong>Achievements:</strong> A way to showcase your milestones and progress.</li>
<li><strong>Performance Updates:</strong> Continued improvements to ensure smooth gameplay.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For the £8.50 normal price it's good fun and well worth looking into if you like the sound of the idea. It's incredibly promising!</p>

      <title>Stories from Sol: The Gun-Dog is a seriously cool visual novel love-letter to retro anime and 80s Sci-Fi</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I don't play many visual novels, but I might have to break that habit again soon with Stories from Sol: The Gun-Dog because it looks and feels like playing through a classic Gundam Anime story. <em>You can even try out a demo right now.</em></p>
<p>The game is directly inspired by retro anime and 80s Sci-Fi, a visual novel made in the spirit of classic PC-9800 titles and it really looks the part too. Developed by Space Colony Studios based in Wales, UK, they're a collection of independent artists, writers and developers working together to create the Stories from Sol anthology of games; a multi part, narrative focused series created to express their love of old school anime, retro sci-fi and interactive storytelling.</p>
<p>Check out the announcement trailer below:</p>

<p>Stories from Sol: The Gun-Dog has Native Linux support including for the demo. They plan to release it on February 20th, 2025.</p>

      <title>Ruffy and the Riverside is a unique action-adventure where you have the power to copy and paste textures</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is such a fun idea for a game. Ruffy and the Riverside is a colourful hand-drawn action-adventure where you've got a special power called SWAP, that lets you copy and paste textures in the game.</p>
<p>More about it: "As Ruffy, the Chosen One, you'll harness the magical power of SWAP, and use it to transform the game world. With SWAP you'll change the sun into the moon or ice into lava while overcoming countless puzzles and effortlessly manipulating objects to your will. You can turn a stone into wood to create a boat or swap a wall into rubble to clear your path, and much more as you fight, jump, and ride hay bales throughout the adventure. The unique SWAP ability opens up endless possibilities, making every moment feel magical and full of surprises."</p>
<p>Recently the developer overhauled the Steam page and showed off a brand new trailer</p>

<p>Speaking over email their press team mentioned to me: "Linux Support is guaranteed indeed! (+ the dev will also try and get it Steam Deck approved as close as possible to the launch)".</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>

      <title>Epic Games update the Unreal Tournament website linking to the free downloads from OldUnreal</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/classic-unreal-tournament-and-unreal-now-easier-to-download-free-thanks-to-oldunreal/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Back in November</a>, I reported on Epic Games giving their approval for Unreal 1 and Unreal Tournament becoming completely free to download. Now, Epic Games have updated the official Unreal Tournament website to link to the OldUnreal community.</p>
<p>Their new website is to go along with the Unreal Tournament episode of Amazon's Secret Level series, which is a new adult animated anthology series featuring original stories set within the worlds of some of the world's most beloved video games.</p>
<p>Epic likely did this since Secret Level having an episode revisiting Unreal Tournament might have caused some to think Epic themselves were going to attempt to revive it, again. Clearly though, Epic are done with it, as they continue building Fortnite into a Roblox-styled Metaverse with all sorts of games.</p>
<p>Nice to see Epic putting up a proper website to give thanks to the OldUnreal community like this though, who have been patching up Epic's classic first-person shooters for years.</p>
<p>Epic Games only previously announced Unreal 1 and Unreal Tournament as being freely available, but the page also links to the OldUnreal website for Unreal 2, but they only host the demo and patches <em>not</em> the full game. It's not clear at the moment if this will also become freely available. I've reached out to Epic Games for confirmation on that and the later Unreal Tournament games. <strong>Update 3PM UTC</strong>: Epic Games replied to mention "we have nothing more to share right now".</p>
<p>See more on the <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/unrealtournament" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Unreal Tournament website</a>.</p>

      <title>The Talos Principle: Reawakened announced that rebuilds and expands the original in Unreal Engine 5</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The much loved puzzle adventure The Talos Principle is being remade in Unreal Engine 5, with Croteam / Devolver Digital announcing The Talos Principle: Reawakened. <em>Seems like Croteam are finished with their own Serious Engine now. </em></p>
<p>Speaking about why they went back they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the success of The Talos Principle 2, we have some very cool projects going on, so why go back? There are many reasons, but the biggest one is simply that we love this game and while the original version is admittedly still pretty awesome, we wanted to create a definitive version that will keep the game fresh for years to come and allow a whole new audience to explore the Simulation.</p>
<p>Once again, we poured all our love and creativity into this project. We didn't just want to make a remaster with gorgeous graphics, although that's definitely part of it. But there's a lot more to this. There are quality-of-life improvements that make a real difference (seriously, the recorder puzzles are so much better now!). There's the puzzle editor. There's a whole new story to play! There are even developer commentaries.</p>
<p>Let's talk philosophy for a moment. We don't just think of games as products. These are the works that we will leave behind for future generations. The Talos Principle: Reawakened will both refresh and preserve this wonderful game that means so much to us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This will include the Road to Gehenna expansion, along with a whole new chapter titled "In the Beginning". On top of that it will also come with a whole new puzzle editor for the community.</p>

      <title>Valve now sell refurbished Steam Deck OLED models</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve announced today that they've added the Steam Deck OLED 512GB and 1TB models into their Valve Certified Refurbished program, so you can grab one a bit cheaper. These have been made available in the US, Canada, UK, and EU.</p>
<p>Here's the prices you can expect to pay:</p>
<div class="scrolling-table">
<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" class="table-stripes-tbody">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Model</strong></td>
<td><strong>Normal Price</strong></td>
<td><strong>Refurbished</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>512GB OLED</td>
<td>£479 / $549</td>
<td>£389 / $439</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1TB OLED</td>
<td>£569 / $649</td>
<td>£459 / $519</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p class="plain-list-title">About the Certified Refurbished program:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each Certified Refurbished Steam Deck has been thoroughly tested to the same high standards as our retail units. Every device goes through a complete factory reset, software update, and an extensive examination involving over 100 tests at one of Valve's facilities. Among the tests are all controller inputs, the audio system, the screen, and internals. Battery health is also assessed to ensure proper functionality and longevity.<br/>
<br/>
All refurbished units meet or even exceed the performance standards of new retail units. Although they may have minor cosmetic blemishes, they provide a reliable, high-quality gaming experience at a lower cost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Valve say with each you get "same one-year warranty as a new Steam Deck (unless longer as determined by your country of residence)" along with a fully-tested power supply plus a carrying case as well.</p>
<p>Perhaps this would make for a great holiday gift for someone and you save a little monies. If you can get one that is, as with the refurbished LCD models, stock will come and go over time as Valve make them available and they generally sell out quick quickly.</p>
<p>In case you missed it: we have a<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-experimental-adds-initial-speech-synthesis-support-lots-of-game-fixes-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> big Proton Experimental update</a> out now too, making game modding easier than ever.</p>

      <title>PlayStation 3 emulator RPCS3 released for arm64 works on Raspberry Pi 5 and Apple Silicon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The PlayStation 3 emulator RPCS3 team have been busy as they've announced the release of RPCS3 for arm64 that includes like likes of the Raspberry Pi 5 and Apple Silicon (M1, M2 etc). Since Arm devices are becoming steadily more powerful and more readily available on the desktop, it's fun to see more like this get official builds.</p>
<p>RPCS3's crew tested their new Arm support across the Raspberry Pi 5, and Apple Silicon on both macOS and Asahi Linux (Linux for Apple Silicon Macs). On Apple Silicon, it seems to work quite well across both platforms, but due to the lower power of the RPi5 not many games work well and the resolution needs to be pulled down quite a lot. Still, this is exciting for future Arm hardware and for overall game preservation!</p>
<p>Windows has given them the most issues though due to various issues like no available devices to test on, but they managed it through a virtual machine to at least get somewhere. The main issue they said for commercial titles would that "Windows-on-ARM having a hard requirement for ASLR which doesn’t play too nicely with some aspects of RPCS3’s JIT engine". So downloads are only up for Linux and macOS right now.</p>
<p>You can see their RPi5 video below:</p>

<p>Pine Studio have announced a follow-up to their massively successful Escape Simulator, with Escape Simulator 2 that they plan to be the "ultimate first person escape room experience".</p>
<p>The first game had full Native Linux support but their plans for the sequel are not entirely clear. Initially they <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1435790/eventcomments/596260472619053253/?tscn=1733509882#c596260472619054725" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">replied</a> to me to mention: "We're still looking into that. But Proton version is going to be tested for sure." and they have since updated the Steam page to note Linux support. So we'll have to wait and see exactly how you'll be running it.</p>
<p>With the sequel they're moving away from the colourful cartoon-like graphics, with a much more impressive but less inviting more realistic style. Check out the trailer below:</p>

<p>Boris Barbir, Co-Founder at Pine Studio said: “A sequel gives us the opportunity to start fresh and push the boundaries of the escape room genre. For Escape Simulator 2, we were inspired to explore darker themes and experiment with new gameplay and puzzle mechanics. This sequel also brings significant technical upgrades, including a new rendering engine, rewritten netcode, improved physics, and enhanced animations. While Escape Simulator 2 adopts a darker, more mysterious tone compared to the original, it’s not a horror game—there are no jump scares or gore. We love the Escape Simulator community and we plan to continue supporting the original game while expanding and enhancing Escape Simulator 2 after its launch.”</p>

      <title>Space Marine 2 adds DLSS3, FSR3 and Frame Generation - more playable on Steam Deck, needs launch option for Desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A huge Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 patch has landed improving many parts of the game, along with helping performance with an upgrade to NVIDIA DLSS3, AMD FSR3.1 and Frame Generation plus some improvements to their anti-cheat (Easy Anti-Cheat).</p>
<p>The version bump for DLSS2 and FSR along with adding Frame Generation should enable more systems to perform better overall. For DLSS 3 Frame Generation on Desktop Linux, you'll need the current <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-experimental-adds-initial-speech-synthesis-support-lots-of-game-fixes-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton Experimental</a> or the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-90-4-beta-updated-with-more-game-fixes-needing-testing-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Beta of Proton 9.0-4</a> which both have support for it added. Another major change is that as of this update mods are no longer supported in public lobbies. As they <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/6681747476222836957?l=english" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">explained</a> previously, it was causing all sorts of server problems but they're still allowed in private games. Seems fair enough.</p>
<p>For Desktop Linux, if you want to actually play <em>online</em> multiplayer, you will need to pretend your PC is a Steam Deck with this launch command:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">SteamDeck=1 %command%</code></p>
<p>This will initially also drop all your settings down to Low and 30FPS limit, so you'll then need to change your graphics settings. If you <em>don't</em> do the launch option on Desktop Linux you'll see an EOS error at the menu (single-player still works), and you'll be kicked from online games due to mods being detected (even with none).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5448569591733831501gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5448569591733831501gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11560939281733831502gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11560939281733831502gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><em>Slightly annoying that we're seeing more games do this lately, but at least it's easy to work around. </em></p>
<p>With the launch option, online play appears to work without issue on Desktop Linux with Proton Experimental.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12661419051733832119gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12661419051733832119gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 on Kubuntu 24.04, online PvP</em></p>
<p>On Steam Deck directly though, the game launches without issue. And thanks to the AMD FSR update, it <em>should</em> look and perform better than before.</p>
<p>I don't have any direct comparison here for the Steam Deck though since I didn't try it previously. I've seen others play it, and it was <em>awful</em> originally. What's surprising here with Space Marine 2 update 5.0 now is that on Steam Deck with Low settings + AMD FSR Performance and Frame Generation On — it's actually a <em>lot</em> more playable.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12588186241733833859gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12588186241733833859gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>Since Frame Generation is usually <em>terrible</em> if the game is already struggling below 60FPS, I'm surprised that not only did it make Space Marine 2 on Steam Deck hit much higher FPS, but the frame timing remained mostly <em>okay</em> as well. I still firmly <em>don't</em> recommend it on Steam Deck though, as the visual quality is pretty poor and there's a fair amount of small text.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental adds initial speech synthesis support, lots of game fixes for Steam Deck / Linux and easier modding</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Proton Experimental has been updated from Valve with some new features like initial speech synthesis support, along with the usual assortment of fixes for specific games running on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux. Confused on what Proton is and how to use it? See <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my beginner's guide</a>.</p>
<p>The initial addition of speech synthesis currently requires you to manually install "<a href="http://steam://install/3086180" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Proton Voice Files</a>", something people saw pop up recently that led to some wild speculation. They've confirmed it works with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1716360/Infinite_Stars__The_Visual_Novel/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Infinite Stars - The Visual Novel</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13496924271733826178gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Other changes from this update include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Now Playable: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/924310/VIDEO_GAME/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">VIDEO GAME</a>.</li>
<li>Fixed Star Wars Outlaws not being playable on some setups.</li>
<li>Fixed Hell Let Loose crashing when joining a server after a recent game update.</li>
<li>Fixed Rivals of Aether II crashing with Intel GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed fullscreen mode in The Bright Star Of Seraph-Katis.</li>
<li>Improved video playback in Max: The Curse of Brotherhood.</li>
<li>Fixed Dread X Collection 3 Bete Grise minigame.</li>
<li>Fixed Proton Experimental regressions:
	<ul>
<li>Progressbar95 no longer has crackling audio when using mouse.</li>
<li>Hell Let Loose again plays audio when showing developer logos.</li>
<li>Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin no longer requries constant mouse movement to progress.</li>
<li>Fixed Ghostbusters: The Video Game Remastered crashing when playing some of the HD bonus videos.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed CPU topology override issues on machines with more than 32 logical cores.</li>
<li>Added support for game mods that load via custom dinput8.dll.</li>
<li>Fixed Space Engineers not registering trigger input with controllers.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>All from the <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a>.</em></p>
<p>Writing about the update, Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/plagman.bsky.social/post/3lcxtzif7qs24" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted this</a> on Bluesky:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On new Proton Experimental, most mods can now just be extracted/copied next to the game .exe, without requiring any extra steps like setting WINEDLLOVERRIDES. This change will also be in future stable Proton releases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Modding Windows games through Proton has long been a nuisance, so removing a barrier like this is fantastic news.</p>
<p>In case you missed it a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/proton-experimental-adds-dlss-3-frame-generation-support-plus-fixes-for-dragon-age-the-veilguard-rivals-of-aether-ii-and-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previous Proton Experimental update</a> added support for NVIDIA Optical Flow API and DLSS 3 Frame Generation for Desktop Linux. We're getting some great stuff for gaming on Linux lately.</p>
<p>On top of that don't miss that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-90-4-beta-updated-with-more-game-fixes-needing-testing-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-4 is currently in testing</a> as the next stable version of Proton that most games will be expected to use.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Humble continue bringing back some popular game bundles for a limited time that I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/humble-bundle-are-bringing-back-11-popular-game-bundles-for-a-limited-time/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wrote about recently</a>, and now you can get another chance to pick up the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/beamdog-owlcat-rpg-masters-encore" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Beamdog &amp; Owlcat RPG Bundle</a> which really is a good deal. <em>Each bundle they bring back over the next week or so will only be up for 2 days, so act fast.</em></p>
<p>Using ratings from Valve on Steam Deck Verified, plus any <a href="http://protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> and Native Linux notes here's all that's in it. Plus as usual each is a Steam link if you need more info first.</p>
<p>Considering it has Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, which alone at the highest previous discount costs more than the entire bundle, it's an awesome deal. A <em>great</em> time for it too since Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader just had a huge update with new cutscenes, a lot of new items, new voiceovers, better loot tables and tons more.</p>

      <title>Arch Linux Package Management (ALPM) gets funding from Sovereign Tech Agency</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems like Arch Linux is going from strength to strength lately. Not only have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/more-info-on-the-valve-steam-collab-with-arch-linux-and-potential-future-hardware-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve begun funding parts of the Linux distribution</a> but now the <a href="https://www.sovereign.tech/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Sovereign Tech Agency</a> are as well.</p>
<p>Writing in an <a href="https://lists.archlinux.org/archives/list/arch-dev-public@lists.archlinux.org/thread/MZLH43574GGP7QQ7RKAAIRFT5LJPCEB4/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on the Arch Linux development mailing list developer David Runge shared the news that Sovereign Tech Agency provided funding for developers Arne Christian Beer, Heiko Schäfer, Orhun Parmaksız and David Runge to work on ALPM part time over 15 months. Work started back in October, with it expected to continue through until the end of 2025.</p>
<p>The announcement mentions the funding supports multiple milestones for the project, which I've noted below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Formal specifications for packaging data formats</strong></p>
<p>The Arch Linux packaging ecosystem uses underspecified/undocumented file and metadata types, yet we need to be able to use them reliably in other contexts such as package creation, build and package repository management tooling.</p>
<p>Therefore this milestone involves developing versioned specifications for all low-level descriptor file and implementing Rust libraries based on them. These will be based on the existing ad-hoc reference implementations in<br/>
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Makepkg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">makepkg</a> and pacman.</p>
<p><strong>Basic OpenPGP verification of artifacts</strong></p>
<p>Signature verification in Arch Linux package management currently hinges on a stateful GnuPG keyring. This solution is brittle and has already caused various issues related to the Arch Linux keyring in the past.</p>
<p>To simplify signature verification - while at the same time enabling the use of a more diverse set of cryptographic technologies - a specification for the <a href="https://uapi-group.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">UAPI group</a> will be written. An accompanying Rust library will be provided as a simple and stateless integration, not limited to use in Arch Linux.</p>
<p><strong>Rust library for handling of individual packages</strong></p>
<p>The structure of Arch Linux package files is currently not explicitly defined. This milestone focuses on providing a formal specification of what an ALPM-based package contains, how it is created and handled. A dedicated Rust library and tool will facilitate package creation, validation and installation.</p>
<p>These new Rust libraries will also expose a C API for possible integration into the C-based libalpm library.</p>
<p><strong>Rust library for system package management</strong></p>
<p>This milestone revolves around the use of the previously implemented components by providing a library for package download, validation, verification, installation and state handling similar to pacman's libalpm and will handle sets of individual packages on user systems.</p>
<p>A C-API will be provided for compatibility with libalpm-based applications.</p>
<p>One specific concern of this milestone is modernizing the OpenPGP integration.</p>
<p>Current package management tooling does not allow for scoping signature verifiers (e.g. OpenPGP certificates) for a specific purpose, such as "only packages" or "only repository metadata".</p>
<p>The new system will rely on a stateless approach such as the one to be proposed as specification to the UAPI group.</p>
<p><strong>Distribution-agnostic OpenPGP stack for the verification of distribution artifacts</strong></p>
<p>This milestone will focus on a set of foundational libraries, based on a UAPI specification from a previous milestone.<br/>
These libraries will add support for PGPKI (aka the “Web of Trust”) in the generic directory structure for OpenPGP certificates used for the verification of distribution artifacts.</p>
<p>The libraries mentioned above will be integrated into the ALPM context to allow for example the full verification of packages and repository metadata.</p>
<p>A Rust-based solution will be provided as a modern alternative to the current<br/>
GnuPG-based approach.</p>
<p><strong>The outcome(s)</strong></p>
<p>The ALPM project strives to build a modern, sustainable, maintainable and memory-safe framework for the Arch Linux packaging ecosystem. This framework will enable robust and predictable integration for all package<br/>
related tooling and libraries.</p>
<p>The project goals are intentionally ambitious while being constrained to a relatively short period of time.</p>
<p>The work is organized so that real world benefits will happen early and often. Several infrastructure related projects have already reached out with a concrete interest to make use of libraries created in the first phase of the project.</p>
<p>The work will be done in the open, on the <a href="https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/alpm/alpm" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Arch Linux GitLab</a>.</p>
<p>Everyone and anyone is welcome to join in and help out!</p>

      <title>Funko issue a statement about the itch.io take-down, while also apparently calling itch founder&#39;s mom</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/itchio-store-was-taken-down-by-funko-due-to-trash-ai-powered-phishing-report/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Recently I wrote about</a> how the much loved itch.io store got taken down by Funko (as in Funko Pop figures). The situation seems thankfully sorted with itch back up, but things got a little weird.</p>
<p>Writing on X / Twitter, the itch.io official account <a href="https://x.com/itchio/status/1866239798924763227" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> to mention Funko called their mother:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4666813661733823447gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>That's pretty crazy behaviour, if really true. Especially, when you see the below.</p>
<p>While the official Funko account an hour later on that same day <a href="https://x.com/OriginalFunko/status/1866255848366039468" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> up a statement: </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8361038231733823603gol1.jpg"/></p>
<blockquote>
<p>At Funko, we hold a deep respect and appreciation for indie games, indie gamers, and indie developers. We’re fans of fans, and we love the creativity and passion that define the indie gaming community.</p>
<p>Recently, one of our brand protection partners identified a page on http://itch.io imitating the Funko Fusion development website. A takedown request was issued to address this specific page. Funko did not request a takedown of the @itchio platform, and we’re happy the site was back up by this morning.</p>
<p>We have reached out to @itchio to engage with them on this issue and we deeply appreciate the understanding of the gaming community as the details are determined. Thank you for sharing in our passion for creativity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's two issues with the statement. The first, is that there's not even a simply basic apology included there. The second, is that it <em>wasn't</em> just a simple take-down request. As itch founder Leaf "leafo" Corcoran posted on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42364033" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Hacker News</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm the one running itch.io, so here's some more context for you:<br/>
From what I can tell, some person made a fan page for an existing Funko Pop video game (Funko Fusion), with links to the official site and screenshots of the game. The BrandShield software is probably instructed to eradicate all "unauthorized" use of their trademark, so they sent reports independently to our host and registrar claiming there was "fraud and phishing" going on, likely to cause escalation instead of doing the expected DMCA/cease-and-desist. Because of this, I honestly think they're the malicious actor in all of this. Their website, if you care: https://www.brandshield.com/</p>
<p>About 5 or 6 days ago, I received these reports on our host (Linode) and from our registrar (iwantmyname). I expressed my disappointment in my responses to both of them but told them I had removed the page and disabled the account. Linode confirmed and closed the case. iwantmyname never responded. This evening, I got a downtime alert, and while debugging, I noticed that the domain status had been set to "serverHold" on iwantmyname's domain panel. We have no other abuse reports from iwantmyname other than this one. I'm assuming no one on their end "closed" the ticket, so it went into an automatic system to disable the domain after some number of days.</p>
<p>I've been trying to get in touch with them via their abuse and support emails, but no response likely due to the time of day, so I decided to "escalate" the issue myself on social media.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What an absolutely insane situation.</p>

      <title>Raspberry Pi 500 and Raspberry Pi Monitor are available now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just in time for the holiday season, Raspberry Pi have launched two new bits of hardware for you to tinker with the Raspberry Pi 500 and an official Raspberry Pi Monitor.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The <strong>Raspberry Pi 500</strong> is a refresh of their popular all-in-one PC, the Raspberry Pi 400, now powered by the Raspberry Pi 5. The official specs:</p>
<ul>
<li>2.4GHz quad-core 64-bit Arm Cortex-A76 processor</li>
<li>8GB LPDDR4X-4267 SDRAM</li>
<li>VideoCore VII GPU, supporting OpenGL ES 3.1 and Vulkan 1.3</li>
<li>Dual 4Kp60 HDMI® display output</li>
<li>Dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi® and Bluetooth 5.0</li>
<li>2 × USB 3.0 ports, supporting simultaneous 5Gbps operation</li>
<li>1 × USB 2.0 port</li>
<li>Gigabit Ethernet port</li>
<li>Horizontal 40-pin Raspberry Pi GPIO connector</li>
</ul>
<p>You also get an official 32GB Micro-SD card bundled with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18953909161733749955gol1.jpeg"/><br/>
<em>Really brings back some memories of one of my first loves, the Amiga!</em></p>
<p>As for the <strong>Raspberry Pi Monitor</strong> it's a '15.6″ full HD IPS panel with a 45% colour gamut and an 80° viewing angle' (quoted from their news post). You get a pair of 1.2W speakers, a fold-away stand, VESA mounting points and power via USB-C. It can be powered directly by a Raspberry Pi too, although brightness gets limited to 60% and volume to 50%.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12090045001733749956gol1.jpeg"/></p>
<p>With these launched, they've also now reduced the price on the Raspberry Pi 400 from $70 to $60, and the Raspberry Pi 400 Personal Computer Kit from $100 to $80. They're also now bundling a Micro-SD card with the Raspberry Pi 400.</p>

      <title>OBS Studio 31 released with first-party YouTube Chat features, new NVIDIA filters and Linux improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>OBS Studio has a brand new stable release available! The awesome free and open source video capture tool OBS Studio <a href="https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/releases/tag/31.0.0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">31.0.0</a> is out now. <em>This release went live on December 7th.</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the release notes the main new features are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added NVIDIA Blur Filter and Background Blur.</li>
<li>Added preview scrollbars and zoom/scale indicator.</li>
<li>Added v210 format support for AJA device capture.</li>
<li>Added Amazon IVS service integration.</li>
<li>Added QSV AV1 Screen Content Coding.</li>
<li>Enabled first-party YouTube Chat features.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18667317511733749234gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">There's various other improvements and fixes, including some tweak for the Linux client like:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Changed display and window capture on Linux to not capture implicitly.</li>
<li>Improved screensaver inhibit functions on Linux in Flatpak</li>
<li>Disabled the (currently unsupported) built-in Automatic Scene Switcher when using Wayland on Linux.</li>
<li>Fixed two crashes with the QSV encoder on Linux.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash on Linux when importing a scene collection created on Windows.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/pull/11232" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">change</a> to display / window capture is a nice one, that will stop it automatically capturing a window without you directly telling it to, something that has been a problem for a long time.</p>
<p>At time of writing that <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/com.obsproject.Studio" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Flathub</a> package has not yet been updated. Hopefully soon since it's been a few days since the release.</p>

      <title>EA pledge another 23 accessibility patents for public royalty-free use</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>EA did another actually genuinely great thing here. They've expanded their previous patent pledge for game developers to use without problems.</p>
<p>Their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/ea-open-source-fonttik-helps-devs-check-text-size-a-contrast-m-plus-patent-pledges/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">original pledge</a> a few years ago included the open source Fonttik tool along with six accessibility patents for public use, which they then <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/ea-opens-up-more-patents-for-increasing-accessibility-in-gaming/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">expanded in 2023</a> to include more patents for developers to use. This has expanded once again to include another 23 patents focused on accessibility that developers are free to use.</p>
<p>From their <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/2024-accessibility-patent-pledge" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These newly pledged patents cover technologies to improve speech recognition, generate more personalized speech and simplify the use of speech recognition technologies in computing and gaming devices.  </p>
<p>Among other things, these patented accessibility technologies could be used to improve the gameplay experience of players who have speech disability or who prefer or need assistance with verbally expressing themselves. They could make it possible for those players’ speech to be more effectively recognized and reflected in-game in a way that is representative of their age, emotion, language and speaking style. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>On top of that they've also open sourced their <a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/IRIS-Unreal-Plugin/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">IRIS plugin</a> for Unreal Engine, which allows in-engine use of EA's photosensitivity analysis tech, <a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/iris" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">IRIS</a>, which was previously open sourced.</p>
<p>What does it actually mean? EA allow the use of all the listed patents royalty-free, so they will not go after any game developer that chooses to implement features the patents describe.</p>
<p>It's good to see patents be used in this way. Many companies use patents to go after other companies, so it's quite refreshing to see a publisher as big as EA stock them up to not just protect themselves, but for others too.</p>

      <title>Steam sets a new record with 39 million concurrent users online</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Over the weekend the Steam store from Valve managed to smash another record, something it has done repeatedly this year and it shows no sign of slowing down.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/753/charts/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> the new concurrent user record of people online is 39,205,447 as of Sunday, December 8th at 2PM UTC. At the time 12,090,313 people were actually in-game as well.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Based on peak player counts, over the last 24 hours the top games were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Counter-Strike 2</li>
<li>PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS</li>
<li>Dota 2</li>
<li>Path of Exile 2</li>
<li>Marvel Rivals</li>
</ol>
<p>No surprise really to see Steam hitting a record with both Path of Exile 2 and Marvel Rivals releasing over the last week. Both of them have been absolute monster releases with their peak player counts together hitting over a million.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some history for you of recent milestones of people online:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/steam-breaks-38-million-concurrent-users-for-the-first-time/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">September 2024 - 38 million</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/steam-sets-a-new-record-with-372-million-concurrent-users-online/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">August 2024 - 37 million</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/steam-breaking-records-again-hitting-over-36-million-players-online/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">March 2024 - 36 million</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/steam-broke-another-record-with-over-35-million-people-online/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">March 2024 - 35 million</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/steam-smashes-its-peak-players-online-record-to-over-34-million/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">March 2024 - 34 million</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/steam-breaks-more-records-with-33-million-online-and-over-10-million-gaming/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">January 2023 - 33 million</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can clearly see 2024 has been an absolute knock-out year for Valve. Steam was already a money-printing machine, and it seems now even more so.</p>

      <title>Minimalist mini-game filled survival city-builder Dawnfolk gets a release date and new demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dawnfolk from developer Darenn Keller is absolutely lovely, a minimalist survival city-builder with each tile having a little mini-game. Really unique and one you need to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>The developer recently revealed it's going to launch on February 13th, which will have full Native Linux support, and there's even a brand new expanded demo you can try too.</p>
<p>More about it: "In Dawnfolk, you will explore an uncharted medieval fantasy world, manage resources, build cities, and survive against many dangers. Minigames add a unique challenge to supporting your people. The better you are at the minigames, the more resources you get and the more likely your community will weather the darkness. Every choice matters as you explore different strategies and play styles in Dawnfolk."</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer below:</p>

      <title>itch.io store was taken down by Funko due to &#34;trash AI Powered&#34; phishing report</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This was an interesting one to come back to today. Game store <a href="https://itch.io/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">itch.io</a> was taken offline recently, due to a "bogus Phishing report to our registrar".</p>
<p>For people who don't understand how websites work, there was no issue with their data on their actual hosting server, the problem was with the web address. Their domain registrar disabled their domain name itch.io directly, due to what itch said was a "bogus Phishing report".</p>
<p>Speaking in a social media post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/itch.io/post/3lcu6h465bs2n" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, the official itch account said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I kid you not, @itch.io has been taken down by Funko of "Funko Pop" because they use some trash "AI Powered" Brand Protection Software called Brand Shield that created some bogus Phishing report to our registrar, iwantmyname, who ignored our response and just disabled the domain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a follow up <a href="https://x.com/itchio/status/1866022784222245305" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X / Twitter (they didn't post this to Bluesky), the itch account mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, for transparency, we *did* take the disputed page down as soon as we got the notice because it's not worth fighting stuff like that. Regardless, our registrar's automated system likely kicked to disable the domain since no one read our confirmation of removal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>It seems to be back up now.</em></p>
<p>What this does is highlight how anything like this should be manually reviewed first. Automated systems should not be able to take down such a high-profile and long-running website like itch. There's a lot of problems with how this was handled by both Funko / Brand Shield and iwantmyname.</p>
<p>It's an ongoing long-running problem across the whole web. Things can be taken down so easily without confirmation anywhere. The whole take-down system is just full of flaws and gets abused all the time, just look at YouTube, people have complained about it there forever.</p>

<p>Path of Exile 2 from Grinding Gear Games has officially arrived, although it's not quite finished yet as it's in Early Access. <em>Note: personal purchase.</em></p>
<p>The developer didn't reply to my request, so I've only just briefly jumped in today to check and see if it actually runs on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux. The good news there — is that it does! The game does launch right out of the box with the <a href="http://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/proton-90-3-released-and-proton-experimental-upgraded-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest stable Proton 9.0-3</a>.</p>
<p>Grinding Gear said they expect it to remain in Early Access for "as long as needed" which they expect will be "at least 6 months". Even though it's not done, it's still absolutely huge. There's somewhere around 400 different types of monsters, about 50 bosses and a whole lot of end-game content to play through. This game will keep you going for a long time, just as the first game did.</p>

<p><strong>Steam Deck</strong></p>
<p>Testing on a Steam Deck LCD 512GB, with the game on the SSD and the game loaded up fine! Gamepad input detected as soon as I moved a thumbstick and so away we go. The game is definitely playable on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Performance has been a bit…<strong>strange</strong>. On the lowest settings I've seen times where the same area will barely hold 30-40FPS, and other times it will give me a <em>drastically</em> smoother 50-60FPS. It's been thoroughly confusing that's for sure, and I've had to re-write this section a few times after doing repeated testing when fully reloading the game. So, your mileage here may vary, it <em>might</em> perform well for you, it <em>might</em> not. Entirely possible it's some server instancing issue messing with the performance at times.</p>
<p>Pictures below on Low settings, AMD FSR Performance, 60FPS limit, Dynamic Resolution On:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11400292831733528660gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11400292831733528660gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5120963571733529376gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5120963571733529376gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p><em>You won't get much more than 1hr 30mins on the LCD Steam Deck battery.</em></p>
<p>One big problem though is that lots of the text is small. There's some UI scaling, but seemingly no text scaling, so I still had to pull the deck up close to my face to read some parts. Especially annoying for a game like this, where you'll be reading over items and skills quite often. Higher levels of UI scaling can also cause some parts of the UI to go off the Steam Deck screen cutting it off.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/46868441733524805gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/46868441733524805gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18218564251733525035gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18218564251733525035gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
<em>That was one heck of a boss fight…</em></p>
<p>There's also some clear bugs, with it being in Early Access and all, like my first crash to my Steam Library when entering a portal the game just threw this up at me:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7044950191733525449gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7044950191733525449gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Overall: definitely playable! I just hope the <em>weird</em> performance issue is figured out.</p>
<p><strong>Desktop Linux</strong></p>
<p>Considering it ran on the Steam Deck, I wasn't expecting any trouble on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 24.10) with an AMD GPU and as expected, no real issues there.</p>
<p>However, for <u>NVIDIA</u> users, you may see a black screen. One fix there is to force the game into DirectX12 mode, which it seems you need to do directly in a configuration file. This file can be found somewhere like this depending on where you have it installed:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">~/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/2694490/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Documents/My Games/Path of Exile 2/poe2_production_Config.ini</code></p>
<p>Inside there set "renderer_type=DirectX12" on Line 7 (it will be Vulkan by default). Then you should be good to go.</p>
<p>Another <em>potential</em> fix I've been told that works with NVIDIA is to run the game with <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Gamescope</a>.</p>
<p>On mostly High settings with my Ryzen 5800x, Radeon 6800 XT:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7070744651733526292gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7070744651733526292gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><strong>Initial Launch Issues</strong></p>
<p>The actual launch was just a <em>bit</em> rocky, with the login not working as the developer had to do some truly last-minute <a href="https://x.com/pathofexile/status/1865098048571113779" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">upgrades</a> on their database system. So over 400,000 people we're playing a loading screen simulator. I'm not exactly complaining though. Launching games is <em>hard</em>, especially online connected games such as this when a ridiculous amount of people are trying to jump in all at the same time. The community even <a href="https://x.com/SteamDB/status/1865128830907605273" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">took down</a> SteamDB as people were hammering it trying to see what was happening.</p>
<p>Still, when the servers went up, seeing then 19,658 people ahead of me in a queue was quite <em>frustrating </em>to say the least. A queue that seemed like it wasn't actually going anywhere. Got there eventually though, <em>only</em> another 5 minutes staring at the red number of people ticking down until it was my turn. At last! At least, that's what I <em>thought</em>, I had a brief 30 seconds of bliss with a cut-scene and the game booted me back to the login screen. A "configuration problem" the developer <a href="https://x.com/pathofexile/status/1865134494321455276" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">said</a> this time.</p>
<p>40 or so minutes later, and I'm back into a queue. Just a few ahead of me, <em>only</em> 17,430 people and so another 4 minutes sat watching it tick down again. Got there eventually…for 5 minutes, then the London Realm and others <a href="https://vxtwitter.com/pathofexile/status/1865145572875018750" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">went down</a> and I was kicked out again. At this point, you get the idea, the launch has <em>not</em> been the best. Clearly, the <em>login screen</em> is the hardest boss of them all.</p>
<p>Anyway. Wonderful to see <em>another</em> huge game launch working on Linux platforms at release just like with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/marvel-rivals-out-now-free-on-steam-and-works-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Marvel Rivals</a>.</p>

      <title>Pizza-delivery bullet heaven Pest Apocalypse is hilarious chaos - out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pest Apocalypse from Kikimora Games is out now, a fresh Bullet Heaven blending together the worlds of Vampire Survivors with something like Crazy Taxi and it's thoroughly chaotic. I've made this joke before, and I'll do it again, this is VANpire Survivors.<em> Look it's a good joke okay.</em></p>
<p>What you get here is a quality mixture of mechanics. The repeated runs of building up a crazy combination of weapons and abilities popularized by Vampire Survivors, but with the spin on it that you're in a fast-moving vehicle equipped with a nitro boost. Each pizza you deliver enables you to pick a new passenger with their own weapon, and you really can make a pretty wild ride.</p>
<p>The developer sent over a release key and I've been having a real blast with it, sending my little van speeding across the map to collect and deliver one pizza after another, while also being chased by hordes of creatures.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Sq14-U58btM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1df396ee8f245302b099ac05ba9455e6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Sq14-U58btM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Not only do you get to pick various passengers (weapons) after you do a successful delivery, but there's also a weapon upgrade system too. As you wheel-spin and drift your way around the map squishing all sorts of creatures, you can collect blue upgrade orbs they drop to level up, and depending on how many you have when you deliver the pizza, you'll then be able to further enhance your weapons.</p>
<p>Aside from that there's a meta upgrade system too. As you progress through a run you'll earn tips for doing a good job, which you can then use in the main menu to do meta upgrades like passenger damage output, attack cooldown, max vehicle health and more.</p>
<p>I also really love the silly cinematic camera that appears when you launch your vehicle over ramps. A fun little touch. It's a game that only gets funnier the more you play it. Across the maps you can find temporary pickups too like a big ball with spikes attached by a chain to your van. The physics in Pest Apocalypse can be a little funky, but that only adds to the comedic charm here I think.</p>
<p>Very similar in style to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/earl-vs-the-mutants-is-choatic-survivor-like-fun-with-vehicles/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Earl vs. the Mutants</a> that I looked at previously, but here you have a specific purpose pushing you on to keep going, and in terms of style, overall feel and content - Pest Apocalypse is a bigger and better game (with a higher price to match). Pest Apocalypse also has Native Linux support, built with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>.</p>
<p>Pest Apocalypse is surprisingly challenging too, a lot more so than I would say other Bullet Heaven games are. Partly due to the vehicle speed and your turning circle, making dodging enemies all that more challenging. But also the vehicle health, it doesn't actually take much to get destroyed if you're not careful. All that only adds to the intense feeling of needing <em>just one more drive</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20910352511733501491gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20910352511733501491gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Another nice feature is that you have a tip level. I mentioned earlier that you gain tips for all the deliveries, but this adds up to its own special counter as well and each time it levels up after run you then get to pick a special unlock as well. This could be new drops from enemies that will appear during a run, new passengers (weapons), items and more.</p>
<p>No problems at all on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 24.10) with the Linux version. Pest Apocalypse is also pretty much a perfect Steam Deck game. Performance is good and the runs are reasonably short too.</p>
<p>A very firm recommendation. Now I need van to come and deliver me some pizza. For now I'll settle for another run to see what ridiculous weapon combo I can make. Go get it, great fun.</p>

      <title>MMO interplanetary crafting adventure SpaceCraft from Shiro Games (Northgard, Wartales) announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Shiro Games developer of Northgard, Wartales and Dune: Spice Wars have announced SpaceCraft, and my space-nerd brain is now very excited. It's a "massively multiplayer interplanetary crafting adventure" according to the press email, whatever that actually means.</p>
<p>Looks like it will have a big mixture of gameplay with free open-world exploration across the stars, along with you being able to explore planets directly on the ground as well. On the planets you can mine for resources, do some crafting, build a base and there's even automation systems as well. The actual spaceships look modular with you building them up from various components, and the economy will be player-driven as well. </p>
<p>Overall it seems like a bit of a blend of Eve Online, Satisfactory and Avorion. Which could be awesome, although likely a huge timesink. Have a looksie at the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bdd0avB3t-g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/875b5d7dc81828ab3e5d50db018f52a2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bdd0avB3t-g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“We wanted to give players a spectacular open-ended world to explore, where their decisions have an impact and they have full freedom to choose their own destiny,” said Nicolas Cannasse, CEO of Shiro Games. “Build complex starships and bases, conduct trade deals in a real-time economy, and form alliances and rivalries at your discretion. From the time you start the game, SpaceCraft is your story to tell.”</p>
<p>Hopefully it will work well on Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> with no <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat</a> annoyances. Right to the top of my wishlist it goes.</p>

      <title>Epic science fantasy roguelike Caves of Qud 1.0 is out now and it&#39;s a wild ride</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Caves of Qud is a proper roguelike, with deep science fantasy lore and after 15+ years of development it is finally finished with the 1.0 release now available. Easily one of the best roguelikes ever made, a game not to be missed, even if you're not usually into the genre it's just a wild ride to play through.</p>
<p>I adore everything about this game from the wild characters you can make with all sorts of insane abilities and mutations, to their deep descriptions and lore on everything in the world. Even the doors and walls have descriptions on them, the game is just massively detailed in every way. The new UI is also a thing of retro beauty.</p>
<p>My latest character was a fun one. I had the ability to fire an electromagnetic pulse, with heightened hearing, night vision, i could make a force bubble around myself, create a force wall to protect myself and reflect mental attacks back at enemies. However, my character also suffers from Amnesia, and tends to forget things at times…</p>
<p>Thankfully there's multiple game modes, so you can make it a bit more adventure-like and less punishing if you wish to explore it more easily.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4nG-N_jtpZI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d66c750a3eb8ce7c073b04be62dc31b8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4nG-N_jtpZI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">New as of the 1.0 release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tutorial to teach the basics of the game.</li>
<li>Final quest in the main questline &amp; the end of the game.</li>
<li>Several new music tracks, sound effects, and items.</li>
<li>40 new achievements.</li>
<li>Lots of bugfixes and small feature improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the 1.0 launch there's also the new  Dromad Deluxe edition that includes the game, the original soundtrack and the Pets of Harvest Dawn DLC to pick from 13 unique companions to start the game with.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the press release:</p>
<p>“It's hard to think of<em> Caves of Qud</em> as anything other than our life's work,” says Jason Grinblat, Founder and Designer at Freehold Games. “We've been making it for almost 20 years now, and the success it has already, has felt like a fever dream. It's so easy to imagine we're still in Brian's converted garage working on the game for our three friends. The prospect of it finally arriving at 1.0 is thrilling, dizzying... exhausting. We're looking forward to Kitfox's support after launch so we can crawl under our desks and sleep for a few months. Anyway, please play it!”</p>
<p>It's launched with Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Flathub to become a self-sustaining entity and they&#39;re looking to hire someone to help</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://flathub.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Flathub</a> has positioned itself as pretty much the go-to place for Linux apps, since it works across many distributions and is even on the Steam Deck. Now, the GNOME Foundation are looking to hire someone to help expand it into a self-sustaining entity.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://discourse.flathub.org/t/request-for-proposals-flathub-program-management/8276" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> on the Flathub Discourse Forum, the GNOME Foundation are looking to hire a contractor to help sort through management, legal and financial stuff with it being funded by Endless. This is all also being done in partnership with KDE e.V. too.</p>
<p>The budget for it seems pretty low though at $12,000 for an expected 3 months of part-time work on it. To me it seems a bit overly optimistic on how long this sort of thing would take to be fully sorted. Especially when you look at what the role entails like:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Oversee deployment of payment systems for applications and direct donations to Flathub operating costs.</li>
<li>Finalise governance documents and convene a simple governing body for Flathub with representatives from GNOME, KDE and the Flathub community.</li>
<li>Establish and manage bank and Stripe payment processing accounts.</li>
<li>Finalize and launch terms of use and developer agreements.</li>
<li>Coordinate handling of accounting, operations and expenses with the GNOME Foundation.</li>
<li>Ensure transparency through clear communications and documentation for the community.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully something is worked out, because Flathub has become a seriously good thing for the Linux desktop.</p>

      <title>Free to play Marvel Rivals is out now on Steam and works on Steam Deck / Linux (Steam Deck has issues though)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Marvel Rivals is the next big multiplayer shooter and potentially the next "big thing", with a Steam free to play release now live. What is it? Pretty much Marvel Overwatch.</p>
<p>The good news, is that it <em>does</em> actually work on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux thanks to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>. Not only that, this is <em>not</em> a case of it accidentally working either, it's supported. Straight from the developer in their Discord one of their team <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1193841000108531764/1202076175355355176/1314354112812290048" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">said</a> very clearly: "Yes Steam Deck supported. Bugs on black cutscenes".</p>
<p><em>There's clear issues right now though. So here's how to get it working on Steam Deck.</em></p>
<p>When you go to play it on Steam Deck / Linux you may encounter errors about drivers and the operating system, which can be safely ignored. On Steam Deck, I just needed to use the touch screen to tap the confirmation boxes and then hit play on the launcher.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16243454001733477819gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16243454001733477819gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5059451721733477819gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5059451721733477819gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>After it's loaded shaders, at least with Proton 9.0-3, you will end up seeing black screens with audio playing, which the developer mentioned in my quote above. The good news, is that's an easy fix!</p>
<p><strong>How to fix Marvel Rivals on Steam Deck</strong></p>
<p>Go into Desktop Mode (STEAM button - Power - Switch to Desktop) and run Marvel Rivals from there. Once it loads the launcher you can control the mouse by holding down the STEAM button and using the Right Thumbpad to move the mouse, with Right Trigger as your mouse button to hit the buttons in the launcher and you can then get into the game properly.</p>
<p>The initial black screen is supposed to show their privacy acceptance screen and agreement screen, which only seem to work in Desktop Mode. Here you can use a mixture of touch-screen and mouse input to get through it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19164423381733479146gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>After that though, it wants you to enter a username, and since you're in Desktop Mode you <em>can't</em> bring up a keyboard overlay on top of the game properly. So hit the Power button <em>once</em>, select Log Out and it sends you back to Gaming Mode. Then launch the game again, and it will work properly.</p>
<p>You'll still see <em>some</em> black screens though, but if you swap Marvel Rivals over to <strong>Proton Experimental</strong> (Properties -&gt; Compatibility) they seem to be fixed with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14093559831733479037gol1.jpeg"/></p>
<p>So it's a bit of work, that will likely be made easier with updates to Proton from Valve and updates to the game. I'm sure Valve will figure out what causes the black screens with the agreement acceptance and get it fixed.</p>
<p>Performance on Steam Deck is not especially great, and cut-scenes lag quite a lot. Actual gameplay is playable enough though, once you turn the settings onto Low and put FSR onto Performance.</p>
<p>Pictures below on Low / FSR Balanced:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13309122041733479753gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13309122041733479753gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10775312451733479799gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10775312451733479799gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Over on Desktop Linux, sticking with <strong>Proton Experimental</strong> as noted above to sort any black screens, and the experience is about what I expected. No issue getting it working there. You still get the driver / operating system version errors to click away but the privacy acceptance screens show up as normal, and you can get into Marvel Rivals without an issue at all.</p>
<p>Picture below on Kubuntu 24.10 Desktop, Ultra settings:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19770803471733480764gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19770803471733480764gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I've been enjoying trying it out, as a fan of games like it, and so far the gameplay is actually really fun, as are the designs of all the characters with their abilities. Looking forward to playing more of Marvel Rivals on Linux.</p>
<p>Don't forget to keep an eye on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat compatibility page</a> for updates on all games for Linux / Steam Deck.

      <title>Valve may be working on a new kind of Steam Machine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's a whole bunch of hints and speculation going around right now, showing that Valve may be working towards a new kind of Steam Machine. Suddenly, their new <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/new-steam-controller-2-and-vr-controller-designs-got-leaked/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Controller 2 that was leaked</a>, along with the new <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/valves-new-branding-guidelines-hint-at-steam-decks-steamos-for-more-devices/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS branding guidelines</a> make a whole lot more sense if this is true.</p>
<p>While the SteamOS branding mentions third-party vendors using it, and we know they're working towards releasing SteamOS for other hardware vendors for their handhelds, having a standard way to show it also helps Valve keep it the same across multiple of their own devices.</p>
<p>As for the Steam Controller 2, it makes even more sense with this because otherwise the target for people to buy it would have been reasonably small. Sure there's all the people with a Steam Deck, but it would be only a percentage of people with one that would buy a Steam Controller 2, and a lot of other people on PC already have their preferred gamepad. So, having a fresh Steam Machine would pretty much <em>need</em> a dedicated controller, unless Valve bundled it with a third-party controller, but that leaves Valve at the mercy of another hardware vendor on features and support.</p>
<p>The <em>speculation</em> and leaks on some form of new Steam Machine from Valve come initially from a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1h7521g/looks_like_valve_is_working_on_a_steamos_device/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Reddit post</a>, where a user pointed out a <a href="https://gitlab.com/evlaV/linux-integration/-/commit/3d92f93a76012f9dc9cb2d75eb0da7ecc93b9bd2" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">change</a> to the Linux kernel used by Steam Deck / SteamOS. It mentions a change for HDMI CEC for Fremont, with code that references AMD Lilac. Lilac on <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/search?q=amd+lilac" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Geekbench</a> being a mixture of different AMD chips like the Ryzen 8540U and Ryzen 7735HS.</p>
<p>On X / Twitter, VR enthusiast Brad Lynch <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1864817868346360011" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">mentioned</a> in a thread after more digging through Valve's code noting "But also that Quanta Computer, Valve’s Steam Deck manufacturer, is giving feedback on it" and "All references to Fremont ensure checks for a full-size HDMI Type-A port you’d see on TV-focused consoles and other desktop computers that don’t have a dedicated GPU with its own HDMI ports". Lynch is the one that has been covering a lot of the leaks for the upcoming Valve Deckard VR headset.</p>
<p>November next year will also mark 10 years since Valve's original Steam Machine launch. That would be a pretty good time for Valve to announce something don't you think?</p>
<p>Things have changed dramatically since the original failure of the Steam Machine launch, which kicked off Valve's effort on everything that made up the Steam Deck. We have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> now, the real important bit, which runs tens of thousands of Windows games and Proton compatibility is continuously improving to the point where so many games really do just work (but we still have the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat</a> problem). We have another <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-90-4-beta-updated-with-more-game-fixes-needing-testing-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">big update to Proton 9 coming soon</a> too.</p>
<p>It's going to be really interesting to see what becomes of all this. Very exciting time to be a Linux / SteamOS gamer.</p>

      <title>Free to play monster-hunting game Dauntless now on Steam and works on Steam Deck, desktop Linux needs a quick fix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dauntless from Phoenix Labs has finally launched on Steam, it's also free to play so you can go and check out this monster-hunting game without spending a penny.</p>
<p>The developers <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/331370/discussions/0/4635987888980475489/#c4635988522932731095" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">mentioned</a> on Steam clearly back in late November: "We have no intentions to intentionally block Steam Deck compatibility!", and it has launched with Easy Anti-Cheat. There's no official Steam Deck compatibility rating from Valve just yet though, and the developer hasn't officially noted any supported status for Steam Deck apart from that quote so far.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0eZC5ITT7f0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/87e7273a655edf3be32e3e392a41d48f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0eZC5ITT7f0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Giving it a test-run myself on Steam Deck with Proton 9.0-3, the game does launch correctly and shows Easy Anti-Cheat initializing. The game <em>requires</em> an Epic Games Account, which I had already previously linked with Steam for a different game, so I just had to use the touch screen to allow the game to be linked to it and after that gamepad input then worked correctly.</p>
<p>So it seems at launch, at least right now, it does indeed work on Steam Deck. Sticking it into Low overall details and the performance looked pretty good too above 50FPS. Not quite keeping 60FPS, but still pretty good, a few dips down into the 40s during heavy combat.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8522697711733427853gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8522697711733427853gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>One odd issue I have encountered, is that some display modes cause the resolution on the menu to be quite broken. Keeping it in Borderless Window works fine. Apart from that, it all appears to work pretty well, running around the city and engaging in a few battles with other players.</p>
<p>Dauntless has a text scaling option too, which I set to larger so it's easier to read although there's still a couple of places with really small text.</p>
<p>I also tested it on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 24.10) <em>but</em> here across both Proton 9.0-3 and Proton Experimental Easy Ant-Cheat gives me a "Client game integrity violation error". A workaround, at least for now, is to pretend your desktop is a Steam Deck with this launch option:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">SteamDeck=1 %command%</code></p>
<p>The official word I got back from their press team over email today is that "the Dauntless anti-cheat is Steam Deck compatible and they’ll be making further improvements to Steam Deck functionality".</p>

      <title>War Thunder is moving away from Easy Anti-Cheat to BattlEye</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After doing the same with their FPS, Enlisted, Gaijin have announced today that War Thunder will also be changing the anti-cheat system used. This may, potentially, cause some momentary breakage.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://warthunder.com/en/news/9247-war-thunder-anti-cheat-system-update-en" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they mentioned War Thunder will be moving over to BattlEye, which is already supported on Linux (for both Native Linux builds and Proton). They currently use Easy Anti-Cheat for it and no reason has actually been given as to why they decided to swap over.</p>
<p>The move makes sense though, keeping their games using the same anti-cheat system. They've supported Linux for a long time now too, being one of the earlier few bigger developers to get involved, so I don't personally expect any real problems here. Especially since Enlisted also works on Linux right now with both games having a Native Linux build available.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8811809991733424521gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>They said the changeover is going to happen in waves, so you might not see BattlEye on your own system for a few weeks. Eventually everyone will be on it, but they'll of course continue supporting those still on Easy Anti-Cheat until the switchover is complete.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA 565.77 stable driver for Linux released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA have today released driver version 565.77 as their latest stable New Feature Branch build available for Linux, pulling in all the changes from the 565.57.01 Beta plus a whole bunch more improvements.</p>
<p>For people who <em>didn't</em> use the 565.57.01 Beta or didn't see it, these were the initial changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause suspend/resume to fail when using the NVreg_PreserveVideoMemoryAllocations option: <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/issues/472" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/issues/472</a></li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused the cursor image to be truncated on Gamescope: <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope/issues/1099" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope/issues/1099</a></li>
<li>Re-enabled GLX_EXT_buffer_age on Xwayland. This extension had been previously disabled on Xwayland due to a bug which is now fixed.</li>
<li>Added support for mmap of exported DMA-BUF objects.</li>
<li>Reduced some cases of stutter with OpenGL syncing to vblank while using GSP firmware.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression that could cause some applications to exit due to resource exhaustion on some GPUs while using GSP firmware.</li>
<li>Added several new per-plane and per-CRTC vendor-specific properties to nvidia-drm. These properties may be used by Wayland compositors to program the GPU's color pipeline for HDR hardware acceleration.</li>
<li>Introduced a driver optimization to mitigate the performance loss from the 'd3d9.floatEmulation' option in DXVK.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused FarCry 5 running through DXVK to display a black screen.</li>
<li>Updated the framelock settings page of the nvidia-settings control panel to use the GTK3 theme text color rather than defaulting to white for the text color, improving legibility with some themes.</li>
<li>Fixed some performance regressions that were observed with Vkd3d 2.9.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause flickering in some applications when using Unified Back Buffer (UBB).</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which could cause incorrect and/or washed out colors to be displayed with HDR scanout: <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=482780" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=482780</a></li>
<li>Implemented support for VK_EXT_depth_clamp_control.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which could cause applications using GBM to crash when running with nvidia-drm.modeset=0.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause kernel crashes upon attempting KMS operations through DRM when nvidia_drm was loaded with modeset=0.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As for what's <strong>new from this 565.77 release</strong> that was promoted as a stable driver here's all the changes on top of the above list:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug in i2c handling that caused the OpenRGB Application to set incorrect LED colors on some NVIDIA GPUs. <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/issues/41" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/issues/41</a></li>
<li>Changed the fallback preference from 10 BPC YUV422 to 8 BPC RGB + dithering when enabling HDR scanout with limited display bandwidth.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause the nvidia-settings control panel to crash when using X11 forwarding on some systems.</li>
<li>Added a new application profile key, "GLVidHeapReuseRatio", to control the amount of memory OpenGL may hold for later reuse, as well as some application profiles for several Wayland compositors using the new key to work around issues with excessive video memory usage.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could lead to crashes when a Vulkan application waits on a VkFence created by importing a DRM syncobj. This solves some crashes observed with Unreal Engine and other applications on Wayland.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause KDE Plasma 6 to crash when running as a Wayland compositor.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that would cause the driver stack to fail to load the correct state of a Quadro Sync board when GSP is enabled. This would lead to inaccuracies in reporting framelock state when using house sync or stereo signals.</li>
<li>Updated the kernel module build process to use CONFIG_CC_VERSION_TEXT from the Linux kernel's Kconfig to detect the compiler used to build the kernel. This may help select the correct compiler on systems where the kernel was built with a compiler other than the default one.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented kernel modules linked using precompiled kernel interface files from loading on recent Debian systems.</li>
<li>Improved the ability of nvidia-modprobe to detect whether kernel modules are already loaded. This corrects an issue that prevented nvidia-persistenced from setting persistence mode on some systems.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see that NVIDIA are continuing to clearly list the changes since their direct previous release, which is something I asked them to do at the start of this year. Previously, they were listing every single change each release when moving drivers between their named branches, which caused confusion.</p>
<p>See all in their <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/details/237598/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>

      <title>Prime Gaming December 5th edition for Steam Deck / Linux - a bunch of special extras were added this week</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here we go again! Each week Prime Gaming, part of what you get with a subscription to Amazon Prime, add and remove various games you can claim to keep.</p>
<p>We already had one this week because Amazon did a double-drop. But not only that, they also surprise-dropped a bunch of <strong>extra</strong> games <em>today</em> that they <em>didn't</em> previously announce in support of their new Secret Level series. Some good stuff here for you.</p>
<p>I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"/> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play. Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now.</p>

      <title>Deep survival game Vintage Story has another massive update approaching in v1.20</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vintage Story is a survival game with some impressively deep game mechanics, and the v1.20 update is another major one that's coming out soon with a first Release Candidate available to test. Probably one of my favourite survival games to keep checking back on, that's really like nothing else.</p>
<p>This update will add in some truly massive upgrades for the game. Not just in terms of gameplay additions, but upgrades to their engine to bring some big visual and physics improvements too.</p>
<p>Speaking about the update the developer said in an <a href="https://www.vintagestory.at/blog.html/news/v120-rc1-lore-update-the-journey-r389/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The primary focus of this update was on delivering the second major chapter in our game's story. There are 4 new unique story locations that require long distance travel to reach them. Long distance travel is enhanced by two new transport systems - the Elk for land based travel and the Sailboat for traversing bodies of water.<br/>
The team worked really hard on this one. We powered through natural disasters, family emergencies, unforeseen technical challenges, unfulfilled ambitions and various other roadblocks. I probably sound like a broken record by now, but again we seem to have ended up building one of the largest updates so far. Turns out that hiring more game developers does not speed up development, it just makes us all way more ambitious.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Just a few cherry-picked additions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Animal riding system and Elk ownership system.</li>
<li>Expanded ocean content and a visual upgrade for water.</li>
<li>A sailboat with a full construction system, and an upgraded raft.</li>
<li>Hundreds of new types of blocks.</li>
<li>Tiny little bouncy and noisy insects.</li>
<li>Added solar eclipses.</li>
<li>Lots of creature AI improvements.</li>
<li>Two new secret mobs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the update trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="C5v8NaRVIyk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3120949d862aac61445c0c0d255a83b9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/C5v8NaRVIyk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It has Native Linux support. However, it seems they need to update their supported version of dotnet from 7.0, which is no longer supported by Microsoft, so running it on an up to date distro may be a little annoying right now.</p>

      <title>Steam Bullet Heaven Festival 2.0 is live to show off the explosive growth of the genre</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bullet Heavens are all the rage right now from Vampire Survivors to Brotato and everything in between them, so Valve launched have a little mini festival to celebrate them all. Weirdly, Vampire Survivors is not included in the festival, but then it also doesn't exactly need any promotion at this point since it was a runaway success.</p>
<p>The genre has absolutely exploded, with developer after developer chasing the trend to bring out their own version of it and honestly — I couldn't be happier. Some of my favourite and most-played games belong in this genre and I'm always excited to see what unique spin each developer puts on it.</p>
<p>What's the difference between Bullet Heavens and Bullet Hells? Well, in a Bullet Heaven, you are the one mostly spamming-out the attacks against hordes of enemies, rather than dodging all their attacks like you would in a Bullet Hell. That's about the simplest way to describe it.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some of the games think I think you need to check out or keep an eye on include:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/BulletHeaven2" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">festival on Steam</a>. It runs until December 11th.</p>
<p>Since clearly Bullet Heaven has been basically set as the name for the genre, I've also now set up a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/Bullet_Heaven/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bullet Heaven tag</a> for such games going forward here on GamingOnLinux.</p>

      <title>Delta Force developer mentions they will look at supporting Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The new Delta Force has launched with kernel level anti-cheat, which sadly doesn't support Linux platforms yet but it seems hope for it is not entirely lost. Not to be confused with the original Delta Force from 1998, this is a free to play online FPS from Team Jade and TiMi Studio Group.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Writing on the Steam forum, one of the developers clearly <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2507950/discussions/0/4509877583653226327/#c4638240954399142658" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Linux is currently not supported. And Steam Deck is also not supported at the moment, but we will start considering how to port it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> though, they don't actually need to <em>port</em> the game like they would for other platforms, the developers just need to ensure their anti-cheat system "Anti-Cheat Expert (ACE)" is enabled for it. Although it's not clear if that will be as easy as it is for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/supporting-linux-proton-and-the-steam-deck-with-battleye-is-just-an-email-away/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BattlEye</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/09/epic-games-announce-full-easy-anti-cheat-for-linux-including-wine-a-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Easy Anti-Cheat</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18849762481733392433gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Trying it anyway on Desktop Linux through Proton 9.0-3, Proton Experimental and GE-Proton 9.20 they all resulted in the launcher login system giving repeating network errors when trying to login, eventually through repeat attempts I could get to the main Launch button - but then the launcher just quits back to the Steam Library.</p>
<p>Curiously, on Steam Deck with SteamOS 3.6, Proton 9.0-3 had the same issues but Proton Experimental <em>did</em> get into the game. Repeatedly testing Proton Experimental on Steam Deck and yes, it <em>does</em> go in-game. So back to Desktop and it still doesn't work there.</p>
<p>Regardless of it randomly working or not, given the anti-cheat system and the <em>clear</em> statement of it <u>not</u> being supported by the developer, it could fully stop working at any time or result in game bans. It's not worth it right now. Save your time downloads and hard drive space for something else.</p>

      <title>Valve&#39;s new branding guidelines hint at Steam Deck&#39;s SteamOS for more devices </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While we've known for a while that Valve plan to get SteamOS Linux on devices other than the Steam Deck, we don't know when that will happen, but we've got another hint here that things are moving along.</p>
<p>Since the release of the Steam Deck, Valve have repeatedly said it's in their plans to release SteamOS 3 to the public and for hardware vendors to ship on their devices. The joke about <em>Valve Time</em> is as relevant as ever though, with no specific public roadmap on anything and it's years in the making at this point.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://steamdb.info/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, who also scrape a lot of things from Valve aside from games, like Steamworks Documentation, we've now seen that Valve have <a href="https://github.com/SteamDatabase/SteamworksDocumentation/compare/d54725a035de...41944930ea8a#diff-5daae83579359a756437d0a949cfce0a729a6857724a1740b2825f45fd0d9292" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">updated</a> their branding guidelines (<a href="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/steam_brandGuidelines.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">document</a>), which includes a new bit about SteamOS.<em> These guidelines haven't been updated since 2017.</em></p>
<p>I can show this to you here, since the <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/branding" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Branding Guidelines</a> page is entirely public, as is the link to the main document from that page. Examples for the new SteamOS Branding Guidlines:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5075490391733323256gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5075490391733323256gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13828148561733323367gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13828148561733323367gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
It will be seriously interesting to see what is the first device other than the Steam Deck to actually ship with SteamOS. Will it be Valve's long rumoured and repeatedly leaked Deckard VR kit, or another handheld from a third-party vendor?</p>
<p>What will be interesting though and a question that popped into my head: what about compatibility notices for games on SteamOS devices other than the Steam Deck? Will that be left to each hardware vendor? I assume so since Valve will still primarily focus on their own Steam Deck with Deck Verified. This may cause community sites like <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> to become more relevant than ever to filter per-device. Don't forget to check <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat compatibility list</a> too.</p>
<p>Exciting times for the Linux community that we might see more popular devices out there shipping Linux.</p>

      <title>I will admit I had a nerdgasm at the portable pilet mini consoles from soulscircuit</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Powered by the Raspberry Pi 5, the incoming pilet devices from soulscircuit look like a chunky retro-tech enthusiasts wet dream and I want them. I have absolutely <em>zero</em> need of them, but I <em>want</em> them badly. Originally going under the code-name of consolo, I almost let out a little squeal of excitement when seeing them today.</p>
<p>Both versions are modular, that they say are "built by open source software for the open source community" with various schematics and other files freely available. They say the "design will be open-sourced once the product is fully completed" too.</p>
<p>Split across two versions, one is a handheld mini-PC with a keyboard, the other has a bigger screen acting more like a tablet:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20117878771733320731gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20117878771733320731gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
Click picture to enlarge. Those with a keen eye may spot a <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> and <a href="https://bevyengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bevy Engine</a> folder.</em></p>
<p>They say you'll get dual 8000mah batteries giving you a 7 hour battery life. The tablet sounds like the most fun of the two with you being able to attach a keyboard, gamepad, camera and more. They even showed it off acting like a games console in one picture:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1015251201733320892gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1015251201733320892gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>As for pricing, that's still to be decided according to their website but they're aiming for around $250.</p>
<p>They have multiple videos of prototype devices in action on their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@soulscircuit" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>, like the one below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bvV9h5kAPXw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/398cd25408b6cf255a4672572a989e6b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bvV9h5kAPXw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

      <title>Survival game The Long Dark gets a big update with a deep Safehouse Customization system</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems like it's time to jump back into the world of The Long Dark, with a big update out now that includes major new free features along with expanding their Tales from the Far Territory DLC. This is actually the final update to the Tales from the Far Territory DLC.</p>
<p>For all players there's a new deep Safehouse Customization system. The developers added "over 100" locations in the game that you can turn into a proper safehouse where you can move around furniture and decorative items, get crafting and it includes many new items never seen before in the game. The developers said it's "one of the biggest changes to the game the team has ever accomplished".</p>
<p>By itself that would be a pretty big enhancement to the game but there's plenty more. For the DLC there's a wildlife refresh with new hunting patterns, a refreshed balance of their population numbers, a return of the Cougar and more. There's also a new instant camera, a new trader, new achievements, a new meat curing box and lots of bug fixes.</p>
<p>It's such a big update they did a 17 minute video on it. See their full video on it below:</p>

      <title>You can win a Steam Deck, Meta Quest 3 VR Headset and more with Fanatical</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fanatical are celebrating their birthday and so they have a new bundle up, which gives you a chance to win some pretty big prizes.</p>
<p>There's a catch though, a <em>big</em> one, it's part of their <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/bundle/birthday-mystery-bundle" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Birthday Mystery Bundle</a>. With it you can buy 1-20 random Steam keys, so you don't know what you'll be getting. Which to be blunt — means you're pretty much <em>gambling</em> away money on it.</p>
<p>I decided, for science, to give it a go and ended up with: Dread X Collection, 10 Second Ninja X, Lost Castle, Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood and Hue which is actually not a bad key drop at all. I didn't own a single one and the Dread X Collection especially looks fun.</p>
<p>Fanatical say "Every bundle purchased includes a chance to win incredible birthday gifts like a Steam Deck, Meta Quest 3 VR Headset, Lexip Bundle, Twitch Vouchers, or a Fanatical Spending Spree to enjoy on our store. Plus, a few lucky customers will uncover AAA game packs, featuring some of the hottest new releases in gaming!". You also get 5% off your next order if you pick up the bundle.</p>
<p>So at a minimum cost of £1 for 1 Steam key, and a chance to win, perhaps you might want to give it a go. I've seen comments from GamingOnLinux readers when I covered such bundles in the past rather happy with the games they got.</p>

<p>Going over the Steam Deck <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4472733036435211456" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a>, there's <em>nothing</em> that was specific to the Steam Deck in this update. So it's just a generic Steam Client update for all platforms.</p>
<p>What do you want Valve to focus on next? The Family and Game Recording updates are out in the stable client, so what's next for a major addition to Steam? Is it missing something you think should really be there?</p>

      <title>Steam Link gets upgraded for Raspberry Pi 5 and Raspberry Pi Bookworm</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Valve no longer sell their Steam Link hardware, the idea lives on as an app you can install across various devices and recently Valve upgraded the Steam Link app for the Raspberry Pi platform.</p>
<p>The update actually went live on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/353380/discussions/6/4629231777834100224/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">November 12th</a>, and it seems a lot of us missed it, until the official Raspberry Pi <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/valves-steam-link-on-raspberry-pi/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> about it went live yesterday to go over the new release. As noted in the RPi blog post from Gordon Hollingworth, getting Steam Link running properly on the Raspberry Pi 5 took a little while since they moved away from closed-source Broadcom multimedia libraries and the move from X11 to Wayland so "a different approach was needed". Sam Lantinga from Valve, who also works on SDL, "has been working with the Raspberry Pi software team to use our hardware in the most efficient way possible".</p>
<p>Now the experience should be pretty good!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="19WMSEc9sHc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4f7acb0a81b6a876effed346ee73c2fc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/19WMSEc9sHc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From Valve's post on it the Steam Link supports the latest Raspberry Pi Bookworm operating system release in these environments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raspberry Pi 5</p>
<ul>
<li>Console and Desktop environment</li>
<li>Supports H.264 at 1080p, 144 FPS</li>
<li>Supports HEVC at 4K, 60 FPS and 1080p, 240 FPS</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Raspberry Pi 4
<ul>
<li>Console and Desktop environment</li>
<li>Supports H.264 and HEVC at 1080p, 60 FPS (30 FPS if the display is at 4K resolution)</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Raspberry Pi 3
<ul>
<li>Console environment</li>
<li>Supports H.264 at 1080p, 60 FPS</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
<ul>
<li>Console environment</li>
<li>Supports H.264 at 1080p, 60 FPS</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Wired networking is highly recommended for the best streaming experience.</blockquote>
<p>And these changes in the latest Steam Link release for RPi:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added settings recommendations based on network test results.</li>
<li>Fixed the Nintendo Switch Pro controller when connected to the latest Steam client.</li>
<li>Added Indonesian language support.</li>
<li>Fall back to English if non-latin font downloads fail.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Are you using Steam Link on a RPi? What's your experience with it? I have an RPi4 sat collecting dust at this point, maybe I should actually blow off the dust and set it up as a Steam Link device. Although, the holidays are coming, perhaps I should treat myself to the RPi5? Decisions…</p>

      <title>Intel announced their Arc B-Series GPUs and XeSS 2, the day after CEO Pat Gelsinger retires</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A bit of a double-whammy this week from Intel. Not only did they announce that CEO Pat Gelsinger has retired, but they've also now properly revealed their new Arc B-Series GPUs.</p>
<p>News of Gelsinger's retirement was <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-ceo-news-dec-2024.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shared</a> by Intel on December 2nd. Intel has named two senior staffers, David Zinsner and Michelle (MJ) Johnston Holthaus, as interim co-chief executive officers while they search for a new permanent CEO.</p>
<p>Gelsinger said, “Leading Intel has been the honor of my lifetime – this group of people is among the best and the brightest in the business, and I’m honored to call each and every one a colleague. Today is, of course, bittersweet as this company has been my life for the bulk of my working career. I can look back with pride at all that we have accomplished together. It has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics. I am forever grateful for the many colleagues around the world who I have worked with as part of the Intel family.”</p>
<p>As for the new Intel Arc B-Series graphics cards (code-named Battlemage), only two models have been currently announced with the Arc B580 and B570 GPUs. The B580 will get a Limited Edition model and various partner releases from the likes of Acer, ASRock and others starting December 13 from $249. While the B570 will arrive January 16th starting $219.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14663127321733255865gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14663127321733255865gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Intel said "Compared with the previous generation, the Intel Arc B-Series GPUs offer 70% better performance per Xe-core and 50% more performance per watt. The B580 GPU, when compared to the Intel Arc A750 GPU, is on average 24% faster at 1440p with some games up to 78% faster. When compared to the competition, the Intel Arc B580 GPU offers up to 32% better performance-per-dollar".</p>
<p>This comes along with an announcement of XeSS 2 which now includes three different bits of tech including XeSS Super Resolution, AI-powered XeSS Frame Generation and Xe Low Latency. So they're following in the footsteps of AMD and NVIDIA here.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12774276551733255710gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12774276551733255710gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Going by their press slides games supporting XeSS 2 will including Assassin's Creed Shadows, Harry Potter Quidditch Champions, Robocop Rogue City, Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza, Dying Light 2, F1 24, Ascendant, Marvel Rivals, Killing Floor 3 and Citadels.</p>
<p>See their explainer announcement video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Dl81n3ib53Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b7612d4c540158179a7cda917b3e1792.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Dl81n3ib53Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Be sure to leave a comment on your thoughts. Will you be buying either of the new GPUs?</p>
<p>Hopefully they will work well on Linux. It's likely you'll need a very up to date kernel and Mesa version for them.</p>
<p><em>I'm still not getting Intel press releases, so have reached out again today to see why.</em></p>

      <title>Minecraft Java 1.21.4 &#39;The Garden Awakens&#39; update is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mojang have today released Minecraft Java 1.21.4 'The Garden Awakens' update for everyone, bringing with it some fun new toys and a new biome to carefully explore.</p>
<p>In this update you'll find the new Pale Gardens biome which is quite <em>creepy</em>. It's here you'll find the new hostile mob, the Creaking. This strange mob spawns at night in the new biome, and it basically acts like a Weeping Angel from Doctor Who where it won't move if you're looking at it. You'll need to find and destroy a new block, the Creaking Heart, to take it down. Another fun feature of this biome is that ambient sounds come from blocks inside the biome, and any music playing will fade-out when you enter it. Ultra creepy vibes.</p>
<p>There's also numerous new blocks that arrive with it like Pale Oak which comes along with its own Pale Oak Logs that can be crafted into a full woodset including a door, fence, planks, signs and more. There's also the new Eyeblossoms flowers, Pale Moss, Pale Hanging Moss and more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0vKS0FOYNok"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8fae765d339f514afde7dd12a9e7dba3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0vKS0FOYNok" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Really interesting addition to Minecraft to make exploring the world a bit more exciting. The full changelog can be found on the <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-java-edition-1-21-4" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Minecraft website</a> release page, it's quite long and detailed with lots of smaller changes on top of all the new additions.</p>
<p>You can install and mod Minecraft easily on Linux / Steam Deck with either the <a href="https://modrinth.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Modrinth</a> app or the <a href="https://prismlauncher.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Prism</a> launcher.</p>

      <title>4X RPG &#39;Heart of the Machine&#39; from Arcen Games (AI War) releases January 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Arcen Games creators of AI War, AI War 2, The Last Federation and other games have announced their new sci-fi 4X RPG Heart of the Machine will launch January 31st, 2025. There's also a new demo available that you can try right now.</p>
<p>More about it: "Heart of the Machine sees players take the role of the world’s first sentient AI, born into a city filled with endless opportunities (and despair). Raise an army of robots to rule by force, become a benevolent machine overlord, or explore a constellation of alternative paths – players must strive to find their place amidst a crumbling society in desperate need of saving (from itself). Whether you rally the underclasses to fight against corporate tyranny, create shell companies and engage in corporate espionage, or just experiment on people to further your goals, the possibilities are endless."</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>

<p>They're no longer doing Native Linux support though, as they <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/heart-of-the-machine-from-arcen-games-dropping-native-linux-for-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced back in 2023</a> since <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> worked better for them.</p>
<p>Do you think this will be one you'll be picking up?</p>

      <title>DXVK-Sarek for old GPUs v1.10.4 released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With integration coming in a future release of Proton-Sarek, designed for gamers that have older GPUs, the first release of DXVK-Sarek is out now.</p>
<p>As a brief reminder: Proton-Sarek is a custom build of Proton with an older DXVK for users with GPUs that support Vulkan 1.1+ but not Vulkan 1.3, or for those with no Vulkan support. Created to enable you to still play plenty of games with older GPUs on Linux.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/dev-of-proton-sarek-for-older-gpus-has-forked-dxvk-to-backport-game-settings-and-improve-compatibility/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mentioned previously</a>, the developer has now also forked the DXVK project directly into DXVK-Sarek to bring over plenty of enhancements and a first release is out with <a href="https://github.com/pythonlover02/DXVK-Sarek/releases/tag/v1.10.4" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">DXVK-Sarek v1.10.4</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14083530961733234457gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Alpha Protocol</em></p>
<p>This release has a mixture of changes to various game configurations including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Backport</strong>: Adapted from a modern build and integrated into the 1.10.x branch.</li>
<li><strong>Update</strong>: Enhanced an existing configuration to match the latest build settings.</li>

<ul>
<li>I also created an Async Patched Build for those who prefer using the Async version over the original.</li>
<li>Updated the <code class="inline-code">Logger</code> string in <code class="inline-code">dxvk/src/dxvk/dxvk_instance.cpp</code> and the <code class="inline-code">renderer.drawText</code> string in <code class="inline-code">dxvk/src/dxvk/hud/dxvk_hud_item.cpp</code> to display <strong>"DXVK-Sarek"</strong> instead of <strong>"DXVK"</strong>. This ensures clarity that the build is a custom version and not from the original DXVK repository.
	<ul>
<li><strong>Note</strong>: The engine name remains unchanged to preserve compatibility with tools like MangoHUD, which rely on the original <code class="inline-code">DXVK</code> identifier.</li>

      <title>Half-Life 2 co-op mod Synergy upgraded for the Half-Life 2 20th Anniversary Update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Synergy is a free mod for Half-Life 2 that allows you to play the Half-Life 2 series and many other singleplayer Source Mods cooperatively with friends. It was recently upgraded to support the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/half-life-2-free-to-keep-until-november-18th-episodes-one-two-now-included-with-a-huge-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Half-Life 2 20th Anniversary Update</a>.</p>
<p>This is the first proper update to the mod since 2015, so it's quite a big one. It includes lots of enhancements, including better Steam Deck support! The developers mentioned they've been working on it for a long time, but they released it "sooner than we've planned as to resolve numerous breaking changes from Half-Life 2's recent large update".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19634688841733224478gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's all the highlights of what's new and improved:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Support for the Half-Life 2 20th Anniversary Update!</li>
<li>Fixed numerous crashes like the infamous "unconnected" player bug and player models jittering.</li>
<li>Significantly improved overall performance, especially with large player counts.</li>
<li>Rebalanced numerous, rather absurd, map-specific difficulty spikes in the Half-Life 2 campaign.</li>
<li>Fixed SteamVR starting when changing settings.</li>
<li>Initial official native support for Steamdeck (UI still leaves a lot to be desired).</li>
<li>Fixed various HUD issues introduced by Half-Life 2's Steamdeck update.</li>
<li>Official support for Linux Dedicated Servers.
	<ul>
<li>Requires steam client installed (e.g. `sudo apt install steam`).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added support for saved games.
	<ul>
<li>Host can load a saved game and friends who join will be restored if they were connected at the time of the save.</li>
<li>Works on dedicated servers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Various map-specific (EDT) improvements throughout the Half-Life 2 campaigns.</li>
<li>Fixed many level transition issues, particularly on backtracking maps.</li>
<li>Steam Cloud support for settings and saved games.</li>
<li>Steam Workshop support for dedicated servers.</li>
<li>Steam Rich Presence support.</li>
<li>Enabled spectator mode via console (jointeam 1)</li>
<li>Players will spawn in a vehicle on airboat levels (coast levels TBD).</li>
<li>Vehicles will no longer stop when the game autosaves.</li>
<li>Added more player voice command lines from ep1.</li>
<li>Fixed player viewmodels being invisible under some circumstances.</li>
<li>Optimized networking for some entities like the Airboat.</li>
<li>'Use' key will now go through players to avoid blocking anything.</li>
<li>Removed cheat flag from some useful commands/cvars.</li>
<li>Added game content rating to unblock Synergy in Germany.</li>
<li>Increased maximum player support from 10 to 32.</li>
<li>Other changes lost in time.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>What's next for it? They're working on "automatic networking and Steam friend lobbies" to make it easier to join up with friends without needing port forwarding, which they hope to have "ready in the near future".</p>

      <title>The best Linux distribution for gaming in 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In a few previous years (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/the-best-linux-distribution-for-gaming-in-2023/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/12/the-best-linux-distros-for-gaming-in-2021/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#2</a>), I decided to do a fresh take each time on what the best Linux distribution was for gaming - so I'm back for a 2025 edition of the article that will cause you to tell me how wrong and terrible I am.</p>
<p>What's changed? Well, quite a lot actually. Both previous times I firmly suggested going with plain Ubuntu. However, time moves on, and the software world evolves rather quickly. So I have a new recommendation for you! Why am I even writing this? Sadly, there's <em>still</em> articles out there pushing for tiny completely random fringe distributions and plenty with stupidly outdated and republished information to get to the top of Google.</p>
<p>My current home for a while now, and what I'll recommend you pick up, is <strong><a href="https://kubuntu.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Kubuntu</a></strong>. It has all the goodies and support of plain Ubuntu, but with the KDE Plasma desktop environment, which is the same one used on the Steam Deck's Desktop Mode. It has an interface that will be much more familiar to people coming over from Windows, it's more customizable (if you want it) but with a sane default setup that just gets you going quickly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5826130221733222157gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The latest Long Term Support (LTS) version of Kubuntu, Kubuntu 24.04.1, is supported with security and maintenance updates until April 2027. So you can install it and basically forget about it and keep it running and secure for years to come. However, you're likely better off with Kubuntu 24.10 which is more up to date, if you're okay upgrading again when the next version of Kubuntu comes out (Kubuntu 25.04) which is around April 17, 2025. Either way, both work well.</p>
<p>I've been through Fedora, Manjaro, Linux Mint, plain Ubuntu, Arch and many others over the years. No Linux distributions is perfect and they all come with their own set of quirks and problems, just as Windows has its own set of unique issues. To me, Kubuntu just offers the <em>best</em> all around middle-ground of everything you need to get going.</p>
<p>People will argue about Snaps, but for the majority of normal users — it just <em>doesn't</em> matter in the slightest. I use the Spotify, Thunderbird, Telegram and other Snaps and they work <em>great</em> and are kept nicely up to date without me even needing to do anything.</p>
<p>I will suggest though, that you enable Flatpaks from <a href="https://flathub.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Flathub</a>, so you get the best of all worlds and access to even more easily installable packages. It's <a href="https://flathub.org/setup/Kubuntu" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">incredibly easy to do</a> as well.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://kubuntu.org/getkubuntu/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">download Kubuntu from their website</a>.</p>
<p>If you need help and support for Linux and Steam Deck gaming, you can try asking in our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/forum/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Forum</a> and <a href="https://discord.gg/0rxBtcSOonvGzXr4" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Discord</a>. Don't forget to follow me on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gamingonlinux.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gamingonlinux" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Mastodon</a> too while you're at it.</p>
<p>Don't agree with me? That's fine! The benefit of Linux is that there's truly no one-size-fits-all. Leave a comment to tell me how wrong I am. <em>You're still wrong if you disagree though.</em></p>

      <title>Prime Gaming December 3rd edition, new titles coming twice this week - lots for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here we go again! Each week Prime Gaming, part of what you get with a subscription to Amazon Prime, add and remove various games you can claim to keep. This week we get <em>two</em> sets of new games, so there will be another article with the next additions / removals on December 5th too!</p>
<p>I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"/> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play. Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now.</p>

      <title>KDE&#39;s 2024 fundraiser hits the goal - clearly their donation pop-up works</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some good news coming out from camp <a href="https://kde.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">KDE</a>, with their yearly fundraiser ongoing and they've managed to smash their original goal.</p>
<p>Writing on Mastodon, KDE developer Carl Schwan <a href="https://mastodon.social/@carl@kde.social/113584216771717051" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">mentioned</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm so happy to see the big influx of donations to KDE. More than 75 000€ in the last 30 days with 35 000€ in the past 48 hours.</p>
<p>This is huge. Thank you to everyone who donated!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Going by the actual <a href="https://kde.org/fundraisers/yearend2024/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">fundraising website</a>, the total is only listed as €34,121 against their original €30,000 goal. But, it seems that's not counting everything. There's also the <a href="https://kde.org/community/donations/previousdonations/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">plain donations</a> to keep an eye on too.</p>
<p>There's more details noted in a fresh <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2024/12/02/i-think-the-donation-notification-works/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> from Nate Graham that goes over various other details, like how the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/kde-plasma-62-adding-a-pop-up-for-donations-plus-they-want-to-make-a-next-generation-kde-os/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new donation request pop-op</a> is clearly working, as it went live on December 1st and this caused donations to <em>surge</em> to where they received "double the prior two months' Paypal donations in a single day".</p>
<p>Thanks to all the donations, KDE e.V. (the non-profit organization that represents the KDE Community), may end up with a balanced budget instead of their predicted "deficit of over €50k in 2024". According to Graham "German nonprofits like KDE e.V. are required to avoid stockpiling money" which is why they run an intentional deficit, so with the funding moving quickly into a positive cashflow they'll end up increasing their expenditure meaning they can hire more people, sponsor more projects and so on.</p>
<p>Really good news, great to see KDE doing well.</p>
<p>Their fundraising website also expanded the list of apps you can "adopt", by donating a specific amount and picking an app you want with a bunch already full but they've recently added more.</p>

      <title>Vulkan API 1.4 released with new required extensions, better 8K rendering</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Khronos Group have today announced the release of the Vulkan 1.4 API specification, with various changes and improvements for game and application developers.</p>
<p>In the announcement it notes that "Mesa open-source Linux drivers have passed Vulkan 1.4 conformance on AMD, Apple, Intel, NVIDIA, and Qualcomm hardware" already. Looking on the conformant <a href="https://www.khronos.org/conformance/adopters/conformant-products/vulkan" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">driver list</a>, even the Steam Deck is already listed as supporting Vulkan 1.4. On the NVIDIA side, they have a Linux <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">550.40.81 Vulkan Beta</a> release available with Vulkan 1.4 support.</p>
<p>New features as noted include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.vulkan.org/features/latest/features/proposals/VK_VERSION_1_4.html#_streaming_transfers" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Streaming Transfers</a>: Vulkan 1.4 imposes new implementation requirements to ensure portable, cross-platform applications can stream large quantities of data to a device while simultaneously rendering at full performance.</li>
<li>Previously optional extensions and features critical to emerging high-performance applications are now mandatory in Vulkan 1.4, ensuring their reliable availability across multiple platforms. These include push descriptors, dynamic rendering local reads, and scalar block layouts.</li>
<li>Maintenance extensions up to and including VK_KHR_maintenance6 are now part of the core Vulkan 1.4 specification.</li>
<li>8K rendering with up to eight separate render targets is now guaranteed to be supported, along with several other limit increases.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“Vulkan 1.4 is a developer-driven update that enhances Vulkan's value as a stable, reliable framework for creating graphics-intensive applications on any platform,” said Tom Olson, outgoing Vulkan Working Group Chair. “As I step down, I'm proud to see the groundwork we’ve laid through our roadmaps come to fruition. Our roadmap milestone plans have empowered developers with new levels of flexibility and performance, setting Vulkan on a path for continued innovation and broader adoption in the years to come.”</p>
<p>“Vulkan 1.4 is a milestone release that directly brings long-requested features and proven extensions into the core standard. By mandating these capabilities, we are enhancing Vulkan’s flexibility and performance across a wider range of devices, making it easier for developers to create cutting-edge applications with confidence that they will run reliably on any platform," said Ralph Potter, newly elected Vulkan Working Group Chair.</p>

      <title>Motorsport Games delisting all NASCAR games after iRacing license transfer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Motorsport Games announced at the end of November, that all NASCAR games will be delisted from stores on December 31st.</p>
<p>In a statement <a href="https://x.com/MSportgames/status/1862534587206836467" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> on X / Twitter the official Motorsport Games account said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To the NASCAR game community!</p>
<p>From December 31, 2024, all NASCAR game titles and their DLC content will no longer be available for purchase on all digital storefronts but will remain available to play after this time. This includes the <br/>
@NASCARHeat, @NASCARRivals, and @NASCARignition franchises.</p>
<p>Please lookout for various platform promotions this December to complete your NASCAR console game collection while you can!</p>
<p>We sincerely thank our community for the enthusiasm and support you’ve shown for these games over the years and hope you have enjoyed racing with us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why? Back in October 2023, Motorsport Games <a href="https://motorsportgames.com/exclusive-simulation-style-nascar-video-game-license-sold-to-iracing/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">sold off</a> the NASCAR Team Properties' (NTP) exclusive license to iRacing. So this is just them cleaning up shop.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9369612381733161312gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - NASCAR Heat 5</em></p>
<p>Looking on stores <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/search?search=nascar" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Fanatical</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/developer/MotorsportGames" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> various games do have a big discount on them. So if you did want to pick some up, now is the time. As usual for delistings, you'll keep your copy for download but no one else will be able to buy them after December 31st, 2024.</p>

      <title>Inventory management battler NeoDuel: Backpack Monsters gets new content - we have keys to give away</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

<p>In the latest update the developers added in a Swamp Element, a fusion of Nature and Water. They said "This new element brings unique abilities and over 10 fresh upgrades and Cosmions infused with muddy power". Plus various UI and quality of life improvements to make the game better. A Custom PvP battle mode is coming later too. They have it ready, but there's a technical challenge with IP restrictions they're working around right now.</p>

      <title>Looks like Discord finally fixed Linux screen and audio sharing with Wayland</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A while ago in November, it seems I missed a <a href="https://discord.com/channels/155794864305471497/803664113560977429/1311064084740964433" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> from a user in the <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux Discord</a> server, noting that the Discord developers finally hooked up screen and audio sharing for Linux with Wayland.</p>
<p>Not yet <em>released</em> though, it seems it's only currently available in Discord Canary, their public testing environment, but anyone can download it and try it out. On the stable client, it just mentions that "Sounds may not be available when sharing a screen on your device", but when you use the Discord Canary client you'll actually see the tickbox to share audio on Linux now too:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12593113211733158763gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Testing it with a couple community members myself using Discord Canary earlier today and — yep, it works perfectly. They could see my shared window and the audio playing from it. Excellent.</p>
<p>Once it's out in the proper <em>stable</em> Discord client, you and friends will be able to sit and chat with screens (or specific windows) and audio being shared properly on Wayland. Nice. I imagine there's many scenarios where this would be useful, and it's a feature many Linux users have been pestering Discord to sort for a while now with a <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360050971374-Linux-Screen-Share-Sound-Support" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">suggestion</a> on it open for 4 years.</p>
<p><em>No word on when it will be in the stable release yet though.</em></p>
<p>You can test it via the experimental Canary client from Flathub using these commands (taken from the <a href="https://github.com/flathub/com.discordapp.DiscordCanary" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>):</p>
<p><code>flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub-beta https://flathub.org/beta-repo/flathub-beta.flatpakrepo<br/>
flatpak install flathub-beta com.discordapp.DiscordCanary<br/>
flatpak override --user --socket=wayland com.discordapp.DiscordCanary<br/>
flatpak run com.discordapp.DiscordCanary</code></p>

      <title>Blizzard are delisting Warcraft I and II from GOG, so GOG adds a special discount and will keep them updated</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GOG have announced that <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/warcraft_orcs_and_humans" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Warcraft I</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/warcraft_2_battlenet_edition" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Warcraft II</a> are going to be leaving <a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> "at the publisher's request" (Blizzard).</p>
<p>They're set to leave GOG on December 13th, although if you have a copy you'll still be able to download it afterwards. If you want to pick them up, GOG have given a special discount code "MakeWarcraftLiveForever" but that only applies to <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/warcraft_bundle" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the bundle</a> of them together. GOG say it will knock "2 USD, 2 EUR, 1.5 GBP or 8 PLN" off the price.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2141467671733155444gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Additionally, GOG announced a promise for their recently announced <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/gog-launch-their-preservation-program-to-make-games-live-forever-with-a-hundred-classics-being-re-released/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Preservation Program</a> as they said "Once a game joins the Program, we pledge to maintain its compatibility even if it gets delisted from the store.". Nice to see for people who do buy it up before it vanishes.</p>
<p>Why are Blizzard doing this now? They recently released Warcraft I: Remastered and Warcraft II: Remastered, although they're only available on Battlenet.</p>

      <title>Linux share remains above 2% in the November 2024 Steam Survey thanks to Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have released the latest Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey for November 2024. Here's the details from it. The good news, for Linux users, is that Linux remains above 2% again overall.</p>
<p>Interestingly though, for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/linux-hits-exactly-2-user-share-on-the-october-2024-steam-survey/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">last month</a> Valve actually adjusted the numbers at some point in the month for the languages used on Steam and the Linux distribution list, so the previous article and our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated Steam Tracker page</a> were corrected with the newer numbers. But the overall platform percentage remained the same.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's the overall platform stats for November 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 96.56% -0.05%</li>
<li>Linux 2.03% +0.03%</li>
<li>macOS 1.41%+0.02%</li>
</ul>
<p>Seems like things just going back to normal, with the Simplified Chinese language option continuing to drop for three months in a row which always causes a change in the Linux numbers.</p>

<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo (Steam Deck) 64 bit 36.63% -0.28%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 9.16% +0.30%</li>
<li>Freedesktop SDK 24.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 4.99% +4.99%</li>

      <title>Proton 9.0-4 Beta updated with more game fixes needing testing on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/huge-new-proton-9-0-4-update-for-steam-deck-linux-now-in-need-of-testing/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Recently I covered the huge Proton 9.0-4 update</a> for Steam Deck and Desktop Linux hitting the Release Candidate stage and there's been a couple of changes.</p>
<p>It's not released for everyone yet as you still need to manually opt into the Beta on Proton 9.0 to test. Valve developers are looking for feedback on any issues that you <em>don't</em> see in the current stable Proton 9.0-3.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Since the initial Beta Valve added / changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>vkd3d-proton update to include a Cyberpunk 2077 performance <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/issues/2215" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">regression fix</a>.</li>
<li>The fix for no audio being played while Microsoft Flight Simulator displays developers logos has been <em>removed</em>. It causes regressions with other games when included without some extra work that's Proton Experimental only for now. The fix is still available via Proton Experimental.</li>
<li>Fixed Hell Let Loose crashing when joining a server after a recent game update.</li>
<li>Included a DXVK <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/commit/d96fa54080320e9b63227e76124ffa50a927ced2" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">regression fix</a> for RaceRoom Racing Experience.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm guilty for adding to Diablo IV even though I own it on Battlenet. The convenience Steam offers is just so much better than other stores and launchers. I forget to ever look at Battlenet, and having it on Steam makes it one-click on both Steam Deck and Desktop Linux.</p>
<p>Also, if you're looking to grab a new game, I've listed some really good <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/best-cheap-steam-deck-linux-games-in-the-steam-autumn-sale-2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cheap stuff for Steam Deck in the Steam Autumn Sale</a>.

<ul>
<li>Support for Feral <a href="https://github.com/FeralInteractive/gamemode" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GameMode</a> and <a href="https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">MangoHUD</a> built into airshipper (the game launcher).</li>

Differential updates were implemented with a fallback to full downloads and you should definitely check <a href="https://veloren.net/blog/devblog-237/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Week 237 blog entry</a>, subtitle “Airshipper Partial download”.</li>
<li>Ongoing work on glider courses.</li>
<li>A strong disagreement that started with a discussion about instruments and sounds led to a spiralled misunderstanding, misattribution and hurt feelings between long term developers. It is an unfortunate event, but this conflict lead to the creation of a consensus with multiple statements regarding resolution of such situations. Please read the entire content of these tips at the <a href="https://veloren.net/blog/devblog-235/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Week 235 blog entry</a>, subtitle “Helpful tips and things to know for contributors”.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Airshipper server queries:</strong></p>
<p>This is a huge one that deserved its own topic here since it also features an entire <a href="https://veloren.net/blog/query-serverbrowser-announce/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog entry</a>.</p>
<p>Player counts is a long-requested feature in the server browser section of Airshipper. Now, the query server allows for clients to query status information about servers more easily displaying accurate ping information, player count, version information and global battlemode. There is a bit of manual work required for server owners to enable that on existing servers, and if you own a Veloren server, please check out the following issue on Gitlab: <a href="https://gitlab.com/veloren/serverbrowser/-/issues/103" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">List of servers without a query port</a>.</p>

      <title>Best cheap Steam Deck / Linux games in the Steam Autumn Sale 2024</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>To help you decide on what to pick up, I've gone through the Steam Autumn Sale and picked out a whole bunch that will work great across both Steam Deck and Desktop Linux. These are my cheap-picks, to help those of you on a bit of a budget right now.</p>
<p>As always, these lists are a little biased to what I think look good, but obviously my tastes are the <em>best</em> and you should buy all of them and if you don't agree you're clearly <em>wrong</em>.</p>
<p>Jokes aside, I've split the list between two categories for you, each filled with an assortment of games. All the games are also <img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Steam Deck Verified, so no hunting for compatibility needed. Every single one in the list is also at a minimum rated Very Positive by users on Steam too.</p>

      <title>Project Zomboid set for a massive update that should get a Beta before Christmas</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Project Zomboid, the highly rated and popular zombie survival game from The Indie Stone, is set to get another truly massive update.</p>
<p>The developers <a href="https://projectzomboid.com/blog/news/2024/11/whatz-next/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> an unstable Build 42 is planned to arrive before Christmas time, but they will delay it if they need to. However they said "the enjoyment we’re seeing from our testers certainly would seem to suggest that the build will be in a good enough state for wider consumption".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/753386981732884857gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Build 42 Unstable is planned to add some great features like:</p>
<ul>
<li>An expanded map.</li>
<li>Underground areas.</li>
<li>A new lighting system.</li>
<li>Animal husbandry.</li>
<li>Wild animals.</li>
<li>Expanded lore.</li>
<li>Dynamic music.</li>
<li>Player vocals.</li>
<li>Better UI scaling.</li>
<li>+ much more shown in the image they shared below.</li>
</ul>

<p>Project Zomboid has now been in Early Access for over 11 years! The Indie Stone have been through some tough times, like a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130505000807/https://projectzomboid.com/blog/2011/10/project-zomboid-burglary-statement/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">break-in</a> back in 2011 that resulted in a lot of lost work. Thankfully, the game lived on and became something much-loved by players.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support and Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Survival game The Last Plague: Blight adds controller support, great for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Last Plague: Blight <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/uncompromising-wilderness-survival-game-the-last-plague-blight-now-in-early-access/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">impressed me quite a lot</a> with the initial Early Access release, and the developer has been doing some great updates to it recently. </p>
<p>With an update <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1564600/view/4464851103138186304" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">last week</a> adding in experimental controller support (only for third-person right now) it's supported across Steam Deck, Xbox and PlayStation controllers. Potentially other controllers as well, but only those controller icons are supported so far. The developer went a step further for Steam Deck, to ensure that text input will give you a proper on-screen keyboard too. Also in is a new radial menu for better controller support, replacing the old quick action menu.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19244298201732880523gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The third-person mode is also a reasonably new experimental addition to the game, giving it quite a different feel to the default top-down view. Feels almost like it was made for it though after giving it a test run today, it works quite nicely with my Xbox controller on Desktop Linux.</p>
<p>Since the update landed, a few more have arrived, like giving an on-screen keyboard to controllers other than the Steam Deck, along with various bug fixes.</p>
<p>The Last Plague: Blight now has a Very Positive rating on Steam. With Native Linux support, and hopefully Valve will rate it officially for Steam Deck soon now it has controller support built-in.</p>

      <title>Modding support returns to Dome Keeper in the latest update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While the developers keep working away on multiplayer for Dome Keeper, you can now get back to filling your game up with mods as support has returned.</p>
<p>The game did have it before, but they did a major upgrade of the <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> version used with a previous update, which messed with mod support. Now though, it's back and better than ever with numerous mods upgraded for it.</p>
<p>As they explained in the announcement</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This year we ported Dome Keeper from Godot 3 to Godot 4. Godot is the engine we use. This was a big undertaking done for three reasons, being multiplayer, console ports and future proofing the project. With that switch, the way the game can be modded did change too, and thus most mods broke.<br/>
We hired Ste from our community to lead the effort of making modding work for Godot 4 for Dome keeper. He is a cornerstone of our community and a key person in the Godot modloader project (shoutout to Kana too &lt;3), so in short the perfect fit to champion modding.</p>
<p>The result: modding is back, yay!</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="iJCV2MjXJYc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/13f8ff5cae645b9695bbd08272a316bd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/iJCV2MjXJYc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>To celebrate, a Dome Keeper modding jam is coming in January and they will be giving out some awards for it.</p>
<p>I recently got quite hooked on Dome Keeper. It's a great game and in the blink of an eye quite a few hours vanished from me. Woops.</p>
<p>Also a great time to mention you can get Dome Keeper and more games <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/the-raw-fury-humble-bundle-is-an-awesome-deal-with-11-steam-deck-verified-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">in the latest Humble Bundle</a>!</p>

      <title>Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 will get cross-play, a photo mode and 12 subclasses next year</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the best RPGs ever made is about to get even better, with Larian Studios announcing what looks to be the last major update for Baldur's Gate 3 coming in 2025.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4461474037375172735" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> the developers mentioned we're going to be getting cross-play so you can finally hook up with friends across PC and console. This also includes cross-progression too using the Larian Network.</p>
<p>You might also want to do a fresh play-through as they're also adding in one new subclass for each of the existing Bard, Barbarian, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Fighter, Monk, Ranger, Rogue, Sorcerer, Warlock and Wizard classes in the game. This will come with "new abilities, animations, VFX, summons and cantrips, and unique voiced dialogue lines for the Oathbreaker Knight with written reactivity for Oathbreakers, along with a touch of homebrewing on certain actions to enhance your role-playing experience".</p>
<p>I love the idea of the Ranger - Swarmkeeper subclass, giving you three types of deadly swarms to assist you in combat. Or the Barbarian - Path of Giants subclass to give you more power to launch people around.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8496320361732878818gol1.gif"/></p>
<p>That sounds pretty exciting actually!</p>
<p>On top of that, there's going to be a proper photo mode to capture those great moments with a whole bunch of options to tweak the camera to your liking. This includes post-processing effects, photo frames, camera angle, what character to focus on, stickers and more.</p>
<p>A stress-test Beta will begin in early January for players to try it out and report any issues.</p>

      <title>Latin cowboy casual farming sim Gaucho and the Grassland new demo released</title>
      <author>nwildner</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>​Gaucho and the Grassland is a game that depicts the life of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaucho" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Gaúcho</a>, the equivalent of a Latin Cowboy from the region of the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pampas" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> Pampas</a> (South of Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina and Chile).</p>
<p>The full game is set to be released in Feb 2025, and this is the official trailer:</p>

<p>The Grassland is a place that not only brings you adventures related to daily duties like taking care of the cattle, helping locals, harvesting and resource gathering much like Stardew Valley, but also has some folkloric elements like "Boitatá the fire snake" which corrupts environments as it passes and the "Velho Pai (Old Father)", an Elderly Gaúcho that helps you with general guidance throughout the game.</p>
<p>The demo provided back at the end of 2022 was not that great. Controllers were bad, camera was awkward, mounting the horse was not really enjoyable because the map was tiny, the dog digging items mechanic was awful. However, after playing 3 hours in a chilled exploring mode in the brand new demo, these are my impressions so far:</p>
<p><strong>The Good</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Game is more polite with more textures, a better night and day cycle, dynamically moving NPCs, item trading with NPCs, and there is actually an earth curvature while you explore the island.</li>
<li>A significant amount of content was added if compared with the old demo. </li>
<li>There is kind of a tutorial which is gameplay driven that let's you freely explore the map while learning the game mechanics.</li>
<li>I've played in Portuguese and English and I think the linguistic regionalism that is a characteristic of the Pampas is well translated or good equivalents are being used for the written dialogs.</li>
<li>For those born in the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande_do_Sul" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> Rio Grande do Sul</a> state like me (Gaúcho), there are plenty of cultural references like when you complete a quest and a sample of the "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDn3lLEQTD0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Canto Alegretense</a>" song is played, which is culturally relevant and an informal anthem of that state.</li>
<li>Quest system looks fun, and while there is a main quest that bounds all the situations that the NPCs are facing, the side quests help you to understand the mechanics and provide you with new items or recipes. The fact of not having all recipes available and you need to do good deeds to other NPCs to unlock them is cool.</li>
<li>Controllers are really good movement wise and using keyboard + mouse or my 8BitDo as a Steam managed controller worked out of the box except in specific situations (see below).</li>
<li>The Dog mechanic got way better since now the spots where the dog needs to dig are visible, making it easier to spot where you can collect materials instead of relying solely on the game RNG.</li>
<li>The house building and house decoration mechanics are nice and trigger a comfy feeling.</li>
<li>Game has a lot of potential from exploring, collecting, crafting, house building, decoration and puzzle solving.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Bad</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The game still needs some optimization. When you start to move around on the map FPS can decrease drastically. In my case with a RTX3070 (laptop) I saw going from 144 to 68, and eventually a dip to 40 FPS.</li>
<li>The game does not have an autosave feature, which is unusual for this kind of exploration game. What happened is that when I was returning some items to end a quest, the NPC was floating(picture below). When I tried to report a bug by pressing F1 the game completely crashed.</li>
<li>When entering build mode to create my first house on the first acquired piece of land, I had to use the mouse to first select the item. After that, I was able to navigate through the building process but it seems that right after you enter build mode, the left thumbstick is useless and the first interaction needs to be done with the mouse. For those using controllers only or movement impaired players with special gamepad setup this could be a problem.</li>
<li>Menus are awkward to navigate with a controller and the game does not  have have a HUD scale setting.</li>
<li>Inventory and crafting uses the same overlay of the main menu, which kinda leads you to the same screen overall if you press Start or Y but on a different tab. On crafting games, I'd expect that you can still observe your environment while crafting and organising your inventory.</li>
<li>Quest tracking only shows one quest per time, and you need to go all over through menus to change the quest you want to track. </li>
<li>Playing on keyboard + mouse is good but the default controller layout needs to be worked a little bit. I’ve got confused many times because LB is “call the dog” and RB is “call the horse” when usually in these games genre it is used for item access on your belt. When I wanted to switch items(which are mapped to Dpad R and Dpad L) I got myself calling my dog or horse.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Ugly (depends on your opinion)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The expressions used by the main character when doing routine stuff are typically gaúcho regionalisms. While those phrases are catchy for those who understand, may annoy "non south Brazilians" because of the repetition. IMHO, it is stereotypically accurate and non-offensive for those from that region, and I feel like using "Texan accent" audio as a substitution because of the cowboy-ish theme would be bad.</li>
<li>The game received some Rio Grande do Sul state<a href="https://www.procultura.rs.gov.br/ver_projeto_fac.php?cod=4614" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> government subsidy</a> and funding since it portrays the life of the ones who are cowboys in the countryside. This item is on this section because people's opinions can differ much on this matter.</li>
<li>There is no mini-game for fishing which turns it into a boring task if compared with similar game titles. Fishing animation takes a lot of time making it not enjoyable for those who want to grind materials as well, and fells really slow if compared with other gathering mechanics.</li>
<li>While the day and night cycle mechanic is good, the day cycle could be longer proportionately in minutes since during the night most of the NPCs are unreachable.</li>
<li>The previous demo didn’t have a progression system for your actions, and after chopping some wood I noticed that my “Axe Skill” increased by 1, leading to an extra drop rate. After that, the same happened for mining and I don’t know if keeping this progression hidden is by design but, it would be nice to see some progression bars like Valheim.</li>
<li>The Linux demo build is still the one from 2022. I was scratching my head because the old grass bug was still there, and nothing had changed. When I forced the use of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> for that title, the new demo was provided. I don’t think it is that bad not providing a Native Linux build, but shaders being compiled during the gameplay could be the cause of performance dips although I saw some Brazilian YouTubers playing natively on Windows having those same performance issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, some screenshots I took during my gameplay yesterday:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3088592121732877244gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3088592121732877244gol1.jpg"/></a><em>A reference to the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruins_of_S%C3%A3o_Miguel_das_Miss%C3%B5es" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> Ruins of São Miguel Unesco</a> World Heritage site.</em></p>

<em>The bug that crashed my game and made me lose 20 minutes of progress</em></p>
<p>The game has incredible potential, if the issues get solved and also because of the fact that you are on an island and navigating out of it could lead to some future DLCs or extra content. I’m giving the benefit of doubt here since other titles of this genre suffered from the same performance issues and got better after some updates.</p>
<p>I tried to be as neutral as possible on my opinions even being a Gaúcho myself.</p>
<p>For those interested, you can<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1670830/Gaucho_and_the_Grassland/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> follow on Steam</a> and download the demo.</p>
<p>Make sure to force the use of the Steam Play <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> compatibility tool as highlighted above, as the Native Linux demo is old. I've let the developer know about this. It has Linux in the system requirements, so as far as we know the main release will have Linux support.</p>

      <title>LIGHT OF MOTIRAM takes Horizon Zero Dawn and turns it into a co-op survival game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Is this Palworld all over again? The copying here is pretty blatant. Tencent Games owned developer Polaris Quest revealed LIGHT OF MOTIRAM and it seems very familiar.</p>
<p>Picture this: you run around with a bow and arrow, or a spear, and come across various mechanical beasts that freely roam the world. You've heard that before right? Because that's Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West. But actually, it's <em>not</em>, it's LIGHT OF MOTIRAM.</p>
<p>Much like Palworld though, this adds quite a lot to the basic idea. There's online co-op for up to 10 people, 100 different Mechanimals to tame, ride, customize and take into combat with you. A full building system that has "realistic physics" with crafting, making it more of a traditional open-world survival game. Even so, their inspiration is truly obvious. The combat looks a fair bit more like Monster Hunter though, which is interesting. It's just the overall design work is <em>very</em> Horizon looking.</p>
<p>See their first teaser trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hAhp1uJpSDc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fdc27407133e388f81182c4f3a70f51e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hAhp1uJpSDc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I must admit, I do love the look and sound of this one.</p>

      <title>We&#39;re getting a Palworld x Terraria crossover, major Palworld update in December</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Quite a surprise this one. Palworld and Terraria are getting a crossover, but we don't really know what just yet.</p>
<p>When Terraria did this with previous games, both games were updated with some content inspired by the other game. So it's likely each game will add something from the other, which could be quite interesting. Imagine the Eye of Cthulhu from Terraria flying at you in Palworld — and you try to catch it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18355469481732791606gol1.jpeg"/></p>
<p>Spotted on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/buckycm.bsky.social/post/3lbvbfszals2f" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> that was posted by their community manager Bucky:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2024 isn't finished yet for Palworld and we have some exciting news about the next update coming VERY SOON...</p>
<p>But first, we want to tell you about something happening in 2025!</p>
<p>! ! ! Palworld x Terraria ! ! !</p>
<p>More info coming soon!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Palworld, we're also getting the next major update in December as also posted on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/buckycm.bsky.social/post/3lbxrb734ic25" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> noting it comes with the new island that's "SIX TIMES BIGGER than Sakurajima will be your greatest challenge yet".</p>

      <title>The new Nexus Mods open source cross-platform app adds Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nexus Mods keep expanding their very promising cross-platform open source app for modding, that will eventually replace their older apps and the new 0.7.0 release just went out.</p>
<p>This expands the game support with Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord, on top of the already supported Baldur's Gate 3, Cyberpunk 2077 and Stardew Valley. The developers mentioned: "This version adds basic support for Bannerlord. All modules can be easily installed and managed. We've also added several advanced <a href="https://nexus-mods.github.io/NexusMods.App/users/games/Bannerlord/#loadout-health-check" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Health Check diagnostics</a> to allow players to understand common issues in their setup, with more planned for the future when we add load order support!".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6681662731732790238gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord</em></p>
<p>The Collections download page has been further refined, now giving non-Premium users access to the Collections features.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">An additional experimental update for Cyberpunk 2077 modding support was added with REDmod load order support. They've also added:</p>
<ul>
<li>Baldur's Gate 3: Added <a href="https://nexus-mods.github.io/NexusMods.App/users/games/BaldursGate3/#loadout-health-check" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">diagnostics</a> relating to BG3 Script Extender.</li>
<li>Updated the My Games page design to better showcase the games you have managed, detected and available in the app but not detected.</li>
<li>Updated the design of tabs in the Workspace system to make them more compact.</li>
<li>General polish to areas of the UI such as Health Check.</li>
</ul>
<p>Great stuff. Looking forward to seeing the full release of the Nexus Mods app since it supports Linux and Steam Deck making modding easier for everyone.</p>

      <title>Mesa 24.2.8 released for Linux with bug fixes, last update for the 24.2 series</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Eric Engestrom announced the release of Mesa 24.2.8 open source graphics drivers for Linux with some bug fixes. This is going to be the last in the 24.2 series, with work now focused on the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/mesa-24-3-0-graphics-drivers-for-linux-released-with-many-new-features-and-bug-fixes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently released Mesa 24.3</a>, although you should usually wait for the first point release.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The noted fixes are:</p>
<blockquote>

      <title>Incredible retro FPS Selaco adds a new &#39;Special Campaign&#39; in another huge update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Celebrating six months since the intial Early Access release, the awesome retro-fuelled Selaco has another really big update out now. It's actually kind of ridiculous how much they keep squishing into the game.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">This follows on from a recent Beta, but now it's available to everyone. The major addition is the new Special Campaign mod which is a blend of "New Game Plus and Randomizer Mode" adding in:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A fully customizable campaign experience.</li>
<li>ARPG-style rarity system for both enemies and weapons.</li>
<li>Weapon Trait system where weapons can have new effects and behaviors.</li>
<li>Random Encounter system where new enemies can spawn into the level in real-time.</li>
<li>New unique enemy variants of existing enemies.</li>
<li>Randomization options including shuffled pickup locations, randomized weapon spawns, mystery boxes, and more.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>By itself that would be an awesome update but there's a whole lot more to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5787550231732787382gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Altered Orbit Studios also added in support for Steam Cloud, Geforce NOW, smarter tutorial prompts, reworked headshots, improved visuals, improved gun sound effects, more upgrades, improvements to the gore system, melee improvements, enemies will react to getting shot in the legs now, save game protection, new mutators to try and much more.</p>
<p>Due to how big the update is they've moved more story content to sometime in January - February 2025, with Chapter 2 development continuing "rapdily". They gave some teaser info about Chapter 2 including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>One of the levels takes place in a mansion.</li>
<li>New defensive items, including a deployable Mini-Turret which comes with its own upgrade tree.</li>
<li>Heavy Weapons. These weapons are extremely powerful, but cannot be stored in your inventory and are thrown away once depleted.</li>
<li>Enemy Miniguns can be picked up.</li>
<li>Drop Pods that can result in unexpected encounters when venturing outside.</li>
<li>Friendly NPC's.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another big milestone has been reached by Valve with their handheld Linux gaming PC, with the Steam Deck hitting 17,000 games rated playable or verified.</p>
<p>If you're curious on how long it's taken to hit various milestones Valve hit <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/steam-deck-officially-hits-over-13000-games-playable-and-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">13,000 in January</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/steam-deck-hits-14000-games-rated-playable-or-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">14,000 in March</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/steam-deck-hits-15000-games-rated-playable-and-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">15,000 in May</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/steam-deck-reaches-over-16000-playable-and-verified-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">16,000 in August</a>. Filtering specifically just to games on Steam at time of writing there's 5,678 <em>Verified</em>, 11,323 <em>Playable</em> and 4,432 <em>Unsupported</em>.</p>

<em>Pictured - Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em></p>
<p>Some other games are easier to play now too like Marvel’s Midnight Suns, since the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/2k-launcher-is-finally-no-more-thats-at-least-one-publisher-making-things-better-for-gamers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2K Launcher is finally no more</a>! We also only just recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/proton-experimental-for-steam-deck-linux-fixes-disgaea-4-complete-final-fantasy-xiv-and-various-other-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">had another Proton Experimental upgrade</a> to bring more compatibility as well. Plus a stable update <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/huge-new-proton-9-0-4-update-for-steam-deck-linux-now-in-need-of-testing/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-4 is now in testing</a> too! Things are always moving to get as many games working as possible.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">I've been covering various games that get Steam Deck Verified across different articles so if you want some more highlights here's a few to check back on:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/steam-deck-verified-highlights-for-november-7-2024-including-planet-coaster-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Deck Verified highlights for November 7 2024</a></li>

</ul>
<p>There's a lot of games you can play outside of Steam too, although they do need a little extra setup. Like GOG, Epic Games and more via tools like the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/heroic-games-launcher-2152-released-fixing-amazon-gog-and-epic-games-issues/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a>. Remember that Valve's numbers here only include what they've put through testing, and only on Steam — so the overall real number is far higher.</p>
<p>Are you curious to know what games with anti-cheat are playable? I'm currently building up our own <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated curated list</a> on that to help you. See more details in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/forum/topic/6277/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my forum post</a> (please leave all comments on that in there).</p>

      <title>Steam Autumn Sale is live for you to empty your wallets, Steam Awards open for nominations</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another year coming to a close and so the Steam Autumn Sale is live again until December 4. Time to find where your wallet is hiding.</p>
<p>I'm not saying you <em>have</em> to buy anything though. Like me, many of you probably have a few hundred games gathering dust, waiting for that rainy day where you keep promising you'll play with them right? But, a few more couldn't hurt. <em>Some of the deals sure do look delicious.</em></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JC876LwJ2AQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a85fd94f4c2347de237d5561a93eb13f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JC876LwJ2AQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>So many thousands of great games on sale, you really don't need any reccomendations from me do you? Oh, you do? Well here's a few favourites going cheaper that work on Steam Deck / Linux Desktop:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1222140/Detroit_Become_Human" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Detroit: Become Human</a> - 70% off</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1593500/God_of_War/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">God of War</a> - 60% off</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">No Man's Sky</a> - 60% off</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1313140/Cult_of_the_Lamb/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Cult of the Lamb</a> - 50% off</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1817070/Marvels_SpiderMan_Remastered/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered</a> - 50% off</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Valheim </a>- 50% off</li>
</ul>
<p>Valve also put up the 64GB (EU 15% off) and 512GB (US/Canada 25% off) Steam Deck models on sale, in regions where they still have stock. These are the models that have been discontinued.</p>
<p>This is a great time to give over some suggestions to your fellow GamingOnLinux readers. Drop a comment of your top 5 games on sale you think people should be picking up.</p>
<p>See more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the Steam store</a>.</p>
<p>You can also now nominate your favourite games in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamawards/nominations" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The Steam Awards</a>.</p>
<p>If you are going to wait a bit, the Steam Winter Sale will start December 19th. So even if you miss something in this sale it won't be long for the next major sale.</p>
