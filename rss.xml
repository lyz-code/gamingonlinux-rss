      <title>CARGO blends off-roading with an action-focused Mad Max like delivery sim</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>CARGO is not your usual delivery sim. Blending together off-roading co-op madness in a post-apocalyptic world.</p>
<p>They really, badly, need to come up with a better name though. The full name of the game is "CARGO: Co-Op Delivery Simulator in Post Apocalyptic World" and uh — that's a ridiculous mouthful. There's already various games named some form of Cargo, so back to the drawing board with the naming.</p>
<p>Aside from that, love the idea of this. Mixing together elements of SnowRunner, Mad Max / Twisted Metal and more into something that really could be a lot of fun. Their initial announcement trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NC77q9xiJBM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6c15c68882c64d7e406b032dba315efb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NC77q9xiJBM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview.</strong> CARGO is a post-apocalyptic off-road autosim about moving critical supplies between survivors. Play solo or form <strong>4-player co-op</strong> convoys. Roles can be split (driver/defense/scout/utility); players can share seats (incl. mounted turrets) or bring separate vehicles into the same session.</li>
<li><strong>Driving &amp; Terrain.</strong> Physics-driven handling with meaningful setup impact: vehicle weight, tires, traction, suspension, engine, differentials. Biomes include cracked highways, deep mud, radiation zones, and sand-choked dunes.</li>
<li><strong>Encounters (PvE).</strong> Hostile raiders attempt to disable the rig and steal cargo. Choose when to evade, reroute, or fight; delivery failure is tied to cargo loss.</li>
<li><strong>Vehicles.</strong> Customization and restoration define cars for combat, capacity, speed, or traversal. Swap tires/engines, add armor and defensive/offensive tools, expand trunk capacity. Progression unlocks new options; some upgrades are vehicle-specific. Derelict vehicles can be discovered and rebuilt piece by piece.</li>
<li><strong>Meta Progression.</strong> Start from a small garage and expand base facilities to unlock trading, new delivery types, restoration options, and eventually settlement-scale operations.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Jump Space (formerly Jump Ship) arrives September 19 for co-op PvE spaceship fun</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Jump Space (formerly Jump Ship) actually looks incredible if you're in the market for a new co-op game and it arrives September 19th. It already works well on Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck from previous demos, and the developers said they will be working on improving Steam Deck performance with Proton.</p>
<p>Check out their two brand new videos:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="skSL_3-3Hb8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/00a481a51a54c05035f98671a204fc46.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/skSL_3-3Hb8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="l0c2o0UdSgs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7b5701190c3713fa37b3db91d2665975.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/l0c2o0UdSgs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Jump across the universe</strong> - Select from a variety of hand crafted missions with random elements. No two runs will be exactly the same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Seamlessly go on and off ship</strong> - Once you’ve jumped with your ship, you can switch seamlessly between operating your ship, space walking and on-foot planetary exploration, it just works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Upgrade, maintain, repair</strong> - Manage your ship as you scavenge for parts to upgrade or repair it, and adapt it to fit your needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fly with a crew, or go solo</strong> - Jump Space is best enjoyed with friends, but solo adventurers are welcome too.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Manage Your Jump Ship</strong></p>
<p>Upgrade and customise your ship as you face off against the challenges of space exploration, and scavenge resources to ensure your survival. Reinforce your defences, adjust your energy output for speed or bolster your ship’s attack capabilities - the choice is yours.</p>
<p><strong>Immerse Yourself in Space</strong></p>
<p>Experience fluid gameplay as you switch from steering your ship out of an asteroid field to jetpacking towards an enemy vessel to sabotage its core. Seamlessly transition between exploration, combat and traversal.</p>
<p><strong>Improvise and Adapt; Together</strong></p>
<p>Go on missions with your friends and take on roles, from piloting to engineering and field exploration. Work together to overcome enemy attacks, extinguish fires on the command deck or adjust your ship’s power grid on the fly. There are no set classes in Jump Space, improvise and decide how you want to engage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And now onto the bit that annoys me. Scroll down on Steam to see an AI notice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The developers describe how their game uses AI Generated Content like this:</p>
<p>Pre-generated voice cloning/Text-To-Speech where it makes sense creatively.<br/>
Placeholders will be replaced by real voice acting as development continues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At least in this case, they do plan to put in real voice acting later.</p>

      <title>Let&#39;s Build a Dungeon sounds like such a fun idea as it hits 140,000 Steam wishlists</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm too stupid to make a game, but a game about managing a game studio building an MMORPG? Oh yeah, Let's Build a Dungeon sounds like my jam.</p>
<p>Seriously, Let's Build a Dungeon actually has such a fun sounding idea to it. Because it's not a management game like you would expect. Built by Springloaded, who also made the cute Let's Build a Zoo. You get to build up  a full game in what they say is a "true-to-life and ridiculous simulation of the games industry". Manage staff and development schedules, build up the actual world itself and eventually…you even get to play your own game.</p>
<p>All of that while you sit back sipping a cola without the worry of a publisher suddenly running out on you.</p>
<p>Check out their brand new overview trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="w9x1hGEJ-hw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/45fc193bc2bfc1af95a8e11bf1e55ad0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/w9x1hGEJ-hw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Design and build your very own MMO world, fit to be filled by hordes of virtual players</li>
<li>Manage the day-to-day running of your game studio, from hiring and firing to keeping your investors happy</li>
<li>Attract new virtual players to your MMO masterpiece by expanding your world, designing new quests and monitoring player journeys</li>
<li>Progress through the campaign to develop new items, environments and mechanics that bring your ideas to life</li>
<li>Playtest your RPG at any time to see the world through the eyes of a player</li>
<li>Mix-and-match quest styles for endless replayability</li>
<li>Customise using thousands of items, or design your own</li>
<li>Negotiate tough conversations with shareholders, staff, players and publishers to make meaningful choices that will impact the direction of your studio.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Deep Dish Dungeon looks like a great co-op dungeon crawler</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Deep Dish Dungeon is a recent announcement from publisher Raw Fury, a dungeon crawler with an emphasis on exploration and player ingenuity. Playable solo or in online co-op, the trailer sold me pretty quickly with the overall theme of it.</p>
<p>Developed by Behold Studios who also made Chroma Squad, Knights of Pen and Paper and more games. As the name alludes, cooking a good hearty meal is a big part of the gameplay here. From Steam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deep Dish Dungeon is a dungeon crawler and exploration game that rewards curiosity and resourcefulness. In an atmospheric environment, explore corridors, rooms and passageways solo or with up to three friends, and gather resources to improve your camping site. Craft tools and cook nourishing meals to bolster strength throughout the journey, and unravel the enigma that lies within the shadows.</p>
<p>Forage and scavenge as you traverse through the dungeon's bountiful depths. Between your journeys, return to camp and plan your next steps by the fire. Use the resources you find to craft new tools and cook a hearty meal. Remember that food is progress: over time, unlock recipes that have different effects on your stats.</p>

      <title>Hollow Knight: Silksong is now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/hollow-knight-silksong-releases-september-4/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hollow Knight: Silksong now finally having a release date</a>, Valve have managed to test it early and given it a Steam Deck Verified rating. It's also rated as SteamOS Compatible, since anything that runs on Steam Deck should run on other SteamOS systems unless they have silly <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat</a> (which this of course does not).</p>
<p>Interestingly, Valve's rating is actually using the Native Linux version of the game and not Proton. As you can see in the details on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1030300/info/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>.

      <title>AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 4 (FSR 4) now available for all developers with FidelityFX SDK 2.0</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AMD have finally released FidelityFX SDK 2.0, which includes support for FidelityFX Super Resolution 4 (FSR 4), so now all developers can use it.</p>
<p>Offering an easy way for developers to upgrade, it provides some pretty big improvements to image quality with their new Machine Learning based algorithm. It improves temporal stability, better preserve detail, and reduce ghosting and in many cases the difference is very noticeable. </p>
<p>As for the upgrade path AMD said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This new release of AMD FSR 4 continues to use the FidelityFX API introduced in FSR 3.1, providing an easy update path for developers. New features are exposed using the extensibility of the FidelityFX API. AMD FSR 4 is available as prebuilt, signed DLLs as part of FidelityFX SDK 2.0 official releases to ensure stability and upgradability of DLLs, if allowed by individual game releases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>AMD FidelityFX SDK is open source available under the MIT license. You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/FidelityFX-SDK" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and their <a href="https://gpuopen.com/learn/amd-fsr4-gpuopen-release/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> for info.</p>

      <title>Nexus Mods announce age verification for UK users</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Nexus Mods team have <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15346" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> they're adding an age verification requirement for certain mods, and it sounds like eventually for the EU too.</p>
<p>You can thank the UK Online Safety Act they legally have to follow, if they're to continue hosting "adult" themed mods for various games. This follows Discord, Reddit and many other sites being forced to do the same. They'll be using <a href="https://www.k-id.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">k-ID</a> for it, which is also used by Discord.</p>
<p>This won't be required for everyone, it will only appear when you try to access adult content hosted on Nexus Mods. They said EU users will "follow once laws in your region require it" and other countries as their laws come in. The only exemption is accounts over 10 years old will not be asked to age verify.</p>
<p>If you are prompted to verify and choose not to they said the content will simply be hidden.</p>
<p>Their <a href="https://help.nexusmods.com/article/157-age-verification-faq" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ post</a> has more info. Nexus said it will begin next week.</p>

      <title>Hollow Knight: Silksong releases September 4</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is coming and soon too! On September 4th, the wait will finally be over for fans as confirmed today by Team Cherry. Finally, it took a while but hopefully the wait will have been worth it. Sure does look incredible.</p>
<p>Check out the official release trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6XGeJwsUP9c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cb608bc050d35de02b488a43c81c81b3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6XGeJwsUP9c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It was originally due to be an expansion for the original but simply grew too big. Their team spoke to Jason Schreier at <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> (paywalled), detailing why it took so long to arrive. The answer is pretty simple. There was no burnout or anything big happening behind the scenes, as developer Ari Gibson said "It was never stuck or anything. It was always progressing. It's just the case that we’re a small team, and games take a lot of time. There wasn’t any big controversial moment behind it." and they were having a bit too much fun designing and expanding it.</p>
<p>"We felt like continued updates were just going to sour people on the whole thing," Gibson said. "Because all we could really say is, 'We’re still working on it.'"</p>
<p>Game Highlights (from Steam):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Discover a whole new kingdom! Explore coral forests, mossy grottos, gilded cities and misted moors as you ascend to the shining citadel at the top of the world.</li>
<li>Engage in lethal acrobatic action! Wield a whole new suite of deadly moves as you dance between foes in deadly, beautiful combat.</li>
<li>Craft powerful tools! Master an ever-expanding arsenal of weapons, traps, and mechanisms to confound your enemies and explore new heights.</li>
<li>Solve shocking quests! Hunt down rare beasts, solve ancient mysteries and search for lost treasures to fulfil the wishes of the downtrodden and restore the kingdom’s hope. Prepare for the unexpected!</li>
<li>Face over 150 all-new foes! Beasts and hunters, assassins and kings, monsters and knights, defeat them all with bravery and skill!</li>
<li>Challenge Silk Soul mode! Once you conquer the kingdom, test your skills in an all-new mode that spins the game into a unique, challenging experience.</li>
<li>Experience a stunning orchestral score! Hollow Knight’s award-winning composer, Christopher Larkin, returns to bring melancholy melodies, symphonic strings and heart-thumping, soul strumming boss themes to the adventure.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not entirely clear if it will have Native Linux support like the original. I've emailed the developer to ask. Otherwise there's Valve's excellent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/7-years-later-valves-proton-has-been-an-incredible-game-changer-for-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton compatibility layer</a>. <strong>Update 22/08/25</strong>: the developers added Linux system requirements after this was published, and it's now <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/hollow-knight-silksong-is-now-steam-deck-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Deck Verified with the Native version</a>.</p>

      <title>The original Splitgate will live on with player-hosted matches</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>At least this is one online game that won't be entirely killed off. Splitgate, the original one, will live on by allowing players to host matches.</p>
<p>If you missed the recent news, the developers announced they're <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/splitgate-2-is-going-back-to-beta-with-the-original-shutting-down-as-1047-games-have-layoffs/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reworking Splitgate 2</a> and they were going to entirely sunset the original Splitgate and were only exploring the possibility of letting players host matches with the dedicated servers turned off. Now, in a <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/news/splitgate-1-lives-on-through-peer-to-peer-support" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official site, they've confirmed an update is coming.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6581120651755784135gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>To save you clicking about, here's the important bits:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What's Happening</strong></p>
<p>Starting August 29, the original Splitgate will be moving to peer-to-peer as we focus our resources on rebuilding Splitgate 2. We know this game means the world to so many of you and we're not about to let that disappear. This means you'll still be able to play matches and experience the magic that made Splitgate special, just in a different way.</p>
<p>In addition to these changes, we have also added content to the game that was previously unreleased, stockpiled, or Work In Progress (WIP).</p>
<ul>
<li>13 WIP blockout arena maps -- Including some of the first maps shown in Splitgate 2</li>
<li>Simulation Juliet (an unreleased Takedown map)</li>
<li>Everyone gets access to all cosmetics -- For this reason, the Battle Pass, Rewards Center, Store, and Drops have been sunset</li>
</ul>
<p>We have also made sure that community-favorite features remain playable, including Races and Map Creator!</p>
<p><strong>How It Works</strong></p>
<p>A player will host a match and act as the server. Other players can view the game in the server browser and join from there. If the host has saved Custom Maps, then those maps will be playable for the lobby.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Truckful is a very colourful looking delivery mystery adventure from MythicOwl and Palworld publisher Pocketpair Publishing. A demo is coming next month!</p>
<p>In a Steam announcement the developer said it will be shown off at PAX West between August 28th - September 1st where visitors will be able to try it. At some point after, a public demo will arrive on Steam that will be "100% compatible with Steam Deck". They also confirmed they're "working on a native Linux version that will be available on full game release in 2026".</p>
<p>Every bit of footage I see on this just makes me want more. See some recent gameplay below:</p>

      <title>Dome Keeper set for full online and local multiplayer with a new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Multiplayer is finally coming to the excellent Dome Keeper, in a major upcoming update from developer Bippinbits. This is in addition to the developer working on the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/i-cant-wait-to-fire-that-massive-cannon-in-pvkk-planetenverteidigungskanonenkommandant/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">excellent looking PVKK: Planetenverteidigungskanonenkommandant</a>.</p>
<p>Giving more detail in a Steam post it will include Cooperative Play, Competitive Play, Local Splitscreen and Online Multiplayer. It's even getting a Dome versus Dome mode, which sounds like a lot of fun and a very different experience to the base game.</p>
<p>What's not entirely clear is when it will arrive. All modes are now in the code and working, but they're going through and fixing various bugs as they find them. At some point a big playtest is coming to Steam to help hunt for problems.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sword &amp; Quill have announced the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zeinmakesgames/soulblaze-a-hand-drawn-creature-collecting-roguelite" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign</a> for Soulblaze, a fresh dice rolling creature-collecting roguelite and there's a demo up right now. Another game made with the free and open source <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>.</p>
<p>This sounds like a good one for people who don't have endless amounts of time. It's a bite-sized creature collecting experience. As the developer explained: "Enjoy the fun of picking a starter and building your team without having to commit dozens of hours. Runs are fast-paced and always different, each of your teams unique every time. You won't run out of action points, you won't have to walk to the last healing provider over and over, you just keep going... until you win? Yes, win!"</p>
<p>It will be supported on Linux, macOS and Windows. Check out the full Kickstarter video to get some more details on it:</p>

      <title>Valheim: Call To Arms major update announced with new combat mechanics and lots of new items</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Iron Gate AB have been cooking! Valheim: Call To Arms is the next major update to the popular survival game and it's available to test right now.</p>
<p>This was announced during Gamescom and it looks to be a pretty game-changing update. While the developers have previously expanded the overall content and added in new biomes, this pulls this back a bit to the more basic gameplay to expand what's possible with it. There's new combat mechanics, a new wearable trinkets system, a whole lot of new weapons and so much more.</p>
<p>Check out the update trailer:</p>

<p>The main highlights of what's coming:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Forsaken Powers rebalanced.</li>
<li>New combat mechanics &amp; combat improvements.</li>
<li>New equipable item type: Trinkets.</li>
<li>13 new trinkets.</li>

      <title>Story-based survival strategy game Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We're getting a brand new Star Trek: Voyager game and a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/battlestar-galactica-scattered-hopes-announced-and-has-me-terribly-excited/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new Battlestar Galactica game</a>? This is what dreams are made of. <em>Someone pinch me, this can't be real. Janeway who? Look at me, I'm the captain now.</em></p>
<p>According to the blurb it blends "exploration, ship &amp; resource management, roguelite elements, and meaningful choices" along with "crew dynamics and a fresh take on a beloved sci-fi universe — with what-if scenarios that open up new possibilities". Each play-through is different with it being a roguelite and so you get to play out various different fantasies with it.</p>
<p>I will make every attempt to turn the Borg into my friends. And finally give Kim that promotion. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="s-0brgSYDEM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1a52e98e3daaf71254bc6c47a75e9507.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/s-0brgSYDEM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“Star Trek Voyager: Across the Unknown is a project driven by passion—both for storytelling and for the legacy of Star Trek,” says Jonas Hüsges, COO at Daedalic Entertainment. “We’re excited to bring the U.S.S. Voyager crew back into the spotlight in a way that feels true to canon while offering new narrative frontiers to explore.”</p>
<p>“As lifelong fans of Star Trek, we’re thrilled to contribute to this iconic universe,” adds Daniel Bernard, Game Director at gameXcite. “This game isn’t just about nostalgia—it’s about giving players the conn and letting them chart their own course through the unknown.”</p>

      <title>Paradox announced the updated, expanded, and remastered Surviving Mars: Relaunched</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sci-fi fans are eating good lately. Surviving Mars: Relaunched was announced by Paradox Interactive with Haemimont Games back for it.</p>
<p>It will include enhanced graphics, a new UI,and new content never before seen in the original. Plus all the previously released DLC from expansions to cosmetic bits all included together in one package. No release date given other than "soon" and it will have a "substantial discount for owners of the original Surviving Mars".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cYdb13fqECo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9c3b50dd9ce2d268f0380d3b04fa3ad6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cYdb13fqECo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>We don't know yet if it will continue the Native Linux support like the original, and Paradox haven't yet replied to my question about it. So it's possible you may have to use Valve's Proton for it on Linux systems.</p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The Award-Winning Martian Colonization Game, Remastered: Players must overcome the challenges of building a habitable, life-sustaining colony in a hostile environment, bringing in human colonists, and keeping them alive long enough to become self-sustaining. Relaunched brings a reworked UI to players for easier access to their toolset and upgraded graphics fidelity and lighting for modern systems.</li>
<li>The Full Expansion Catalog: Compete with other colonies with Space Race, introduce Animal Life with Project Laika, and terraform the martian desert with Green Planet - along with all major and minor expansions, cosmetics, and radio stations released for the original game.</li>
<li>New Gameplay Feature: The “Martian Assembly” update adds colony factions to the game, adding players’ greatest challenge yet to the unforgiving environment of Mars: politics. Colonists will adopt agendas and personal demands, allowing players to shape the society of their colonies’ future. Establish laws and policies, and even push for full independence from Earth!</li>
<li>Expansive Mod Support: Craft your own buildings, parks, or even a sci-fi mystery to share through the game’s extensive and convenient modding tools. Modding is integrated into the game across all platforms, making it easy to browse, install, share, and manage mods without ever leaving your colony.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The base price will be $39.99/£34.99/€39.99 but owners of the original get it for $19.99/£17.50/€19.99.</p>

      <title>Mesa 25.2.1 released for open source Linux graphics drivers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mesa 25.2.1 was released on August 20th bringing some essential bug fixes for the current latest feature release of open source Linux graphics drivers. The Mesa developers generally tell people to wait until this first bug fix before upgrading production systems, as new feature releases always have a little something they might miss.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/relnotes/25.2.1.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release notes</a> the main bug fixes are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>d3d10umd: Build regression on 25.2.0-rc1</li>
<li>nvk/nak regression: memory_model.message_passing fails on KeplerA</li>
<li>[ANV] dEQP-VK.api.copy_and_blit.copy_commands2.image_to_buffer_transfer_queue.2d_images.whole_r32g32b32_uint_linear and possibly others asserts on LNL</li>
<li>Build dependency on intel_wa.h missing in Intel vulkan driver</li>
<li>Missing polygons/vertices in CS2 on BMG</li>
<li>`vn_ring`: use-after-release crash after `vn_ring_destroy` on Virtio-Vulkan</li>
<li>venus: vkmark –winsys headless segfault (regression)</li>
<li>Vulkan headless WSI crashes when initializing swapchain on Asahi Linux running Apple M1 Max</li>
</ul>

      <title>Leaks again hint at Valve doing a proper Steam Machine Console</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We are again seeing leaks of a potential future console from Valve, which is exciting considering how well the Steam Deck has done.</p>
<p>Valve are always working on something though, and seeing leaks doesn't mean what they're currently working on will ever actually release. Valve did also <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/the-latest-valve-steam-console-rumour-with-amd-rdna4-can-be-safely-ignored-heres-why/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously completely dismiss another rumour</a> but this one at least has some more substance to it.</p>
<p>The what: as reported by <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1957931577444561350" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SadlyItsBradley</a> on X, noting that a <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/13390426" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Geekbench</a> result had appeared for "Valve Fremont". Going by the details it's currently using a "Hawk Point 2" CPU noted as "AMD Custom CPU 1772" featuring 6 Cores and 12 Threads running at 3.20 GHz.</p>
<p>What makes it a little odd though is the listing being Windows 11 Pro, along with it <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1958024995273068544" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reportedly</a> having a dedicated RX 7600 GPU. It would be thoroughly odd if it was Windows-based, given all their work on Linux and the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/7-years-later-valves-proton-has-been-an-incredible-game-changer-for-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">amazing Proton compatibility layer</a>. This is likely just some testing machine that won't match up to what the real specifications will be, if it <em>ever</em> does release.</p>
<p>Question is though — how did this listing appear? It wasn't just the once either, but <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/13390144" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">twice</a>. Did someone at Valve accidentally allow it to be published? Did Valve do it on purpose to generate more leak hype and speculation? Then again, to cover all sides - this "Valve Fremont" <em>might</em> not even be a real listing actually coming from a Valve test.</p>
<p>How <em>could</em> they actually make it a success? I wrote about what I thought <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/what-valve-would-need-to-do-to-make-a-steam-console-a-success/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve would need for a new Steam Machine previously</a>, and going back — most of what I said still remains true. Mostly, because they do now have the dedicated SteamOS rating system now at least for other devices.</p>
<p>Valve have built up a lot of goodwill and dedicated customers with the Steam Deck, and we've come a truly long way since the failure of the first Steam Machines so they could quite easily make it a success. As long as it's priced right, and performs well enough with people having access to all their existing Steam games thanks again to Proton if it used SteamOS. We definitely <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/new-steam-controller-2-and-vr-controller-designs-got-leaked/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">need that Steam Controller 2</a> as well that's for sure.</p>
<p>What are your current thoughts on a future TV Steam Machine from Valve?</p>
<p><em>I've reached out to Valve for comment but we're unlikely to get a response on such a thing.</em></p>

      <title>7 years later, Valve&#39;s Proton has been an incredible game-changer for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It has been 7 years since Valve revealed Proton, their compatibility layer to run Windows games on Linux systems. <em>What an incredible time it has been.</em></p>
<p>Hard to imagine Linux gaming without Proton now isn't it? Unless games use some funky video codecs or <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">kernel-level anti-cheat</a>, a lot of the time they do just work with the click of a button. We went from getting a handful of indie games and some AAA scraps from porting companies, to multiple tens of thousands of games — we're spoilt for choice on what to actually play. Going by ProtonDB there's at least 15,855 games rated playable by at least two reports, and Valve's Deck Verified system shows 21,694 games rated at least playable for SteamOS / Steam Deck. Incredible numbers and that's only what have actually seen some checks.</p>
<p>I still <em>vividly</em> remember the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2018/08/valve-officially-confirm-a-new-version-of-steam-play-which-includes-a-modified-version-of-wine/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">original announcement</a>, shaking with excitement on what it would mean for the future. It has opened up a world of possibilities, where you (for the most part) don't need to be attached to Windows to play some of the best games around.</p>
<p>Valve's commitment to Linux and open source is very much self-serving of course, they are a company with goals. All of this was progress towards creating their own ecosystem with the likes of the Steam Deck / SteamOS and other potential hardware to come. Linux desktop users are mostly just along for the ride and reap all the benefits.</p>
<p>Thanks to all the work with Proton and the Steam Deck, the Linux user share on Steam is also <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on the cusp of breaking through 3%</a> which is impressive considering the massive mountain that is Windows. You don't beat or even get remotely close to such an entrenched system overnight, movement like this just takes time. Slow and steady wins the race right? Valve continue playing the long game here.</p>
<p>What's truly incredible about Proton though is how it gives Valve a set platform to continue building on. So when we hopefully see a Steam Deck 2, or a Steam Machine TV console, it will be plug and play with all the existing games. Linking into why I love the whole idea of Valve using Linux with Proton, SteamOS / Steam Deck over traditional consoles is just having access to all the same games - no need to buy them again.</p>
<p>And with more publishers like Microsoft and Sony pushing their games on Steam too, we all win.</p>
<p>Here's to Valve and Proton, 7 years on. Cheers!</p>

      <title>I can&#39;t wait to fire that massive cannon in PVKK: Planetenverteidigungskanonenkommandant</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PVKK: Planetenverteidigungskanonenkommandant really rolls off the tongue doesn't it? Is it basically Dome Keeper in 3D? Well, sort-of but not quite. Either way, it looks fantastic and the latest trailer gives us a fresh glimpse into the world of firing a massive planetary defence cannon.</p>
<p>Working for an autocratic regime and confined to your bunker, it's your mission to manually control that huge weapon with various buttons, levers and more. It's not just you sat in front of a screen though, you can actually get up and walk around this bunker with customizations, and you'll be dealing with various moral dilemmas. There's also some secrets to the bunker to explore and discover.</p>
<p>Check out the fresh trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HYoehpASQMA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0b207f1379a87aade70c2025b678619a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HYoehpASQMA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>We still don't entirely know if it will have Native Linux support. It's built with Godot and their FAQ still just mentions that Linux is a "pretty safe bet" since Godot works well. Just have to wait and see.</p>
<p>I'm excited by this one, what a great idea and the new footage looks awesome. Dome Keeper really sucked me in, so I expect more great things from Bippinbits. Their booth at Gamescom is also <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/smitner.studio/post/3lwtdd3oiqs26" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">just awesome</a>.</p>

      <title>Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster is the next Nightdive Studios release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nightdive Studios announced they're doing Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster, reviving the 1997 classic from LucasArts. People were speculating this was coming, since the original on Steam got named to "Classic" before the official announcement claim.</p>
<p>More about it: "Saddle up and ride back into the Wild West with the gunslinging ex-Marshal, James Anderson, and face off against the good, the bad, and the even worse this side of the Mississippi as you work to uncover a twisted plot of greed and corruption. With your trusty six-shooting .45 Revolver, Scoped .44 Rifle, 10-Gauge Shotgun, and good ol' Sawed-Off 12-Gauge Shotgun, you'll be packin' plenty of firepower to take out all manner of outlaw varmints."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

We’re honored to help bring this iconic Western adventure to modern audiences.”</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Main Highlights:</p>

      <title>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition fixes desyncs between Windows and Linux / SteamOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition released recently and it works great on Linux, even better now the online works properly too.</p>
<p>Thanks to Valve's Proton, we have access constantly to games new and old. But, sometimes, they come with issues. Much like previous RTS games from Relic Entertainment, it launched with a desync issue between Windows and Linux (Proton). However, unlike previous games, Relic actually released a patch to fix it! Just goes to show how far we've come that developers are truly now paying attention.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8xFKCaztKIA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5b3d7ac548714a183dba48a1e5a55e2c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8xFKCaztKIA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Noted in Hot Fix 2.0.1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where players could not see Multiplayer game lobbies hosted by a player using a different audio language (English, German, French, and Russian).</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that prevented the game from loading the correct language using the GOG Galaxy launcher for those using Korean, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese. </li>
<li><strong>Fixed a desync that led to a crash in Multiplayer games where players on Windows &amp; Linux (SteamDeck / Proton) were playing together.</strong></li>
<li>Fixed two crashes that could occur during singleplayer or multiplayer when numerous enemy units were starting to move while the player is also moving the camera.</li>
<li>Fixed two crashes that could occur when pre-rendered movies started for players using older operating systems. </li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could occur during loading screens or while saving the game.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gameplay</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a fatal scar error in Winter Assault Disorder Mission 1 when Gorgutz was killed immediately before a cut-scene triggered.</li>
<li>Fixed a scripting error that prevented Listening Posts from being buildable in Dawn of War Mission 1 when two strategic points were captured at the same time.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that could sometimes prevent objective locations from being correctly highlighted by arrow FX in Campaign missions.</li>
<li>Updated Gridkeys controls to fix a keybind conflict on Orks, Space Marines, and Imperial Guard.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Now we can all enjoy one of the best RTS games ever, with lots of enhancements and actually working multiplayer between platforms without having to resort to special external fixes. What a time to be alive.</p>

      <title>iRacing Arcade announced and it&#39;s basically Circuit Superstars 2 with licensed cars and tracks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>iRacing have announced iRacing Arcade made in partnership with Original Fire Games the developers of Circuit Superstars.</p>
<p>Certainly seems like this could have been Circuit Superstars 2, with iRacing mentioning how this "all-new title blends the strengths of both studios to create a unique racing experience that’s fun for all". It will also come with a stylized version of officially licensed vehicles and tracks.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QDQg-MjglNY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/25a2710700195311ceb3a55ed32d61ab.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QDQg-MjglNY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Interestingly, their system requirements on Steam note it will run on "LCD Steam Deck equivalent or higher". Nice to see more developers using the Steam Deck directly like this, as a set specification platform for performance.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features of iRacing Arcade include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Approachable racing for all:</strong> Racers of all ages will enjoy iRacing Arcade’s mix of playful art and fun physics, giving players a driving experience that is easy to pick up but rewarding to master.</li>
<li><strong>Build your motorsport legacy: </strong>Climb the racing ladder to earn resources and boosts that improve your results and build your racing empire from a backyard garage to a bold, fully customizable palace.</li>
<li><strong>Officially licensed cars and tracks: </strong>From iconic vehicles like the Porsche 911 GT3 Cup to top tracks like Imola and Autódromo Hermanos Rodriguez, real-world race fans will enjoy a unique take on their favorite cars and circuits.</li>
<li><strong>More ways to race:</strong> Along with your single-player racing dynasty, compete in global time trials and push for the highest possible spot on the leaderboard.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Death By Scrolling is the next game from Ron Gilbert of Terrible Toybox and publisher MicroProse</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>MicroProse Software are on a bit of a roll lately for their publishing, now they've announced Death By Scrolling from Ron Gilbert of Terrible Toybox.</p>
<p>More about it: set in the bizarre depths of Purgatory — now under new management, Death By Scrolling challenges players to race upward through endless levels, battling quirky underworld monsters, dodging deadly traps, and staying just ahead of the relentless Grim Reaper. The ultimate goal? Amass 10,000 gold to pay the Ferryman’s outrageous river‑crossing fee and finally escape the afterlife. Check out the first proper trailer for it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="fXIGtCVH5Wo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3746ef19412f15cac41826fd985aaeeb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/fXIGtCVH5Wo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Players will choose from a varied cast of unique characters, each with distinct perks and abilities, and take on a nonstop vertical sprint where time, gravity, and death itself are constant enemies.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Along the way, they’ll:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Battle <strong>bizarre creatures</strong> and demonic bosses in fast‑paced combat.</li>
<li>Gather <strong>loot</strong>, gems, and power‑ups from eccentric vendors.</li>
<li>Complete <strong>bonus runs and side quests</strong> for extra rewards.</li>
<li>Compete on global Steam <strong>leaderboards </strong>to prove their purgatorial skill.</li>
<li>Enjoy a<strong> tongue‑in‑cheek</strong> take on afterlife bureaucracy, with cheeky dialogues and playful narration—hallmarks of Ron Gilbert’s signature style.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>"Working with Ron Gilbert on Death By Scrolling is an honor," said Davide Pessach, CMO at MicroProse. "He’s brought his trademark humor, sharp design, and quirky world‑building to a completely new genre for him. We can’t wait for players to experience it."</p>
<p>Looks like it will have Native Linux support too.</p>

      <title>Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes announced and has me terribly excited</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes is a new strategy game from Dotemu and developer Alt Shift releasing in Q1 2026.</p>
<p>I cannot even begin to tell you how happy I am to see this. The modern Battlestar Galactica is easily my all-time favourite sci-fi series. If you haven't watched it – you should fix that.</p>
<p>There is already a Battlestar strategy game with Battlestar Galactica Deadlock, that's really quite good! But this Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes brings more of a roguelite experience that "pays tribute to the fundamental aspects of the franchise". Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZJsmoFJE-vs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/eb5914df03b41748eec99353af35d975.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZJsmoFJE-vs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Gosh, that music, what a perfect bit of marketing for anyone who is a Galactica fan. And recreating the intro from the series in the trailer for the game? That was clever. Gimme gimme gimme. My expectations weren't particularly high until watching the trailer, since it's a series I love so much but now I really am interested. A universe that just deserves to be expanded — there's a ridiculous amount of background lore that they can dive into.</p>
<p>From the press email announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In <em>Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes</em>, you command a fleet of spaceships fleeing humanity’s settled worlds, known as the Twelve Colonies. You must escape annihilation by the Cylons, a sentient robotic species that has turned against its human creators. The only hope of survival lies in reaching the mighty ship known as the Battlestar Galactica, but enduring the Cylons attack while preventing political dissent or in-fleet disputes from dividing your forces will test your ability to manage multiple crises at once – including identifying imposters that may already be among your ranks.</p>
<p>Every difficult choice made in <em>Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes</em> brings consequences, and each run varies in its challenges. Encounter planets and galactic points of interest, decide whether to spend precious resources addressing incidents within your fleet or upgrading your forces, and make the most of your crew’s time while preparing for assault; enemy Cylon ships will close in with each action and turn you take.</p>
<p>Once the deadly Cylons make contact with your forces, a battle begins. True to the franchise’s theme of escaping an overwhelming enemy, <em>Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes</em> features innovative core combat gameplay centered around a simple but key concept of survival: “resist until you can jump.” Deploy fighters from your hangars and direct them in real-time combat scenarios to dispatch the Cylons, minimizing damage to your central ship while wielding its onboard defenses against your gravest threats. Endure until you can flee to another sector of the galaxy, choosing your destination (and potential rewards) based on your most dire needs.</p>
<p>Each run in <em>Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes</em> offers new lessons as you adapt to defy your brutal odds of survival, and your tactical options broaden as you unlock additional squadrons, weapons and traits as well as meta upgrades to benefit future runs. Make decisions that meaningfully alter your fleet’s fate, lead your fighters through high-risk battles, and jump to new sectors before the Cylons turn your ships into astral debris. With humanity’s haven in the Twelve Colonies now uninhabitable, your steadfast tactical leadership is your crew’s only hope of surviving the journey to humankind’s last hope, the Battlestar Galactica. So say we all.</p>

      <title>Competitive vehicle shooter World of Tanks: HEAT announced with Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A competitive multiplayer game announced with Steam Deck support right away? Not something we see often! World of Tanks: HEAT has me cautiously interested.</p>
<p>It's from Wargaming Group Limited so it's going to be another free to play live service game full of micro-transactions, because of course it is. Hopefully at least it goes better than <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/steel-hunters-is-another-live-service-casualty-as-its-shutting-down/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">STEEL HUNTERS which they're shutting down</a>, let's see how long this one lives. To be fair, Wargaming's other games are pretty popular.</p>
<p>Anyway, I thought it was still pretty neat to see Steam Deck mentioned directly along with other platforms at the end of the trailer. The trailer which, while in-engine, is <em>not</em> actual gameplay. So it's about as useful as glass hammer in terms of getting even the slightest idea if it looks fun or not.</p>

<p>They claim it will have no pay to win, hopefully they actually stick by that. More from their announcement:</p>

      <title>SCS Software have next-gen trucking competition with Road Kings from Saber Interactive</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>When you think of a trucking sim you probably think American Truck Simulator and Euro Truck Simulator 2 but here comes some big competition with Road Kings.</p>
<p>Announced by Saber Interactive and Focus Entertainment, Road Kings invites players to take the driver’s seat of a 40-ton semi in a realistic simulation, and deliver goods across the vast and vibrant landscapes of the American South.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-DgAnfPjijY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dca509b5d97c4835ad56e6009788df87.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-DgAnfPjijY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release: </p>
<p>“We are thrilled to start on another exciting journey with our longtime partner Saber Interactive,” says John Bert, Managing Director at Focus Entertainment Publishing. “Road Kings is a project that truly combines Saber’s technical expertise with Focus Entertainment’s passion for immersive simulation experiences. Together, we're aiming to deliver a deeper gameplay experience and a more dynamic adventure for players. We can’t wait for fans to get behind the wheel and discover everything this new title has to offer.”</p>
<p>"As a native Floridian, it is awesome to see parts of my home state recreated in Road Kings. ​ I spent hundreds of hours on those roads as a kid and now we are bringing them to life in a game that creates a new category in the simulation space. ​I am so happy to be a part of this journey and personally loved playing the game." said Matthew Karch, Saber CEO.</p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take the wheel of a 40-ton semi, hauling cargo across the coastal plains of the American South. Manage multiple jobs, trailers, and routes, from busy Jacksonville to the shady streets of historic Savannah.</p>
<p>Starting as a rookie driver, encounter cunning rivals, helpful allies, dangerous weather, and treacherous roads as you take on long-haul deliveries to carve out a reputation as a veteran owner-operator in <em>Road Kings' </em>immersive world.</p>
<p><strong>Grow your reputation, push through dangerous situations, face down rivals, and take on long-haul deliveries in a living, reactive world.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Take control of your truck in a next-gen simulation, where every aspect matters, from weight, wear, brakes, torque, tires, and transmissions, to dynamic weather and road surfaces. Drive long distances in faithfully recreated, customizable branded trucks.</li>
<li>Dive into a changing world, where a ruthless corporation is expanding across the South, threatening catastrophe in the name of profit. When disaster strikes, only you can make it through. Rescue communities, deliver critical supplies, and prove that out on the road, a helping hand can make all the difference.</li>
<li>Make your own Road Kings story by earning reputation with drivers, dispatchers, and agencies. Choose a path to success by diversifying clients, or become the star vendor for just a few. Go further with asynchronous multiplayer: join or create a company, and climb the global leaderboards.</li>
<li>Hit the open road, traveling through breathtaking landscapes inspired by the real-life Florida-Georgia border. Navigate interstates with road signs, mind your diesel, watch for troopers, and follow service regulations, as cutting corners can hit your wallet, your clocks, and your reputation.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 launches October 21 but you have to pay extra for all the content</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 from Paradox finally has a release date with October 21, but it gets expensive if you want all the content.</p>
<p>Paradox games have become a bit of a meme on the level of DLC included, but with Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 they're pushing it further. There's three different editions of the game, the one with all of the actual content at release is a surprising £74.99. That's because, for some reason, they've separated two clans into a DLC which they've put into the "Premium Edition".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="TrAVDT7maJE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2b069870430fdaa4b694b9afbb6c8332.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/TrAVDT7maJE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it from the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 players will experience the game's narrative through two alternating playable characters: Elder vampire Phyre and Malkavian detective Fabien. After centuries of torpor, a deep state of vampiric slumber, Phyre awakens in modern-day Seattle with a mysterious mark that has locked away their Elder abilities and Fabien’s voice echoing in their head. As Phyre, players meet the city’s ruling Kindred vampires, each with their own motivations, and uncover Seattle’s dark secrets while reclaiming their lost vampiric powers.</p>
<p>Between nights, as Phyre rests, dreams and voices from Fabien's past take hold. Emerging as Fabien, players enter a neo-noir 1920s Seattle and use his Malkavian abilities to unravel the mystery behind his murder. Solving the case proves challenging, as Fabien's fractured perception of reality, a trait of his Malkavian blood, makes it difficult to distinguish fact from fiction. </p>
<p>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 is the successor to the cult-classic Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines (2004). Bloodlines 2 plunges players into Seattle's dark underbelly, where vampires struggle for survival and supremacy. Players meet compelling characters, navigate complex political relationships, stalk the city streets for prey, and engage in intense combat while balancing their thirst for mortal blood. </p>
<p>The base game includes four clans, each with its own distinct playstyles, outfits, and Disciplines: the rebellious Brujah, blood sorcery masters Tremere, justice-driven Banu Haqim, and the persuasive Ventrue. Players must remain mindful of their surroundings or risk breaking the Masquerade – the absolute law of secrecy that keeps vampire society hidden from humanity.</p>

      <title>Europa Universalis V set to release November 4</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Europa Universalis V from Paradox Interactive now has a confirmed release date for November 4.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/europa-universalis-v-from-paradox-will-only-support-windows-no-linux-or-macos-this-time/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">As confirmed previously</a> though, Paradox have dumped both Native Linux and macOS support as they're now just focusing on Windows. Hopefully their latest engine will work well in Proton so at least Linux gamers won't entirely miss out on the latest grand-strategy game.</p>
<p>From the press release: "Developed by the Barcelona-based Paradox Tinto under the direction of Paradox co-founder Johan Andersson, Europa Universalis V is a continuation of the series’ record of deep, quality strategy gaming, but also a major departure from the previous titles. The new game moves further from the game’s boardgame roots, and embraces population simulator models that have been explored in other Paradox games."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nP59vpuEJx8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2369c69de56c60b21597a52d7a44540b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nP59vpuEJx8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>New “pop” based system: </strong>A region’s population is reflected by pop units, varying in culture, religion, and social position. A prosperous society will see the population grow, while plague and war can prove costly to the core of your game.</li>
<li><strong>Earliest Starting Date in Europa Universalis history,</strong> beginning with the world of 1337. The French and English are about to start the Hundred Years’ War, the Yuan dynasty thrives in China, and the Black Death has yet to happen. Guide a nation through 500 years of history, written by your decisions.</li>
<li><strong>The Biggest Paradox Map</strong> ever uses a more accurate projection of the globe and small province units. This means greater fidelity to the historical world that Europa Universalis V represents and more variety in the strategies available to the player.</li>
<li><strong>Deeper Economic System</strong> including multiple goods and resources in each province. Resources can be fed into a production system, creating key goods for your society or for trade in regional and global markets.</li>
<li><strong>Expanded Research Game:</strong> Unlock new technologies and ideas across diplomatic, administrative and military realms. Progress along each research branch will allow new weapons, new industries, and new ways to organize your realm.</li>
<li><strong>Detailed Government System:</strong> Give tasks to your cabinet advisors to ease your rule, adopt new laws and national characteristics, and keep the factions of your nation in line by doling out privileges to various Estates.</li>
<li><strong>New Military System</strong> that draws soldiers from your population. Raise the levies and watch commerce grind to a halt, or hire mercenaries to fill your ranks. Slowly develop a professional standing army and organize your battlefield posture as you fight for territory and glory.</li>
<li><strong>And more:</strong> Historical situations to immerse you in real world events, multiple religions and government types, greater importance of characters and dynastic relationships, and dramatic world changing events.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Woolhaven expansion announced for Cult of the Lamb</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gimme! I know a good few people who will be terribly excited for the announced Woolhaven expansion for Cult of the Lamb. Set to arrive in "early 2026" it's a big one too.</p>
<p>The base game works great on Desktop Linux and is Steam Deck Verified. I've put a lot of hours in and can easily recommend it. Absolutely incredible style so I'm quite hyped for this expansion! You'll need to have played a lot of it to access the expansion, as it's only available near the end.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EehS0AGcLkc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b4f7a95dc21d4941b0dd6f6bde13150d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EehS0AGcLkc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Expansion Details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Winter descends, and a long-silenced deity stirs beneath the snow.<br/>
<br/>
Yngya, the forgotten God of the lambs, summons you to restore the flock and reclaim what time has erased. But as you breathe life into what long passed, a creeping Rot awakens, spreading corruption through the sacred mountain the lambs once called home…<br/>
<br/>
Not all who tread this peak come seeking redemption. Upon the frozen summit, a wolf prowls — his pack hungers for war with the covetous Gods. Deep within the hidden caverns, a shadowy figure waits, blade honed and patience fraying. Restless spirits drift along the ridges, each bound by former sins. The past was buried for good reason — will you unearth it, or will it consume you?<br/>
<br/>
That which was sacred now rots, and nothing is as it seems. Last of the lambs, Woolhaven’s fate rests in your hooves.</p>
<ul>
<li>Return the lost souls of Woolhaven to their spiritual home and learn the long-forgotten history of lambkind. Rebuild the fallen town to its former glory and reclaim the mountain to restore the depleted power of Yngya, the forgotten God of the lambs. But beware: there is always a price to be paid.</li>
<li>Endure harsh weather, including blizzards and freezing temperatures, that threaten your Cult’s survival. Build new structures to keep your loyal followers warm and protect them from frostbite and famine.</li>
<li>Unlock ranching at your Cult base and breed rare animals that provide wool, warmth, and when times are particularly desperate, precious meat. Tame, ride, and let your followers take care of these majestic creatures.</li>
<li>Venture into a new realm battered by bitter storms, crawling with creatures corrupted with the Rot lurking beneath the snow. Battle through two vast new dungeons, where the echoes of the past refuse to rest.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Dune: Awakening is now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After Funcom have patched Dune: Awakening quite a few times since release, the experience on Steam Deck is now good enough that it's been Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Easily one of the best MMOs released in a long time, I've been having a seriously good time with it, although it's a huge time sink. The <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/dune-awakening-is-out-now-and-works-well-on-linux-desktop-but-rough-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">initial release worked great on Desktop Linux</a> but was just a little rough on Steam Deck. Seems now though Valve felt the issues it had that kept it to a Playable rating have improved enough.</p>
<p>As of August 18th, it's Steam Deck Verified with Proton 9.0-4. The developers also put up an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1172710/announcements/detail/515218419125060464" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> for the change on Steam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Greetings Sleepers, </p>
<p>We’re excited to announce that Dune: Awakening is now fully Steam Deck verified! </p>
<p>Until now, it has been in the Playable category, but after some tweaks, it now meets all of Valve’s requirements to be a smooth experience on the Deck: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All functionality is accessible when using the default controller configuration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This game shows Steam Deck controller icons </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In-game interface text is legible on Steam Deck</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This game’s default graphics configuration performs well on Steam Deck </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So put some Dune in your Deck and bring a little spice wherever you go. </p>
<p>Thank you all so much for your support as the team continues to work on improvements. Any issues you report using the in-game tool and feedback you leave across all our channels is massively appreciated! We look forward to sharing more details about all the new content we have in store for Dune: Awakening. </p>

      <title>Hollow Knight: Silksong &#39;special announcement&#39; coming August 21</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A special announcement from Team Cherry has been revealed for Hollow Knight: Silksong.</p>
<p>They've put up a video on YouTube that will premier at 2:30pm UTC / 3:30pm BST on August 21st. We don't know exactly what it will be for though, so speculation across social media is already going wild about it. This could just be a fresh proper gameplay trailer, a release date announcement or perhaps they might even surprise us all with a direct release along with the video (we can dream right?).</p>
<p>You'll be able to watch it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGeJwsUP9c" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">YouTube</a> or directly below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6XGeJwsUP9c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cb608bc050d35de02b488a43c81c81b3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6XGeJwsUP9c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I continue to be amazed by just how wild the wait is for Hollow Knight: Silksong. There's not many times I've seen this kind of hype for a game in my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/happy-birthday-gamingonlinux-16-years-today/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">16 years</a> doing this. The pressure that Team Cherry are feeling must be unimaginable. Will it live up to expectations? </p>

      <title>HELLDIVERS 2 x Halo: ODST crossover arrives on August 26</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Okay fine, I'll load HELLDIVERS 2 up again. I definitely don't want to miss the new HELLDIVERS 2 x HALO: ODST Legendary Warbond.</p>
<p>It arrives on August 26th bringing with it armour and weapons from the Halo series. Since it's a Warbond, it does need an extra purchase using in-game currency. But, to the credit of Arrowhead Game Studios, they have one of the best battle pass styled systems in any game I've ever played. You can buy up any Warbond, and then progress through them at your own pace as they don't vanish.</p>
<p>Here's what's in it:</p>

      <title>Valve continue building up their new game Deadlock with a big update with six new heroes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve developers are still working on their upcoming game Deadlock, a third-person MOBA and the latest update is a pretty big one.</p>
<p>There's still no word on a release date, likely as they had to announce it earlier than they wanted to due to all the repeated leaks but work is ongoing on it regularly. You also still need to be invited by someone else with access. Despite all that, it has been seeing over 10,000 concurrent players regularly. </p>
<p>This new update adds in six new heroes, although Valve are doing a staggered release of each with a new one unlocking each day over the week.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3109303521755607306gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>A big new addition is also The Hideout. Giving you a private area to mess about in while you're waiting on a match. You can invite friends to yours or join others, and Valve said it will provide "future opportunities for personalization, achievements, and events".</p>
<p>This Hideout gives you access to various game functions along with a practice range to test movement and abilities without needing to load into the Sandbox.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3622847471755607911gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3622847471755607911gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9396936861755607921gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9396936861755607921gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Valve also updated the game map with "various visual improvements and lighting changes" and promises "a lot more map improvements planned in upcoming updates". </p>

      <title>Steampunk auto-shooter Airships: Lost Flotilla gets a big free content update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Airships: Lost Flotilla is a really good auto-shooter taking elements from survivor-like bullet hells and it just had a big free content expansion. It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Like other games inspired by the mechanics from Vampire Survivors, you pick a character (in this case, a ship) and go through waves of enemies while you keep upgrading. Airships: Lost Flotilla is one of the more unique in the list though with the path progression system where you pick different nodes, each a different location to fight through with unique bonuses to acquire.</p>
<p>The latest update adds in six new airships to pilot, five new enemy factions with their own unique set of enemies to shoot down, lots of new weapons and new captains to pick to mixup your play-through. Check out the update trailer:</p>

      <title>Webcam-based head &amp; eye tracking app for gaming, LookPilot gets improved Linux compatibility</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>LookPilot continues being one of the most promising (and cheapest) ways to get 6DoF head &amp; eye tracking for gaming on Linux.</p>
<p>I covered it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/webcam-based-6dof-head-eye-tracking-app-lookpilot-released-on-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here on GamingOnLinux last week</a> when it released, since it has some really fun features to change the way you game. Since it's webcam-based, it's easy to get it up and running too without expensive dedicated hardware and no annoying driver issues.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hs-8CzalGIk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/62471e9f7661bab3efc09bc07cf003c3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hs-8CzalGIk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Across the weekend the developer released the "Linux Compatibility Update" with lots of improvements for the detection systems on Linux, and making the app easier to run:</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Protocol changes</h2>
<h3>Auto protocol</h3>
<ul>
<li>No manual bash script launch required anymore.</li>
<li>Faster game discovery.</li>
<li>Improved compatibility across games.</li>
<li>Replaced <strong>Game Process</strong> setting with <strong>Wine Prefix</strong> setting.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Freetrack protocol</h3>
<ul>
<li>Improved compatibility across games.</li>
<li>Renamed <strong>freetrack (Proton)</strong> → <strong>freetrack (Wine)</strong>.</li>
<li>For <strong>Other</strong> launcher type, changed <strong>Tool Path</strong> setting → <strong>Wine Executable</strong> setting.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed: visualization cube not showing for some users.</li>
<li>Fixed: auto protocol JSON decode error.</li>
<li>Fixed: app crash on resize on Linux.</li>
<li>Bug reports now include more comprehensive logs.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They also said the demo version has been extended to 14 days to give you more time to test it and report any issues.</p>
<p>Wonderful to see apps like this available for Linux systems.</p>

      <title>Puzzle colony builder AUTARKIS looks great with a demo up and releases September 1</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AUTARKIS is an upcoming puzzle colony builder from developer rockingprojects. It's all about building mini colonies, and protecting them from catastrophes.</p>
<p>Love the whole setup and style on this one, looks like a really fun idea to play through. You can try it yourself too, as ahead of the September 1st release there is a demo available on the Steam page. The idea here is that you're searching for lost parts of your spaceship, the AUTARKIS. Building across multiple island-style settlements at the same time with portals to supply between them, it has some clever ideas but there's plenty of danger too.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Mm_6ggHYEVw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/52a679f341184d6fc3d86f553626b482.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Mm_6ggHYEVw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Tactical Colony Layout - When your settlers land on a planet, they will find a harsh environment. Each building depends on its neighbours. Think carefully about the most efficient way to build your colony.</li>
<li>Running Multiple Colonies at the Same Time - Advanced portal technology allows you to manage multiple colonies at once. Explore new sectors of a planet to find lost ship parts. However, sometimes it might be necessary to abandon one of your settlements.</li>
<li>Surviving Against All Odds - Life on an alien planet is unforgiving. Your colony may face meteor showers, toxic clouds, floods or even the destruction of an entire sector. At worst, you will have to launch a second settlement expedition. Failure is part of the game.</li>
<li>Adapting to Varied Environments - You will establish colonies on various planets. Each with different conditions. Build in an Earth-like environment, among giant mushrooms or on windy desert plains.</li>
<li>The Journey Back to AUTARKIS - The ultimate goal of every settlement expedition is to return to the mothership AUTARKIS. Ideally with the ship components you are looking for, but of course the lives of your settlers are your first priority.</li>
</ul>

      <title>GeForce NOW gets Blackwell GPUs, install to play games, a Steam Deck upgrade and Discord integration</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA GeForce NOW is set for some huge upgrades with GeForce RTX 5080-powered servers, a new way to play games and the Steam Deck gets a boost too.</p>
<p>This will add in DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Generation, which they said will allow up to 5K streaming at 120FPS. Plus support for up to 360FPS at 1080p with NVIDIA Reflex. There's also a new "Cinematic-Quality Streaming (CQS) mode" that uses a "host of technological advancements to significantly improve image quality".</p>
<p>More about the CQS mode:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Cinematic-Quality Streaming</strong><br/>
Members will experience a noticeable leap in graphics fidelity with CQS for the highest-quality visual experiences in the cloud. CQS features a suite of technologies powered by the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture, delivering:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stunning Color Accuracy:</strong> Support for the YUV color model with 4:4:4 chroma sampling and 10-bit high dynamic range enables true-to-life visuals with richer colors, sharper edges and deeper contrast — ideal for games with detailed text and intricate backgrounds, such as with lush foliage and rich greenery.</li>
<li><strong>Supersmooth Streaming:</strong> Advanced AV1 encoders offer seamless adaptation to changing network speeds, ensuring uninterrupted play.</li>
<li><strong>Crystal-Clear Graphics: </strong>New heads-up display sharpness and AI-powered video filters, available on select games, keep on-screen text crisp and action scenes free from blur or noise, even during fast-paced games.</li>
<li><strong>Optimized for Every Screen:</strong> New automatic detection of a laptop’s display resolution delivers the highest possible streaming quality — especially on laptops with high dots per inch, or DPI.</li>
<li><strong>Blazing-Fast Bitrates: </strong>With up to 100 Mbps streaming, every detail stays sharp, so gamers can tap into today’s fastest home internet connections.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For the Steam Deck, NVIDIA said they're going to be bumped up the FPS from 60 to 90 with the release of the Blackwell servers when using the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-get-geforce-now-on-steam-deck-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official Steam Deck app</a>.</p>
<p>They also announced Install-to-Play games, which allows you to install games that have opted into supporting NVIDIA GeForce NOW but don't yet have a dedicated slot for them like other games, which will give you around double the games you can use with GeForce NOW. Ultimate and Performance members get 100GB of "single-session cloud storage" for this (which is wiped when you leave) but there's also an option for persistent storage of "200GB for $2.99 per month, 500GB for $4.99 per month and 1TB for $7.99 per month".</p>
<p>NVIDIA are also teaming up with Discord and Epic Games, to instantly load up games on Discord with nothing extra needed powered by GeForce NOW. Fortnite being the first game that will be added in this limited-time trial that will be shown behind closed doors at Gamescom. Discord had their own <a href="https://discord.com/blog/transforming-game-discovery-with-instant-play-experiences-on-discord" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on this too.</p>

      <title>Nintendo 64 emulator gopher64 recently added save state slots and netplay cloud servers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If Nintendo 64 is your thing, keep an eye on the gopher64 emulator which is steadily adding in more features and has Linux support.</p>
<p>This is from the same main developer that worked on <a href="https://github.com/simple64/simple64" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">simple64</a>, which was a originally started as a fork of Mupen64Plus. The simple64 project is no longer developed and the GitHub page archived, with the developer moving onto creating and maintaining gopher64.</p>
<p>Writing in the GitHub Discussions to give a little more detail on it the developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not based on GLideN64 at all. For graphics (RDP) it uses parallel-rdp (<a href="https://github.com/Themaister/parallel-rdp" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/Themaister/parallel-rdp</a>). I am not the author of parallel-rdp, but it is used in a number of N64 emulators for low-level RDP emulation.</p>
<p>For the rest, it is a combination of original research, mupen64plus, and ares. For example, the CPU interpreter is original, it is not based on mupen64plus or ares. The cache emulation also works differently from both of those emulators. The RSP opcodes are mostly taken from ares, but not the interaction between the RSP/CPU.</p>
<p>Basically, for each component, I decided whether mupen64plus or ares had a really good implementation that I couldn't really improve on. If not, I wrote something new. Sometimes it is mostly taken from another emulator, but with some of my own improvements, etc... whatever worked best for each component of the emulator.</p>
<p>It also contains some features that aren't found in mupen64plus or ares, for example, SummerCart64/SD card emulation, CPU overclocking, Japanese VRU support, etc..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over the last few weeks two new releases went up with these additions:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Save state slots are supported. Press Alt+0-9 to change which save state you are saving/loading from.</li>
<li>On-screen messages (no more robotic Scottish voice). These will let you know when you change your controller pak, save or load a state, when cheats are enabled, etc..</li>
<li>Small improvements to the controller selection dropdowns.</li>
<li>Update to latest versions of Rust and SDL.</li>
<li>Use nearest filtering for final image rendering (results in a sharper image).</li>
<li><strong>On-demand netplay cloud servers</strong>. Previously, there were 3 always-running netplay servers (US West, US East, and Europe). Now, you can create a netplay server across many different regions (as of now, there are 12 regions, please let me know if you would like one that isn't there today).
	<ul>
<li>This works by creating the server on demand when you request it. This means that when you create a server, it will take about 20-30 seconds for it to complete. This is the time it takes to provision the server.</li>
<li>There is also now a unified session browser. All games from across all regions are shown in the "Join Session" window.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

      <title>Valve announce language-specific user review scores for Steam games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have carefully tweaked the user review system for Steam games, to now include language-specific user review scores.</p>
<p>This new system is on by default for all Steam users, however Valve said they realise changes will bring scrutiny and so there is a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/account/preferences/#review_score_preferences" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">dedicated setting</a> to disable it. If you do disable it, your Steam account will go back to seeing the overall review score from <em>all</em> languages posting Steam reviews.</p>
<p>Why have they done this? As Valve explained, they've grown a lot into having a massive global presence from users from all difference regions. Some games may have translation issues, specific cultural references and so on. Valve feel this language-based review score will help to capture these issues and that "Calculating a language-specific review score means that we can better distil the sentiment of these different groups of customers, and in doing so, better serve potential customers that belong to those groups".</p>
<p>Keeping it all rather transparent, there's a whole new language breakdown section for Steam reviews you can click to open. At the top of the reviews section is this now:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3636359071755538170gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>And when you open the language breakdown you'll get to see the overall score as well:</p>

      <title>Last Epoch Season 3 will work better on Steam Deck and there&#39;s lots new coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're in need of an ARPG to play on Steam Deck / SteamOS or other handhelds, Last Epoch Season 3 could be the one for you. They've recently put up the full details of what's including, and there really is a lot coming that should hopefully be a big hit for Eleventh Hour Games.</p>
<p>For Steam Deck and other lower-end systems, performance should be improved by quite a lot. They've detailed how with the Season 3 update that lands August 21st, they've worked in texture streaming across the whole game to provide "reduced memory usage and improved loading times" and now the game "uses at least 25% less vram with full texture resolution enabled". For Steam Deck, they said bumping it up to the Medium preset is now possible.</p>
<p>There's quite a few other optimisations they've made including optimising memory allocation, a new graphics setting to control the amounts of lights emitted by visual effects, a fix for hitching seen in the game, various lighting adjustments to improve performance and the list goes on.</p>
<p>Controller / gamepad input has seen a few improvements too like stopping accidental movement if a panel is open, controller navigation for the chat window and other controller UI adjustments.</p>
<p>Perhaps most exciting though is the big new Rift Beasts feature, which they said is a bit like the Nemesis mechanic from Shadow of Mordor, but different enough that they won't fall afoul of the ridiculous patent that Warner Bros. have on it. Essentially, you go through a series of encounters and fight off special beasties and their evolved descendants. Sounds pretty awesome. </p>
<p>Check out their new nearly 14 minute overview video below:</p>

<p>You should take a look at <a href="https://forum.lastepoch.com/t/last-epoch-beneath-ancient-skies-patch-notes/78635" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the patch notes</a>, they're ridiculously long.</p>

      <title>Bioneers combines factory-building with organism simulation in a microworld</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bioneers will have you build up an organism on the micro-scale that mixes together elements of factory-building with organism simulation. Sounds like it could be a fun idea!</p>
<p>With you mixing various different types of cells including muscle, skin, fat, bones, nerves and more. You need to somehow connect them all up into creating functional living systems like digestive, respiratory and others. It's all about creation and then survival.</p>
<p>Check out the first trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8yeWumI7Tao"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dd7be609bf034fb64d5bb4b801aa1b10.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8yeWumI7Tao" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Unique gameplay</strong> that combines factory-building with organism simulation.<br/>
	Instead of buildings — cells, instead of conveyor belts — vessels, instead of enemies — viruses. The bigger your organism, the more powerful it becomes — but it also needs more resources to sustain itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Animations inspired by real biology.</strong><br/>
	All cell and system movements are based on behavioral models from living organisms, creating a vibrant and believable microworld.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A sandbox without limits.</strong><br/>
	Evolve as you wish: become an aggressive predator, a resilient symbiont, or a peaceful herbivore. Every choice affects your organism's evolutionary path.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Detailed customization.</strong><br/>
	Design your organism cell by cell, optimize systems, balance energy and resource consumption — you are the true creator of life.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Take command of a Cold War-era nuclear corvette in space with Deck &amp; Conn</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Publisher MicroProse revealed Deck &amp; Conn, a single-player turn-based tactics game that places players in command of a Cold War-era nuclear corvette — in space.</p>
<p>It's being developed by a new studio, FUNTIME ELECTRICS, from Elissa Black the co-creator of Objects in Space, Swords of Freeport, and Metrocide. Deck &amp; Conn is a homage to classics like the 1971 Star Trek mainframe game. I do love my space games and chunky retro graphics and all things Star Trek, so this looks like it was made for me.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="f10tfiqdDdw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3ff0a6f3cdedbc8e06fc46464765b14c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/f10tfiqdDdw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it from the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Deck and Conn, players must lead their crew through a relentless forever-war among the stars. Every patrol brings tough choices: respond to distress calls, capture or destroy enemy ships, upgrade your systems, and manage scarce resources — all while shaping the legacy of your vessel and crew.</p>
<p>Whether facing the branching challenges of a dynamic campaign or honing skills in standalone tactical scenarios, Deck and Conn demands precision, adaptability, and decisive leadership.</p>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Command a Cold War-inspired nuclear space corvette in a retro-futuristic sci-fi universe.</li>
<li>Turn-based tactical combat with limited resources and intricate system management.</li>
<li>Dynamic campaign with war patrols, ship upgrades, and crew promotions.</li>
<li>Standalone combat scenarios to master tactical fundamentals.</li>
<li>Capture or destroy enemy vessels to gain rewards and shape your ship’s reputation.</li>
<li>Hand-crafted pixel art inspired by early ’90s MicroProse classics.</li>
<li>Follow HQ orders and make high-stakes decisions in the endless war.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Jupiter Hell Classic is a &#39;demake of a remake of a roguelike unmake&#39; now on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A demake of a remake of a roguelike unmake. It's okay to be confused, but Jupiter Hell Classic is a cool roguelike now in Early Access on Steam. <em>Disclosure: the developer provided GamingOnLinux a key.</em></p>
<p>To clear things up a bit though, because initially it warped my brain too, here's what it all means. It's based on DRL (DoomRL / Doom the Roguelike) which had to change it's name when lawyers got involved, but updated for their newer world created with Jupiter Hell. I'm a sucker for Jupiter Hell, as it has one of the absolute slickest turn-based movement systems ever.</p>
<p>It's not just the classic DRL updated for the Jupiter Hell universe though, they're adding in all sorts of upgrades.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What to expect from Jupiter Hell Classic:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Classic, unforgiving, top-down, grid-based roguelike gameplay.</li>
<li>Fast and fluid ranged based tactical combat.</li>
<li>Control via keyboard only, mouse + keyboard or gamepad.</li>
<li>Diagonal movement along movement based tactics.</li>
<li>Environmental destruction and interaction.</li>
<li>4 episodes, almost 200 items, 25+ enemies.</li>
<li>30+ crafting assemblies, 3 classes with 5 master traits each (subclasses).</li>
<li>Steam Workshop support for all your nostalgia modding needs!</li>
</ul>

<p>Unlike the original, this does <em>not</em> have a Native Linux version. Speaking with the developer about it, they told me they had a "horrible experience with JH - where the libc situation broke our Linux build, and the Steam Deck build at the same time during a crucial time for JH" and that there "was there was no way to make Steam Deck run on Proton if there was a Linux version present, so we had to temporarily nuke it, and even that didn't help".</p>
<p>They're talking about Valve's Steam Deck verification system, which forcibly picks either the Native Linux build or the Windows build to run through Proton. Game developers don't get a choice in that. And so they didn't want to risk breakages due to Native Linux dependencies for this launch "especially that it flawlessly runs on Proton on the Deck".</p>

      <title>Become a chaotic vacuum in the physics-based action-adventure ACUVAC</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I couldn't help but giggle a fair bit at the actual full name - ACUVAC: A Suck and Blow Adventure. Yes, that's really the name of this one. A bit unfortunate perhaps, or is my mind just terrible? It's not just me right?</p>
<p>Releasing soon on August 20th, there's also a demo available you can try right now. Here's a little more about it: "Take control of ACUVAC, a physics-driven canister vacuum with a mind of its own, in a destructive cleaning adventure. Use your hose to suck up, blow away, and manipulate the world around you in unexpected ways. Uncover, clean, and conquer every corner of this whimsical, robot-run world where anything goes, and chaos is all part of the fun!"</p>
<p>Check out the release date trailer below:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>WHAT YOU'LL DO:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>CLEAN:</strong><br/>
	Vacuum trash, smash objects, and creatively interact with environments to complete objectives. Be the overachiever and super-clean the level, clearing out every object in sight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>COLLECT:</strong><br/>
	Every unique object collected gets added to your own residence (Yes, <u>ACUVAC has their own house!</u>) Unlock new levels, arcade machines, and quirky cosmetics by earning medals and discovering hidden collectibles.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>CONQUER:</strong><br/>
	Master every challenge across varied sandbox levels. Take on unique tasks, unlock loads of special bonus levels, and compete in local-multiplayer modes. There's plenty of challenge and lots of different surprises to uncover!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Had to chuckle at the first reply to the developer on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/xenosage.bsky.social/post/3lwh6vrqdgk2k" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> as well, on how you're basically the Noo-Noo from Teletubbies. A classic British young kids TV show that was just — <em>weird</em>. As for the game, looks like some quality physics fun to be had with this one. I look forward to swinging my hose around.</p>

      <title>LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes gets Steam Deck Verified and Cloud Saves</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>TT Games pushed out a small update for LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes and managed to get it Steam Deck Verified in the process.</p>
<p>The actual <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/213330/announcements/detail/668340807104725171" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> doesn't go into any specifics on what's changed, it just notes the update "was to get this title Steam Deck verified" and that they've also enabled Cloud Saves now too. Great to see for this classic from 2012, a nice surprise to see them go back to tweak it. Goes to show how important the Steam Deck can be!</p>

      <title>THE FINALS should be fixed again with the latest Proton Experimental updates</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Thankfully the Proton coders for Valve have managed to work quickly to get THE FINALS working on Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/the-finals-broken-on-linux-again/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">after it broke again</a>.</p>
<p>At least this time around it really wasn't the developer blocking anything, just a case Proton needing more tweaks to get a reasonably popular online shooter working again.</p>
<p>Writing on the official GitHub developer Paul Gofman <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/7317#issuecomment-3192760744" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">wrote</a> that it "should hopefully be solved (or improved)" with Proton Experimental when using the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bleeding-edge Beta</a> branch for it. Many reports on there and in THE FINALS' Discord show it does indeed fix the issue of the game kicking you out of matches.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16138137191755524366gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat page was updated</a> to note this.</p>
<p>Likely the next proper update to Proton Experimental directly will have the fix without the need for a Beta. But that could be a few days, a week or longer.</p>

      <title>SlaveDriver Engine for the Sega Saturn classic shooter PowerSlave gets open sourced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another win for game preservation and open source, with the release of the SlaveDriver Engine for Sega Saturn classic shooter PowerSlave. Originally released in 1996, there were also versions for PlayStation and MS-DOS. NightDive also made a modern port with PowerSlave Exhumed.</p>
<p>The source code is <a href="https://github.com/Lobotomy-Software/SlaveDriver-Engine" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">now on GitHub</a> (and the <a href="https://archive.org/details/slavedriver-engine" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Internet Archive</a>) under the GPL license. It's only the code, so you need to supply the data from the game to work with it.</p>
<p>Thanks to this anyone can now dive in and see how the game was made, expand it, port it to other systems and all sorts. Great news for the boomer shooter community and just gaming history.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5764355371755523785gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I wish more developers would do this for their classic games.</p>

      <title>LEGO Voyagers looks super sweet and arrives for co-op play on September 15</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Light Brick Studio and Annapurna Interactive have announced that LEGO Voyagers will arrive for your next co-op session on September 15th. This looks like possibly the cutest LEGO game yet.</p>
<p>Now this I'm going to have to get, once me and my gaming partner get through our current session of It Takes Two. I really do love how this offers up both local and online co-op, and if you're playing at a distance online only one of you needs to own it with the Friend Pass system — excellent stuff.</p>
<p>Check out the short new trailer that arrived with the release date news:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1J4Zq-A6FAw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b90a59ccdbb5f102486dd9c4e4dc22e7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1J4Zq-A6FAw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the makers of LEGO® Builder's Journey comes a new 2-player co-op adventure about friendship and play. When two friends make it their mission to rescue an abandoned spaceship, they embark on a journey beyond their wildest dreams, ultimately learning the value of being connected.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Experience what it feels like to be a LEGO brick. Tumble, jump, snap together, and build your way through rich brick worlds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unravel a poetic, non verbal narrative, set in beautiful brick built environments, supported by an atmospheric soundtrack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cooperatively solve the game's many challenges and discover how two bricks are better than one. Play locally on the same screen, or online.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invite a friend to join your adventure for free with the Friend’s Pass. As long as one of you owns LEGO Voyagers, you can both play the full co-op experience together.</p>
</li>
</ul>

      <title>Rally Arcade Classics to expand with the Precision &amp; Chase update on September 9</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need more rally games? Rally Arcade Classics looks like a good one and it's expanding with a free update on September 9th.</p>
<p>The game currently offers 44 iconic cars from different eras (70's, 80's and 90's) with a license-based progression system, so you have to train your driving skills to unlock different modes before driving legendary cars. This is not a standard arcade rally racer though, with more physics to provide something in between arcade and pro rally games. The Precision &amp; Chase will bring with it a new manual transmission mode, a revamped speedometer and a new online friends list with high scores.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CwYAgcSMzWA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ab275a77681f77cbc88a055eaf4d8b8c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CwYAgcSMzWA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“We devoted two hard years to create this game with a passionate team and one goal: to combine elements from different eras of racing games and keep an accessible experience for both veteran and new fans of the genre” - Salvador Casamiquela, co-founder at NETK2GAMES.</p>
<p>It actually has a Native Linux version, but last I checked it was tweaked specifically for the Steam Deck, with no graphics options so it's all pre-set. You may want to use Proton to get access to everything properly. It's currently Steam Deck Verified with the Native Linux version.</p>

      <title>You&#39;ve built cities with people, beavers, on top of giant creatures - and now you&#39;ll do it with Crows</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Crowded was just announced as a new city-builder but it's all about nesting, since your people are Crows. Crowded is a crow city builder where you strategically design a nest-city to support and shelter your flock. Engineer, scavenge and explore your way to a self-sustaining society in the sky.</p>
<p>More about it: "Scavenge for delicious bugs and building materials, managing resources wisely so your feathered friends get what they need. Take flight and explore a landscape of lush forests and sprawling meadows, planting new trees to expand your territory. Strategically design your nest-city to support and shelter your adorable flock. Manipulate the wind itself to influence the environment and create a form of transportation. As you innovate, you’ll also discover new technologies to lead your flock to greatness."</p>
<p>Check out the announcement trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Nxb6ZeaFL9c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8668a7ce3ffb0d80b26b971925516165.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Nxb6ZeaFL9c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"We wanted our game to feel truly avian. So, we came up with a design philosophy we call Featherpunk," said Alex Grenus, one of the devs at Nestwork Games. "It focuses on the anatomy of crows and their abilities. And as city builder fans, we know how enjoyable it is to watch our tiny people, animals, cars, etc go about their lives. In German (to no one's surprise) there is even a word for it 'Wuselfaktor'. We also want this in our game, so our buildings feature a lot of open space to watch the crows, and if you look closely, you can find some cute details."</p>
<p>Love the idea behind this and really can't think of another like it. Can't wait to see more.</p>

      <title>Docked is the latest big machinery simulation game from Saber Interactive</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From the teams that gave us SnowRunner, RoadCraft and more is Docked, a new big machinery sim about rebuilding a dock in the wake of a devastating hurricane.</p>
<p>Operate heavy machinery and vehicles, restore and upgrade the port's capabilities, and continually take on new jobs to expand the business. Another sim game fully of busy-work, but hey you get to mess with huge machines which is fun to some of us? I don't really get why though. What is it about big heavy machinery that makes us enjoy oddly tedious work?</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SBguf_F3Yz4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e8aa76f45a456e2735d62bef1eeebdf7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SBguf_F3Yz4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You're the manager of Port Wake, and so you have to keep everything flowing to save the family business. This includes unloading huge cargo ships and establish various logistical chains and complete jobs to earn resources. No date is being given on when it might release so we'll just have to wait and see.</p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Port Wake Calls</strong>: From ship to crane to truck and beyond, every job is a vital piece of the business. Manage operations and vehicles, take on important contracts, and make high-priority cargo runs to fulfill your commitments. When wear and tear drags your equipment down, execute repairs under strict deadlines to keep the port growing.</li>
<li><strong>Operate Powerful Machinery</strong>: Take command of a fleet of realistic machines, expertly engineered with the raw power and precise handling to fulfill your contracts, from colossal ship-to-shore cranes to sturdy, heavy-duty tractors and more. Tighten ropes, position materials, optimize weight distribution, navigate delicate cargo with little margin for error, and gain a firsthand understanding of what it means to work a dock.</li>
<li><strong>Earn, Invest &amp; Expand</strong>: Revitalize Port Wake one crane at a time. Every job you take earns cash to invest in new and more powerful machinery. Sign contracts to create new logistical chains and build up resources, purchase lots to store vehicles, upgrade fuel and power supplies, and conquer new milestones to save and expand the family business.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Their previous sims worked well on Linux with Proton so I fully expect this to as well. If you on an AMD GPU that is, as it appears the most recent sim RoadCraft still has issues on NVIDIA.</p>

      <title>Vampire Survivors is getting an official board game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The smash-hit indie game Vampire Survivors is getting an official board game. Developer poncle have teamed up with Grey Fox Games for it but details are light.</p>
<p>As confirmed by poncle on their official <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vampire.poncle.games/post/3lwefnpkmr22c" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> account, there's not really any firm details on it other than a confirmation that it exists and it's coming to Kickstarter sometime in the Autumn. So at some point between September - December.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://promotion.greyfoxgames.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">official page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Select Your Survivor</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose from beloved characters to battle against creatures of the night.</li>
</ul>
<p>Face Endless Swarms</p>
<ul>
<li>Wave after wave of familiar enemies relentlessly spawn and threaten your survival.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlock and power up weapons and passives</p>
<ul>
<li>Use and evolve signature weapons to cut a path through the darkness in your quest for strength and experience</li>
</ul>
<p>Fear The Reaper...</p>
<ul>
<li>...because Red Death comes for us all.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm a total sucker for a good board game and I do love some Vampire Survivors, so even I'm tempted by this. Once we get a proper look at it anyway, more will be revealed when the Kickstarter launches.</p>

      <title>THE FINALS broken on Linux - again</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oh dear. A regular occurrence with THE FINALS after updates, as it's causing various problems with it kicking Linux players at the moment.</p>
<p>It might happen right away, it might take a few matches, but there's masses of reports from players on Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck seeing error screens. The developers at Embark Studios have confirmed in their Discord that they're aware, and they're working on the problem as they've reached out to Proton developers and Easy Anti-Cheat developers about it.</p>
<p>Embark developer tvandijck on their Security team made it <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1008696016318513243/1235610365098987621/1405822063725383731" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">clear</a> in their Discord that "I want to play on SteamDeck.. I am part of the security team, and so whatever we build... will work on steam deck" but hiccups like this will happen, since the Linux / Proton community is "less [than] 1% of our players".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13533832441755257149gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>So hopefully THE FINALS will be working properly again on Linux systems sometime soon but for now you'll have to sit tight and wait.</p>
<p>In my testing earlier it wouldn't even launch at all with Proton 9, but did run with Proton Experimental. At least until you see the issue where you get kicked.</p>
<p>Additionally, in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2073850/view/612045811444875471" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> for the 7.9 update on Steam, they confirmed Denuvo Anti Cheat is also in testing, with it potentially rolling out <em>next</em> season on Steam but with that "Compatibility with SteamDeck and Proton has been tested as well, and we are still committed to serving that part of our community".</p>

      <title>Steam is getting wider and more responsive store pages</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve are continuing their work to modernise more of Steam, and now we're finally getting bigger and more responsive store pages. It's currently only available in the Steam Beta, which is opt-in. It's not on the web just yet - app only. Once it's ready though, it will roll out everywhere.</p>
<p>Store pages have changed from 940px to be 1200px wide, and it's responsive so it will shrink back down. Most of that extra space went to the videos and description side, which has expanded by default to 780px wide. Giving you bigger videos, screenshots and more space for the full description to pull you in a bit more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15027163531755255111gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15027163531755255111gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>That's still a lot of space they could fill up with things, but the key in design is not to overload with information. At least now on wider monitors it doesn't look so ridiculously small.</p>
<p>Plus developers can now put up small videos inside their game descriptions. For a long time developers have been adding in GIFs, but their quality and sizing is pretty poor, so to help devs can now use MP4 or WebM clips. As part of this, Valve went back through all the GIFs developers uploaded (292,000 of them!) to swap them over to video files. The videos will auto-play just like GIFs, but they also now have a play/pause button on them.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1943332901755255216gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1943332901755255216gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Hitting pause on one clip currently pauses them all.</p>
<p>And of course, Valve just had to get into the argument of how to pronounce GIF didn't they. From the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/532106189043925406?snr=2___" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q. How do you pronounce GIF, with a hard G or a soft J?</strong></p>
<p>A. We on the Steam team are pretty split on how to pronounce it. Regardless of which way you are inclined, be prepared for some heated debates should you share your opinion on the internet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only correct way is with a hard G, as in Graphics, not Jraphics. Anything else just sounds wrong. It stands for <strong>G</strong>raphics Interchange Format after all doesn't it, and it's a hill I will plant my flag down and die on.</p>

      <title>Green Man Gaming to launch a charity bundle platform and expanding into the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Green Man Gaming recently announced they're evolving, with plans for a new charity bundle platform along with expanding into the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region.</p>
<p>Bundles can be pretty lucrative for stores, with Fanatical and Humble doing them constantly, so now they're going to get more competition.</p>
<p>GMG said in an <a href="https://www.greenmangaming.com/company/news/charity-bundle-announcement/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today we announced the launch of our brand <strong>new charity bundles platform</strong> - a bold step in our mission to make game discovery easier, and create new incremental revenue opportunities for developers and publishers, all while supporting charitable causes and doing something truly meaningful through <strong>gaming for good.</strong></p>
<p>Alongside this new initiative, we are also expanding into the <strong>Asia-Pacific (APAC) </strong>region to strengthen partnerships with local game developers and publishers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their first charity bundle is planned for October 2025 in support of SpecialEffect’s One Special Day, a charity that's truly worth supporting so a great one to start with. They'll have some good features for their bundles including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Guaranteed key delivery</strong>-  Every bundle purchase includes<strong> instant key fulfilment</strong></li>
<li><strong>Visible stock levels-</strong> Customers will see real-time stock availability before they buy</li>
<li><strong>Regional pricing-</strong> Making bundles more accessible to global audiences</li>
<li><strong>Charity first- </strong>Every bundle supports impactful causes, with a focus on local charities in key markets</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Humble Bundle could definitely learn from Fanatical and GMG here on those first two points, as they have repeating issues with keys going out of stock but purchases still happening.</p>
<p>“We have built these charity bundles to be a force of positivity in an industry which has seen difficult times,” said Paul Sulyok, Founder and CEO of Green Man Gaming. “We feel the opportunity to support gaming for good, while giving publishers and developers the tools to secure incremental revenue from their products, is a win-win the games industry needs right now.”</p>
<p>They're calling on developers, publishers and charities to get in touch to get involved.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental updated with fixes for The Crew Motorfest, Farlight 84 and more games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For August 14th Valve released another upgrade to Proton Experimental, bringing some more essential fixes for Windows games on Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Confused on the different Proton versions? Be sure to read the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux guide</a>. For games that have anti-cheat be sure to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check out our compatibility page</a>. This latest follows on from the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/proton-experimental-gets-fixes-for-dualsense-god-eater-resurrection-crysis-3-resident-evil-village-and-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">August 8th update</a> with even more improvements!</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">For the August 14th update noted to be now playable includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firefly Village</li>
<li>The Crew Motorfest</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">The other fixes and improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed long loading times in God Eater 2 Rage Burst.</li>
<li>Fixed Spark &amp; Kling crashing when idling on main menu.</li>
<li>Fixed multiplayer in Farlight 84.</li>
<li>Fixed Proton 10.0-2 regression that caused weird window behavior in RiME with non-native aspect ratios.</li>
<li>Fixed Proton 10 regressions:
	<ul>
<li>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land no longer fails to play cutscenes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Source: <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a></em></p>
<p>The Crew Motorfest is an interesting one since it uses BattlEye <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat</a>. Ubisoft seemed to have it enabled for Linux platforms at some point recently, but Proton was missing a few bits to get the game fully working which have now been added. Nice to see more games like it working!</p>

<p>Also nice to see Farlight 84 get fixed again too, so that's even more multiplayer games that continue working on Linux.</p>

      <title>Blackbird Interactive take back full ownership of Hardspace: Shipbreaker</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hardspace: Shipbreaker developer Blackbird Interactive have announced they've broken off from Focus Entertainment.</p>
<p>In an announcement they said they've reacquired full ownership over Hardspace: Shipbreaker. As a result, they've confirmed that multiple new Hardspace projects are in development but they're not going into any real specifics on it just yet. Hardspace: Shipbreaker itself is set for a small update to reflect the change</p>
<p>In a press release Rory McGuire, President and Chief Creative Officer at Blackbird Interactive said: "It is rare to have an IP that resonates so deeply with millions of players. So we are honored to have this opportunity to deepen and expand that connection through new games that explore the Hardspace universe. Shipbreaker also wouldn’t be what it is today without our friends at Focus Entertainment. We are eternally grateful for their partnership and hope to work with them again soon."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14129926061755250931gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The game runs great with Proton on Linux and is rated Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Clay-animated shoot &#39;em up Platypus Reclayed releases September 18</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Platypus Reclayed revives the classic 2002 claymation shooter for the next-generation. A demo is up now and it's releasing September 18th. I absolutely love everything about clay animation, and I have to say this looks great if you love a good shoot 'em up.</p>
<p>This reimagining of the cult classic arcade shooter Platypus takes everything that was great about the original game and updates it with a huge host of new features for the definitive edition of Platypus. Led by the original creator, Anthony Flack, along with a new team it's not just a simple remaster. They've completely revamped it from scratch with new models and artwork, updated gameplay and new content.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="w34Y8oSRqIY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e746f3c1347376d93d7cdb1108d92a2c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/w34Y8oSRqIY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"As the industry has shifted towards more complex, feature-rich, lengthier games, we wanted to go in the other direction: providing a one-button shmup that’s fun from the moment you pick it up!" said Anthony Flack, Lead Games Designer at Claymatic Games. "You don’t need to learn any complicated combos or absorb a bookish tutorial teaching how you can have fun later. Instead, you get right to the action. Platypus Reclayed is designed to be something you pick up for 20 minutes before bed or on your lunch break, but you enjoy every second of it!"</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Two-Player Simultaneous Action: Team up with a friend for double the fun!</li>
<li>Stunning Clay-Animated Graphics: Experience the beauty of clay-animation like never before with all-new high definition artwork.</li>
<li>Addictive, Exciting Gameplay: Get ready for heart-pounding action that will keep you on the edge of your seat.</li>
<li>The original <em>Platypus</em> soundtrack is back with even more officially licensed remixes of classic 1980s game tunes from our friends at C64audio.</li>
<li>Adjustable Difficulty Settings: Whether you're a novice or a seasoned pro, <em>Platypus</em> has a challenge for everyone.</li>
<li>Perfect for the Entire Family: Share the joy of <em>Platypus</em> with loved ones of all ages!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Inspired by classics like UFO: Enemy Unknown / XCOM - Archrebel Tactics gets MicroProse backing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Archrebel Tactics looks awesome if you're into challenging sci-fi strategy games, and now it has MicroProse backing it as publisher. Covered first <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/archrebel-tactics-is-a-wild-sci-fi-turn-based-strategy-game-inspired-by-rebelstar-and-x-com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here on GamingOnLinux back in June of 2024</a>, it still has an early demo up on the itch page which has a Linux version. It's not clear if it will continue the Native Linux version for the full Steam release, but will likely run with Proton if not.</p>
<p>It's a retro-inspired, turn-based sci-fi strategy game set on the dangerous colony world of Kaprical. Drawing direct inspiration from legendary classics like Rebelstar (1986) and UFO: Enemy Unknown, Archrebel Tactics brings back grid-based, action-point-limited warfare with modern design twists and layered campaign choices. In the game you rally a resistance force to combat a secretive totalitarian faction that has seized control of the colonies. Through tactical battles, strategic decision-making, and encounters with alien wildlife, players will shape the fate of the planet — or perish trying.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Z2H1liSbVTo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/229039085445f8b0918f0400a436130f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Z2H1liSbVTo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer mentioned how progress has been steadily ongoing since 2021 when they quit their job to work full time on it, but "after three years of intense work, my funds were nearly depleted, and a few ill-timed real-life events forced me to scale back to part-time development". Thankfully, MicroProse are financially backing it as publisher now so work continues towards release.</p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Classic Turn-Based Combat – Grid-based battles with an action-point system inspired by Laser Squad and early X-COM, featuring expanded functionality such as multi-selection.</li>
<li>Travel Mode Mechanics – The classic action-point system is enhanced with a travel mode that lets units cover large portions of terrain in a single turn, greatly improving the pace on larger maps.</li>
<li>Player-Driven Campaign – Choose your mission order, face persistent consequences, and experience branching outcomes. Align with one of three factions to gain their unique benefits.</li>
<li>Unit Customization &amp; Progression – Expand your squad into a platoon, recruit new units, and construct, build, or even capture droids to fight at your side. Unlock and upgrade gear, and plan the class type and progression for each human unit.</li>
<li>Partially Procedural Missions – No two battles are the same. Includes a standalone mission generator and a mission editor for endless replay value.</li>
<li>Emphasis on Environment Destructibility – While enemy compounds have indestructible walls, the terrain itself is largely destructible. Use this to your advantage.</li>
<li>Alien Threats – Deal with both hostile factions and the feral wildlife of Kaprical, including massive native behemoths and something else that has descended upon the colony.</li>
<li>Retro Aesthetic, Modern Systems – Pixel-art visuals enhanced by bone-based animation, particles, and shaders.</li>
</ul>

      <title>With a flooded world, survival-crafting sim Oceaneers is getting a proper demo September 25</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oceaneers is definitely one of the games I'm most excited to see, with it's interesting take on survival and colony building across a flooded world. Thankfully we'll all get a chance to properly try it early, as they've revealed today that a proper demo is coming on September 25th.</p>
<p>With a flooded world you have to survive, build and scavenge across unstable islands. Build your colony, scavenge debris, craft equipment, and train your survivors. Construct a raft and fend off sharks as you explore island bunkers and uncover lost Float-Tech from an old-world corporation. Island life is not all sunshine and coconuts. With sparse resources and limited island space, planning will be essential as you construct workstations, manage food production and secure drinkable water—all while making sure your island refuge stays above water. I'm getting definite Don't Starve vibes from this one.</p>
<p>Check out the latest trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_ykuHNa_xcw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b43b52f2c91db01dcdda4aecd1cffc02.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_ykuHNa_xcw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I expect it will work great with Valve's Proton on Linux systems. Maybe not the Steam Deck though, as they don't currently have controller support plans just yet. <em>Something I think they're pretty crazy to be skipping over.</em></p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Control multiple characters in this single player experience.</li>
<li>Design multiple rafts and send survivors on expeditions.</li>
<li>Haul islands back to your colony to expand your island home.</li>
<li>Improve island buoyancy with contraptions that keep islands afloat.</li>
<li>Research and unlock advanced workstations and upgrades.</li>
<li>Survive against weather events, and threats on both land and sea.</li>
<li>Farm crops, prepare rations and cook meals.</li>
<li>Customize your survivor names, traits, hair styles... including beards &amp; mustaches!</li>
<li>Uncover the deep sea storyline plot alongside the survival journey.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Some game developers are far too shameless about generative AI use</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm having to be steadily more careful on what I choose to cover here on GamingOnLinux, with more games releasing using generative AI.</p>
<p>To start things off to be clear — my current stance is generally to ignore games that use generative AI. My whole point is to support creative people, <em>not</em> machines. It's quickly getting more difficult because some won't disclose it at all (even though they're supposed to), it's steadily being used by more studios for all sorts of things big and small, and the AI notice on Steam is buried at the bottom of pages and sometimes I do forget to check <em>before</em> getting into a game and end up <em>wasting</em> my time when I see it later.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the latest, where the developers are just so completely brazen on how they're using generative AI. It's called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2824790/GUG/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GUG</a> and the thing is, the idea of the game sounds really cool, but their full statement on their generative AI use really rubbed me the wrong way.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16438033921755169890gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16438033921755169890gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GUG is a sandbox simulation roguelike where you generate monsters—”gugs”—by typing any word or phrase. Your choice of words determines how they look, behave and battle. Type “banana flamethrower” and you might get a spiky yellow pyromaniac. Type “emotional support gremlin” and get… Well, who really knows?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds cool right? Then you see the Steam page AI notice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The developers describe how their game uses AI Generated Content like this:</p>
<p>This game relies on AI to underpin its procedural image and functionality generation systems (the systems that allow for personalised creatures and their effects).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I looked a bit deeper, and found their <a href="https://martianlawyersclub.notion.site/GUG-FAQ-170d2f4bb4f780bd8a66d08ca00f63c1" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">full FAQ</a> which they've linked in a Steam community post. This is where it just really irked me. Have a little read of the full quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does GUG use ethical AI? What is the company’s stance on AI ethics?<br/>
<br/>
As a company, we are frank and open about our usage of AI. To put it simply: <strong>we use language models and image models that are trained on content from the internet that’s been extracted without consideration for its copyright or licensing</strong>. Models of this size are huge for a reason. They must be able to store enormous amounts of information on the internet. When you type in “clam” or “bucket of milk” or “martian lawyers club” or “henry kissinger” you have a gug that (likely) incorporates content from that prompt — we can rely on the model’s vast understanding of content to help it synthesize knowledge into a usable format to inject into the game. The *same* is true of our image generation model. Our image model is fine-tuned on a collection of our own images. This allows the image model to faithfully utilize the game’s intended art direction, while incorporating the domain knowledge of the user’s request.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that the game is running on contentious technology. It is also important to understand that at the current state of knowledge in machine learning is impossible to achieve the flexibility of the gug generation system in any other way. Anyone who claims that you can “train” your own model from scratch solely on your own data is either misinformed, is conflating the concepts of “training” and “finetuning”, or has enormous amounts of cash and time.</p>
<p>Of course we want to emphasize: as active members of the machine learning community and longtime video game developers, we are internally working on alternatives and planning to move ourselves further and further from unethical and unfair uses of AI. For example, there are open-source projects trying to replicate the capabilities of current models, while using fair-licensed datasets. We believe that what we have built is interesting and fun enough to our players and represents a valid use of this technology in its nascent state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Emphasis in the above quote mine.</em></p>
<p>With that in mind then, they're fully aware that the generative AI models they're using are trained on others work, scraped from all corners of the internet. It's made their game GUG "interesting and fun enough" right now that who cares right? Why put in the hard work to make your own stuff when the <em>totally intelligent machines</em> can do it for you?</p>
<p>When we have <strong>100s</strong> of games releasing on Steam <em>constantly</em> - why am I going to pick one where the developers aren't even doing a lot of the work? From artwork to story text - why am I going to play or read it if it's just made by a machine, what's the point? The answer is — I'm not. I'm going to continue clicking ignore on them. And I hope to be able to stick by that stance for a long time.</p>
<p>Looking over on <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Btags%5D%5B0%5D=AI%20Content%20Disclosed" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, there's now over <strong>10,000</strong> games with an AI disclosure notice. Of that number, 3,957 have a 2025 release date. It's only going to keep increasing.</p>
<p>I suppose it's yet another good thing about GamingOnLinux remaining 100% independent, I don't <em>have</em> to cover anything. And at times I can just write an article like this, pointing out how the industry is just changing and throwing some thoughts up on it. I don't like where this is going, but automation is inevitable in everything isn't it? Higher ups always want to maximise everything and some people are just lazy. What bugs me the most though, is that the more you rely on AI generation - the less you learn and improve.</p>

      <title>Long-awaited prehistoric multiplayer platformer Dino Run 2 is heading back to Kickstarter with a new demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After some setbacks, Pixeljam are readying a fresh Kickstarter to help fund the prehistoric multiplayer racing platformer Dino Run 2, along with a fresh demo.</p>
<p>Dino Run 2 lets players race against extinction in a pixelated world of danger and charm — escaping an apocalyptic wall of doom, selecting from a cast of uniquely specialized dinos, and customizing every scale and claw with a vast library of visual mods.</p>
<p>This is not the first time they've crowdfunded for the game, which has a bit of a troubled history. Their first big Kickstarter failed in 2013, their second in 2018 was a <em>lot</em> smaller to focus on getting more work on it done which did succeed. But after that, things fell off a bit.</p>
<p>In an email they told me how it ended up in "development hell" but in 2022 they started the project over with a new team, rebuilding the foundations and now it's ready to expand.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1648887781755168756gol1.gif" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1648887781755168756gol1.gif"/></a></p>
<p>With the new campaign launching September 2nd, they're hoping for enough funds to get it out in Early Access. They already have plenty to show for it now with a fully playable multiplayer sandbox, which they said has "custom netcode that requires no servers and will last for decades, this sandbox includes worldbuilding tools, online and LAN multiplayer, and early access to the systems that will power the full game".</p>
<p>Since it requires no servers they told me "I suppose we accidentally supported the "stop killing games" movement, but it was never our original intention - we just didn't want the multiplayer experience to ever suddenly go away like Dino Run 1 did".</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pixeljam/the-dino-run-2-early-access-campaign" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Early Access Kickstarter</a> will go live on September 2nd, with full Native Linux support.</p>
<p><em>I'm a big fan of one of their more recent releases with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/utopia-must-fall-is-easily-one-of-the-best-modern-arcade-shoot-em-ups/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Utopia Must Fall</a>, so hopefully this goes well.</em></p>

      <title>R-Type Delta: HD Boosted announced for release in November</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A PlayStation classic returns. The shoot 'em up R-Type Delta: HD Boosted was announced with a PC release coming in November.</p>
<p>Originally released in 1998 for the PlayStation 1, this new version of the game will have various enhancements for modern platforms. Plus it will no doubt work just fine on Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck thanks to Proton.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hZL-B5KD1jc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/53fe2b5991b8ebc71284f136c386f936.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hZL-B5KD1jc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I'm just happy we're seeing so many more retro games get spruced up for modern audiences, making them feel better and easy to access.</p>
<p>Updated to run at a smooth 60 FPS and with the option to dynamically switch between the original graphics and HD visuals at the start of each gaming session, R-Type Delta HD Boosted features numerous options and new additions catering to modern gamers. The much-loved soundtrack has received a refresh,with newly-arranged compositions from Masahiko Ishida (R-Type II), as well as USP (R-Type Delta) and Chris Hülsbeck (R-Type for C64 and Amiga). There is also an option to adjust the screen size,  and multiple difficult settings alongside an all-new practice mode provide players the opportunity to hone their skills before facing down the Bydo Empire for real.</p>

      <title>Rogue-lite slot machine nightmare CloverPit launches September 3</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The demonic lovechild of Balatro and Buckshot Roulette, apparently. CloverPit looks like it will suck away all your time.</p>
<p>It's been something of a viral hit too with the demo helping it along, as it's gathered nearly half a million Steam wishlists which puts it in the top 100 upcoming games. Today, they revealed it will be launching September 3rd. Going by the demo, it should be a flawless experience on Linux systems thanks to Proton.</p>
<p>While the game is inspired by actual slot-machine gambling, the developer was keen to note it's "not a slot machine simulator" as it's "designed to be broken and ultimately overcome". They said they "don’t really like gambling" which is what the game is about as you manipulate it for extra coins, while you bend and break the rules.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A gripping rogue-lite where every round could be your last!</li>
<li>Meta-progression, seeded runs, unlockable run modifiers and power-ups!</li>
<li>A hellish escape room atmosphere!</li>

      <title>Super Farming Boy is a bizarre farming sim about chain reactions with a Cuphead inspired style</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You've never played a farming sim like this before. Blending a few genres together where Stardew Valley collides with a Cuphead like style. <em>Disclosure: a key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>I'm really struggling to give you a good explainer on this one. It has incredibly simple controls, since it was designed for mobile as well as desktop — but don't let that put you off. It's very accessible and the weird mixture it offers is something rather different.</p>
<p>The story goes that you control the character Super, whose mother and friends have been captured by the evil KORPO, who then hires you to work your own farmland so you can earn everything and everyone back. KORPO even sends you mail about how slow you are. Bit rude huh? So you have to go through lots of challenges to make money each day, to keep progressing through upgrades to make earning monies easier and keep unlocking more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1265784811755100499gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1265784811755100499gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>With the farming side of it, Super Farming Boy is all about initiating silly chain reactions. When you pull a crop that's ready, it will interact with tiles around it to cause chain reactions and combos so it's not just a case of planting, watering and waiting. You need to figure out all the combinations that work together, to maximise how much you earn. Some crops are also massive, and need these chain reactions to hit them to bring down their HP to harvest them. Pretty fun when you get going! The higher the combo, the more monies you get.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19202309401755098778gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19202309401755098778gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I also had to laugh the first time I saw the special Fever Time mode after you've done a few combos to build up your super meter, which activates a wild mode (pictured above) where crops around you grow instantly. The whole game is just thoroughly <em>bizarre</em> like this all the way through. I love it though, when we have so many Stardew Valley-likes, this is breaking through the dirt to find a little gold.</p>
<p>You can also buy a few critters to help you do various things around the farm. Everything is pricey as heck though, that KORPO really makes you sweat for it. Thankfully, once you learn a few combos from pulling various crops, you'll soon be earning lots of monies quite easily.</p>
<p>In a way it's pretty streamlined since you don't need to worry about inventory management, allowing you to just sit back and relax a little more while you build up your farm to make some awesome reactions.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rkOTEkRKxCs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8e5031880112ddf0fadaa8abc5b3fbd5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rkOTEkRKxCs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The Cuphead style to it is pretty clear, which actually looks quite nice without being too derivative. It has its own unique charm to it thanks to the setting and all the quirky characters.</p>
<p>It's in Early Access so no formal review type-thing from me yet, other than just summing up that it has a really great idea and I'm excitedly looking forward to them finishing it with all the extra content they have planned. Like boss fights (yep, in a farming game), new seasons, more missions and the list goes on. It continues to scratch a very weird itch in my brain I didn't know I needed.</p>
<p>Works perfectly on Desktop Linux with Proton 9.0-4, and they made numerous tweaks to have it run nicely on Steam Deck directly too.</p>

      <title>Assassin&#39;s Creed Shadows gets bumped up back to Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve seem confident enough in how Assassin’s Creed Shadows runs on Steam Deck, that it's now again Steam Deck Verified. It's nice that Valve do actually go back and recheck titles more than once, hopefully they will do this for other titles too.</p>
<p>When it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/assassins-creed-shadows-out-now-steam-deck-verified-but-has-nvidia-problems-on-desktop-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">originally released</a>, it was Steam Deck Verified but Valve dropped it down to a Playable rating on July 24th noting it had issues with small text. As of August 12th it's now fully Verified again, with a note now actually there to say it does require internet for setup and they're recommending <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/proton-10-0-2-beta-brings-even-more-gaming-improvements-to-linux-steamos-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 10 Beta</a> which is set as the default.

<p>We've seen the ratings switch on a few other titles before like Spider-Man 2 <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/marvels-spider-man-2-has-lost-its-steam-deck-verified-rating/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">losing the Verified rating</a> and then <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/marvels-spider-man-2-now-steam-deck-verified-with-a-fresh-update-out-to-improve-performance/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">gaining it back again</a>. And we just saw <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-gets-steam-deck-verified-with-the-enhanced-update-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Senua's Saga: Hellblade II also get bumped up to Verified</a>.</p>
<p>The main issue I find with the Verified rating on these bigger titles is that while the games do work, and you can usually hit at least 30FPS, there's a fair amount of visual compromises to make it happen. At least in the case of Assassin's Creed Shadows, it still looks visually quite good on Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Valve confirm that Steam purchases with PayPal have been limited to a few select currencies</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In the ongoing saga of payment processors locking down payments, Steam has been hit by PayPal limiting purchases to only a select few currencies.</p>
<p>This has been going on for a little while now, with numerous posts across social media from users wondering why PayPal has been unavailable for them. Recently though, it seems the situation has only worsened as Valve have now put up a statement to clarify the situation when going to check out in a whole bunch of countries.</p>
<p>Valve have now added a statement to their <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/731C-13C7-7D04-A11E#purpp" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">purchasing FAQ</a> that reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>PayPal use on Steam is currently unavailable in my currency. Why?</strong></p>
<p>In early July 2025, PayPal notified Valve that their acquiring bank for payment transactions in certain currencies was immediately terminating the processing of any transactions related to Steam. This affects Steam purchases using PayPal in currencies <em>other than</em> EUR, CAD, GBP, JPY, AUD and USD.</p>
<p>We hope to offer PayPal as an option for these currencies in the future but the timeline is uncertain. We are also evaluating adding additional payment methods on Steam for the customers affected by this.</p>
<p>In the meantime, please use one of our other current payment methods during checkout. If you can't use any of the available options, you can consider using a <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/78E3-7431-1E88-AD59" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Wallet code</a> to add funds to your account.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We don't entirely know why this is happening though. It may be linked to the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/mastercard-release-a-statement-about-game-stores-payment-processors-and-adult-content/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">other payment issues</a> that Steam and itch.io have been facing but it also might not be.</p>

      <title>After the DMCA takedown debacle, Old School Rally has now replaced all affected car models</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It was unfortunate what happened with Old School Rally when it was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/valve-restores-the-steam-page-for-old-school-rally-after-it-got-hit-with-a-dmca/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hit with a DMCA takedown</a>, but thankfully the situation is solved now.</p>
<p>It's a reminder to game developers that if you're going to use assets from somewhere, you might not actually be getting the real rights to them — unfortunately.</p>
<p>The developer has announced that all 13 models of cars in the game that were affected by this issue have been replaced, with shiny new retro-looking models that perfectly fit in with the game. That's quite a bit of work for a smaller developer to get sorted in a short time and the models look great in-game.</p>
<p>Hopefully this hasn't derailed their previous plan to have the game finished and out of Early Access by the end of the year.</p>

      <title>Go on the hunt for a simple pilsner in a world full of craft beer in Dude, Where Is My Beer? A New Hop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In a world overrun by craft beer enthusiasts and their endless creative brews, one grumpy guy is still on a quest to find one thing: a regular, basic pilsner. Dude, Where Is My Beer? A New Hop is a sequel to Dude, Where Is My Beer? from 2020.</p>
<p>More about it: "An evil Master Brewer has banned pilsner and is hunting down all who dare to drink it. But our mustachioed hero has a plan: enter a brewing contest to bring it back. Along the way, he’ll need to gather brewing ingredients, find the right equipment, and even team up with the rebels in “The Pilsner Front.” Can you defeat the IPA regime and bring pilsner to the world once again?</p>
<p>A New Hop sees the return of the much-loved nostalgic point-and-click gameplay, gorgeous comic stylings, charming sense of humour, and of course the warm embrace of an imminent bar crawl through Oslo’s streets to defeat an evil brewer of beverages that are NOT pilsners. Are you up for a legendary night out in Norway?"</p>
<p>The announcement came with the launch of a demo you can try right now on Steam. Check out the trailer:</p>

<p>Game Highlights (from the press email):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>30 unique pilsner-lacking locations to explore.</li>
<li>Puzzles to solve using old-school 90s interfaces.</li>
<li>The Beer-o-meter tracks your tipsy choices.</li>
<li>The distinctly numb feeling of not finding a pilsner.</li>
<li>This guy really wants a pilsner, huh?</li>
<li>But there aren’t any, because of the Master Brewer sitch.</li>
<li>Can we please just get this dude a pilsner.</li>

      <title>Nexus Mods app 0.15.2 brings updater improvements and more bug fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Nexus Mods team just put out a new version of their in-development cross-platform mod manager, the Nexus Mods app v0.15.2 is now available to test.</p>
<p>Eventually this will replace Vortex, but there's a lot of work ahead. It currently fully supports Stardew Valley and Cyberpunk 2077 with work ongoing to properly support Baldur's Gate 3 and Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord. <em>Many more games to come.</em></p>
<p>With this update they've improved updating mods to make it "faster and more predictable" so it will correctly replace the old mod in all loadouts. Searching is now available in more places across the UI, mod collections you export will now include the game version number and they've reduced the app startup time.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 10-12 hotfix adds a few more needed tweaks for video playback</title>

      <title>NVIDIA 580.76.05 released for Linux as the new recommended stable driver</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The first proper release of the NVIDIA 580 driver series is out now, with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/details/252790/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">NVIDIA 580.76.05</a> now the latest recommended driver.</p>
<p>Interestingly, they only <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/nvidia-driver-570-181-released-for-linux-as-the-latest-recommended-stable-driver/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bumped up NVIDIA driver 570.181</a> as the recommended driver less than a week ago, which contained the vague "Minor bug fixes and improvements", so I'm still sort-of expecting more driver security issues to be revealed soon. Unless they really did need to bump up the previous driver for something so minor they didn't even say what…</p>
<p>Anyway, here's all the changes for the new driver:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Highlights since R580 Beta Release, 580.65.06</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated egl-x11 to version 1.0.3.</li>
<li>Updated egl-wayland to version 1.1.20.</li>
<li>Added an "OutputBitsPerComponent" MetaMode attribute that can be used to control the number of bits per color component transmitted via a display connector. If not specified, the driver will choose an optimal color format.</li>
</ul>
<p>Highlights from R580 Beta Release, 580.65.06</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause Vulkan applications to hang when destroying swapchains after a lost device event.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could allow atomic commit and other DRM operations to return success status despite having failed due to handling an interrupt:<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/issues/832" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/issues/832</a></li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause GTK 4 applications to crash when using the Vulkan backend on Wayland.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could intermittently cause llama.cpp to crash on exit when using the Vulkan backend:<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/10528" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/10528</a></li>
<li>Added support for the fifo-v1 Wayland protocol on Vulkan.</li>
<li>Updated GPU clock value reporting in nvidia-settings, NVML, and nvidia-smi to show clocks before thermal and idle slowdowns for better consistency with the equivalent functionality on Windows.</li>
<li>Fixed compatibility with Bigscreen Beyond Head Mounted Displays.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could result in a black screen when setting specific modes on HDMI displays.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused blank or frozen screens under the following conditions: nvidia-drm is loaded with the modeset=1 and fbdev=1 parameters, using a Maxwell or Pascal series GPU, and more than one display device of differing resolutions are connected.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused nvidia-suspend.service to fail when available system memory is low.</li>
<li>Enabled RMIntrLockingMode by default. This feature can help reduce stutter especially when using virtual reality. This feature was originally introduced in the r570 series. It can be disabled by loading nvidia.ko with the `NVreg_RegistryDwords=RMIntrLockingMode=0` kernel module parameter.</li>
<li>Implemented another feature that can reduce time spent in the interrupt top half for low latency display interrupts by deferring the work until later. This feature is experimental and disabled by default. This feature can be enabled by loading nvidia.ko with the `NVreg_RegistryDwords=RmEnableAggressiveVblank=1` kernel module parameter.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause blank rendering on some single-buffered GLX applications when running on Xwayland.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause a kernel use-after-free on pre-Turing GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause OpenGL applications and compositors to stall when using NVIDIA as a PRIME Display Offload sink ("Reverse PRIME"), potentially resulting in a black screen.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that led to increasing memory usage in X11 OpenGL and Vulkan applications after suspend/resume cycles.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause 32-bit x86 applications running on recent builds of glibc to crash on dlopen().</li>
</ul>

<p>POSTAL 2 Redux is now on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/postal2redux/postal-2-redux/description" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> with the developers gathering funding to make this enhanced Unity rebuild of the classic divisive game.</p>
<p>Originally launched in 2003, this will bring the game over from ancient Unreal Engine to Unity and make it work better on modern platforms. Plus, plenty of enhancements to the visuals and basically overhauling everything while keeping the spirit of it intact.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8851136341755014819gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>What's new in Redux:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A modern backbone. We’re hauling POSTAL 2 into Unity so it runs perfectly on modern hardware. This gives us the ability to have completely scalable requirements. Basically, for every platform this comes to it will look as good as it can for the hardware. </li>
<li>Loading Zones, begone! Paradise streams in as you walk. No more load screens. Just roam and ruin.</li>
<li>A complete graphical upgrade. Higher‑resolution textures, upgraded shaders and materials and lighting make every billboard, back alley, and biohazard pop.</li>
<li>Guns with bite. Balancing the combat based on community feedback. Weapons are being rebuilt to hit harder, punch through flesh, and send bodies flopping with proper ragdolls. You’ll feel the boom.</li>
<li>Check out my insides. Shipping malls, restaurants, offices, arcades—stuffed with destructible props. Let loose and see the World explode in front of your eyes. </li>
<li>Crowds that find trouble faster. Civilians still snitch and cops still overreact, but smarter pathing means they get to the chaos quicker and make it messier when they do.</li>
<li>Champ gets promoted from mascot to menace. Pet him, point him, weaponize him. Man’s best friend finally acts like it.</li>
<li>Built to break out of the PC cage. Targeting PC and modern consoles so Paradise can spread its disease broadly and legally. </li>
<li>Quality of life, everywhere. Widescreen done right, modern inputs, fewer crashes, smarter UI—the boring necessities so the fun stuff can be loud.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As for why Kickstarter? Here's what they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Twenty years later, POSTAL 2 is still selling, still memed, but confined by limited platform support and its older engine. Console players want it. Mac players can’t even launch it. Doing it right (new engine, modern pipelines, rebuilt assets, smarter systems) and also expanding the Universe and continuing the story of POSTAL 2 costs real money. To that end we need to gauge the community interest in this happening. If the interest is there we also want to engage with the community upfront, rather than turn up with something in 12 months and hope it's what people want. POSTAL 2 has always been a journey, we want to bring you along on the next phase of this adventure. <br/>
Kickstarter lets us do that without some suit leaning over the keyboard asking us to “tone it down.” No creative half‑measures. We answer only to Running With Scissors and you. POSTAL 2 Redux is for the fans. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Kickstarter is asking for $250,000 to make it a reality and there's special stretch goals to expand the game further if they pull in lots of funding. Extras like time of day effects, a sandbox mode and more.</p>

<p>"We are absolutely thrilled to launch the POSTAL 2 Redux Kickstarter campaign today," said Eric Masher, COO, Impact Inked. "The original game is one of the most exciting and important games of the 21st century, and we’re honored to work with Team Beef and Running With Scissors to bring the POSTAL Dude, Paradise, and everything that makes POSTAL 2 special to today’s gamers!"</p>
<p>The campaign runs through September 12.</p>

      <title>Rising Heat aims to be a next evolution of horde survival twin-stick shooters</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A sprinkle of Geometry Wars and other twin-stick shooters, a dash of Vampire Survivors styled upgrades - Rising Heat thinks it's going to be special.</p>
<p>So special in fact the developers claim it's going to be the "next evolution of horde survival". That's…a pretty bold claim huh? One I thought I should check out as part of my ongoing quest to play everything resembling some sort of survivor-like game. <em>I'm a sucker for quick action, lots of upgrades and watching numbers go up.</em></p>
<p>Here you're flying a ship with floaty physics that you need to take into account. It's very much a twin-stick shooter, or should I say twin-stick <em>smasher</em>, as a big part of it is the <em>tackling</em> system. Yeah you have weapons you can fire, but your ship is directly a weapon too. You will dash repeatedly into enemies to cause all sorts of chaotic explosions.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3641959181755012652gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3641959181755012652gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The upgrade system is pretty interesting too in its design. You buy and attach modules to your ship when you level up from the shop, and you're able to fuse together two of these modules to make them more powerful (and save on your limited active slots) to reign down more destruction. The fusing system is essential as a lot of modules have debuffs as well as buffs, with fusing reducing the debuffs. The first fusion attempt is free, so it's always worth doing and you can re-fuse to re-roll at a cost as many times as you want for each module fusion until you get what you want.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14418868401755012071gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14418868401755012071gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18548151581755012069gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18548151581755012069gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>On top of that there's an <em>integration</em> system for these modules. You only have 5 active slots to place modules in, but you have a bunch of additional integration slots,where you can pay up to make modules available for use outside of your active slots. It can be a little bit of information overload but it's all pretty simple once you get going.</p>
<p>Lots of stats to think about too so it will take a while to go through and figure out what sort of build you want to make, but that's part of the allure of it. All the modules, stats and the action together make it really interesting. I'm not sure if it's anything close to the evolution they're marketing it as — but the modules system is quite fun to play with.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="MAItG038CE8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2bad03d4db2525dd5eab2fa83c5d6d3a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/MAItG038CE8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The co-op mode is part of what's going to make this one rock. You each have a ship on the field, linked together by any energy beam and it can end up pretty crazy thanks to this system. Possibly one of the best co-op experiences in a survivor-like game so far.</p>
<p>With different ships, pilots, hacks and maps to unlock through the full game, I am most definitely excited for more.</p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dynamic movement</strong><strong>:</strong> Master a dynamic momentum-based movement system. Line up multiple enemies to execute a flurry of precise tackles, dealing devastating damage while bouncing between a barrage of enemy bullets!</li>
<li><strong>Customize Your Loadout:</strong> Each cockpit has a limited inventory in which the pilot can upgrade, integrate, and fuse hacks together to create varied builds. Different strategies in the shop, hack positioning, action order, and even negative stats will help get the most out of every build.</li>
<li><strong>Plan of Attack:</strong> A strong pilot must plan out their runs, including which pilot, ship, hacks, and weapons to equip. As the aliens learn to adapt, how does a successful pilot stay one step ahead?</li>
<li><strong>Fly With a Friend:</strong> In co-op mode, two pilots are linked by a supercharged beam, creating opportunities for mass destruction…assuming they’ve got each other’s backs.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you love arcade-styled action, twin-stick shooting and arena-styled shooters then I think Rising Heat has a lot of neat ideas bundled together. The demo is worth checking out right now and the game works perfectly on Linux with Proton 9.0-4 tested.</p>

      <title>Senua&#39;s Saga: Hellblade II gets Steam Deck Verified with the Enhanced Update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Enhanced Update has arrived for Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, bringing with it optimisations, Steam Deck Verified support and more.</p>
<p>Originally released on PC back in May 2024, this update adds a new "Very High" graphics preset. They said that their team "carefully considered where we could make the most impactful improvements for a visual quality bump at a reasonable performance cost" for it, rather than just dialling everything up. They've also added in NVIDIA DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation support.</p>
<p>A good update for Steam Deck players too as they explained in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2461850/view/528728489311864054" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Something else we wanted to revisit with this update was performance on Steam Deck to achieve Verified compatibility, and we’re pleased to report that this work was successful. Deck performance at launch wasn’t an out-of-the-box experience, so players would find themselves needing to tweak settings to achieve optimal performance. We’ve now made the game ‘Deck-aware’, so the game will now automatically select the best settings for this hardware. We’ve also found some CPU performance improvements for a better game experience on Steam Deck.</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">The full list of changes are below:</p>

      <title>Repterra is a base-building survival RTS set in a world overrun by dinosaurs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Repterra is a promising upcoming real-time strategy game that has a demo available, and if you love the idea of facing hordes of dinosaurs it's one for you.</p>
<p>Set in a similar gameplay style to the likes of They Are Billions and Age of Darkness, with you building and expanding while also dealing with hordes that will come to try and destroy you in waves. So it's a bit of a mixture of classic RTS building with some tower defense. The demo as tested worked perfectly on Linux with Proton 9.0-4 and it's going to be worth keeping an eye on, as it's exactly the type of RTS I love to see more of.</p>
<p>You're not just building up walls to hide behind though, you'll also be building up your own little army of humans and dinos together - some dinos can even have a human jump on their back to unlock special extras. I just think it's neat to see.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZtRdtdK4B8A?rel=0&amp;start=0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ecb9f0799465d1a1e630372bec22cf06.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZtRdtdK4B8A?rel=0&amp;start=0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A little rough around the edges since it's a demo of an unfinished game, but it shows a lot of promise that reminds me of the good classic RTS games I played endless hours of in my youth. Looking forward to seeing more of it but there's no release date being mentioned for the full game just yet.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some Highlights (from Steam):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Unique Breeding, Riding, and Taming mechanics.</li>
<li>5 Different factions with unique play-style focuses.</li>
<li>Game modifying perks that can be chosen at load-out.</li>
<li>Permanent unlockable points and shop (levels, perks, bonus features).</li>
<li>Customizable hero units..</li>
<li>Campaign mode.</li>
<li>Extensive Survival mode with unlockables and meta progression.</li>
<li>100,000+ dinos running at a smooth 60fps.</li>
<li>Dozens of different units, dinos, and buildings.</li>
<li>Achievements and Steam Cloud.</li>
<li>4k High rez graphic in a timeless pre-rendered style.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Use bombs creatively to progress in the puzzle-platformer metroidvania Öoo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Öoo is a visually charming and clever puzzle-platformer metroidvania where you make creative use of bombs to move yourself around to progress. The game works great on Linux / Steam Deck with Proton.</p>
<p>You don't directly have any real abilities and so you need to stick bombs everywhere and see what happens. Bombs can push you across gaps, send you flying to hit other platforms and bombs can push other bombs to annihilate things blocking your path. Some might even show up hidden passageways to allow you to progress further.</p>
<p>A game that does a lot with a little and it's absolutely worth picking up for a couple of hours of fun. Some areas need just a little bit of your imagination but none of it is particularly difficult to figure out, so it won't waste you time making you scratch your brain for ages.</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A dense experience that can be enjoyed in just 2–3 hours.</li>
<li>A cute yet oddly mysterious world.</li>
<li>Diverse puzzle solutions that change depending on how you use bombs.</li>
<li>No text — enjoy the game without language barriers.</li>
<li>Cute enough to delight even those who don’t like bugs!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Webcam-based 6DoF head &amp; eye tracking app LookPilot released on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>LookPilot is an app that provides head and eye tracking for games, using nothing but your webcam and it looks pretty slick with a new Steam release. It even has Linux support right out of the box and there's a demo available to see if it works for you before buying it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hs-8CzalGIk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/62471e9f7661bab3efc09bc07cf003c3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hs-8CzalGIk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>6DoF Tracking: Head yaw, pitch, roll, plus forward/back, left/right, up/down translation.</li>
<li>Head + Eye Blend: Combine head and eye rotation with adjustable influence to match your preference.</li>
<li>High-Rate Output: Responsive output at high refresh rates for smooth camera control—even from low-FPS webcams.</li>
<li>Quick Start: Install → Start tracking → Launch the game. Most titles work instantly; some need a one-time in-game toggle.</li>
<li>Low Overhead: Runs on CPU—no dedicated hardware or GPU required.</li>
<li>Cross-Platform: Windows and Linux support, including titles launched through Wine.</li>
<li>Wide Compatibility: Works with 700+ games via standard head-tracking interfaces.</li>
<li>Keybinds: Recenter, toggle tracking, and switch presets on the fly.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Since it's on the newer side, there's not many guides for games up on this yet, and especially so for the Linux side with most guides missing - but nice to see it release to give Linux gamers more options like it.</p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3326890/LookPilot/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Smash everything with your balls in BALL x PIT releasing October 15</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you have the balls to go deep into a bottomless pit? Well, you'll find out on October 15 when fast-paced fantasy roguelite BALL x PIT releases.</p>
<p>BALL x PIT is one of my favourites that I played during the last Steam Next Fest, with it's delicious fast-paced combat that sort-of blends together Arkanoid / Breakout with Vampire Survivor like elements into something truly weird and challenging. Add to that the mini city-building aspect to it and there's a lot to like about it and I can't wait to play more of it. I certainly wasn't alone in loving it, as it was actually the 12th most-played demo from the entire Steam Next Fest event in June.</p>
<p>See the new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="GB5v8BAn97Q"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/de2b2d8eeff2b371c717f516f5accc01.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/GB5v8BAn97Q" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Fuse Your Balls</strong></p>
<p>The Ball Fusion system encourages explosive experimentation with over 60 randomized balls to equip and combine during your journey. Discover overpowered combinations and unexpected synergies from hundreds of possible outcomes. Load up, lean in, and let the spit hit the fan! </p>
<p><strong>Build New Ballbylon</strong></p>
<p>Expand New Ballbylon with over 70 unique buildings that provide gameplay bonuses and unlock further power-ups, new characters, and more! As your community grows, task homebound heroes with automated tasks to keep the resources coming while you dive deeper into the pit. </p>
<p><strong>Discover New Realms</strong></p>
<p>Face legions of diverse enemies within the pit, battling through barren deserts, frozen caverns, savage forests and more. Each region offers its own unique set of hazards on top of hordes of increasingly challenging foes and mighty, screen-filling bosses. </p>
<p><strong>Recruit Fellow Hunters</strong></p>
<p>As you explore the pit you’ll encounter fellow treasure hunters eager to add their skills to your expedition. Each character has unique, upgradable mechanics that totally change the way you play the game. Experimentation and adaptation are crucial to the success of New Ballbylon!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The demo, which is still live, works perfectly with Proton 9.0-4 on Linux systems.</p>

      <title>Change the world around you with unique spells in the colourful puzzle game Rhell: Warped Worlds &amp; Troubled Times</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a spell system that somewhat reminded me a little of the amazing Baba Is You for how you change the world to win, the upcoming Rhell: Warped Worlds &amp; Troubled Times looks damn fun.</p>
<p>With a semi-open world design you get to freely roam around, with the only limit being the current spell combinations available to you. You'll come across lots of different obstacles including blocked paths, hazards, movable objects and more that you'll overcome by unlocking different spells. What makes it really interesting (aside from the incredibly vibrant style) is the spell system itself. You get up to 40 different runes, and then craft unique spells by mixing keywords together. They said there's "over 102 million permutations in total" and so lots of ways to beat the open-ended puzzles.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6jEmPHQlOwE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fa311212e47a5db1ee515e4a22d34472.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6jEmPHQlOwE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“We’re excited to introduce Rhell, a fun puzzle adventure that encourages players to experiment, inspires creativity, and offers a fresh take on the puzzle genre,” said Simon Byron, Managing Director, Yogscast Games. “Alongside the depth of storytelling and puzzle-solving, players will feel drawn to Rhell's emotional development as she goes in search of answers and restores normality to the toon-like world.”</p>
<p>There's a demo available on Steam right now and it works perfectly with Proton 9.0-4.</p>

      <title>You absolutely have to try the expanded demo of Moonsigil Atlas</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Moonsigil Atlas is easily one of the most unique deck-builders around, and the latest major update to the demo has me hooked. You have to try it.</p>
<p>A game we've covered here at GamingOnLinux a few times because it's just so cool. Deck-building where you don't fuss around with an energy system, or limited action points. Instead, you play your cards down in a physical space, with each having their own shape that you need to fit onto the board. Even if deck-building isn't usually your thing, if you love strategy and puzzle games you might even find this win you over.</p>
<p>This twist on having to position your cards, along with the enemies messing with the board too, just adds such a fun dynamic to the genre that I can't help but keep coming back to the demo.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8iscwsdG4tc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/478b7218f0370226669c8edc6516b8c7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8iscwsdG4tc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Just some of what's been added to the fresh demo update includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eclipse levels</strong> for additional difficulty modifiers once you've beaten the demo.</li>
<li><strong>New encounters</strong>, including Astral Card Packs and new forms of infusing.</li>
<li><strong>Improved visuals</strong> for the player character and encounters.</li>
<li><strong>Even more</strong>, including starting boons, character mastery, run history, Astral Dust, new cards, and a lot of small quality-of-life improvements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can get a surprising amount of hours out of the demo with all of this.</p>
<p>I will be amazed if this isn't a big hit when it's released. It has Native Linux support too.</p>

      <title>Dark fairy-tale metroidvania Well Dweller looks incredible, probably a must-have for Hollow Knight fans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dark fairy-tale metroidvania Well Dweller is the next game from Kyle Thompson who also made the highly rated Crypt Custodian and Islets. Kyle is continuing to team up with Top Hat Studios, Inc. for publishing too.</p>
<p>Here you play as Glimmer, a tiny bird armed with a matchstick who must burn the wicked queen to save his family before they become part of her royal gown. It was revealed during the recent Nintendo event but it will be releasing for Windows as well, so Linux / Steam Deck fans can play it with Proton.</p>
<p>The artwork on the monsters is what really pulled me into this one, those are some seriously freakish looking creations. Looks like the boss fights will be quite intense in this one.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="J1e29j2DzqU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/231257477d7e801dc1a9529f1700770e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/J1e29j2DzqU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More details from the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Venture forth into a whimsical but morbid fairy-tale landscape, and battle terrifying beasts whilst gaining new abilities to expand your world. Discover secrets, mysteries, and the riddles that rot in the underbelly of this wretched queendom.</p>
<p>The dark nooks and crannies throughout shelter powerful trinkets that are key to survival, and a cast of charming characters and allies - all trying to make their own way through the Queen’s twisted world - await befriending along your journey. Go camping with Ilda, a tiny mouse on the run from the Queen’s grasp. Explore an abandoned castle with Looter, a mysterious scavenger who searches the queendom for the best wares to steal.</p>
<p>Many more encounters and discoveries await along the way, punctuated by beautiful, hand-drawn medieval-style fairy-tale illustrations.</p>
<p>Not every fable or fairly-tale has a happy ending, and an imposing collection of beast and royally-sized challenges await. Step into the tiny shoes (or feathers) of Glimmer, and perhaps, just perhaps, you’ll be able to re-unite all your sheltered siblings, snatched from the nest one night in a turn of events that lead to the coming of an unlikely, little hero....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No release date is being given yet other than sometime in 2026.</p>

<p>Nice to see fixes coming in for Farlight 84, since a lot of it was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/farlight-84-is-now-broken-on-linux-steamos-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">left broken after a recent game update</a>.

<p>Is This Seat Taken? is a game I've absolutely adored since trying the demo in February and it's officially out now with Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>A truly lovely cosy puzzle game about playing matchmaker, as you get people to swap seats across various locations to ensure that everyone is happy. The idea behind it is simple and it's really easy to get into thanks to the wonderfully charming art style too. Like all good puzzlers it will start you off slow, but don't let the simple style deceive you, later levels do get a bit on the challenging side but it is all pure logic. Everything makes sense, you just have to fit it all together.</p>
<p>Doesn't take forever to get through either at around 4-8 hours depending on how good you are at it. Check out the launch trailer for it below:</p>
