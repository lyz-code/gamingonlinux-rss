      <title>Bye Sweet Carole blends horror with what looks like classic Disney movies</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I've no idea how I missed Bye Sweet Carole being announced a good while ago, but maybe you did too and it deserves a look because it honestly looks pretty incredible. Created by Chris Darril of the Remothered series it looks like it really does blend classic Disney movies, with a more mature horror theme.</p>
<p>The reveal trailer from last year:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="KSd5hbRGYR4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/43147d8070260f3c3bd28785980fb945.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/KSd5hbRGYR4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it: "Set in the early 1900s, in an age where the phenomenon of the feminist political movement begins to shake the British nation, young Lana Benton, guest of the eerie Bunny Hall orphanage, is the only one to suspect that her best friend Carole didn’t just run away. The secret correspondence between Carole and a mysterious “French” pushes Lana to investigate enough to find herself surviving, poised between the real world and the fantastic kingdom of Corolla that, under the cruel influence of the terrifying Mr.Kyn, the insensitive owl Velenia, and the ravenous colonies of tar bunnies, is inexorably perishing."</p>
<p>And then for some very early gameplay shown during Gamescom 2023:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="YuM4LqSR_5A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7e3d5f49312c73dde393801a4a221cd3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/YuM4LqSR_5A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Embark on a horrific journey through a dark tale set in the austere Bunny Hall and the mesmerizing world of Corolla.</li>
<li>Immerse yourself in a hand-drawn universe brought to life using cinematographic techniques inspired by the greatest animated movies.</li>
<li>Shape-shift into a rabbit and harness your various forms to conquer the deadly challenges that await you.</li>
<li>Encounter a vibrant cast of characters, from your loyal friend Mr. Baesie to the malevolent owl Velenia and the terrifying Mr. Kyn.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Right onto the wishlist it goes. Can't wait to give this one a run through. It releases later this year.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2428980/Bye_Sweet_Carole/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>. No doubt it will work well with Proton on Linux.</p>

      <title>Palworld is bringing in fun new Pals for you to put to work</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pocketpair's absolute smash-hit Early Access game Palworld is set to expanding, with some new Pals being teased that will be coming sometime this Summer.</p>
<p>This is a further tease on what the developer <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/palworld-is-getting-a-major-content-update-this-summer-plus-a-pvp-arena-mode-later/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously announced</a> recently for the big Summer update that will bring in a whole bunch of new content, including a new island and eventually a PvP mode too. Now we're getting our first glimpse at some of what to expect.</p>
<p>We're going to see a frog with a stick, some sort of ostrich, a dog with long ears and a cute little dino-like creature with a silly-looking mushroom on its head. Do any look like Pokemon? That's been an ongoing complaint about Palworld's design since even before release. <em>I don't know </em>but<em> </em>they look fun though. </p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="RrrRs7-gpzg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0552d51c271e020e464ecd4965f4664e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/RrrRs7-gpzg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Palworld is rated Steam Deck Playable and works great on Desktop Linux with Proton.</p>
<p>You can buy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Palworld on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Vampire Survivors gets a AAAA update with functional doors, a train and rail kart racing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Poking a bit of fun at Ubisoft for calling Skull and Bones "AAAA", poncle have released a fresh free update to Vampire Survivors with the AAAA Laborratory update.</p>
<p>That's right your favourite and the original survivor-like that spawned a great many clones is back to suck you in for many more hours. Yes, they did also spell it with the double r, it's the Laborratory update. The trailer is a real treat too poking fun at big publishers (and themselves) about "hyper realistic" characters, "immersive door opening action", trains and my favourite "fully rendered running animations". Oh there's also some go-karting on tracks because why not right?</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Tgn_XyvtOro"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/80513b6415c0735e425870ef88f1d7be.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Tgn_XyvtOro" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>New content:</p>
<ul>
<li>7 new EXTRA achievements.</li>
<li>1 new challenge stage.</li>
<li>1 new bonus stage.</li>
<li>1 new character.</li>
<li>1 new weapon with its evolution.</li>
<li>1 new passive weapon.</li>
<li>1 new power-up, Seal III.</li>
</ul>
<p>They also said in the release <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1794680/view/4104540932629694732" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> that work for co-op online play support is going well, but it's too early for them to go into details on it. More Adventures are planned too, but for now they're working on something secret for the base game before coming back to releasing more.</p>
<p>Vampire Survivors is Steam Deck Verified and also has a (unadvertised) Native Linux version.</p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Steam page</a>.</p>

      <title>The huge life-sim Life by You from Paradox hits Early Access on June 4</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What could potentially be a The Sims killer, Paradox Interactive plan to finally launch Life by You into Early Access on June 4th after multiple delays.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Paradox didn't have another trailer ready for this new release date announcement. However, the team at Paradox Tectonic, which is led by Rod Humble formerly of Electronic Arts have been putting up regular development update videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@lifebyyou/videos" rel="noopener" target="_blank">YouTube</a> going over various features. A few of the videos include partnering up with popular YouTuber FakeGamerGirl like this one going through some gameplay:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wXnAL_642Gc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/55e96b088a81c954ba0b74c64085a7e2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wXnAL_642Gc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It definitely looks very much like The Sims, only clearly a bit rougher around the edges.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Play in an open world: Live life with no loading screens. Strike up real-language conversations. Drive or bike to the countryside. Discover and complete quests to unlock new experiences.</li>
<li>Tell stories through conversations: Every real-language conversation is generated based on your human’s unique situation. You can even craft your own conversations in-game.</li>
<li>Expand your creativity: Make your own in-game content through mods. Utilize a variety of deep Creator Tools. Change the gameplay anytime. Life is yours to make -and break.</li>
<li>Take direct control: Drag and drop your humans into their place - or drive them directly in third-person mode. Live the life of one or tell the stories of many. Climb a career ladder. Fall in love. Raise a family.</li>
<li>Design your own world: Build your humans’ dream homes or businesses from scratch. Furnish them from top to bottom, inside to outside. Drag, demolish, and rearrange entire towns.</li>
<li>Create fully customized humans: Design your families in the Human Creator, including deep personality and character traits. Style and restyle your humans at any time.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2358660/Life_by_You/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Will you be taking a look at it when it releases? Hopefully it will work well with Proton outside of the usual expected bugs from an Early Access game. </p>

      <title>NVIDIA 550.78 released fixing issues for RTX 4xxx series GPUs notebooks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Towards the end of April, NVIDIA released the <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/download/driverResults.aspx/224458/en-uk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">550.78</a> driver and if you use a notebook with a RTX 4xxx series GPU you may want to update for this one.</p>
<p>This is <em>not</em> the exciting release we're all waiting for that adds in Explicit Sync support, as last we heard that should be due <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/egl-wayland/pull/104#issuecomment-2010292221" rel="noopener" target="_blank">around</a> May 15th with the new 555 Beta series.</p>
<p>For this release the one-liner is:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a regression that led to Xid errors when loading the NVIDIA driver on some notebook systems with RTX 4xxx series GPUs. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you have a notebook that had this issue on Linux? Did this driver fix it? Let me know in the comments.</p>
<p>There was also another earlier driver update I missed with version <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/download/driverResults.aspx/224033/en-uk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">550.76</a> from April 16th:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that could prevent the driver from initializing on some systems running RHEL 9.3.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Albion Online now officially launched in Europe and MENA regions</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Albion Online the MMO from Sandbox Interactive has now formally opened the gates for Europe and MENA (Middle East and North Africa) with their brand new server.</p>
<p>This will give players in those regions "substantially improved ping" the developers say, along with a fresh start for everyone playing on them. This is the third server introduced to the game alongside Albion Americas and Albion Asia, although the new one does have certain initial <a href="https://forum.albiononline.com/index.php/Thread/195377-Europe-Server-World-Size-Starting-Conditions/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">restrictions</a> for now.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/946867521714391172gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/946867521714391172gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Albion Online is a sandbox MMORPG featuring full-loot combat, a fully player-driven economy, and a classless "you are what you wear" skill system. The game is fully cross-platform, playable across Linux, macOS, Windows, iOS and Android with a single account.</p>
<p><span style="background-color:var(--article-main-background); color:var(--font-color); font-size:17px">Launch trailer:</span></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xPyw4nZlGNA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5c0f8d0b8462c922b7f4029e8b2d9ae3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xPyw4nZlGNA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>New Server Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A new and untouched version of the game, where all players start as equals and can claim their own piece of Albion.</li>
<li>A game world that is fully separate and independent from the existing US and Asia servers.</li>
<li>Greatly improved connection speeds and ping for the whole Europe and MENA region.</li>
<li>Timings of game and server events (territory battles, Crystal League, Faction Warfare, maintenance, etc.) that are optimized for the region.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The event timing is a big one. For players in Europe / UK the timings on events in this and other games always being Americanised gets quite <em>annoying</em>. So now you'll be able to do them on your own time, which is probably the most exciting thing about this.</p>
<p>Albion Online has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Playable.</p>
<p>Play via their <a href="https://albiononline.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/761890/Albion_Online/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>The big hit medieval strategy game Manor Lords works well on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Manor Lords is currently another 2024 release smashing through the charts on Steam! Coming from developer Slavic Magic and publisher Hooded Horse, it's certainly impressive. <em>Note: personal purchase, but publisher did send a key that I missed - woops.</em></p>
<p>A game that blends together a medieval city-builder with a full RTS game where you try to take over neighbouring lands, it's a really interesting mix that will suck away a lot of your time.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this Early Access release already works rather well on Desktop Linux thanks to Proton. I've been testing it with Proton 9, and apart from the pop-over tutorial videos being <a href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9806438631714388874gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blank</a>, it's been smooth-sailing. That is the <em>only</em> Linux-specific issue I've encountered with it so far as all other issues seem to be present on Windows too from reports I've seen on Steam.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="S7MnkE_qxj8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7af371e922bbbfe16fb72682688d6e43.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/S7MnkE_qxj8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Testing on my main desktop system with Proton 9 (Beta): Kubuntu Linux 23.10, AMD Ryzen 5800X, Radeon RX 6800 XT with Mesa 24.0.6 at a 2560x1440 resolution with the settings cranked up to the maximum (with FSR on Quality) it has been performing really well above 100FPS.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6657768281714388872gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6657768281714388872gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I'm going to be spending a lot more time with this one as so far I am thoroughly captured by the setting, the mechanics, the visuals and pretty much everything about it. There's certain rough edges though of course, with it being Early Access (where the dev estimates another year to finish it) but fantastic so far. It can be quite a challenge too, especially with how construction depends on having Oxen, if you're dumb (like me) and allow them to all run away early on, you're pretty much screwed. There's no doubt going to be plenty of tweaks to the balancing on that, but I gather it's not supposed to exactly be easy and you will learn from your mistakes as I did.</p>
<p>What blows my mind is that Manor Lords is mostly the work of solo developer Greg Styczeń. It goes to show what small teams can accomplish. Publisher Hooded Horse <a href="https://twitter.com/HoodedHorseInc/status/1784333658297626810" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mentioned</a> on X (formerly Twitter) that Manor Lords has already sold over 1 million copies in only about a day. They said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since yesterday's launch Manor Lords has already sold over 1 million copies &amp; hit a peak Steam concurrent player count of 170k - highest ever for a city builder (or for other different genres like GSG/4x/colony sim).</p>
</blockquote>

      <title>Zink driver startup time squashed with new patches</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Mike Blumenkrantz is once again blogging about working on the Zink driver, and this time a nice optimization is on the way for startup times.</p>
<p>As a brief refresher on Zink from the Mesa documentation: "The Zink driver is a Gallium driver that emits Vulkan API calls instead of targeting a specific GPU architecture. This can be used to get full desktop OpenGL support on devices that only support Vulkan.".</p>
<p>One problem that has been encountered recently was slow startup times, specifically some testing has been done against a GTK4 demo. In <a href="https://www.supergoodcode.com/startup/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the blog post</a>, Blumenkrantz notes how on the Iris driver (Intel) the average startup time for the gtk4-demo was "between 190-200ms" but on Zink it was between "350-370ms".</p>
<p>After profiling and getting some <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/28955" rel="noopener" target="_blank">patches</a> made to move more of the work into more threads, they've been able to reduce the startup time to an average of around "average of 260-280ms, a 25% improvement". Nice.</p>
<p>This isn't the end though, Blumenkrantz said investigation is ongoing and hopefully they will get it closer to the startup times on Iris.</p>
<p>Overall it might not sound like a huge amount when talking milliseconds, but every bit counts and getting apps and games to startup quickly is obviously a nice improvement overall.</p>

<p>Sleepytime Village is inspired by games like Monkey Island and Broken Sword, and TV shows such as In The Night Garden, Moon &amp; Me and Life on Mars. You’ll awake in a mysterious children’s storybook village, with clues and puzzles driving you forward to learn why you ended up here and - more importantly - how to get out! </p>
<p>Currently funding on Kickstarter, the developer hopes to get £12,000 by June 3rd. Check out the teaser:</p>

      <title>VR game Alien: Rogue Incursion releases late 2024</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oh damn, this is quite exciting as an Alien fan and might be a reason to pop my VR headset back on again. Alien: Rogue Incursion is coming sometime in late 2024. I only hope that Valve can keep improving SteamVR on Linux, which <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/steamvr-beta-linux-fixes-plus-beta-updates-for-desktop-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">we had some fixes for recently</a>.</p>
<p>Coming from Survios, an industry-leading virtual reality studio, in collaboration with 20th Century Games, they said it will be releasing "Holiday 2024" so it's most likely around December.</p>
<p>It has only just been announced so details are still quite light and their announcement video didn't actually show anything:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uaYbugGRV3c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/95e1d6c3e583ae21d0a1c64104b611ae.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uaYbugGRV3c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it from the press release:</p>
<p><em>Alien: Rogue Incursion</em> fully immerses players in a harrowing VR journey deep into the <em>Alien</em> universe with an all-new storyline of an ultimate mission that tests their courage, wits, and skill to survive the terrors of the “Perfect Organism.”</p>
<p>“Our team at Survios are huge fans of <em>Alien</em> and have been building <em>Alien: Rogue Incursion</em> for a long time, honing our ability to pair the most technically advanced, immersive, and engaging VR experiences with best-in-class franchises,” said <strong>TQ Jefferson, Chief Product Officer </strong>at <strong>Survios</strong>. “This fully original story embraces all our favorite elements from 45 years of <em>Alien</em>, from kinetic action and heart-pounding exploration to our terrifyingly resourceful Xenomorphs that will truly make your skin crawl. We can’t wait for fans to get their hands on it this holiday season.”</p>
<p>Look, if this is even remotely anything like Alien: Isolation, I'm already sold. Terrifying.</p>

      <title>Bazzite 3.0 out now with Steam Deck OLED support nearly ready</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bazzite 3.0 has been released with the internals upgraded to Fedora 40, which brings with it numerous improvements for gamers looking to get Linux on their PC or handheld gaming device like a Steam Deck or ROG Ally.</p>
<p><em>A great alternative to SteamOS, which is still exclusive to the Steam Deck from Valve.</em></p>
<p>For Steam Deck OLED support they said it's ready to the point that "it should be mostly functional", however there's at least one major issue left which "has to do with audio crashing when switching to Desktop Mode" and some other issues related to HDR support.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5866340771714380987gol1.jpg"/></p>

<li>Added <a href="https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide" rel="noopener" target="_blank">zoxide</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The future for it sounds pretty bright with them working on various background improvements, like an easier workflow for getting needed kernel patches sorted in Fedora. They said they have "a clear vision about the project and have goals for the future reflecting that vision". More on that in the <a href="https://universal-blue.discourse.group/t/announcing-bazzite-3-0/1218" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a>.</p>

      <title>Open source evolution sim Thrive gets upgraded to Godot 4</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A game engine upgrade across a major version is quite a big thing, and it initially proved a little problematic for the open source evolution sim Thrive but it is done.</p>
<p>What is Thrive? In Thrive, you take control of an organism on an alien planet, beginning with the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA). Your goal is to survive in the environment, adapt your species by adding mutations, and thrive. Other species will emerge to compete with yours. They will evolve via a population dynamics driven simulation with random mutations - you must improve and spread your species to surpass them. The success of your species depends both on your skill in surviving as an individual cell and the changes you make in the editor.</p>
<p>In their <a href="https://revolutionarygamesstudio.com/devblog-41-godot-4-is-here/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a> the developers mentioned for this update it was "pretty painful to upgrade to" Godot 4, but the improvements should be worth it for improved performance and Godot's new Vulkan renderer and this was all "necessary for the long-term future of Thrive as the game". One of the actual visual changes I'm happy to see in this release is cells no longer just flashing when eating, thanks to some additional shader magic you'll see the food getting engulfed.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="45Fy6j_gNx4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f889d4f330ff15cf3116f8bcd5bb8f97.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/45Fy6j_gNx4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Full patch notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Updated to Godot 4.2.2 (we were previously on 3.5 so this is a massive upgrade).</li>
<li>Updated to .NET 8 runtime and C# 12 as it turns out this can be used with Godot 4.</li>
<li>New engulf animation that creates wave lines instead of the old just flashing blue animation.</li>
<li>Oxygen now has different levels in different patches which affects the utility of certain parts a ton.</li>
<li>There's now a native library variant that doesn't require AVX, this should make Thrive playable again on some older CPUs.</li>
<li>Arabic fallback font had to be removed as it caused buggy line heights in all text in Godot 4.</li>
<li>Osmoregulation cost values are now shown in red as it is a negative property.</li>
<li>Engulfment storage full tutorial now has an end trigger once the player has digested enough things.</li>
<li>Fixed new player species name not immediately applying after exiting the editor.</li>
<li>Fixed new cell button crashing multicellular freebuild editor.</li>
<li>Fixed data cache disposed errors that only seemed to trigger in exported version of the game.</li>
<li>Fixed no changes in editor tutorial being able to prevent multicellular editor exit.</li>
<li>Memory usage metrics now works on Windows.</li>
<li>Fixed CPU check only checking AVX and not AVX 2 which was then used anyway causing a crash on CPUs that have AVX but not AVX2.</li>
<li>Switched the AVX feature check to use standard C# function, which is hopefully more accurate than the previous approach that we got reports about false negatives.</li>
<li>Tweaked wording on the fallback opengl renderer use and disabled the 3D backgrounds again for that as they still aren't fully correct.</li>
<li>Updated our colour picker customizations for Godot 4 (pick from game window seems to not work currently on Linux).</li>
<li>Removed our custom checkbox implementation now that Godot's has all the needed features.</li>
<li>Switched from the previously used tar compression library to C# standard one which shouldn't have any save corruption issues (due to this we were stuck on an old version of the compression library).</li>
<li>Added check to tools against omitting part of a version number this removes potential for a mistake that almost was in 0.6.5.</li>
<li>Added simple C#-code-only unit tests for a few things.</li>
<li>Converted some things to use direct references instead of NodePaths.</li>
<li>There's now a nix flake for Thrive developers.</li>
<li>Updated our documentation impacted by the upgrade to Godot 4.</li>
<li>Updated Jolt physics engine to newest version.</li>
<li>Updated YamlDotNet from 15.1.1 to 15.1.2.</li>
<li>Updated AngleSharp from 1.1.0 to 1.1.2.</li>
<li>Updated code checking tools version.</li>
<li>Updated translations.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Golf With Your Friends adds a hilarious new Speed Golf mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Grab your friends and play something resembling Golf in the latest free update to Golf With Your Friends, which adds in a new rather funny looking Speed Golf mode. </p>
<p>The idea here is to forget about par and the number of shots taken, it's all about how fast you are. It's a furious race to putt your ball before everyone else and score points based on how quickly you can do this. To help with this it brings in a new handbrake feature, letting you slow your ball down at specific moments to set up for another quick shot. And like something out of Sonic or Mario Kart, there's special speed gates to give you a boost.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ohy2xwlmg4o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/eee1c33c59657a7bfc78cba198fd49f6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ohy2xwlmg4o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>New Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Speed is king in the brand new Speed Golf mode! Take your positions on the starting line and race to the hole to claim first place. Speed Golf is available to play online or offline on any course, including all workshop content! Speed Golf can even be experienced in teams play for an all new team racing experience.</li>
<li>New game setting options are now available for Speed Golf players. Race to the hole in an anything goes ruleset where only time matters, or add time penalties for every stroke taken to reward both speed and accuracy.</li>
<li>All courses have been turbo charged with brand new Turbo Charge Boosters! Passing through boosters allow you to reach speeds and take routes never before possible.</li>
<li>Turbo Charge Boosters are also now available to use in the Level Editor in order to turbo charge your own creations!</li>
<li>Sometimes slowing down is the best way to speed up. The new handbrake feature allows you to slow your roll, opening up new ways for you to save yourself valuable seconds, or you know, just save yourself.</li>
<li>The brand new “Critical Hit” pack (DLC) is now available featuring 10 new cosmetic items based on the spoils of a particularly fruitful party’s campaign. This pack includes 4 Hats, 2 Floaties, 2 Trails and 2 Stickers.</li>
</ul>

      <title>SteamVR Beta gets Linux fixes, plus Beta updates for Desktop and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Three sets of Steam Beta updates this weekend across SteamVR, Desktop and Steam Deck so here's all the details for you in one place.</p>
<p>Firstly, the SteamVR Beta <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/250820/view/4207000995142471429" rel="noopener" target="_blank">v2.5.3</a> comes with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Steam Link:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix an issue with video encoder initialization on certain AMD integrated GPUs.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Linux:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved launch scripts and log capture for bug reports.</li>
<li>Fixed uninitialized memory in right eye.</li>
<li>Fixed SteamVR Home launch script.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Really nice to see some VR fixes for Linux, which is pretty much always in a rough state.</p>
<p>There's one Steam Deck specific adjustment in the latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4202497395516169013" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Beta</a> which is:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Settings-&gt;Storage will now display drives that are missing a steam library as format targets.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And all these <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/4173223997929872639?snr=2___" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changes</a> below affect both Steam Deck and Desktop:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Big Picture</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where after playing a game it would require extra B button presses to back out of the game's library page.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Linux</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a case where the store tab would fail to display any content after maximizing the steam window.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>New Configurator feature "Swap Left with Right": While editing a Controller Configuration, you can Swap the behavior of the Left Stick and the Right Stick, or Left Trackpad and Right Trackpad etc. Highlight the source you want to swap in the "Edit Layout" page, and the "Y" button should appear to allow the swap. This should be handy for "South Paws".</li>
<li>New Mouse Action: "Turn to Face Direction". When activating this, the camera will turn to face the direction you are pushing on the Left Stick (default - Track pads, DPads and Buttons can also be used). Can be combined with "Reset to Horizon" to produce a behavior similar to Splatoon's camera reset button. Note: Dots per 360 must be calibrated for this to be accurate.</li>
<li>New Mouse Action: "Dots per 360 Calibration". By default this will generate 360 degrees of rotation. You can use this to tune the Dots per 360 value in the Flick Stick / Gyro To Mouse modes.</li>
<li>Gyro to Joystick modes now no longer generate haptic events when outside the active range.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Proton Hotfix update fixes Fallout 4 frame pacing issue on Steam Deck OLED</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just recently we had the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/fallout-4-next-gen-update-out-now-and-steam-deck-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fallout 4 "next gen" update</a>, which came with some issues. Thankfully, Valve are on the case with Proton Hotfix.</p>
<p>For those not aware: Proton Hotfix is a special version of Proton, the compatibility layer to run Windows games on Linux and Steam Deck, which gets updated at times for specific games. So when Valve aren't ready to roll out the changes to the main Proton version or even Proton Experimental, they use Proton Hotfix. It's all about getting a quick-fix out when needed.</p>
<p>The main problem in the new Fallout 4 update is that it caused various frame pacing issues, making it quite <em>annoying</em> to play on the Steam Deck OLED model. Thankfully, as announced by Valve developer<br/>
Pierre-Loup Griffais on X (formerly Twitter) this should no longer be an issue as they <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1783912978221568116" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said</a>: "A Proton Hotfix has been deployed for a Fallout 4 frame pacing issue on Deck OLED.".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img 4="" a="" alt="Pierre-Loup Griffais said " been="" deck="" deployed="" fallout="" for="" frame="" has="" hotfix="" issue="" oled""="" on="" pacing="" proton="" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16800148971714160292gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Another issue as mentioned in our previous article, is just <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/skyrim-special-edition-updated-with-steam-deck-support-ultrawide-res-bug-fixes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">like Bethesda did with Skyrim</a>, the launcher has been removed for Steam Deck so changing graphical options isn't possible. Unless you turn off the Steam Deck detection with this launch option: <code class="inline-code">SteamDeck=0 %command%</code>.</p>
<p>You can buy Fallout 4 from:</p>

      <title>Factorio devs detail their &#39;Linux adventures&#39; in a new blog post</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Factorio from Wube Software currently has an expansion and big update on the way, with regular blog posts going over all that's coming. The latest has some fun behind the scenes info on their Linux adventures.</p>
<p>The post is detailed in <a href="https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-408" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Friday Facts #408</a>, which goes over all sorts of things but I felt it worth highlighting because one developer, raiguard, clearly puts a lot of effort and love into their official Native Linux version. As mentioned by raiguard they were originally making mods for the game since 2019 and eventually joined Wube Software in 2023 with their primary goals being "expansion programming and Linux support, as well as being an advocate for the modding community" and they daily-drive Linux on their own system too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13834164771714140190gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13834164771714140190gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>And the subject of why don't more games support Linux comes up, here's what raiguard said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Why don't most games support macOS and Linux?" is a sentiment I often see echoed across the internet. Supporting a new platform is a lot more than just changing some flags and hitting compile. Windows, macOS, Linux, and the Nintendo Switch all use different compilers, different implementations of the C++ standard library, and have different implementation quirks, bugs, and features. You need to set up CI for the new platform, expand your build system to support the new compiler(s) and architecture(s), and have at least one person on the team that cares enough about the platform to actively maintain it. If you are a video game, you will likely need to add support for another graphics backend (Vulkan or OpenGL) as well, since DirectX is Windows-exclusive.</p>
<p>Many developers will take one look at the <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Windows market share</a> and decide that it is not worth the trouble to support other platforms. Also, with the meteoric rise of the Steam Deck and Proton, it is easier than ever for game developers to ignore Linux support because Valve does some black magic that lets their game run anyway.</p>
<p>Factorio supports macOS and Linux so well because there has always been someone at Wube who actively uses these platforms and is willing to take on the burden of supporting it. Our native <a href="https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-371" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Apple Silicon</a> support is a great example of this. Today, I will take you through some of the adventures I've had with maintaining Factorio's Linux support.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After that raiguard goes over the fun of add Wayland support to the game, client-side window decorations, the game having seizures when the window was resized, dependency hell, clipboard issues and more.</p>
<p>The blog post is worth a read for the more technical side of game development and Linux support, especially in an area where Linux is in quite a bit of flux due to Wayland, Pipewire and more.</p>
<p>Factorio is available to buy on <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/factorio?as=1636858786" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/factorio?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Lefties unite! Counter-Strike 2 now lets you swap hands</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>All you Lefties out there can finally get properly represented, in Counter-Strike 2 that is, as there's now the ability to swap your weapons into the other hand.</p>
<p>The latest update to CS2 adds in weapon hand swapping, with an option to set your preferred hand. Plus there's a keybind to swap around mid-game too whenever you feel like it. Nice. I know, this isn't truly breaking news but hey - it's nice to see such a feature for those that want it right?</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8818294091714130943gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The buy menu was also updated with some new tricks too like showing you the minimum amount of cash you'll have next round to make purchase planning a bit easier, and there's now a dropped weapons panel where you can see and actually pick up any weapons around you dropped by you or teammates. Sound quite useful!</p>
<p>Other UI changes include a line-up reticle for grenade throwing, along with new hotkeys to adjust the radar map zoom level actually during a match. There's also a scoreboard on the ESC menu now, a kill feed icon for in-air kills and an icon to show bots on the scoreboard.</p>
<p>Plus various other <a href="https://www.counter-strike.net/news/updates" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changes</a>.</p>
<p>Personally, I'm just waiting for Danger Zone 2.0. I feel a bit lost with it, it was good fun. Do you think Valve will bring it back for Counter-Strike 2.0? With the big engine upgrades they could probably do a lot more with it now too.</p>

      <title>Dome Keeper is getting a major content update and multiplayer is coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>An absolute indie gem released in 2022 is Dome Keeper from developer Bippinbits that has you mine underground for resources, while you also defend your dome above land from aliens. It's good fun and some big updates are on the way.</p>
<p>Teased in a <a href="https://discord.com/invite/AxYpX7AaFP" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Discord</a> post the developer noted this upcoming update is "the biggest update dome has seen so far" with the focus on "increasing the replayability and run variety". They're going to be adding in "about as many new gadgets as there are already in the game and also make them much more powerful with supplements". That's only part of what's to come for the update.</p>
<p>Also they're porting the game from <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> v3 to v4 that will bring various improvements, and help towards their other big plan to at some point add in full multiplayer support. However, before multiplayer comes, their focus on adding in more content for replayability has been their most common feedback which is why that's the initial focus.</p>

<p>You can pick it up on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1637320/Dome_Keeper/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> with the <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/dome_keeper?as=1636858786" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a> version only being for Windows.</p>

      <title>Check out the free spooky fan game Aliens: Redacted</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>To celebrate Alien Day, one developer decided to make a fan game with Aliens: Redacted now available on itch.io. Only officially available for Windows, I've confirmed it does run well with Wine 9.7.</p>
<p>Giving some big Alien Trilogy vibes that was released back in 1996 for PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and MS-DOS this dark and spooky shooter is worth a run through if you're an Aliens fan and you love retro games. I put quite a few hours into Alien Trilogy on the Saturn and remember it terrifying me. I am also big Aliens nut, so this was an instant-play for me.</p>

      <title>Open source NVIDIA Vulkan driver NVK gets more enhancements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Faith Ekstrand has written up a fresh <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/blog/2024/04/25/re-converging-control-flow-on-nvidia-gpus/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post on Collabora</a> which goes over implementing two extensions in NVK, the open source NVIDIA Vulkan driver, and how it ended up fixing actual games.</p>
<p>It's quite a long technical post talking about the VK_KHR_shader_maximal_reconvergence and VK_KHR_shader_subgroup_uniform_control_flow extensions, and how the initial support from Ekstrand were flawed, but now the extensions have been completely re-done.</p>
<p>I'm not going to quote much of the post, since unless you're doing driver development or you're about 100x smarter than me, it probably won't make a whole lot of sense. What I will do is sum it up for you to point out that this driver is getting more and more capable of actually playing games and displaying them properly. As Ekstrand showed, this work has actually fixed a real game.</p>
<p>A screenshots was shown off of rendering corruptions in Genshin Impact:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19159138731714122854gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19159138731714122854gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You'll notice some weird rendering artifacts in the image above, but now it looks much better:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8403527981714122896gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8403527981714122896gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Why? Turns out fixing these new extensions also fixed "an ancient 3D graphics feature in an actual game". Since it fixes issues in one game, it no doubt fixes issues in others too.</p>
<p>Great stuff. Can't wait to see how NVK continues to evolve. Especially as it seems NVIDIA themselves are now <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/nvidia-developer-contributing-to-the-open-source-nvk-driver/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">beginning to contribute to it too</a>.</p>

      <title>Microsoft open sources MS-DOS 4.0</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>More open source surprises for you today, coming from Microsoft too which is always interesting to see as they've now open sourced MS-DOS 4.0.</p>
<p>Added into their existing MS-DOS repository on <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/MS-DOS" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a> which already had MS-DOS v1.25 and v2.0, they've now expanded it to include MS-DOS v4.0 which was jointly developed by IBM and Microsoft. This is all available under the permissive MIT license.</p>
<p>From the repo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The MS-DOS v1.25 and v2.0 files <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/microsoft-ms-dos-early-source-code/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">were originally shared at the Computer History Museum on March 25th, 2014</a> and are being (re)published in this repo to make them easier to find, reference-to in external writing and works, and to allow exploration and experimentation for those interested in early PC Operating Systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They're doing this for "historical reference and will be kept static" so they're not accepting pull requests, but that doesn't stop someone forking them and doing pretty much whatever they want now it's all under the MIT license. Great news for preservation.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see if they eventually keep going adding in more later versions, and perhaps even get some earlier versions of Windows up too. Now that would truly be something don't you think?</p>
<p>There's a fun little tidbit of history in the Microsoft <a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/opensource/2024/04/25/open-sourcing-ms-dos-4-0/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a> on it with the code being found on some old floppy disks.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA developer contributing to the open source NVK driver</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another surprise from NVIDIA here. On top of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/former-nouveau-driver-lead-joins-nvidia-and-sent-a-massive-patch-set/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">one developer contributing to Nouveau</a>, we have another developer now contributing to NVK.</p>
<p>This time around it's Arthur Huillet, who opened a <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/28937" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Merge Request</a> titled "nvk: implement conservative rasterization (all GPUs)" which implements the VK_EXT_conservative_rasterization extension support, which is part of what's needed for Direct3D Feature Level 12.1 in VKD3D-Proton.</p>
<p>From the MR:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Implement conservative rasterization</h4>
<p>This is based on Benjamin's work in <a href="/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/25668" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="nvk: implement VK_EXT_conservative_rasterization">!25668</a>, but with fixes.</p>
<p>Not testing on pre-Volta yet, but matches Benjamin's code except for minor fixes.</p>
<p>Our commits with the same name will need to be squashed before submission, but I left it as that for review in order to more clearly show the differences.</p>
<p>AD102 testing:</p>
<pre>
deqp-vk --deqp-case='*conservative*'
Test run totals:
  Passed:        250/11777 (2.1%)
  Failed:        0/11777 (0.0%)
  Not supported: 11527/11777 (97.9%)
  Warnings:      0/11777 (0.0%)
  Waived:        0/11777 (0.0%)</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Really fun to see more NVIDIA developers officially contribute to the open source drivers. Hopefully this really is a taste of what's to come. Imagine having AMD, Intel and NVIDIA <em>all</em> having good open source Linux drivers. That might not actually be a dream for too much longer it seems.</p>

      <title>Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat) is now available</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another big Linux distribution release is upon us. Ubuntu 24.04 is a new long-term support release from Canonical available today.</p>
<p>Since it's an LTS it will be supported until June 2029. Although Canonical do suggest waiting for the first point release if you're on the previous LTS for the best experience possible. The point release Ubuntu 24.04.1 is due out August 15th, 2024.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5199158591714063157gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5199158591714063157gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Ubuntu 24.04 LTS with Dark Sode</em></p>
<p>I went through various changes in the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/ubuntu-2404-lts-noble-numbat-beta-released/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">article going over the recent Beta</a> but to reiterate some of the goodies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher vm.max_map_count (1048576) to stop various games crashing (matches Fedora and Arch).</li>
<li>Linux kernel 6.8 with lots of new and improved hardware support.</li>
<li>Mesa 24.0.5 open source graphics drivers.</li>
<li>The first LTS release supporting the Raspberry Pi 5 with both arm64 server and desktop images.</li>
<li>Updated to GNOME 46.</li>
<li>A more modern slimmer version of the Ubuntu font family is now shipped as standard.</li>
<li>Lots of software updates like Firefox 124, LibreOffice 24.2, Thunderbird 115 (now a Snap package), BlueZ 5.72, Pipewire 1.0.4, OpenJDK LTS 21 now the default and so on.</li>
<li>Various security improvements like the Ubuntu kernel now restricting the use of unprivileged user namespaces. I suggest <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/noble-numbat-release-notes/39890#security-improvements-14" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reading</a> a little more into that specifically, as it sounds a bit complicated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Full release notes on <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/noble-numbat-release-notes/39890" rel="noopener" target="_blank">their Discourse Forum</a>.</p>
<p>Will you be upgrading, or switching to Ubuntu for this latest release? Let me know what you're excited about from it in the comments. As a Kubuntu user since I prefer KDE Plasma, I'll be upgrading at some point over the next week.</p>

      <title>SteamOS 3.5.19 for Steam Deck out now for everyone</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After two recent Preview releases of SteamOS for Steam Deck, Valve has now put out the latest Stable update for everyone with SteamOS 3.5.19 code-named "Grey Park Seagull".</p>
<p>If you were hoping that Valve would actually explain what the recent "stability and security improvements" were from the last two preview releases, you'll be left disappointed. Valve has <em>not</em> detailed what they've changed there as the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4202497395509210057" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release notes</a> are just two lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue causing no sound output in games that open and close audio devices quickly like Super Blood Hockey.</li>
<li>Stability and security improvements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Your guess is as good as mine on that second line; why are Valve being so vague do you think? It's great to see continued updates to the operating system, but giving us more info on what has actually changed would be helpful. Usually Valve are a lot more clear in their release notes.</p>
<p>Is there a Steam Deck bug you're hoping to see solved soon? Let me know in the comments.</p>

      <title>Dr. Robotnik&#39;s Ring Racers released after 5 years of development</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sonic fans will love this one! Dr. Robotnik's Ring Racers builds upon the idea of its predecessor SRB2Kart, a kart racing game built on the fangame <a href="https://www.srb2.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sonic Robo Blast 2</a>, itself based on a modified version of Doom Legacy. In the announcement they said it's taken 5 years to get here but it's finally out (although a Linux Flatpak is due "soon"). It's open source too under the GPL listed on <a href="https://github.com/KartKrewDev/RingRacers" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>More from the developer: "The meticulously crafted pixel and 3D art, catchy music and sounds, elaborate level design, and tightly tuned gameplay all come together into a complete product we are immensely proud to present to you, entirely for free." Features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A ludicrously long list of courses and playable characters.</li>
<li>A complete Grand Prix mode with CPU opponents and multiple difficulty levels.</li>
<li>New and revamped items.</li>
<li>Unique game systems and mechanics.</li>
<li>Local split-screen multiplayer up to 4 players, and online play up to 16.</li>
<li>A comprehensive Time Attack mode with replay support.</li>
<li>A wealth of secrets to find.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Fallout 4 &#39;Next Gen&#39; update out now and Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, here it is Vault Dwellers, the big update to Fallout 4 you've been waiting on after binge-watching the Fallout show. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/377160/view/4182230563212382085" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> goes over all the changes, which includes stuff for consoles we are of course not bothered about here but the rest of it sounds pretty good.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7137613931714058369gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7137613931714058369gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>This update includes getting the game officially Steam Deck Verified, which Valve tested on Proton 9 that is now set as the default for it. The problem is that they've hidden the launcher, just <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/skyrim-special-edition-updated-with-steam-deck-support-ultrawide-res-bug-fixes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">like they did with Skyrim</a>, but you can get it back in the same way with this Steam launch option: <code class="inline-code">SteamDeck=0 %command%</code> if you do wish to change some graphics settings.</p>
<p>There's also proper ultra-wide support, an "Installed Content" menu, along with new Creation Club items that has two quests attached. The "Echoes of the Past" quest that can give you:</p>
<ul>
<li>X-02 Power Armor</li>
<li>Hellfire Power Armor</li>
<li>Heavy Incinerator</li>
<li>Tesla Cannon</li>
<li>Enclave Weapon Skins</li>
<li>Enclave Armor Skins</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus the "When Pigs Fly" quest that gives you a Makeshift Weapon Pack which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two grenade launchers</li>
<li>A Nail Gun</li>
<li>Baseball Launcher</li>
<li>Saw Blade launcher</li>
<li>Piggy bank based weaponry</li>
</ul>
<p>All the rest of it:</p>
<blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Resolved issues preventing Japanese and Chinese users from connecting to Bethesda.net (this restores access to Mods).</li>

      <title>Fantasy city-builder Songs of Syx is approaching the end-game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Songs of Syx is approaching the end-game now with a new Beta release out for version 66, which as usual has tons of changes for this massive city-building strategy game. This update needs you to opt into the Beta until it's released for everyone.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1162750/view/4186734162838053539" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> the developer mentioned a recent sale, plus the game being picked up by the YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oucHl9NM97g" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SsethTzeentach</a>, which led to the game once again doing well on Steam going into the Top 20 worldwide briefly which ended up giving the developer "6 months normal revenue in 24h" — wow.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1162750/view/7377534039862149085" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a> for v66 is pretty big and the developer mentioned it's likely the last before the big 1.0 release, with the focus on mid to late game. This includes a new campaign engine, the tutorial was turned into a campaign, scripting for generating random games, different scenario options for modders, 14 new soundtracks, big improvements to the save system, various artwork improvements and the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>See their big overview of the update below:</p>

      <title>Garry&#39;s Mod forced to remove Nintendo content after takedowns</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Facepunch issued an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/4000/view/4200245595694413052" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> for Garry's Mod players, to explain that a whole lot of user content is being taken down due to Nintendo.</p>
<p>Posted on the Steam page titled "Nintendo stuff on Steam Workshop", Facepunch mentioned they're working through removing all Nintendo related content from the Steam Workshop. A bunch is already gone but due to there being 20 years of uploads it will take time to go through it all.</p>
<p>Facepunch said "This is not a mistake, the takedowns came from Nintendo" and that they feel it's "fair enough". As we all know, Nintendo do often go after any unauthorised use of their characters and IP and so mods for other games get included in that.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/4000/discussions/5/4211497623308213915/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">some</a> believed the takedown requests were fraudulent. This led Facepunch's Garry Newman to <a href="https://twitter.com/garrynewman/status/1783374453562290376" rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> on X (formerly Twitter) to say "Yes, we have got your emails and dms, we have seen your threads, we're doing our own investigations. We need to take these things seriously (particularly from Nintendo), but we also can't let people misuse DMCA takedowns.", and then followed it up to <a href="https://twitter.com/garrynewman/status/1783501547361411494" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirm</a> it's legit, "I have been assured that the takedowns have been verified by Nintendo as legit, so this will now continue as planned. Sorry."</p>
<p>So there you have to, no more Mario in Garry's Mod.</p>

      <title>Semi-open world paper plane adventure &#39;Paper Sky&#39; coming to Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I do love how indie developers come up with all these unique and quirky game ideas, and now Paper Sky is on the way from developer BRUTE FORCE who also made the dynamic physics platformer Crumble. Crumble was well made and a pretty clever game overall, so I'm keen to see more from this developer.</p>
<p>They've launched a Kickstarter with a goal of 35,000€ EUR, which they have until Fri, May 24 2024 to hit. For those of you who love more casual games, this might be for you. It's going to have Native Linux support, and full testing on Steam Deck. The developer even noted they're planning proper gyroscope integration too for controlling the plane by tilting.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="pFBkgPXEWtM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4331ad3c6c8bf177bb9d529dfd799d57.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/pFBkgPXEWtM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features the developer noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fold your own Paper plane in the first game to ever let you do that.</li>
<li>Dynamic paper transformation, either glide with the paper plane or roll with the paper ball.</li>
<li>10+ hours of relaxing yet challenging gameplay, experimenting with the world and fully exploring the wind flows.</li>
<li>Write your message, and help other players carry on theirs just like they helped yours.</li>
<li>12 unique art styles.</li>
<li>Challenge mode, compete against others to see who can glide the farthest in an online Paper Plane competition using your own folded paper plane.</li>
<li>Customizable plane, beyond its flying capability you will be able to fly your colours.</li>
<li>Play at your own pace - No hard skill checks, no dark souls filtering bosses. If you can't use the skies, use the ground.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a demo on the Steam page but currently only for Windows, so you'll need Proton to test it for now. However, they said the Beta will be available on all platforms. The full release is planned for 2025.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1617230/Paper_Sky/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wishlist / follow on Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bruteforce/paper-sky" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fund it on the Kickstarter</a>.</p>

      <title>Valve makes paid &#39;Advanced Access&#39; a clear feature on Steam now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With more and more AAA publishers putting up special editions of games you can pay extra for, to play a few days before the main release, Valve has formally made "Advanced Access" a thing on Steam.</p>
<p>You know the drill, you've seen it right? "Buy the Deluxe Edition or the Special Edition, and you get to play 3 days before everyone else!" something to that effect anyway. Publishers have been using all sorts of naming and wording for it — until now. On top of Valve adjusting <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/steam-refunds-get-adjusted-to-account-for-pre-release-playtime/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the refund rules</a> recently, this whole Advanced Access thing is now, well — an actual thing on Steam.</p>
<p>Noticed by <a href="https://twitter.com/SteamDB/status/1783058912142360635" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> creator Pavel Djundik on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1785650/TopSpin_2K25/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TopSpin 2K25</a> you'll see this for example:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18923932561713957989gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18923932561713957989gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p><em>Seems like Valve did a bit of a woops there though. The Learn more link actually goes to the <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/6554-ED29-FBDB-1612" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Early Access info</a> page instead of the new <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/453F-5C96-EAC2-9145" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Advanced Access page</a>. I'm sure they'll fix that soon though.</em></p>
<p>At least according to the Advanced Access page, it seems the feature is open to any developer to do this. As Valve say "Games by default will not include an Advanced Access pre-purchase option. This will be setup at the discretion of the developer/publisher creating and selling their products.". So it's not reserved for AAA.</p>
<p>With this getting promoted to be a proper official Steam feature, it's no surprise then to see them going over some of their rules like refunds to ensure people aren't gaming it by playing as much as possible before "release" (what does <em>release</em> even really mean now?) to refund it.</p>
<p>How do you feel about Advanced Access?</p>

      <title>Atari revives Infogrames and acquires Totally Reliable Delivery Service</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Atari are trying more and more to make a proper full comeback now and they've just announced a revival of Infogrames along with acquiring Totally Reliable Delivery Service.</p>
<p>Infogrames returns as a new publishing label, which was well known from the 1980s to early 2000s, with plans to acquire various IP and publish games directly, that "fall outside the core portfolio of IP associated with the Atari brand" and they see "game preservation as a core component of its mission".</p>
<p>“For decades, Infogrames built a reputation as a publisher and developer of amazing and eclectic games, and we are excited to bring it back,” said Wade Rosen, Chairman and CEO of Atari. </p>
<p>As part of this, they've also swallowed up Totally Reliable Delivery Service (which has Linux support) from tinyBuild as their first purchase.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15032684571713954110gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>“With Totally Reliable Delivery Service, Infogrames is starting off with a strong IP that has a loyal and enthusiastic player base,” commented Geoffroy Châteauvieux, Manager of Infogrames LLC. “The Infogrames team will be able to expand upon the strong work of tinyBuild, and re-energize this high-potential franchise.”</p>
<p>In the last year or so we've seen <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/atari-are-acquiring-night-dive-studios/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Atari buy up Nightdive Studios</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/atari-acquires-awesomenauts-swords-soldiers-and-digital-eclipse/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Awesomenauts, Swords &amp; Soldiers and Digital Eclipse</a>, and it seems they plan to keep going. Let's hope they don't end up as another Embracer Group that ends up being the cause of so many job losses they ended up <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/embracer-group-splitting-into-three-companies/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">splitting into three companies</a>.</p>

      <title>Flathub for Linux apps has been given quite the makeover</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://flathub.org" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Flathub</a> is my favourite place to grab various apps for Linux and Steam Deck and it just had a bit of a makeover and it's looking fancy.</p>
<p>The new update brings with it a rotating featured banner with 5 apps updated weekly, an app of the day listing, new grouping for trending apps along with a tabbed section for trending, popular, new and updated. Thanks to their work behind the scenes to get developers to update all their listings to have proper branding and colouring, it's all looking a bit swish.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17311972751713953194gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17311972751713953194gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The tabbed section switch below the featured banners is a good touch, giving you a quick and easy glance at some of the latest and popular. The team on <a href="https://floss.social/@flathub/112315662449987878" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mastodon</a> noted that this has been "almost a year in the making, including tons of work on documentation, backend, frontend, and the actual metadata in apps".</p>
<p>Oh, and according to developer Cassidy James on <a href="https://mastodon.blaede.family/@cassidy/112316204447915007" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mastodon</a> there's now well over 3 million active users of Flathub.</p>
<p>Nice to see Flathub continue to evolve and improve, especially nice with their team actually doing proper verification for apps and games getting listed along with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/flathub-now-prominently-notes-unverified-flatpak-apps/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">noting unverified apps</a>.</p>

      <title>Minecraft v1.20.5 the Armored Paws drop update is live now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mojang have released the latest upgrade to Minecraft with the version 1.20.5 the Armored Paws drop free update out now.</p>
<p>This update brings in the new Armadillo and Armadillo Scutes, Wolf Armor and Wolf variants. Armadillo look pretty cute and fun as a new passive mob that rolls up when it detects certain threats. Good for helping deal with Spiders and Cave Spiders since they will run away from them when not rolled up too. They drop Armadillo Scutes, periodically and when brushed, which is an essential item for crafting the new Wolf Armor.</p>
<p>Not just that there's also a big change to chunk spawning, making the radius more configurable and they've also decreased the default value to give most players a performance boost. More on that in a previous <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-24w03a" rel="noopener" target="_blank">snapshot post</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UKF91_m_B2Q"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/95395dfa46647143207808dcccad753b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UKF91_m_B2Q" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Plenty more was changed in this release too including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The UI has been updated with a fresher look.</li>
<li>Decreased the default size of the spawn chunks and made the value configurable.</li>
<li>Updated the health and damage dealt by Tamed Wolves.</li>
<li>Adjusted spawning conditions for Wolves, allowing them to spawn on Coarse Dirt and Podzol blocks.</li>
<li>Adjusted the texture of the Wolf Collar layer to be more consistent with the new Wolf Armor.</li>
<li>Adjusted passive mobs spawning in Grove biome to only include Rabbits, Foxes and Wolves.</li>
<li>Minor tweaks to existing Blocks, Items and Entities.</li>
<li>Added option to use Japanese variants of CJK characters.</li>
<li>Added support for Viossa language.</li>
<li>When entities leave or enter The End, the area they arrive in will now stay loaded for 15 seconds, matching the behavior of Nether Portals.</li>
<li>Improvements to the Game's Performance.</li>
<li>Improved handling of errors during saving and loading.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Minecraft also now requires Java 21. The full changelog lists rather a lot of changes along with plenty of experimental features you can turn on like the new Mace weapon.</p>

      <title>Ghostwire: Tokyo removed Denuvo Anti-Tamper</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I know plenty of people skip over games with Denuvo Anti-Tamper, so for those who do you may wish to now take a look at Ghostwire: Tokyo.</p>
<p>For Linux and Steam Deck players, it can be a special nuisance since it can end up entirely locking you out of games for a day or so when switching around Proton versions. And if you play on both PC and Steam Deck (or other handhelds), that can cause quite a problem when trying to get games to work well as you try different things. So now it shouldn't be a problem.</p>
<p>You can see the update noted on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1475810/history/?changeid=U:47536834" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> showing its removal, with the developer and publisher being silent on it. Most games get it removed eventually, since they need to keep paying for it, eventually it's not worth it once a game is past its prime.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wPTX1I2pKeA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f32c3da0e9d77b5e5d96fd1cd0a354ca.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wPTX1I2pKeA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Ghostwire: Tokyo is rated Steam Deck Verified and ProtonDB Gold.</p>

      <title>Horizon Forbidden West gets Intel XeSS v1.3 and text scaling</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news for Steam Deck players, and those with not so great vision, as the latest update to Horizon Forbidden West brings in some essential improvements. For Steam Deck players, Valve have rated it as Steam Deck Unsupported for now as they say it can't perform well enough.</p>
<p>Maybe with the newly updated Intel XeSS v1.3 it might be a bit better? Additionally, the developers added text scaling with it being set to Large by default on Steam Deck. It's really nice to see a developer pay attention to these things (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/dead-island-2-arrives-on-steam-boasting-of-steam-deck-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">unlike Dead Island 2</a>) although one day I do hope to see such a basic thing in releases and not updates.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5870698061713948036gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Thankfully the experience seems reasonable on Desktop Linux, with people on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/2420110?device=any" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating it Gold overall.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's all that's changed in version 1.3.55.0:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improved the visual quality of dust.</li>
<li>Added Interface Text Size option in the General Settings menu.</li>
<li>Improvements to texture streaming to reduce memory usage and improve quality.</li>
<li>Updated Intel XeSS to version 1.3 with improved image quality and new XeSS Native AA option.</li>
<li>Resolved performance regression when enabling NVIDA Reflex On+Boost.</li>
<li>When using Quick Slot hotkeys to select weapons, the last used ammo type used will now be remembered.</li>
<li>Improved smoothness of camera movement in Photo Mode when using the mouse.</li>
<li>Removed hardcoded Mouse and Keyboard bindings for actions such as Navigation Assist in Focus Mode. They now listen to their respective remappable key bindings.</li>
<li>Various optimizations and stability improvements.</li>
<li>Various UI bugfixes.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam refunds get adjusted to account for pre-release playtime</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve announced a small tweak to their refund policy, which closes a small loophole left open for Early Access and Advanced Access.</p>
<p>Their refund system is pretty reasonable giving you 14 days from purchase and 2 hours of play until you can no longer refund a title, but it seems it was left just a little bit <em>too</em> open in some cases. The good news is that Valve's not actually changing those rules, it's just getting a tweak to take into account <em>all</em> time played including before the full release date. So you won't be able to refund a game that gave you a few days access early, if you put over 2 hours into it, which it seems you could before.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/4195741362094579141" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam, Valve said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today we have updated a portion of our Refund Policy regarding pre-purchased titles. This change covers titles that are in pre-purchase and offer “<a href="https://help.steampowered.com/faqs/view/453F-5C96-EAC2-9145" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Advanced Access</a>”. Playtime acquired during the Advanced Access period will now count towards the Steam refund period. You can find out more information regarding <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds/?snr=2_groupannouncements_detail_" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Refunds here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we look back to earlier in April the refund page simply stated this about pre-purchases:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>REFUNDS ON PRE-PURCHASED TITLES</p>
<p>When you pre-purchase a title on Steam (and have paid for the title in advance), you can request a refund at any time prior to release of that title. The standard 14-day/two-hour refund period also applies, starting on the game’s release date.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it now reads as this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>REFUNDS ON TITLES PURCHASED PRIOR TO RELEASE DATE</p>
<p>When you purchase a title on Steam prior to the release date, the two-hour playtime limit for refunds will apply (except for beta testing), but the 14-day period for refunds will not start until the release date. For example, if you purchase a game that is in <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/6554-ED29-FBDB-1612" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Early Access</a> or <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/453F-5C96-EAC2-9145" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Advanced Access</a>, any playtime will count against the two-hour refund limit. If you pre-purchase a title which is not playable prior to the release date, you can request a refund at any time prior to release of that title, and the standard 14-day/two-hour refund period will apply starting on the game’s release date.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems pretty straightforward and fair enough. </p>

      <title>Fedora Linux 40 is officially out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for some more upgrades? Today Fedora Linux 40 has now been officially released bringing with it big upgrades with GNOME 46, KDE Plasma 6 and lots more. Plus the usual assortment of upgrades and enhancements to all the core applications.</p>
<p>With this release you're getting Linux kernel 6.8, Mesa 24.0.5, Wayland out of the box for the KDE edition, the inclusion of PyTorch for deep learning, numerous security improvements and so much more across the bump in versions of KDE and GNOME with all the enhancements there like improved HDR support in Plasma, experimental Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) in GNOME and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20962377431713884748gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20962377431713884748gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>They also revived the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fedora Atomic Desktops</a> branding which includes Fedora Silverblue, Fedora Kinoite, Fedora Sway Atomic and Fedora Budgie Atomic. So if you fancy a different type of Linux distribution perhaps give those a try that use either ostree or image-based provisioning that the Fedora team say isn't really "immutable" so it's being clearer going forward.</p>
<p>See more in the release <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-linux-40/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a>. And you can see the overview of changes for <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/whats-new-fedora-workstation-40/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fedora Workstation</a> and <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/whats-new-in-fedora-kde-40/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fedora KDE</a>.</p>
<p>You might also want to read the interesting blog post titled "<a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/shell-dev/2024/04/23/notifications-46-and-beyond/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Notifications in 46 and beyond</a>", which goes over the work involved in improving notifications in GNOME thanks to funding from the Sovereign Tech Fund.</p>

      <title>Trackline Express is a quirky, funny and unique journey</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Trackline Express is a game all about getting your train across an unforgiving desert, and it's a whole lot of fun coming from Bubblebird Studio who also made the cute Haven Park. Note: key provided by KeyMailer.</p>
<p>Going into Trackline Express I thought I was getting something a <em>bit</em> like Unrailed! but it's actually <em>very</em> different. Here it's much more of a crafting and people-management adventure, while also defending a train from various AI characters you meet that wish to destroy it. There's plenty of chaos but I adore it, especially the scraggly drawn graphics that really give it a lot of charm.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19658716011713882999gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19658716011713882999gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The gameplay has a nice loop to it too and in some ways it's a lot more relaxed compared to Unrailed!. You start off alone, gradually getting more passengers as you go, with each passenger able to contribute to the journey and you can switch between the passengers at any time. So you can have one off chopping wood, one mining coal to keep you going, one defending you from barbarian attacks and so on. The train also only moves when you put someone in the engine, so you move on when you're stocked-up and ready to go.</p>
<p>It's all about managing your time, along with the finite resources in each section. Each passenger has their own health and a water bar too with all the actions costing water, so you need to keep sending your passengers around to little pools and water pumps to fill back up again. </p>
<p>The crafting system is quite interesting too. Giving you various tools to get resources, buildings to help transform resources like ore into actual usable Iron and you can even build new parts for your train. When you want to craft something you have to pay to unlock it using coins you've gathered or sold resources for, then you place down the blueprint to dump resources into to eventually build it. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5584659351713881196gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5584659351713881196gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5848369571713881197gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5848369571713881197gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

<p>Don't have enough resources for what you wanted to build? Just pick up the blueprint, even if it has some resources in it, and make a run for it while another passenger runs the train. This is needed, because you only have a limited safe area around the train, as going outside it hurts your passenger and losing a passenger can be quite fatal to your plans. You can also place buildings on your train, to take useful things like a Forge on the go.</p>
<p>Quite silly overall but I've been really enjoying it.</p>
<p>All this because you're trying to get away from wildfires, so if you take too long, eventually it will catch up to you.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4614270731713881438gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4614270731713881438gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Left something behind? You can set the train to go backwards to go and grab it too. It's such an overall odd blending of game mechanics, but it all comes together quite nicely.</p>
<p>Just be prepared for failure, because you <em>will</em> fail. Sometimes because you die during an attack, sometimes because you've just messed up the resources and need to restart a section. That is one slight issue with it, because the resources are finite like trees, mines and pools only giving a specific amount of each, you could end up stuck. But that's also part of the challenge - using everything wisely.</p>

<p>It has Native Linux support and I had no problems there at all, it all worked very nicely. I can easily recommend this one for those of you looking for something entertaining that's a bit different to a lot of what's coming out lately. Trackline Express is a game full of character that's well worth picking up. High replay value too so you'll get plenty of hours out of this one.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2343920/Trackline_Express/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Shoot through a mass of alien cells in Swarm Grinder 1.0 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Swarm Grinder is a repeatable action roguelite where you control a little mech, as you battle your way through a big swarm of cells that spawn various types of enemies. An interesting one if you enjoy games like Vampire Survivors.</p>
<p>Here you spawn into a procedurally generated map full of alien cells. As you travel around, these cells burst and reveal various types of enemies. These cells regrow too, so sitting still is not an option and you need the fuel they drop to keep going. Every so often you get a big wave that bursts out of the cells to deal with. There's plenty of upgrades to change your run too, which you get by clearing specific areas of cells to call down a mining system which spawns 3 different upgrades to pick from.</p>
<p>It gives a similar sort of feeling to Vampire Survivors, Brotato and many other survivor-like games with the auto-firing mechanic but it's probably one of the most unique around and it just hit the big 1.0 and left Early Access.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UijnTE9cob4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/34e4066c418e086cd1f93593b39be813.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UijnTE9cob4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's a really interesting idea for a game! It has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Playable. The Linux version on Desktop works great, and since the initial release the performance on Steam Deck is also much improved. It's now usually above 50FPS, instead of dropping below 30FPS.</p>

      <title>Khronos Group seeking proposals for paid work to improve OpenXR for Godot Engine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Khronos Group, the overseers of many open standards like OpenGL, Vulkan, OpenXR and more are currently looking to pay someone to improve OpenXR in <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>.</p>
<p>They recently on April 22nd posted up a <a href="https://www.khronos.org/rfp/godot-integration" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Request for Proposal for the work</a> as they hope to "expand and demonstrate the reach of the API Standard by better integrating OpenXR with the Godot game engine to effectively bridge the gap between runtime developers and application developers".</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">So they're hoping the work will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a testbed for the OpenXR API by enabling a direct feedback channel between app developers and runtime developers. A byproduct of this is building the OpenXR Advisory Panel with app developers to ensure successful OpenXR Conferences with the Outreach Subgroup.</li>
<li>Improve developer documentation including examples with WG notes on best practices. Although the OpenXR Tutorial Project covers using OpenXR directly, most app developers will use a library/engine therefore providing examples at the engine level is still needed.</li>
<li>Provide a OpenXR Working Group (OWG) approved open-source reference for other game engines and libraries to reduce fragmentation in the industry. Since Godot is MIT-licensed, the work done in this project can be freely integrated into proprietary projects, advancing the entire industry.</li>
</ol>
<p>As per the <a href="https://members.khronos.org/document/dl/32395" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> they're willing to pay up to $100,000 for the work and you need to send in any proposals by 22nd May, 2024. They say anyone that has experience with Godot and OpenXR is welcome to submit a proposal to be considered.</p>

      <title>Rhythm-shooter roguelite KILLBEAT sounds like a real blast</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You don't see many roguelites like this! KILLBEAT blends musical rhythm shooting with fast-paced action to create something that looks rather fun.</p>
<p>With music inspired by EDM and metal, the developers say the unique soundtrack adds a spin with catchy vocal chop melodies. The music goes along with the gameplay of course and if you manage to get a good combo going, it adds additional musical instruments to the tracks and you get some gameplay bonuses.</p>
<p>More about it: "Descend into the depths of Cadence Drop, a mysterious sinkhole devouring an entire city. Fight your way through monsters and bosses as you venture deeper, driven by the rhythm towards the source of the beat.</p>
<p>Explore procedurally generated levels with rhythm driven, skill-based gameplay. Shoot, Dash, Reload, Repeat, and Finish off your enemies on beat. Create varied builds with synergies for each run - Offence is your best defense."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZUzLsUqifGM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fefd8d9b8333951257ea7cbcaacb67d1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZUzLsUqifGM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developers have said they will be doing a Linux version, which you can sign up to their newsletter for more info on their <a href="https://kalmagames.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official website</a> as they're looking for testers. So here's your chance to ensure it's a good release.</p>
<p>You can also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2808530/KILLBEAT/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Valve tweak 4K screen scaling on Linux, plus more Remote Play fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A fresh Desktop Steam Client Beta has been released, and it sounds like a useful one for those of you who do Remote Play. It's always nice to see more Remote Play fixes, because it often ends up as the least stable feature on Steam, especially on Linux.</p>
<p>Here's what's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/4219385260137009468" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changed</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Remote Play</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the streaming button staying stuck on "Stop" when the streaming client exits quickly.</li>
<li>Fixed framerate drop when capturing over 120 FPS.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Linux</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed slow startup on busy systems.</li>
<li>Changed the default scale from 200% to 150% on a 4K monitor.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Did these fix issues for you? Or is there a particular bug you're desperately wanting to be fixed? Let me know in the comments. Extra points for a properly filed bug report. </p>

      <title>SteamOS 3.5.19 Preview out for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released another small SteamOS Preview update for Steam Deck, along with an additional Steam Client Beta update. </p>
<p>After releasing <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/steamos-3518-preview-released-for-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.5.18 Preview</a> only recently that curiously mentioned some rather vague "Stability and security improvements". Here we are again with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4202496761535270229" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.5.19 Preview</a> with more weirdly vague "Additional stability and security improvements".</p>
<p>I have to admit my curiosity has piqued now. What are the changes and why are Valve now being repeatedly vague on it, when previously they've been really quite detailed with all their fixes? It could be that they don't want to detail them properly until it goes stable for everyone, to prevent issues being jumped on by bad actors to cause issues perhaps.</p>
<p>A Steam Deck Client Beta <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4202496761535420316" rel="noopener" target="_blank">update</a> was also released with these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed slow startup on busy systems.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Remote Play</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the streaming button staying stuck on "Stop" when the streaming client exits quickly.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Proton Experimental brings initial D3D12 for OpenVR, fixes Overwatch 2 crashes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A freshly squeezed cup of Proton Experimental was released today by Valve containing fixes for multiple games on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux like Overwatch 2.</p>
<p>Firstly, they're listing Sonic Colors: Ultimate as now playable, with a lot of people using GE-Proton to play it previously. Plus there's now some initial D3D12 support for OpenVR which they note should work for Battlezone Gold Edition in DX12 mode.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Other changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Horizon Forbidden West no longer displays warning about outdated drivers with Nvidia GPUs.</li>
<li>Updated Wine Mono to <a href="https://github.com/madewokherd/wine-mono/releases/tag/wine-mono-9.1.0" target="_blank">9.1.0</a>.</li>
<li>Fixed Proton 9.0 regressions:
<ul>
<li>Overwatch 2 no longer randomly crashes.</li>
<li>Video playback in Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition works again.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2757628091713802495gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2757628091713802495gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
Pictured - Overwatch 2</p>
<p>And the changes for Wine Mono (replacement for the .NET Framework) v9.1.0 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Due to a license change in Vagrant, the Vagrant build files have been removed in favor of Podman. The official build of this release was also made using Podman.</li>
<li>Fixed a build error on systems that use a scheduling policy not in a hard-coded list.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash when auto-generating a COM interface for some classes with array types in their signature (<a href="https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=55736" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Winehq bug 55736</a>).</li>
<li>Implemented String.Concat(object, object, object, object, __arglist) (<a href="https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=56248" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Winehq bug 56248</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed doubled characters when typing in Terraria.</li>
<li>Added support for Joystick and Keyboard inputs in Managed DirectX/monoDX.</li>
<li>Added support for the ApplyToOverrides property in System.Web.Extensions.</li>
<li>Fixed System.Drawing.Icon incorrectly rejecting cursor handles, which was also breaking System.Windows.Forms.Cursor.Hotspot.</li>
<li>Fixed hang when System.Environment.Exit is called while another thread is in a long-running native call.</li>
<li>Upstream updates:
<ul>
<li>SDL2 to 2.30.2.</li>
<li>FNA to 24.03.</li>
<li>llvm-mingw to 20240320.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Dead Island 2 arrives on Steam boasting of Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dambuster Studios and Deep Silver have now finally released Dead Island 2 on Steam, after previously being Epic Games exclusive and they're boasting about Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>About the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A deadly virus is spreading across Los Angeles, turning its inhabitants into ravenous zombies. The city is in quarantine and the military have retreated. Bitten, infected, but more than just immune, you learn to harness the zombie inside of you. Only you, and the handful of other swaggering assholes who happen to be resistant to the pathogen, hold the future of Los Angeles (and humanity), in the balance.  <br/>
 <br/>
As you uncover the truth behind the outbreak you’ll discover the truth of who – or <em>what –</em> you are. Survive, evolve, save the world – just another day in LA! </p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5278328781713801633gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5278328781713801633gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>While it does look really good, I do want to touch on an issue. Their new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOx07gV3thY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam trailer</a>, which I can't embed here due to it being age-restricted on YouTube, boasts pretty clearly "Steam Deck Support". However, Valve has only given it a Steam Deck Playable rating which notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>This game sometimes shows mouse, keyboard, or non-Steam-Deck controller icons.</li>
<li>Entering some text requires manually invoking the on-screen keyboard.</li>
<li>Some in-game text is small and may be difficult to read.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Why in 2024 is font sizing still an issue? It's such a basic accessibility feature.</em></p>
<p>Additionally the first-time setup requires an active Internet connection (Denuvo Anti-tamper) and lesser so an issue since it is primarily a handheld, it doesn't default to external Bluetooth/USB controllers on Deck so you need to manually switch. Their own <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/934700/discussions/0/4368004468484074346/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">forum post</a> on it also goes over some other issues like the first launch of the game is likely to <em>fail</em> and cross-play with Epic Games needing some setup.</p>
<p>If you're going to boast about Steam Deck support, I generally would expect a lot better, to actually have the game running properly from the first load without issues. Otherwise, it's not supported in any sense of the word. It's just another game released on Steam, that runs thanks to Valve's effort with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, that aside, it will likely run quite well on Desktop Linux too thanks to Proton.</p>

      <title>Embracer Group splitting into three companies</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Embracer Group have announced that after being the cause of many job losses, shutting down developers and selling some off - they're now splitting into three companies.</p>
<p>These three will be <em>Asmodee Group</em>, <em>Coffee Stain &amp; Friends</em> and <em>Middle-earth Enterprises &amp; Friends</em>. Each of them will be separate, publicly listed companies which Embracer say enables " each entity to better focus on their respective core strategies and offer more differentiated and distinct equity stories for existing and new shareholders" that will enable them to "unlock value in the high-quality assets of Embracer Group following the successful completion of the restructuring program".</p>
<p>Coffee Stain &amp; Friends will have a focus on a wide variety of games across PC, console and mobile across two distinct segments of premium and free to play. This includes some control over Deep Rock Galactic, Goat Simulator, Satisfactory, Wreckfest, Teardown, Valheim, Coffee Stain, Ghost Ship, Tarsier, Tuxedo Labs, as well as THQ Nordic and Amplifier Game Invest plus "more than 200 other IPs".</p>
<p>Asmodee Group will focus on board games and digital board games including Ticket to Ride, 7 Wonders, Azul, CATAN, Dobble, Exploding Kittens plus they're also developing tabletop games for The Lord of the Rings, Marvel, Game of Thrones, Netflix, Lego and Star Wars. As part of this, Asmodee also <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/asmodee-secures-financing-agreement-of-eur-900-million-as-part-of-separation-deleveraging-the-remaining-embracer-group/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">secured</a> a new financing agreement of 900 million euros through JP Morgan, BNP Paribas, SEB, Societe Generale and Swedbank which Embracer said is "an important part of the debt refinancing of Embracer Group following its restructuring program".</p>
<p>Middle-earth Enterprises &amp; Friends will be their "creative powerhouse in AAA game development" and will remain the "stewards of The Lord of the Rings and Tomb Raider intellectual properties" but they also control the likes of Crystal Dynamics, Dambuster Studios, Eidos-Montréal, Flying Wild Hog Studios, Tripwire, Vertigo Games, Warhorse Studios and 4A Games among many others. IPs includes Dead Island, Killing Floor, Kingdom Come Deliverance, The Lord of the Rings, Metro and Tomb Raider, among many others. The group will include PLAION, Freemode, Dark Horse and other businesses.</p>
<p>I should note that both Coffee Stain &amp; Friends and Middle-earth Enterprises &amp; Friends aren't the official names, just what they're being referred to right now. As Embracer said the official names will be "decided at a later stage".</p>
<p>More in their <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-announces-its-intention-to-transform-into-three-standalone-publicly-listed-entities-at-nasdaq-stockholm/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release</a> and the <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/open-letter-by-embracer-group-ceo-about-the-transformation-into-three-standalone-publicly-listed-entities/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">open letter</a> from the Embracer CEO.</p>

      <title>Sunshine game streaming update has frame timing improvements for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sunshine when paired up with Moonlight offers a great way to stream games from your PC to pretty much any other system, and the latest release v0.23.1 should work better on Linux now.</p>
<p>This is an alternative to the now defunct NVIDIA Gamestream, and you can use it as an alternative to things like Steam Link / Remote Play. The idea is that you set up Sunshine on your gaming PC, then use Moonlight to get the stream on your other devices. So you can play whatever you want across your many systems like Steam Deck, mobile and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13097767681713780715gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13097767681713780715gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - War Thunder</p>
<p>Here's what's new / changed in v0.23.1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Fixed</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(Capture/Windows) Disable HRD and CBR encoding options by default for AMD GPUs due to video quality regressions in v0.23.0</li>
<li>(UI) Fix incorrect strings for QuickSync 'fast' and 'faster' presets</li>
<li>(UI/Linux) Fix update prompt appearing even when running the latest version</li>
<li>(Input) Fix crash when absolute input events are received prior to the display viewport being set</li>
<li>(Input/Linux) Fix missing clamping of rumble intensity to valid range</li>
<li>(Build/Tests) Fix error when attempting to disable compilation of tests</li>
<li>(Build/Linux) Fix some compilation errors when using Musl libc</li>
<li>(Logging) Fix broken debug messages for codec capability flags</li>
<li>(Logging/Linux) Fix log messages to include the correct setcap command for resolving KMS permission errors</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Added</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(Capture/Linux) Improve frame time consistency for all capture backends</li>
<li>(UI) Set focus to the PIN textbox when navigating to the PIN tab</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dependencies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Remove libavdevice dependency</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Misc</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(Linux) Prefer ayatana-appindicator3 over appindicator3 if both are available</li>
</ul>

      <title>Parking Garage Rally Circuit coming by dev of JellyCar with Linux / Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A game that is something of a homage to the days of the Sega Saturn, Walaber Entertainment who created the fun JellyCar series have announced Parking Garage Rally Circuit. This really looks like it would fit right at home on the Saturn! Complete with tasty low-poly, chunky textures.</p>
<p>"The 'Parking Garage Rally Circuit' tour comes into a city, selects a parking garage, and temporarily turns it into an exciting rally course for a week-long competition. Each track in the game is styled as a unique parking garage that has been turned into a race course. Players will use a map of North America + UK to chart their course from track to track across the globe."</p>
<p>You can see their announcement video below, although you may need to turn your speakers up a bit to actually hear the developer properly:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Skg6V3Up0BM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7ed99ca502ad6bc2956d7e5053bfb429.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Skg6V3Up0BM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In the video they said clearly it's been tested on Steam Deck and will have a Native Linux version. They also said it will offer multiple tracks, online leaderboards with ghost cars and even a simple online mode to race your friends.</p>
<p><span style="background-color:var(--article-main-background); color:var(--font-color); font-size:17px">You can </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2737300/Parking_Garage_Rally_Circuit/" rel="noopener" style="background-color:var(--article-main-background); font-size:17px" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a><span style="background-color:var(--article-main-background); color:var(--font-color); font-size:17px">. It's due to release later this year.</span></p>

      <title>Over 10 years later 7 Days to Die is going to leave Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A long time coming after initially going live back in December 2013, developer The Fun Pimps has now announced that 7 Days to Die is going to be leaving Early Access. The release is currently planned for June, with an exact date to be given closer to the time No I can't quite believe it's finally happening either.</p>

      <title>PSA: someone set up a fake Proton-GE website</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It seems <em>nothing</em> is safe from bogus websites and scams, with someone setting up a fake website for Proton-GE / GE-Proton. A warning note about it was added to the GE GitHub page readme <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/commit/7bbf58654befd0c2f0856c5568f89f98ddc98ec6" rel="noopener" target="_blank">last month</a>, which I've only just been made aware of.</p>
<p>The website in question protonge.com, which I am intentionally <em>not</em> making a clickable link, makes it seem like it's all official but the <em>only</em> official place is the <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Cheekily, it even uses a screenshot of mine taken from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/protonup-qt-for-easy-ge-proton-installs-on-linux-and-steam-deck-v270-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an older article</a> about ProtonUp-Qt which is a completely different (but related) project.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7365448271713776782gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7365448271713776782gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>According to the website, Proton-GE has builds "tailored for various game genres", well that's a new one. Claiming they have "a customized Proton build to enhance your experience in each specific gaming category". That's just not how it works.</p>
<p>No matter what industry you're in, or what tools you're making, even open source projects — there's always someone who will want to ride on its popularity to do something nefarious.</p>
<p>This reminds me of a recent spate of emails going around claiming to be from the Kdenlive video editor team, where the official developers had to post up <a href="https://mastodon.social/@kdenlive@floss.social/112207013564456009" rel="noopener" target="_blank">warnings</a> across social media. These emails tried to get people to download things for partnerships, which of course is usually some form of malware.</p>

      <title>Wine 9.7 released with ARM improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Wine 9.7 development release is out now bringing with it the usual bug fixes, plus some ARM platform improvements for this Windows compatibility layer used in Proton.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">What's new:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build system support for ARM64X.</li>
<li>Some restructuration of the Vulkan driver interface.</li>
<li>WIDL improvements for ARM support as well as SLTG typelibs.</li>
</ul>
<p>For bug fixes they noted 18 solved including issues for older Command &amp; Conquer games, Oregon Trail II, osu!, Medieval II: Total War, BURIKO visual novel engine and more.</p>
<p>What is ARM64X? According to Microsoft:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Arm64X is a new type of binary that can contain both the classic Arm64 code and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/arm/arm64ec" target="_blank">Arm64EC code</a> together. This makes Arm64x compatible for both the classic Arm64 and Arm64EC processes on a Windows on Arm device and a particularly good fit for middleware or plugins that may be used by both ABIs.</p>
<p>Introduced in the Windows 11 SDK, the Arm64X binary is a type of Portable Executable (PE) file that works with both Windows 11 on Arm and Windows 10 on Arm. To build Arm64X binaries, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/arm/arm64x-build" target="_blank">Build Arm64X Binaries</a>.</p>

      <title>Action-filled naval sandbox game Windward follow-up Windward Horizon announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Remember Windward? Released in 2015, it's an action-filled multiplayer sandbox game that puts you in control of a ship sailing the high seas of a large procedurally-generated world and it's getting a sequel with Windward Horizon.</p>
<p>Windward sold quite well too, over 500K copies I've been told, so not a big surprise to see Tasharen Entertainment return to the setting. Currently the Steam page only lists Windows support officially, but Stride PR told me very clearly "Windward Horizon will have support on Linux as well.".</p>
<p>The developer said they aim to "improve every aspect of the original, such as adding lore to the game, a robust economy system that governs growth, fully configurable internal ship layouts with adjacency bonuses and penalties for interesting builds and many, many new skills to complement the expanded talent trees" and it will be free to try next month for a limited time.</p>

<p>“As a standalone sequel, Windward Horizon improves upon Windward’s foundation while keeping its original charm,” said Michael Lyashenko, Founder of Tasharen Entertainment. “With an engaging gameplay loop filled with intricate systems and detailed customization options, we’re creating a feeling of freedom many open world sandbox games can’t match.”</p>

      <title>Phantom Fury gets Steam Deck Verified ahead of release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Phantom Fury is a new FPS from Slipgate Ironworks and 3D Realms, taking place a few years after Ion Fury and it's going to be Steam Deck Verified for release.</p>
<p>While their team say it takes place after Ion Fury, they also say it's not a direct sequel, more of a "soft sequel" taking place in the same universe but it's more of a spin-off.</p>
<p>Releasing on April 23rd, the Steam page doesn't yet actually show the Steam Deck Verified status however 3D Realms <a href="https://twitter.com/3DRealms/status/1780724635094360154" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted</a> about reaching it on X (formerly Twitter) which the official Valve OnDeck account reposted. Have a look at their explainer video below which talks about the setting and shows off various bits of gameplay:</p>

      <title>Crownfall multi-act update live for Dota 2, plus a new comic</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve just released a big new update for Dota 2 with Crownfall, which not only includes a new comic to read but also what they call The Markets of Midgate. This is the first act of an ongoing story event.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.dota2.com/crownfall" rel="noopener" target="_blank">update page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Markets of Midgate is just the first act of an ongoing four-act narrative that will span the next few months. You'll be able to play through new acts as soon as they become available, but you can also move through the adventure at your own pace — the introduction of a new act won't close off an earlier one.<br/>
<br/>
Which means you can take as long as you like exploring every possible path, challenge and secret in Act I. And as much as there is to find, this event's just getting started. Crownfall will keep expanding as it unfolds over the coming months, with each new act bringing its own story, characters, a unique overworld map and all-new rewards. There might even be a surprise or two along the way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What you get is this special new overworld map to explore the area of Skywrath, and as you play games with various characters you obtain different tokens. You use these tokens to unlock paths through the overworld map to progress through the story and earn rewards. It's free for everyone, but you can also pay $14.99 to get the Midgate Pathfinder Pack to give you more places to explore with sidequests, more stories and more rewards.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15339624781713518103gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15339624781713518103gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's also various new cosmetic packs released you can buy. The second part of the story is due out mid-May, with the other two acts not dated yet.</p>
<p>You can read the comic on the <a href="https://www.dota2.com/crownfall/comic" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dota 2 website</a>.</p>
<p>Play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/570/Dota_2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dota 2 free on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 64bit support released, plus Vulkan for Linux via DXVK</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has now launched the 64bit update for Team Fortress 2, which should bring performance improvements for most users. Plus we get Vulkan now too.</p>
<p>After being in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/team-fortress-2-has-a-64bit-and-vulkan-update-for-linux-in-testing/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Beta since January</a>, the Vulkan support is thanks to DXVK which is now the default launch option for the game on Linux. This replaces Valve's original ToGL translation layer for OpenGL, but it's left in as a Legacy launch option for those who need it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9869620751713516903gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9869620751713516903gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>From the update <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/?tab=updates" rel="noopener" target="_blank">notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added 64-bit support for Windows/Linux client and server
<ul>
<li>Should include performance improvements for most users</li>
<li>Bugs can be reported here: <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Source-1-Games/issues" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Source-1-Games/issues</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed an exploit related to uploading invalid custom decals that would crash other clients</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And then a quick follow-up update after:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the game would be falsely detected as malware by some anti-viruses</li>
<li>Fixed a crash relating to using some Unicode characters on Linux</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Looks like there's a lot of bug reports flowing in, so expect more updates to come.</p>
<p>Play for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">free on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Free Stars: Children of Infinity coming to Linux after smashing Kickstarter goals</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well that really was fast. Free Stars: Children of Infinity, the sequel to The Ur-Quan Masters (Star Control 2) is now confirmed to be supporting Linux (and macOS).</p>
<p>The Kickstarter campaign has only been up for just over a day and it's already managed to pull in over $240,000 in funding. This means the $220,000 stretch goal for Linux and macOS support has been achieved as <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pistolshrimp/free-stars-children-of-infinity/posts/4080050" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed</a> by the developer. Since it also passed $240K, it will also now see a DRM-free PC release as well so that's double good news. It's not confirmed what DRM-free stores they will put it on but their <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pistolshrimp/free-stars-children-of-infinity/posts/4080177" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> mentioned possibilities being itch.io and GOG.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="MqCnsE3hxP4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6d78a59f9c07693e23bcb30c95843152.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/MqCnsE3hxP4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The campaign still has a whole 29 days to go with extra stretch goals including more languages, local co-op, console ports, English voice over and if they somehow hit $4.4 million they will open source it all.</p>

      <title>Victoria 3: Sphere of Influence delayed, Europa Universalis IV: Winds of Change on May 8th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two bits of news for fans of the grand strategy games from Paradox Interactive as we've got a delay for Victoria 3: Sphere of Influence, but we also have a date for Europa Universalis IV: Winds of Change.</p>
<p>For the upcoming major expansion Victoria 3: Sphere of Influence, Paradox put out a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/529340/view/5848561962978078111" rel="noopener" target="_blank">statement</a> to say that it's just not ready. It was going to come on May 6th, but it's been pushed back to June 24th. Why? As they said "we’ve unfortunately come to the conclusion that both the update and the expansion are in need of more time for bug fixing and polish". It's coming with some pretty big changes and while they're "happy with the features on offer in 1.7/Sphere of Influence, we simply do not believe that sticking to the original release date will allow us to deliver those features in a polished and balanced state".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14604466271713435038gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14604466271713435038gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Fair enough, let's not have a repeat of Europa Universalis IV: Leviathan, which released back in April 2021 and is <em>still</em> sat on Overwhelmingly Negative on Steam. Ouch. It's actually nice to see Paradox take a step back for quality on something.</p>
<p>You can grab Victoria 3 from:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/humble-choice-for-april-has-terraformers-victoria-3-the-callisto-protocol/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">April's Humble Choice</a></p>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/529340/Victoria_3/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a></p>
<p>The other side is that they did just announce Europa Universalis IV: Winds of Change to release on May 8th, hopefully an expansion that will actually do better this time. Winds of Change adds more focus to key regions of the world. New mission trees, new government reforms and new national mechanics are in place for over a dozen nations. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ha6Ivz_7fOE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/11c8d4cf566c3151e708e4c8bc32bbfa.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ha6Ivz_7fOE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Europa Universalis IV: Winds of Change includes new historical content for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Major American Nations: The Aztecs, Maya and Inca all get significant updates, including an Aztec mechanic that promotes warfare and demanding sacrifices, new ways to unite the Mayan nations into one kingdom, Incan royal authority, and many other improvements and updates. These nations also receive special content to allow an alternate-history invasion of the Old World.</li>
<li>Major Trading Nations: Both The Netherlands and Venice see expanded historical flavor, including more detailed content for the creation and enlargement of the Dutch Republic, the Glorious Revolution uniting the Dutch and British crowns, the Venetian Council of Ten, and the glories of the Venetian Renaissance.</li>
<li>Gunpowder Empires: The declining Timurid Empire can either fully embrace  Persian traditions or return to its horse empire roots through a life of plunder, and the rising Mughal Empire has new routes to unite all of India under its sway. The Central Asian Horde nations also get updates, including unique flavor for the Tatar, Mongol and Moghul Khanates.</li>
<li>Central Europe: Austria, Hungary and Bohemia get revised trees, including the possibility for the Austrian and Hungarians to form the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary and for Bohemia to expand Hussite Power in the heart of the Empire, while all three can tailor the HRE to their liking.</li>
<li>Major Formable European Nations: New alt-historical options and content for the formation of Germany and Italy.</li>
<li>Minor Orthodox Empires: Surrounded by enemies, the Black Sea kingdoms of Theodoro and Trebizond seek to thrive and expand, potentially reviving Orthodox fortunes in the region.</li>
<li>Hisn Kayfa and Hormuz/Oman: The minor nation Hisn Kayfa, heirs of the Ayyubid dynasty, and major Gulf trading powers of Hormuz and Oman get unique mission trees to dominate the Middle East.</li>
</ul>
<p>Europa Universalis IV: Winds of Change will be available for $19.99 / £16.75 / €19.99.</p>

      <title>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance gets Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another potentially big PC release coming up is Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance from ATLUS and SEGA and it has been Steam Deck Verified already. This is great news, as it means testing has actually been done on it well ahead of release on June 14th.</p>
<p>Valve's compatibility note does mention though that it needs an active internet connection for the first-time setup, so just something to keep in mind. Likely due to the inclusion of Denuvo Anti-tamper.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19665129531713428353gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19665129531713428353gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The latest trailer can be seen on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbLdn_bviZI" rel="noopener" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, which I can't include here directly, since it has an age restriction on it.</p>
<p>The latest title in the series, Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance allows players to enjoy the story of Shin Megami Tensei V in its entirety, with a new story path, untold in the original.  Massively expanded with new areas, demons, and music, Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance features more accessible gameplay, an improved battle system, new demon experiences, and greater field exploration. </p>
<p>As a standalone game, you don't need to have played the others. Which is good news for people new to the series.</p>
<p>Getting Steam Deck Verified is good news for Desktop Linux players too of course! It means it really should run without issues on a more powerful desktop system!</p>
<p>It can be pre-ordered via:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/shin-megami-tensei-v-vengeance?ref=gol" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fanatical</a> (13% off)</p>

      <title>Former Nouveau driver lead joins NVIDIA and sent a massive patch set</title>
      <author>nwildner</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ben Skeggs, former Nouveau lead developer and former Red Hat employee has joined NVIDIA. He resigned from Nouveau development as a personal decision removing himself from the <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/nouveau/2023-September/043241.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MAINTAINERS file</a> September of last year.</p>
<p>After months of being radio silent in Nouveau driver development, Skeggs sent a<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/nouveau/20240416234002.19509-1-bskeggs@nvidia.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> massive 156-part patch set</a> as a follow-up on the Noveau GSP firmware enablement work, code cleanup, ioctl-like interfaces between NVKM and the Nouveau DMS driver which will reduce driver overhead and call chain complexity.</p>
<p>The important part for this news is that this patch series was submitted using his new NVIDIA work email address.</p>
<p>Strange times indeed since, no one was expecting that Skeggs would be at NVIDIA, and due to the history involved with that company that he would also <em>continue</em> to contribute directly with Nouveau.</p>
<p>Looks like history may be repeating itself with AMD and Radeon…could this be another sign of NVIDIA opening up more?</p>

      <title>Adventure Mode Beta out now for Dwarf Fortress</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dwarf Fortress on Steam from Bay 12 Games and Kitfox Games has a fresh Beta now available containing the new Adventure Mode. This turns the expansive building sim into a big turn-based RPG, where you can create a character and freely roam the rich simulated world you've made a home in during the Fortress Mode or start afresh in a newly generated world.</p>
<p>To access it you just need to own it on Steam, head to the Properties -&gt; Betas and select "beta - Public beta branch". To go along with it, they'll also be releasing the Dwarf Fortress Soundtrack 2 (Adventure) DLC, this will also be available across Bandcamp, Spotify, Youtube and Apple Music.</p>
<p>Check out the Beta trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="dX2gnya3eH4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b32a88355e7a6a6e290f824fbe6da484.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/dX2gnya3eH4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With this being a Beta it's not finished of course and they said there's "features from Classic Adventure Mode and planned new features that have not made their way to the Steam version yet", so work is ongoing to expand Adventure Mode still.</p>
<p>You can buy it on:</p>

      <title>Ghost of Tsushima PC specs revealed - should work on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sony has released the specifications needed for the upcoming PC release of Ghost of Tsushima DIRECTOR'S CUT, and it seems like it scales quite well so it should run on the Steam Deck (and Desktop Linux will no doubt be fine).</p>
<p>An exciting upcoming release, which many have wanted to see on PC since the original PlayStation release in 2020. Sony are treating their PC fans quite well nowadays though with so many titles releasing.</p>
<p>Here's the specs for those that want to see (click to enlarge):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3561493351713366368gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3561493351713366368gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Going by that, at least on Steam Deck, we might see it stick around 30FPS and be reasonably playable. Considering it's coming with NVIDIA DLSS 3, AMD FSR 3 and Intel XeSS it should be good across a wide range of hardware.</p>
<p>Curiously, this is also the first Sony release on PC that will come with the new PlayStation overlay. As per the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/04/17/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-pc-cross-play-and-system-requirements-revealed/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a>, Sony mentions this includes access to your Friends list, Trophies, Settings, and your Profile. So you'll be able to earn PlayStation Trophies, but it will also work just fine with Steam Achievements too. This PlayStation overlay is entirely optional though, which is good to see and will look something like this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9138276371713366617gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9138276371713366617gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I'm not really one to care about achievements and trophies, but a nice touch for those that do, further bridging the gap between traditional consoles and PCs. Although it remains to be seen if this new overlay works with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>, but I'm sure Valve will update it to get it working if it doesn't initially.</p>
<p>Previous PC trailer if you missed it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EzWBNwhb870"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/917587cd15a8fb992c160dac4d4734a1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EzWBNwhb870" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It releases on PC on May 16th. Will you be picking it up?</p>

      <title>Buckshot Roulette hit a million sales, multiplayer mode in development</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It just goes to show, that as challenging as it is for indie devs right now, there's still a whole lot of success stories. Buckshot Roulette is the latest to hit over a million sales.</p>
<p>Previously available via itch.io, it recently jumped over to Steam with a big update and clearly caught the attention of a lot of players thanks to its dark and intriguing game idea where you play Russian roulette with a 12-gauge shotgun. There's over 12,000 user reviews on Steam now giving it an Overwhelmingly Positive rating.</p>
<p>You won't see many games that get user reviews <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/fcukignfyif/recommended/2835570/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">like</a> "Dealer handcuffed me then shot himself in the head twice.", and that's a pretty accurate summary of how nuts this title is. With a multiplayer mode in development right now, no doubt when that releases the game will see another big uptick in players.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BbKAIy1GFF4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3793ce32a7dfc20981c82f08e3602379.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BbKAIy1GFF4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I think this goes to show that there's clearly a place for all types of games. From AAA chasing ever more realistic looking environments and people, to smaller stranger games like this.</p>
<p>Wonderful to see <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> games gain such popularity. Be sure to follow our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/Godot_Engine/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine tag</a> for more!</p>

<p>The goo has gotten a bit stuck, and so the May release date <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/world-of-goo-2-launches-in-may-on-the-epic-store-but-linux-support-from-their-website/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously announced</a> for World of Goo 2 has been pushed back to August 2nd.</p>
<p>As a reminder, World of Goo 2 will have Linux support but you will need to buy it direct as it's going to be on the Epic Store. Presumably it will eventually hit Steam after their Epic Exclusive deal is up. At least they're still providing direct-purchases though.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://tomorrowcorporation.com/posts/world-of-goo-2-launch-date-enhanced-now-august-2-2024" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Goo is flowing, balls are coalescing, and blinking eyes lift up towards the sky where a mysterious pipe is rumored to appear. But instead, a signpost rises up out of the ground. “Good news!,” it says. “The World of Goo 2 launch date has been enhanced. It has now moved to August 2, 2024. We are proud to offer you this enhancement free of charge!”</p>
<p><em>From the Team: We have really appreciated your kind comments and patience while we finish building the best possible game!</em></p>

      <title>Asymmetrical indirect control RTS game Roboden now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>How about a free game to add to your library? Roboden is an asymmetrical indirect control real-time strategy game about robot colonies and it's now Steam Deck Verified. It also has Native Linux support.</p>
<p>In the game you control the colony priorities while the automated drones execute your program. Collect resources, build and combine units, and play with friends in cooperative and competitive modes.</p>
<p>One I missed that was released back in 2023, it looks like an interesting concept and good to kill a few hours with. Since release the developer has continued improving it, and has now put out an update that enabled it to become Steam Deck Verified too. From the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2416030/announcements/detail/4191237128330669820" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> the developer added in improved gamepad controls, larger fonts and some accessibility fixes along with a new font.</p>

      <title>Adventure of Rikka - The Cursed Kingdom is one for classic Zelda lovers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you like classic action-adventure puzzle games like the older Zelda titles? Be sure to check out Adventure of Rikka - The Cursed Kingdom.</p>
<p>Released back in March from developer Poorly Drawn Squid, The Adventure of Rikka is a top down 2D action RPG with a focus on puzzles, exploration, secrets and collectables. You must defeat the dark forces that has cursed the lands, fight enemies using your sword and an arsenal of items such as the bow and fire wand and save the kingdom!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4-oykMa9Wmk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/afaf1766c4c45c2d9f3bb197c25fea9d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4-oykMa9Wmk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I actually only came across this looking up recent Steam Deck news, somehow missing the main release. The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1726390/announcements/detail/7790739306613725922" rel="noopener" target="_blank">developer noted</a> in an announcement that they're currently waiting for Valve to put it through review but they say "The UI of the game was actually built to fit the Steam Deck display and is then scaled up for larger monitors" and it also has Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>7 Dungeons with challenging boss-fights, and many smaller puzzle dungeons.</li>
<li>10 Unique player items such as the Bow, Bomb, Grappling hook, Pegasus boots and the Fire wand.</li>
<li>Upgradeable items and weapons.</li>
<li>Shards and Stones of Power scattered across the land which are used to upgrade your stats.</li>
<li>A bunch of side quests.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1726390/Adventure_of_Rikka__The_Cursed_Kingdom/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">out on Steam</a>. It only has a few reviews so far, but early indicator is that players enjoy it.</p>

      <title>Athenian Rhapsody is one of the wackiest games I&#39;ve seen for a while</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Releasing May 14th, Athenian Rhapsody certainly caught my attention in the GamingOnLinux inbox with a tagline of "Make friends and catch IBS". I obviously had to open that email and see what the heck this was all about.</p>
<p>Athenian Rhapsody is an upcoming comedy RPG, one that the publisher notes is "simultaneously a tribute to classic games such as Earthbound, absurdist comedy, and create your own adventure storybooks". </p>
<p>Made by solo developer Nico Papalia with a focus on tongue-in-cheek storytelling and vibrancy, you'll explore the colourful world of Athens as you make friends (or not), engage in rambunctious mini-games ranging from weight-lifting, shooting bugs, or drawing your own bosses to fight, and partake in excruciating challenges such as "Carry A Feather" as you travel from town-to-town. All this in the name of writing your own Rhapsody - a special, unique memento/token of your exact playthrough (no it's nothing to do with NFTs).</p>
<p>This is also the weirdest trailer I've seen in a long time:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NDYSfjIi-V4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5fb5c5185d344d49440909fc45d913a7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NDYSfjIi-V4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I have a key request in for this one because of how totally insane it seems. Hopefully I'll be able to see how well it runs on Steam Deck + Desktop Linux with Proton.</p>
<p>You'll be able to buy it on:</p>

      <title>Superhero strategy game Capes confirmed for release on May 29th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Capes is an XCOM-like superhero strategy game coming from Spitfire Interactive, comprised of key creatives behind the Hand of Fate franchise. It has a new trailer and a release date now!</p>
<p>Drawing upon experience that reaches back to Freedom Force (2002) and Teen Titans (2006), Spitfire is reimagining superhero tactics for a new age while learning from the past. Capes brings together a unique blend of classic influences including comics like Days of Future Past, Astro City, or Watchmen, and elements of games such as XCOM and Into the Breach.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qcLKBe6PDB4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/41b8c2626b51f8e2ef1b7b33ed4e3637.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qcLKBe6PDB4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The super villains won. 20 years later, in a time when people with superpowers are arrested and taken off the streets, a ragtag group of young heroes fight to liberate King City. Under the questionable guidance of Doctrine, one of the city’s last surviving Capes, this new team must learn to work together, uncover The Company's secrets, and find out whether they're strong enough to become the heroes King City needs them to be.</p>
<p>Recruit other emerging superheroes and take on The Company across a challenging hand-crafted tactical campaign. Tackle smaller stakes and learn to wield your team's powers in optional "patrol missions."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be Mighty: Play as a team of heroic protectors, each with unique skills and powers. Master each hero and unleash their devastating ultimate abilities!</li>
<li>Assemble Your Team: Combat isn't based on raw strength. Choose your heroes wisely and combine their individual superpowers to create powerful combo attacks!</li>
<li>Level Up: Complete challenging missions and side-quests to gain XP and unlock your heroes’ potential with new abilities and powerful upgrades!</li>
<li>Defeat Evil: Face down vile villains, criminal corporate henchmen, and powerful bosses. Do you have what it takes to free your city from the clutches of villainy!?</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm really excited by this one, as a big XCOM fan and lover of all things superhero related, so I have a key request in to hopefully be able to check it out on Linux Desktop and Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Take back 1944 occupied Poland in &#39;63 Days&#39;, will be optimised for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>63 Days is a new action strategy game coming from developer Destructive Creations who previously made War Mongrels and Ancestors Legacy. 63 Days is about brotherhood and the fight to regain independence against overwhelming odds in the 1944 occupied Warsaw, Poland.</p>
<p>They announced the game earlier this month, and over email they mentioned to me "We're working hard to optimize the game for Steamdeck. That means we're improving things like text scaling, controller support, and overall performance." which is great to see!</p>
<p>It’s an isometric real-time tactics game that follows in the footsteps of Destructive Creations' previous release, War Mongrels, building upon its gameplay mechanics. Ready for those of you looking to scratch that tactical itch playing a proven formula with quality graphics, fresh gameplay elements, and music produced by the legendary Adam Skorupa.</p>

      <title>Free Stars: Children of Infinity, sequel to The Ur-Quan Masters now on Kickstarter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pistol Shrimp Games, founded by Toys for Bob veterans, have today launched the Kickstarter campaign for Free Stars: Children of Infinity which is a direct sequel to The Ur-Quan Masters (Star Control 2).</p>
<p>Developers include the original creators of The Ur-Quan Masters, Paul Reiche III and Fred Ford (the original founders of Toys for Bob), Ken Ford, and Dan Gerstein.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="MqCnsE3hxP4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6d78a59f9c07693e23bcb30c95843152.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/MqCnsE3hxP4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release: "Happy days and jubilation, captains! Traversing the universe may be an endless venture, but we have finally reached the next destination in our long quest to bring Free Stars: Children of Infinity to life," said Pistol Shrimp Games’ founders Fred Ford and Dan Gerstein in a joint statement. "Help us complete this journey through the stars, and — with enough backers, we might even get to infinity plus one."</p>
<p>Even if you haven't played the original, which is free and open source and recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/free-stars-the-ur-quan-masters-open-source-star-control-2-now-available-on-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">had a Steam release</a>, plenty of games you've likely played were in some parts inspired by it. The Ur-Quan Masters has been called "one of the greatest games of all time" and praised by the likes of Tim Cain (Fallout, Fallout 2) of Obsidian Entertainment, Ken Levine (BioShock, System Shock 2, JUDAS) of Ghost Story Games, and Mark Darrah (Mass Effect), alumni of BioWare. The Ur-Quan Masters inspired countless other creators in the video game industry, including the devs behind No Man’s Sky, Subnautica, and Stellaris — to name just a few.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6783281921713283553gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6783281921713283553gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>They plan to have it highly moddable, as they said it "supports modding out of the box", and accessibility is a key issue for them too as they hope to include keyboard and controller support, co-op play, multiple difficulty modes, avoidable or automated combat, generated voice-over for vision-impaired players and so on.</p>
<p>They're seeking at least $100,000 on the Kickstarter campaign, with Native versions for Linux and macOS at a $220,000 stretch-goal. At time of writing, it already has over $80,000 and the Kickstarter has only been up for about 2 hours. So it's clearly got a lot of people excited.</p>

      <title>PAC-MAN Mega Tunnel Battle: Chomp Champs launches in early May</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I know I'm going to be suckered into PAC-MAN Mega Tunnel Battle: Chomp Champs when it releases on May 8th, after previously being a Stadia exclusive. Good to see more ex-Stadia games actually come to PC properly like this. Although, the press releases said May 9th, but Steam say May 8th so the Steam date might change.</p>
<p>After playing it myself on Stadia, before Google hit the dreaded killswitch, it actually was genuinely good fun. And unless they do something ridiculous with it, no doubt it will work really well with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux.</p>
<p>This is no normal PAC-MAN, it's a battle royale styled game with 64-player battles and various colourful connected mazes.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZGpZRuFKIKA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0c96be4a1ad719ceaf0dae0e4eba4278.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZGpZRuFKIKA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ready to welcome players of varying skill levels, game modes include Elimination Mode with arcade-style action where players of any rank can compete and earn Tokens to redeem on customisation items, and Ranked Mode where players battle against similarly skilled opponents from around the world and gain Rank XP earning their place on the leaderboards. </p>
<p>PAC-MAN MEGA TUNNEL BATTLE: CHOMP CHAMPS includes a Friend system that lets players drop into the same match with friends, track progress, and spectate the action when their friends – or foes – are playing the game.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has cross-platform multiplayer too, so finding a game with friends shouldn't be an issue.</p>

      <title>It took about 15 years but epic roguelike Caves of Qud is nearly done</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Caves of Qud from developer Freehold Games and publisher Kitfox Games is approaching the 1.0 finishing line, and so their roadmap towards the release has been put up and it sounds really exciting.</p>
<p>A big part of the work they've been doing is on the UI (user interface) to make it a lot more modern, and the good news there is that it's complete! A fresh public pre-release is coming soon that will feature:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- ALL NEW INTERFACE - The much-touted, transformational UI redesign is complete! Fully mouseable, fully gamepaddable, and gorgeous, but all carefully designed to maintain the essence of what makes Qud Qud.<br/>
- A refresh of the starting town of Joppa, with as much texture &amp; lived-in feeling as the rest of the world.<br/>
- Hundreds of new sound and visual effects.<br/>
- 40 new achievements.<br/>
- Several new narrative touches, big bug fixes, &amp; performance improvements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some shots of the new interface (click them to enlarge):</p>

<p>What's coming up next? Throughout the Summer and Fall they will be working to finish the main quest, and provide something for people who have finished it. That, plus a "more hands-on" tutorial. Then lots of smaller things like achievements, some missing sounds, visual effects, bug fixes and so on.</p>
<p>As for when it will release? They don't have an exact date yet but it will be sometime in late 2024.</p>
<p>How about after release though? They said they plan to keep updating it with major content and system releases, although how much they do " does depend on the financial realities of sales, but no matter what, we have two big DLCs planned already". They're not sure yet if the DLC will be free or paid just yet.</p>

      <title>Emulation tool RetroDECK brings in Ryujinx for Nintendo Switch, many other improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>RetroDECK is one of the simplest options for getting various emulators set up on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux, and the latest release has lots of fun improvements to check out.</p>
<p>What's the point of RetroDECK? It gives you an easy one-click install via Flatpak to get everything you need to play retro games. You just need to supply the games, they do all the configuration for you.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12684752391713269046gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12684752391713269046gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>In version 0.8.0b they've updated all available emulators to their latest versions, ES-DE (EmulationStation Desktop Edition) was also bumped up to version 3.0.1 and they pulled in some new system support too including:</p>
<ul>
<li>PSVita, trough Vita3K.</li>
<li>Solarus.</li>
<li>GZDoom that is now the DOOM system default engine.</li>
<li>Ryujinx for Nintendo Switch.</li>
<li>MAME (Standalone).</li>
</ul>
<p>There's also an overhaul to Steam controller layouts, there's controller configurations for 2-4 people multiplayer in Cemu, Duckstation, GZDoom, RPCS3 and Ryujinx.</p>
<p>With their configurator tool they added the ability to swap the ABXY buttons for compatible systems, Steam Flatpak detection for controller profile install, RetroDECK now knows if it is running on a real Steam Deck or other Linux desktop, they disabled the "Desktop Mode" warning when not running on Steam Deck, plus various other fixes in the <a href="https://github.com/XargonWan/RetroDECK/releases/tag/0.8.0b" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a>.</p>

      <title>Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat) Beta released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Canonical is gearing up for the release of the next LTS (long term support) version of Ubuntu, with a first Beta now available for Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat).</p>
<p>While the Beta is not intended for production use the developers said that the Beta is "known to be reasonably free of showstopper image build or installer bugs, while representing a very recent snapshot of 24.04 LTS that should be representative of the features intended to ship with the final release expected on April 25, 2024".</p>
<p>For gamers, you'll be pleased to know this release ships with the vm.max_map_count value boosted to 1048576, which is needed for certain games to run, this matches up with Fedora <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/arch-linux-changes-vmmax-map-count-to-match-fedora-ubuntu-for-better-gaming/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">and now Arch Linux too</a>.</p>
<p>A Games page has also been added to the Ubuntu App Center, the mail app Thunderbird version 115 has been moved to a Snap package, GNOME upgraded to version 46, you also get Firefox 124 and LibreOffice 24.2 and various upgrades to other included software like Pipewire 1.04. You're also getting kernel 6.8 as standard.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4572079991713268176gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4572079991713268176gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat) Beta</em></p>
<p>There's a few app changes too like the default install only being "minimal", but you can select "extended selection" to have stuff like LibreOffice and Thunderbird installed. GNOME Snapshot replaces Cheese for webcams and Games are no longer installed by default. Various improvements to the look and feel of their Flutter-based installer too with it being more customizable.</p>
<p>Plenty of security improvements have been implemented too like some tweaks to the Ubuntu kernel to restrict the use of unprivileged user namespaces, TLS 1.0, 1.1 and DTLS 1.0 are forcefully disabled, they said that packages are now "built with security-hardening features which stop many undiscovered security vulnerabilities, rendering them unexploitable" and more.</p>
<p>Various other upgrades included too like GCC 14, Python 3.12, OpenJDK 21, LLVM 18, Rust 1.75, Golang 1.22 and .NET 8.</p>
<p>Ubuntu 24.04 is also the first LTS release that supports the Raspberry Pi 5 with both arm64 server and desktop images.</p>
<p>Ubuntu 24.04 LTS will be supported for 5 years until June 2029. </p>
<p>You can find the downloads on <a href="https://releases.ubuntu.com/24.04/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Ubuntu website</a>. Release notes on <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/noble-numbat-release-notes/39890" rel="noopener" target="_blank">their forum</a>.</p>

      <title>Descent 3 has been made open source</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update #2, 21/04/24 18:06</strong>: the code is now licensed under the GPL!</p>
<p><strong>Update 18/04/24 15:11</strong>: there seems to be an issue with the licensing at the moment. The MIT license was not meant to be up on it, as this was <a href="https://github.com/kevinbentley/Descent3/issues/32#issuecomment-2061461160" rel="noopener" target="_blank">apparently</a> the default GitHub put on it. That license has now been removed, and so there's now <em>no</em> license on it. Hopefully this will be sorted soon so it can be clear for anyone who wishes to contribute.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Another classic has been given the open source treatment, with Descent 3 from Outrage Entertainment now available under the MIT license. This release was put up on <a href="https://github.com/kevinbentley/Descent3" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a> by Kevin Bentley, one of the original developers.</p>
<p>It has a bit of an interesting history as it was originally ported to Linux way back in 2000 from Loki Entertainment, which didn't age particularly well. Then <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/02/descent-3-returns-to-linux-and-macos-with-an-official-modern-port/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">much later in 2020</a> developer Ryan "Icculus" Gordon did a re-port with various upgrades.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7721286881713266742gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7721286881713266742gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>From the GitHub:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the latest version of the Descent 3 source code. This includes the '1.5' patch that Jeff Slutter and Kevin Bentley wrote several years ago. At the time, it worked for Windows, Linux, and Mac.</p>
<p>Some proprietary sound and video libraries from Interplay have been stripped out (the ACM and MVE format). I have that code if someone wants to help make a converter so the old cutscenes work. It'll take some effort to stub out that code so it compiles.</p>
<p>The first thing I want to do is get everything compiling again, and ideally some CI/CD actions. After that, the code needs to be cleaned up some, to remove old version control comments, etc. A lot of this code was written by a really great team, but keep in mind we were much younger and less experienced back then.</p>
<p>If you're interested in helping maintain it, please send me a message. Otherwise, I'm happy to take pull requests.</p>
<p>This is the last update I put out there showing different architectures playing along. Yikes, that was a long time ago, sorry we never released a 1.5 patch. Some logistics got in the way!</p>
<p>Thanks to Jeff Slutter, who did most of the work modernizing the code from the 90's. I'm looking forward to seeing what the community does with it!</p>

      <title>Half-Life remake Black Mesa has a big upgrade with DXVK 2.3.1, optimizations and bug fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Crowbar Collective have released the Necro Patch for the Half-Life remake Black Mesa, which brings with it some essential bug fixes and some nice optimizations. If you had issues with it previously, you might want to give it another go as it sounds like they put a fair amount of work into this update.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20051272641713256700gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20051272641713256700gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Main Update Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improved performance of the game (Vulkan, UI optimization, New Renderer/New Post Post Process Optimization).</li>
<li>Fixed cases where game would crash on startup.</li>
<li>Fixed UI flickering and artifacting.</li>
<li>Fixed crash in the first map of Interloper that players were experiencing.</li>
<li>Improved controller support using Steam Input (<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/362890/discussions/0/6733519291681971343/?snr=1_2108_9__2107" rel="noopener" target="_blank">more info</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed hitch when weapon decals are first applied to gun.</li>
<li>Re-enabled weapon decals by default.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>One thing to note is that they mentioned in the update that they may be looking into "more robust fixes that might break saves and switching over Linux support to Proton, but we don’t have a timeline for that". So eventually the Native Linux version may no longer be a thing. Presumably because it works better with Proton and they're already using a big part of Proton anyway (DXVK) for rendering on Windows (Linux still seems to use Valve's really old ToGL).</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another festival of games is live on Steam now with Steam FPS Fest 2024 running until April 22nd at 10am PT / 5pm UTC, and there's also plenty of demos for games to try too.</p>
<p>For those of you building up thousands of Steam Points as well the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/points/shop/event/sale_fps_fest" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Points Shop</a> also has a couple of new items for the event. Good, because I have nearly a <em>million</em> and need something to do with them…wait a minute, they're free?! </p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After the success with the Crusader Kings III: Chapter III season pass, Paradox have decided to give the same treatment to Stellaris with Stellaris: Season 08. We also have a new trailer and release date for Stellaris: The Machine Age.</p>
<p>Basically Stellaris: Season 08 will include Stellaris: The Machine Age, Stellaris: Cosmic Storms and Stellaris: The Grand Archive Story Pack for one single purchase. Plus you also get a Rick The Cube Species Portrait instantly when purchasing. Speaking about it they said "There’s a chance that we might experiment with some other ideas that might or might not come out later this year, but Stellaris: Season 08 will include all of the major releases of 2024."</p>
<p>Stellaris: The Machine Age was also confirmed for release on May 7th with a new trailer:</p>
