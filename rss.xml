      <title>The cross-platform Nexus Mods app v0.21.1 makes mod collection installation smoother</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Nexus Mods app team have rolled out another early release for their in-progress successor to Vortex, with v0.21.1 bringing more improvements. It's free, open source and most importantly - has a Native Linux version available.</p>
<p>With this release they said the focus has been on "making mod collection installation smoother, improving Health Checks and logs, and squashing several key bugs for a more reliable experience". While in the background work continues on technical features needed to support Bethesda games like Skyrim and Fallout 4.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6910706071763574417gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6910706071763574417gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>From the changelog:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Features:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collection Conflict Rules:</strong> Mod collection <strong>conflict resolution rules</strong> (which files win when multiple mods include the same file) are now correctly applied the very <strong>first time</strong> you install a collection. This ensures your collection starts up correctly from the beginning.</li>
<li><strong>Better File Checks:</strong> The "Missing Game Files" Health Check now includes a <strong>list of the actual affected files</strong>. This makes it much easier to pinpoint exactly which files need attention.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h3>Bug Fixes and Stability:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fixed Collection Installation:</strong> Fixed a bug that occurred when installing collections that use <strong>Fomod installers with predefined choices</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Resolved 'File In Use' Error:</strong> Fixed a "File in use" exception that could appear when <strong>unmanaging a game</strong> and then trying to <strong>delete the associated mods</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Logging:</strong> Added more <strong>debug information</strong> to the logs, specifically for cases where <strong>backup limit exceptions</strong> are triggered. This will help our team diagnose and fix these issues.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h3>Behind-the-Scenes Improvements:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Refactoring and Optimizations:</strong> we did some general refactoring and optimization related to project structure, hashing and GameIds.</li>
<li><strong>UI State System:</strong> Implemented a system to <strong>save and restore user interface (UI) state</strong>. While not actively used yet, this sets the stage for features where views can remember your preferred layouts and configurations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Considering we're about to see more hardware arriving with SteamOS Linux like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-reveal-the-new-steam-frame-steam-controller-and-steam-machine-with-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the new Steam Machine and Steam Frame</a>, getting a properly good cross-platform mod manager like this is going to be essential. So it's pleasing to watch it continue to mature towards being the go-to.</p>

      <title>AMD FSR Redstone arrives December 10 with a teaser</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AMD have gone and done it. They've put up a teaser for an announcement of AMD FSR Redstone arriving on December 10. Marketing - you gotta love it right? A 26 second video that tells us nothing at all, only that FSR Redstone is "premiering on December 10th".</p>
<p>Officially, only Radeon RX 9000 will be supported, so a lot of GPU owners are going to miss out unless they upgrade. Well, FSR4 can be made to work on earlier models (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/steam-deck-plugin-adds-amd-fsr4-support-to-improve-visuals/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">even the Steam Deck</a>), but it's not completely clear exactly what Redstone will hook into so it may just be out of reach for older generations.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6IWzvKxkKVc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c59bfe641070fdabfd325e71376012d6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6IWzvKxkKVc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>According to AMD's own information, FSR Redstone key highlights include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FSR "Redstone" is a suite of ML-powered gaming technologies, delivering smoother performance and sharper visuals on the latest on AMD RDNA™ 4 GPUs – coming soon.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FSR Upscaling:</strong> (Formerly AMD FidelityFX™ Super Resolution) Reconstructs crisp, high-quality visuals from low-resolution frames. </li>
<li><strong>FSR Frame Generation:</strong> Predicts and inserts new frames between rendered ones, delivering smoother and higher frame rate gaming.</li>
<li><strong>FSR Ray Regeneration:</strong> Infers and restores full-quality ray-traced detail from sparse samples, delivering sharp, noise-free visuals with reduced rendering cost. </li>
<li><strong>FSR Radiance Caching:</strong> Dynamically learns and then predicts how light propagates through a scene, delivering efficient real-time global illumination. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I do wonder how long it will be before Proton supports it. We only just had <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/vkd3d-proton-3-0-brings-fsr4-support-shader-backend-rewrite-lots-of-bug-fixes-and-performance-upgrades/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VKD3D-Proton 3.0 released which finally has FSR4 support</a> - so it may be a little while. As always, GamingOnLinux will let you know when we know without any clickbait on it.</p>

      <title>A great showcase of open source - Blender 5.0 is out with completely overhauled colour management</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another release is here for the incredible open source project Blender. The 5.0 release brings huge changes like completely overhauled colour management.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bringing with it a refreshed colour management pipeline that natively supports wide-gamut and HDR colour spaces. This also comes with improvements to their Vulkan support, and is supported on both Linux and Windows. With these improvements you get new display and views including support for:</p>
<ul>
<li>ACES 1.3 and 2.0 views as an alternative to AgX and Filmic and for compatibility with ACES pipelines (both standard and HDR).</li>
<li>Rec.2100-PQ and Rec.2100-HLG displays. May be used for color grading for <a href="https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/pipeline_io/#images-movies" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">HDR video export</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/142758" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">AgX HDR</a> view.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Tons more new like much faster material compilation, a new fully realistic skeleton asset from the community, lots of big new rendering features like the Compositor in Blender 5.0 gaining a new asset shelf filled with built-in effects. There's also massive improvements to the Video Sequencer with "unprecedented integration" across different areas of the app, the UV Sync feature has been completely overhauled and enabled by default, there's lots of improvements for XR / VR and the list goes on forever.</p>
<p>On Linux there's also now support for the cursor-shape protocol under Wayland.</p>
<p>Check out their official overview video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4wEqD-jK0DU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a9f936c55ffe5841034904337c42eb85.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4wEqD-jK0DU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking as someone who doesn't work with modelling and the like, this is far from my comfort zone. But, as an open source project it really does showcase how amazing the open source community can be - building something as incredible and feature-filled as this.</p>

      <title>Surviving each day is a fierce battle in the upcoming Primal Survival</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Primal Survival is an upcoming prehistoric game about surviving as Homo habilis or Homo erectus, and it really sounds interesting with the dangerous world.</p>
<p>At the dawn of human history, fire has just been discovered and you're taking steps into a wider world. That's the basics of Primal Survival, it's all about sending you back in time some 2.5–3 million years, where hunting for the basics like food and water is as dangerous as anything else.</p>
<p>Check out the announcement trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="61mqauOptAw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6b3e79da9d68158781681a7d1b4cbcfa.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/61mqauOptAw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some things to expect from it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Paleo-Atmosphere: No zombies, no magic. Just a world populated by scientifically grounded megafauna like Mammoths, Smilodons, and Platybelodons.</li>
<li>Archaic Struggle: There is no modern tech. You rely on stone, bone, and wood. It is about surviving nature exactly as early humans did.</li>
<li>Visuals: We are using Unreal Engine 5.5 (Nanite + Lumen) to create a gritty, dark, and dangerous environment.</li>
<li>Co-op: You can form a tribe with friends to build shelter and stand a chance against the ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- squire --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking over email about Linux support the developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- squire -->Linux gaming is important to us, and we know your community values proper support.<br/>
We’re actively working to ensure the game runs well on Linux through Proton, and we’re paying attention to Linux-specific issues throughout development. Supporting Linux players is definitely part of our plans as we move toward the next phases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But why another survival game? What's different about it? They said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- squire -->We wanted to move away from fantasy tropes and create a grounded, scientifically based prehistoric experience. Unlike many survival games where you quickly become powerful, our core philosophy is simple: <strong>You are not the hunter. You are the prey.</strong></p>

      <title>I have finished Dispatch and now I&#39;m at a loss so I&#39;m going to play it again</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Last night I finished my first run in the new episodic superhero adventure Dispatch from AdHoc Studio, and now I don't know what to do with myself.</p>
<p>So I think I'll treat myself to playing through it again, because there's a good amount of choices that really clearly affect big parts of the overall story, and I can think of numerous times where I would like to do something differently. I even managed to hook in the partner to play it through, and it sounds like they're going to be doing the same with an additional play-through.</p>
<p>It's easily one of the absolute best game of the year by far, and I'm pleased to see it has been a huge success for AdHoc Studio! Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dispatch-is-on-course-to-beat-its-three-year-sales-target-in-three-months-heres-how" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GI.Biz</a>, the developer noted how they expected to hit a specific target within three years that they're now on track to do in only three months.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19589840331763555836gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The game is split into two parts — there's anime-styled cut scenes that allow you to pick between watching like a mini-movie or with quick-time events, and then there's the hero management. The management side of it was great fun too, surprisingly challenging as well with you needing to match up the right hero from your team of reformed villains to each call.</p>
<p>Making it an episodic format like a TV show was a clever move too, with excitement building up for each new episode as they came out in blocks of two. That could have just as easily worked against them, but thankfully it has paid off. Seeing everyone talk about it as the episodes rolled in, seeing the hype — it's an experience that's nice not to miss. And thanks to Valve, no one on Linux / SteamOS has to miss out with Proton running Windows games so nicely.</p>
<p>I'll admit the brief bit of nudity was a surprise in one episode, especially where it opens with a rather spicy scene. Caught me out good that did. Good job I wasn't playing it around anyone else - hah. Definitely not a game to play around younger people.</p>
<p>Dispatch made me <em>really</em> feel something too. You'll know the scenes if you've played it. When a certain speedy character says "keep up" and runs off and bad stuff happens. Then the next episode, in a past memory they say "keep up" again and then it jumps back to now and someone is in hospital. The entire mood of the episode is completely different to everything else. The rain on the map in the management section too, the carefully muted audio - gosh, I felt the sadness in me too. The writing and the voice acting is just, <em>fantastic</em>. It all made me really truly care about the characters that I just had to write something more on the game because it's <em>so</em> good.</p>
<p>That's why I feel like I'm at such a loss. It really truly sucked me in, and I feel a sense of nothing without it right now because it's done and finished.</p>
<p>If you've been sitting on the fence about it just jump off already, it's brilliant. I need more. I really hope for a second season, or just more games that mix things together so nicely like this did. Just more <em>please</em>. I'm starving for it. It's safe to say I'll be jumping right into whatever AdHoc Studio make next if it's anything near this quality level.</p>
<p>The game works perfectly on Desktop Linux and Steam Deck with Proton. Not a single issue encountered. It is one of the most perfect for Steam Deck games I've played.</p>

      <title>Megabonk from vedinad has withdrawn from The Game Awards 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Game Awards is never without some kind of controversy, but this is a little different. Developer vedinad has withdrawn Megabonk from The Game Awards 2025.</p>
<p>Why? As listed <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/the-game-awards-2025-reveals-all-the-nominees/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">in our original article</a>, they were in the running for "Best Debut Indie Game". However, this is <em>not</em> their first game, just their first under the name of vedinad.</p>
<p>Writing on <a href="https://x.com/MegabonkGame/status/1990856468615061603" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">X / Twitter</a> they said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7344880681763553321gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Geoff Keighley <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1990899068022005881" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed</a> they've spoken to sort the situation:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21223717201763553796gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>While I applaud their honesty, and their attempt to address it like this, it does shine a light on the <em>Debut</em> category as a whole that feels like Megabonk could have been kept in. Since, other games in the category are from studios that have plenty of veterans. Like how Dispatch from AdHoc Studio was formed by former devs of the likes of Telltale Games and Ubisoft, same again with Sandfall Interactive who has veterans from Ubisoft and other studios.</p>
<p>What would TGA be without a little drama huh? Like how in 2023, Dave the Diver was nominated in the "Best Independent Game" category, despite it very much not being an indie game in any way. The developer, Mintrocket, is owned by the huge Nexon group.</p>

      <title>Steamworks SDK adds support for Linux Arm and Android, and it seems we know the first Android game on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As we get closer to the launch of the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-reveal-the-new-steam-frame-steam-controller-and-steam-machine-with-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new Steam Machine and Steam Frame</a>, Valve put out a new Steamworks SDK that brings in libraries for linuxarm64 and android.</p>
<p>This is of course work more specifically for the Steam Frame, since it's using an ARM64 processor and it will support running Android APKs to hopefully get developers from other VR kits to work with it. And, as confirmed previously by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/818672/valve-android-apps-steam-frame" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The Verge</a>, Steam itself is getting Android games to go with it.</p>
<p>Steamworks SDK 1.63 <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/627817201164877826" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added libs for linuxarm64 and androidarm64.</li>
<li>ISteamMusicRemote has been removed.</li>
</ul>
<strong>ISteamController</strong>
<ul>
<li>Added controller action origins for Lenovo Legion Go.</li>
<li>Added controller action origins for generic controller.</li>
</ul>
<strong>ISteamInput</strong>
<ul>
<li>Added input action origins for Lenovo Legion Go.</li>
<li>Added input action origins for generic controller.</li>
</ul>
<strong>ISteamRemotePlay</strong>
<ul>
<li>Added keypad scancode values.</li>
</ul>
<strong>ISteamUser</strong>
<ul>
<li>GetMarketEligibility may now return new k_EMarketNotAllowedReason_TradeCooldown status code in MarketEligibilityResponse_t.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And it seems we may know what the first Android game being added to Steam is, with Walkabout Mini Golf. As noted on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1408230/history/?changeid=32325165" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> (thanks to <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1990961231180542086" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Brad Lynch</a> on X), Android has been added to the "oslist" (operating system list) with the details noting the "WalkaboutMiniGolf.apk" executable file it will launch.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19690952121763552816gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Fun times ahead. The industry is going to look quite different by the end of 2026.</p>
<p>Imagine if Valve actually fully rolled out running Android stuff on SteamOS as a whole via the compatibility layer Proton, and not just for the Steam Frame. That would be <em>very</em> interesting, and perhaps already in their plans.</p>

      <title>JSAUX are teasing Steam Machine front panels with built-in screens</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>JSAUX are teasing that they're going to be making <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-reveal-the-new-steam-frame-steam-controller-and-steam-machine-with-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Machine</a> accessories, with the first being a new front panel for the Steam Machine with a screen. Some company was obviously going to do this, especially since Valve actually teased it was possible and showed off a prototype with a few YouTubers.</p>
<p>Writing on X / Twitter on November 17, JSAUX <a href="https://x.com/jsauxofficial/status/1990418613380186120" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">teased</a> a few different ideas including an E-Ink display, LCD or Dot-Matrix. Asking people to vote in the comments.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/993021921763551983gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>In a later <a href="https://x.com/jsauxofficial/status/1990812744216363357" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, they teased a mock-up image noting something was coming in 2026.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18005856441763552020gol1.webp" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18005856441763552020gol1.webp"/></a></p>
<p>Just like we had lots and lots of accessories for the Steam Deck, this could be another fun boost for accessory companies like JSAUX. Having more set hardware like this makes it easy for them, and fun for all of us to see what they can come up with. And no doubt I'll be testing a good few of them over the next year or two.</p>
<p>I wonder what else companies will come up with to empty our wallets for the Steam Machine and Steam Frame next year?</p>

      <title>Unity games are coming to Fortnite as Epic continue attempting to build a metaverse thing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Epic Games are still trying to build some kind of metaverse inside Fortnite, and now they're pulling in Unity to expand Fortnite even more.</p>
<p>I know - Fortnite doesn't work at all on Linux / SteamOS, it's listed on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our dedicated anti-cheat page</a> as broken, but it's still big industry news to be aware of. Plus, with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-reveal-the-new-steam-frame-steam-controller-and-steam-machine-with-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">upcoming Steam Machine and Steam Frame</a>, who knows, maybe we'll actually pull in a few more millions of people that Epic can't ignore. Anti-cheat is <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/anti-cheat-will-still-be-one-of-the-biggest-problems-for-the-new-steam-machine/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">going to remain quite a blocker</a> though until we see more people move to Linux / SteamOS for gaming.</p>
<p>Anyway, the news. That's why you're here, not my rambling. In a <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/unity-and-epic-games-together-advance-the-open-interoperable-future-for-video-gaming" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> Epic Games announced they're teaming up with Unity to "bring Unity games into Fortnite, creating more opportunity and value for players and developers" giving developers the "ability to publish Unity games into Fortnite". </p>
<p>I do find this very interesting actually. Because while the Epic Games Store might not be a goldmine for third-party developers, Fortnite clearly has a lot of eyes on it all the time. Epic are probably one of the few that could make this whole metaverse thing actually work, since Fortnite is already very popular. And now more different games inside it from a different game engine? The industry is getting <em>weird</em>.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“We’re excited to partner with Epic Games to create more opportunities for game developers around the world,” said Matt Bromberg, President and CEO, Unity. “Choice and open systems create growth for everyone in the gaming ecosystem.”</p>
<p>“Just like the early days of the web, we believe that companies need to work together in order to build the open metaverse in a way that’s interoperable and fair,” said Tim Sweeney, Founder and CEO of Epic Games. “Working alongside Unity we’re helping developers build fun games, reach bigger audiences, and find success.”</p>

      <title>Hello from Fedora KDE</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I recently did a bit of a major <em>woops</em>, and so I decided perhaps it is once again time to Linux distro hop and have settled on Fedora KDE.</p>
<p>You see even though I have been using computers since I was tiny in the days of the Amiga, and I've been using Linux for…21 years now (oh god, I feel old writing that), I'm still a bit of a complete <em>moron</em> at times. Why you might ask? Because I just like to ignore clear problems and "yolo" my way through things apparently.</p>
<p>I had an issue that annoyed me — my main Kubuntu 25.04 partition was getting filled up, and it caused a serious problem recently where I couldn't actually boot into it. Linux doesn't particularly handle a main drive being filled gracefully (still?!), so I thought - okay, I'll actually remove a bunch of games I'm not playing from the other partition and merge them into one big partition for my main drive. That would solve <em>everything</em>. I still had <em>three</em> other drives to fill with games that I keep telling myself I will get around to actually playing.</p>
<p>So, off to download an Ubuntu ISO I went. Burned it to a USB drive, loaded it up and started up gparted. This is where the <em>problems</em> began. The gparted app froze up on me. I (stupidly), thought nothing of it. Forced it closed, started it up again and it got stuck again but this time while scanning my drives for an eternity (okay, a few minutes but it didn't budge). I googled around, found I could launch gparted just on the specific drive I needed it for — it worked! <em>Or, so I thought…</em></p>
<p>It was going to take an hour or so to resize the drive, so off I went to do some overdue housework. I came back a few times to inspect, all going well but eventually — it froze. Oh no. Oh dear. I left it a while again but it had very clearly frozen up, the app was doing <em>nothing</em> it was just totally stuck. In hindsight, if gparted on a live ISO is being weird, don't use it. Nevermind, lessons learned that will no doubt be ignored again in future.</p>
<p>The only reasonable thing to do at this point where you need your system back quick is to go totally <em>nuclear</em> right? Annihilate the partitions from orbit, and pick a new distribution while you're at it. And that's exactly what I did. So, hello from Fedora KDE - things are a bit different, but also very much the same. The new home that powers basically everything GamingOnLinux.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6909728911763550435gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6909728911763550435gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><em>Feels just like /home</em></p>
<p>Luckily for me, I don't keep anything actually important on my main drive. It's spread across multiple other drives and the cloud, so nothing was actually lost. Apart from my ability to remember how to properly set up accessing the GamingOnLinux server from within the Dolphin file manager. But, this time when I had it all re-done, I actually noted down the exact steps. Hooray for less confusion for when I no doubt break something again. I'm really good at breaking things, as a few contributors and readers will know. There was the time I completely broke an install trying to compile OBS Studio from source, yes really. No I still don't know how I did it.</p>
<p>Fedora's newer installer is quite nice too, looks streamlined and somewhat inviting and works well! Got me back up and running in no time at all.</p>
<p>I'm glad the Fedora crew decided to promote their KDE edition to full status. KDE Plasma is simply my love, I couldn't be without it nowadays. No hate to the GNOME crew, but your desktop and the design decisions around it just doesn't jive with me. I like all the options KDE Plasma gives me. That, and KDE Plasma is the Desktop Mode on Steam Deck and soon the Steam Frame and Steam Machine too - so it's nice to have everything match.</p>
<p><em>Anyway, back to work. Carry on.</em></p>

      <title>Playnite may get a Linux version during 2026 as the creator plans a move to Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Creator of the popular free and open source video game library manager Playnite has a positive update on a Linux version, with plans for it during 2026.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/popular-game-launcher-playnite-will-get-linux-support-but-its-still-a-while-away/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Back in February</a>, GamingOnLinux covered the latest update from the creator on their plans for it, where they noted "To sum this up, Linux version is definitely something I plan to work on in future, it's just going to happen later than originally planned.".</p>
<p>Seems this may come just a <em>bit</em> sooner than expected, as per the latest update from the developer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"2025 update 2</p>
<p>I'm planning to move to Linux in 2026 after P11 is done, and since Playnite is my personal blocker for the move, I will try to make some Linux version in 2026. Definitely not fully featured version on parity with Windows version of P11, and probably desktop mode only, but something daily drivable with Linux specific features (Wine/Proton integration for example).</p>
<p>If that goes well, I'll start looking into P11 Avalonia porting proper say I mentioned in previous update."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hopefully their Linux move and work on Playnite for Linux go well. See more about Playnite on their <a href="https://playnite.link/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>The Game Awards returns for another popularity contest, and they've revealed the nominees for the 2025 event that we've listed here for you.</p>

      <title>Hytale has been saved as Hypixel acquired it from Riot Games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For anyone interested in the ongoing saga of Hytale, the good news is that the game has been saved, with Hytale Studios acquiring it from Riot Games.</p>
<p>What is it? Hytale blends the freedom of a sandbox with the momentum of an RPG: explore a procedurally generated world full of dungeons, secrets, and a variety of creatures, then shape it block by block. Riot purchased the studio back in 2020, and then in June 2025 announced the cancellation of it. Now, it's back!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10113050721763467693gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>As detailed in a <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-is-saved" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> they explained how they've managed to rehire "more than 30" developers who were previously working on the game, with them hoping to bring back even more and all while being "fully independent and personally committed to funding Hytale for the next 10 years".</p>
<p>The too long / didn't read from the blog post (they included this themselves):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Early access date:</strong> To be announced in the coming days</li>
<li><strong>Platform:</strong> Windows at launch, Linux / Mac will be attempted, other platforms much later</li>
<li><strong>Pricing:</strong> Details to be announced in the coming days</li>
<li><strong>Early access state:</strong> Expect bugs, rough edges, unbalanced content, and frequent updates that break things</li>
<li><strong>Early access duration:</strong> Expected to last at least a few years; no rush to "1.0"</li>
<li><strong>Launch content:</strong> Exploration Mode, Creative Mode, and Modding</li>
<li><strong>Not at launch:</strong> Minigames and Adventure Mode (both come later; dedicated team for minigames)</li>
<li><strong>Ownership:</strong> We own 100% of Hytale (repurchased from Riot Games)</li>
<li><strong>Funding:</strong> 10-year personal funding commitment; no investors or publishers</li>
<li><strong>Game build:</strong> Using the previous engine from the trailer, enabling faster development and immediate playability</li>
<li><strong>Modding:</strong> Available at launch. Run your own servers and create custom content.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Pretty fun to see they will even attempt a Linux version too. Although, we do have Wine / Proton if they're unable to do it.</p>
<p>Nice to see some good news from the games industry.</p>

      <title>The big new RPG Where Winds Meet release works well on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Where Winds Meet is a new free to play game on Steam that's doing some big numbers right now, and thankfully it seems to work great on Linux with Proton. Tested with Proton 10, so far I haven't encountered any issues.</p>
<p>What is it? Set during the turbulent era of tenth-century China with a Wuxia theme, it's an open-world action-adventure RPG. It's not directly an MMO though. It sort-of blends the worlds of solo and online play together. You can play it entirely alone, or team up with up with friends to play together. But, it does have some MMO features in it too like guilds and group activities. When starting the game, you choose initially how you want to play it. It's a curious mixture.</p>
<p>Proving to be popular too with it hitting an all-time peak of 193,860 players online on November 16th following the launch on November 14th.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10977799781763465123gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10977799781763465123gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15655938401763465855gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15655938401763465855gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Surprisingly, it doesn't appear to have anti-cheat. There's nothing listed on the Steam page, and it works out of the box with Proton 10. So for now it's <em>not</em> listed on our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated anti-cheat page</a> but that could change with the popularity of it, so we'll be keeping a close eye on this one. Hopefully for players interested it will just continue working.</p>
<p>Performance at 2560x1440 on my Ryzen 5800x + Radeon 6800 XT on the defaults seems mostly great. Some blips down to 50FPS during the intense intro scene, but other than that it has been smooth. This is with most settings on Ultra, only Ambient Occlusion and Tessellation are on High.</p>
<p>It does commit two annoying sins: a forced intro with no ability to change settings. And, you cannot change settings on the main menu, only once you login with your character. Both quite hostile user experiences.</p>
<p>As it's free to play, there are in-game purchases which the developer and publisher has promised "no pay-to-win mechanics to ensure a fair gameplay environment".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="e8S4yoXNMPU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/95d2db3f9bd41d30aaafc61dbf857b19.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/e8S4yoXNMPU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where Winds Meet boasts a vast, intricately crafted open world filled with life, featuring over 20 distinct regions to explore. The game harmoniously integrates history with the imaginative essence of the Wuxia world. With more than 10,000 unique NPCs, each with their own personalities and responses, players can shape their interactions, turning characters into trusted allies or sworn enemies based on their choices.</p>
<p>The game offers players the opportunity to master over 40 unique Martial Mystic Arts and an arsenal of weapons, including Spears, Swords, Dual Blades, Glaive, Umbrella, and Fans, and unlock distinctive martial arts skills, including Acupuncture Hitting, Lion's Roar, Merciful Picking, and Tai Chi.</p>
<p>Choose to embark on a journey as a lone swordsman or team up with up to 4 others on your adventure, as players can immerse themselves in over 150 hours of rich, narratively driven exploration and adventure. Those looking to test their newly established skills on the battlefield can take part in PVP battles against other players.</p>
<p>Craft your own legend and weave your own destiny as Where Winds Meet lets players pick the job role that best suits them. Players can pick from the role of a doctor, merchant, assassin or bounty hunter. Decide the path you take, whether that’s good or evil, the choices to stay true to your original aspiration or throw it all away, all in the name of freedom and unbound adventure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Something that does concern me a bit is the apparent use of generative AI. Specifically, it seems they may be using some kind of AI chatbox for some (not all) NPCs, which is not listed on the Steam page. There's plenty of reports out there on it - just search for "AI" on their <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereWindsMeet/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Reddit</a> and you'll see loads. Hopefully Valve will get them to update the store page to clearly note any generative AI use for players to get a clear picture.</p>

      <title>Earth 2140 remake on OpenRA engine OpenE2140 gets a first release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>OpenE2140 is bringing back Earth 2140, the classic RTS with it being powered by the OpenRA engine and a first release is out now. Showing just how great the OpenRA engine is, hopefully we'll see more revivals like this for other retro strategy games.</p>
<p>It's classed as an "early access alpha release" as it's not complete. There's no AI in it yet, so the focus is currently on multiplayer. Writing about it the developers said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We understand that this might be a bit disappointing for some people — Earth 2140 was mainly a single-player game after all. However, making AI work with the specifics of Earth 2140 (mainly base building) is going to take some time. We’ve focused on adding as many gameplay features as possible before making this public release, because that’s what’s actually most important: without units and buildings, you can’t really play an RTS like Earth 2140.</p>
<p>We think your ability to play multiplayer games with others may actually be interesting, because only the old DOS version of Earth 2140 had multiplayer — and even that was hard to get working (all Windows versions came without multiplayer and never received it after release).</p>

      <title>Steam Deck gets display-off low power downloads in a new stable update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have released the big upgrade for Steam Deck that brings display-off low power downloads for everyone now, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/steam-deck-gets-a-new-low-power-screen-off-downloads-mode/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">after a short time in Beta</a>. I'm actually surprised the Beta was so short for such a big feature, I would have thought it would need a fair amount more testing time, but Valve do like to roll out things pretty rapidly sometimes.</p>
<p>What this means: when you go to put your Steam Deck to sleep and you have active downloads, it will now ask what you want to do between continue downloading with the screen off or going right to sleep. By default it's turned on for when you're plugged in, and turned off for when on battery power. You can tweak the behaviour in the power settings menu.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19469821331763459923gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19469821331763459923gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8843652231763459924gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8843652231763459924gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>The full Steam Deck changelog for the November 17th update:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Display-Off Low Power Downloads</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added a new feature, allowing Steam Deck to complete all active downloads in a new display-off low-power mode before going to sleep.</li>
<li>This feature is enabled by default when Steam Deck is plugged in to power, and can also be enabled on battery power in Settings &gt; Power.</li>
<li>Learn more about this feature at our blog post <a class="Link _29bMZB6BOQfTQ_3za-w60I" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/771930569635267984?snr=1_2108_9__2107" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">here</a><strong>.</strong></li>

      <title>Mesa 25.3.0 released with lots of Linux graphics driver improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just as the weekend arrived, Mesa 25.3.0 was released as the latest new-feature upgrade for open source Linux graphics drivers.</p>
<p>Curiously, it was <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/tags/mesa-25.3.0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">tagged</a> and put out on the 14th but as of yet there's been <em>no</em> release announcement to the mailing list, and <em>no</em> news post to notify of the new release on the official Mesa website either. I <em>was</em> waiting on the actual announcements before posting either Friday or Saturday, but it seems to be coming in quite late. So anyway, here we are.<br/>
<em>Minor update 22:59 UTC: a while after publishing the <a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/relnotes/25.3.0.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Mesa news post</a> went live.</em></p>
<p>As usual, you may want to stick with the previous latest bug fix release with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/linux-open-source-graphics-drivers-mesa-25-2-7-released/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mesa 25.2.7</a> until the first point release for Mesa 25.3 is out while they deal with any issues that appear. The release calendar is not up to date yet either, but we can usually expect the Mesa 25.3.1 release in around 2 weeks.</p>
<p>Whenever they actually publish the announcements, we can see from <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/blob/523eea18c546b67ce0ed8425f5eb469808fa7523/docs/relnotes/25.3.0.rst" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitLab</a> this will be in the release notes:</p>

      <title>VKD3D-Proton 3.0 brings FSR4 support, shader backend rewrite, lots of bug fixes and performance upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>VKD3D-Proton is one of the secret ingredients for Proton to make so many Windows games work well on Linux / SteamOS with a new 3.0 release out now.</p>
<p>You don't need to actually do anything to upgrade, as Valve pull in VKD3D-Proton changes for Proton versions themselves that you'll see in future Proton release updates. However, if you wish to try it out in the current version of Proton <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-update-dxvk-and-vkd3d-proton-in-proton-and-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">we have a GamingOnLinux guide</a> to tell you what to do.</p>
<p>In VKD3D-Proton 3.0 there's a a major DXBC shader backend rewrite that brings improvements to the D3D12 mode in various games, resulting in some games that were previously broken being fixed. Nice! They noted that "Some recently released DXBC based games also only work on the new path" and that DXVK shares the same backend, so it has been tested quite heavily.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/497785671763397391gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Mafia: Definitive Edition</em></p>
<p>There's also the exciting FSR4 support added in which will even work on older AMD GPUs, although the default build of VKD3D-Proton only exposes the feature for RDNA4+ since the "quite hacky emulation path" for older GPUs comes with a "significant performance cost (and some cost to theoretical correctness)". You have to build from source to get the emulation path, as the plan is to "be able to ship FSR4 in a more proper way in Proton".</p>
<p>Various additions to D3D12 feature support, a whole bunch of performance improvements, along with lots and lots of game fixes too.</p>
<details class="spoiler_container"><summary class="spoiler_header">Full changelog, click me</summary>
<div class="spoiler-content">
<div class="markdown-body my-3" data-pjax="true" data-test-selector="body-content" data-view-component="true">
<p>A new major release, yay!<br/>
A few milestones have been reached over the last year, warranting a new major bump.<br/>
It's been quite a while since the last release due to new things coming up constantly.<br/>
These tags are mostly arbitrary anyway, and tend to be done when islands of calm and stability emerge.</p>
<h3>Major items</h3>
<h4>DXBC shader backend rewrite</h4>
<p><a class="notranslate user-mention" href="https://github.com/doitsujin" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">@doitsujin</a> rewrote the entire DXBC backend, replacing our legacy vkd3d-shader path.<br/>
DXVK and vkd3d-proton now share the same DXBC frontend which gives us clean,<br/>
"readable" (as readable as DXBC can be) and lean IR to work with.<br/>
dxil-spirv standalone project now supports DXBC as well as a result.</p>
<p>Lots of games which used to be completely broken before due to bugs and missing features<br/>
in the legacy vkd3d-shader backend are now fixed. E.g. Red Dead Redemption 2 runs just fine now in D3D12 mode.<br/>
Some recently released DXBC based games also only work on the new path.<br/>
The amount of regressions found the last months in DXBC games has been very minor,<br/>
but it's possible there are still bugs in this area.<br/>
However, given that DXVK uses it now as well, it's been battle tested quite extensively already.</p>
<h4>FSR4 support</h4>
<p>We added support for AGS WMMA intrinsics through <code class="inline-code">VK_KHR_cooperative_matrix</code> and <code class="inline-code">VK_KHR_shader_float8</code>,<br/>
which is enough to support FSR4.<br/>
Note that these shaders are tightly coded for AMD GPUs with some implementation defined behavior<br/>
(particularly around matrix layouts), and they will not necessarily work on other GPU vendors.</p>
<p>There is also a quite hacky emulation path of this which relies on int8 and float16 cooperative matrix support,<br/>
which can run on older GPUs at significant performance cost (and some cost to theoretical correctness).</p>
<p>Note that the default "official" build of vkd3d-proton only exposes this feature when the native<br/>
<code class="inline-code">VK_KHR_shader_float8</code> is properly supported, i.e. RDNA4+ only.<br/>
The emulation path is available when building from source with the appropriate build flags.<br/>
The decision to not include this emulation path by default is over my pay grade.<br/>
The aim is to be able to ship FSR4 in a more proper way in Proton.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>We've more or less caught up on the things we can feasibly implement,<br/>
so there isn't much exciting stuff happening on the feature front.</p>
<ul>
<li>Implemented experimental support for D3D12 work graphs. No real-world content ships this yet.<br/>
	This implementation is far from complete,<br/>
	but it works on "any" GPU since we emulate the feature with normal compute shaders.<br/>
	Funnily enough, the performance of this emulation can massively outperform native driver implementations of the feature<br/>
	in many scenarios we've tested (at the cost of some extra VRAM usage).<br/>
	See <code class="inline-code">docs/</code> for more details on implementation and some performance numbers.</li>
<li>Expose <code class="inline-code">AdvancedTextureOpsSupported</code> by default from SM 6.7 if <code class="inline-code">VK_KHR_maintenance8</code> is supported.</li>
<li>Expose the recently added sparse TIER_4.</li>
<li>Bump exposed D3D12SDKVersion to latest 618.</li>
<li>Experimentally expose support for opacity micromaps.<br/>
	There are some details which aren't quite compatible with the D3D12 API, but some basic demo content is working fine.</li>
<li>Add support for AMD_anti_lag when exposed. The current implementation does not take frame-gen into account.</li>
<li>Implement support for tight alignment from recent AgilitySDK.</li>
<li>Add support for shared resource path on upstream Wine.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<ul>
<li>Overhaul the texture copy batching situation.<br/>
	The new batching logic should be able to improve performance in many more cases than before.
	<ul>
<li>Implemented support for <code class="inline-code">VK_KHR_unified_image_layouts</code>.<br/>
		Image copy batching in particular can take advantage of this to avoid a lot of unnecessary barriers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Removed manual clear workaround on newer (6.15.9+) kernels on AMD, where an old kernel regression was finally fixed.<br/>
	Kernels older than 6.10 are also not affected by this workaround.</li>
<li>Use push descriptor path on Qualcomm GPUs over BDA for speed.</li>
<li>Improve handling of GDeflate when decompression extension is not available.<br/>
	We now ship our own fallback shader in GLSL instead of the more awkward HLSL shader that dstorage ships.</li>
<li>Bump DGC scratch size on NVIDIA. Should avoid some massive perf drops in Halo Infinite on NVIDIA.</li>
<li>Add performance optimization for The Last of Us Part 1 to prefer 2D tiling on 3D images.<br/>
	Requires <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/38084" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">an update to Mesa</a> as well to get the proper effect.</li>
<li>Handle depth/stencil &lt;-&gt; color image copies better when <code class="inline-code">VK_KHR_maintenance8</code> is supported.</li>
<li>Make use of <code class="inline-code">VK_EXT_zero_initialize_device_memory</code> to avoid manual clears on allocation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Emit render pass barriers as expected on tiled GPUs. Fixes misc rendering bugs reported on e.g. Turnip.
	<ul>
<li>For performance reasons, we deliberately skirt the spec a bit on desktop GPUs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed a bunch of minor correctness problems exposed by new Vulkan-ValidationLayers.</li>
<li>Adjust how <code class="inline-code">PointSamplingAddressesNeverRoundUp</code> is reported to match recent driver behaviors.</li>
<li>Fix overflow bugs in massive (&gt; 4GiB) sparse resource handling.</li>
<li>Fix reporting of some esoteric format properties to better match native drivers.</li>
<li>Fix handling of NULL acceleration structure descriptors.</li>
<li>Fix some texturing bugs in Helldivers II on NVIDIA.</li>
<li>Fix some bugs with memory type handling on very old NVIDIA GPUs.</li>
<li>Fix bug when pixel shader includes root signature.</li>
<li>Make ClearUAV barrier insertion the default now.<br/>
	Too many games screw this up, and D3D12 drivers seem to do it by default.</li>
<li>Fix shared fences when initial value is not 0. Fixes some Star Citizen issues.</li>
<li>Fix rare deadlock scenario in Ninja Gaiden 4.<br/>
	Fixes some long-standing issues with how we deal with fence rewinds.</li>
<li>Fix some long-standing issues with how we deal with placed MSAA resources and alignment.</li>
<li>Make sure we don't clear memory of imported resources.<br/>
	This doesn't fix any known games, but you never know :V</li>
<li>Improve correctness for many odd GS/HS/DS corner cases with primitive types and API validation.</li>
<li>Fixes crashes when index buffer SizeInBytes = 0, but VA was invalid.<br/>
	Seen in some Saber Interactive games.</li>
<li>Fixes some potential deadlocks in VR interop APIs when multiple threads attempt to acquire Vulkan queue.</li>
<li>Fixes 16-bit aligned structured buffer strides. Not observed in any real content, but you never know!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Workarounds</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add FF VII rebirth sync bugs workarounds. Fixes some rare GPU hangs.</li>
<li>Add misc AMD workarounds for Monster Hunter Wilds caused by bugged hardware around sparse SMEM.
	<ul>
<li>A proper hardware workaround in RADV is still pending.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Workaround some Starfield bugs around <code class="inline-code">NonUniformResourceIndex</code> use.</li>
<li>Add performance workarounds for extremely large tessellation factors used in misc new Koei Tecmo games.</li>
<li>Add Wreckfest 2 workarounds for illegal texture placement aliasing. Fixes some broken textures.</li>
<li>Add barrier in Satisfactory that game missed. Fixes some corrupt rendering especially on AMD.</li>
<li>Ignore NOT_CLEARED flags on allocation in all games now. Native drivers seem to always clear regardless of the flag,<br/>
	and e.g. Street Fighter 6 relies on NOT_CLEARED memory to actually be cleared :(</li>
<li>Workaround some issues with RGB9E5 and alpha write masks observed in Ninja Gaiden 4.</li>
<li>Add missing barrier in Death Stranding (the older build, not Director's Cut).</li>
<li>Add missing barrier in Wuthering Waves.</li>
<li>Workaround bugged uninitialized loop variable in Dune MMO.</li>
<li>Disable UAV compression in Spider-Man Remastered. Fixes some weird RT issues on RDNA2.</li>
<li>Add Root CBV robustness workaround for Gray Zone Warfare.</li>
<li>Disables color compression in Rise of the Tomb Raider. Fixes some glitches due to game bug on AMD.</li>
<li>Workaround some bugs in Port Royal benchmark.</li>
<li>Workaround Mafia: Definitive Edition hanging GPU when using FSR on startup due to use-after-free.
	<ul>
<li>The workaround applies to all uses of FSR. Plausibly workaround a hang in MGS: Delta as well, but not confirmed it was this bug.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Workaround Control RT path occasionally observing NaNs due to bad normalize() patterns.</li>
<li>Workaround Final Fantasy Tactics Ivalice Chronicles illegally using dynamically indexed root constants.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Misc</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added a lot more debug instrumentation as usual.
	<ul>
<li>Not user facing, so omitting details.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make it a bit easier to use vkd3d-proton in Linux-native projects.</li>
<li>Remove <code class="inline-code">DXVK_FRAME_RATE</code> to align with DXVK's removal. Only <code class="inline-code">VKD3D_FRAME_RATE</code> remains (at least for now).</li>
</ul>

      <title>Forestrike is a martial arts roguelite like no other where you see the future</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Using the power of Foresight, in the 2D martial arts roguelite Forestrike you can see how each fight will go down, and it's really damn good. <em>Note: a key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>A beat 'em up fighting game like no other that's for sure, and one of this year's absolute gems. There's no sense in button-bashing here, and that's firmly not the point of it. While you can just jump directly into every single battle, the game is built around your Foresight technique. This is where you enter a special state, where you can test out all your moves, and see what each enemy is going to do. You can do this as many times as you like in each fight. You're supposed to use the ability to explore every possible way to defeat the enemies, and find the perfect solution to each battle.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12849105041763396459gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Nice narrative to go along with it too. Set in a country that was once firmly ruled by a great Emperor, but now an evil Admiral has spread their influence far and wide to pretty much take over. Reaching even as far as your one of your old masters that betrays you. It's up to you, Yu, to try and rescue the Emperor from the Admiral's influence — one fight at a time.</p>
<p>The fighting system is the clear star of the show here, but the narrative elements do wonderfully break things up so that everything doesn't feel so samey which I find a lot of beat 'em ups end up like. Good to have a bit of a break to let your mind rest between a lot of crazy fights.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that just because you <em>know</em> what's going to happen with Foresight, it <em>doesn't</em> make the game easy though. It's still a thorough challenge to not only pick the right moves to deal with each individual enemy with their different behaviours coming at you, but getting all your own timings right can still lead to a few bloody noses on your end.</p>
<p>I've played tons of fighting games, beat 'em ups and all sorts in between and can't remember a time where they've truly tried to punch through the genre to make something as different as this is. Forestrike is just so incredibly inventive. Fighting games rely on you having a specific amount of health, giving you a limited amount of attempts - but here it just feels so <em>different</em>. You <em>still</em> have your health limit and you <em>need</em> to watch it closely, but the experimentation you can do endlessly on every single fight is quite amazing.</p>
<p><em>That said, I suppose Shogun Showdown is probably one of the closest to it in terms of some of the ideas. However, that's turn-based, this is real-time and they're still very different overall.</em></p>
<p>You could do 10 different attempts in Foresight, and still manage to screw it up when you decide it's time for the real thing. Some of the fights even early on can be pretty brutal, and that challenge might actually put a few players off. It's definitely one for people who appreciate the technical side of the challenge. That experimentation is key though, I've seen so many fights in it go completely differently by changing up one specific thing with either what ability I use, or timing something differently and the results can be hilariously unexpected sometimes.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZCbJLFTjgbo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cf49edfe6292afc4b95157c2ec949f58.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZCbJLFTjgbo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Another fun addition is the fight re-cap you get, so you can study how the fight went down after beating it. And here, you can grab a special code to share with others, so they can then try the exact same fight you had. Very cool! Absolutely love features like that.</p>
<p>Add to that the rogue-lite side of it, with you picking from random upgrades for your fighter as you go through - each run can be quite different. There's some interesting abilities there like healing up if you manage to get an enemy to hit another enemy that defeats them, poking them in the eyes to stun them and turn them around once per fight and more. You also pick what fights you engage in using a node-based map system of progressing through the game, with each fight having their own different set of enemies and rewards for you.</p>
<p>It did bug me that some of the nodes on the map had you fight <em>without</em> the Foresight ability, which really is the key highlight of the entire game. While yes, it can give you a nice reward, the map is not exactly big and you don't get many movement choices. If they added just one more lane to the node map, this probably would have been a lot better. Just, a few more options for the progression and it would have been perfection there.</p>
<p>The map you progress through also has shops to visit where you can give up certain techniques you've picked, to form a better one. And you can also buy health along with various trinkets to help your run. So there's additional ways here that your run can be different each time too.</p>
<p>The way you build up your fighter through it feels like it leans a little more into deck-builders, or day I say it, survivor-likes. Eventually once you progress through it, you also get to do a run with a few different masters backing you. Each of them come with their own special moves for you.</p>
<p>With all parts together, it's quite brilliant. Loved it. A really fresh feeling spin on beat 'em styled fighting games, with great presentation and it really will give your brain a right-hook to the pleasure centre. Probably one of my favourite releases of 2025.</p>
<p>Worked without issues on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 25.04) with Proton 10. Valve also rated it Steam Deck Playable, as it may have some small text.</p>

      <title>Below the Crown is an curious brew of chess and dungeon crawling out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Out now in Early Access, from the minds that gave us the excellent Duskers, Below the Crown is a mixture of chess-like pieces and moves in a dungeon crawler. <em>Note: a key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>It's a "dungeon crawler for everyone" they say, that is only somewhat <em>loosely</em> related to chess and you don't need to be some sort of grand master to play through this one. You start off by picking a deck that gives you a few chess-like pieces in the form of cards, and move through different randomly generated dungeons using your wizard who can summon your pieces. Your wizard can be a king, bishop, knight and others - with each giving you a different set of cards to summon and some have special abilities.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/664598831763389957gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Starting off in each room with only your main piece, the rooms are all small self-contained puzzles to smash through. Make a move, summon a piece if you have any left to bring into play and keep moving around the board. The idea is to beat each room by either: getting a checkmate, getting the AI enemy king to withdraw by being the last piece left, or getting your king to a door. It's not just standard chess pieces though, as they've introduced some new pieces to keep things fresh and you get an assortment of spells to throw the game in your favour too. It's not just plain square board layouts either, there's a few different shapes that present their own unique challenges to think on as well.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it is true that you don't need to really understand chess to play this at all. Everything is <em>very</em> clearly presented. And with the amount of pieces each side controls, there's no information overload here. Just a few pieces at a time, with each having a clear set movement pattern you can see by hovering your mouse over them anytime. There's even a turn assist feature, for the game to suggest moves if there's something good for you to do, so it's quite accessible too.</p>
<p>It's all a bit <em>strange</em>. From the retro visuals to the strange psychological questions you have to answer that "may or may not impact runs". Just what exactly is going on here? They've somehow given a chess-like a bit of an unnerving atmosphere.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="acKftQNAsfI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1bee3c2d4c3321bdf66589b171ff1db5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/acKftQNAsfI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While it's turn-based, it's certainly <em>not</em> chilled. Part of the difficulty here is that if you take too too many turns, the board will start self-destructing with tiles getting a turn timer so you need to ensure your pieces aren't there. Reducing the size of the board forces both sides closer together, and really does make your brain sweat a bit.</p>
<p>The presentation is supremely slick too. I <em>love</em> the way the game moves between boards, and the overall feel of it is perfect for the type of game it is.</p>
<p>“Below the Crown wouldn’t be what it is today without the incredible minds on the Misfits Attic team," said Tim Keenan, Founder, Misfits Attic. “Our diverse experiences on films and games have enabled us to give Below the Crown its own distinct, mysterious identity. We hope chess enthusiasts and beginners alike enjoy digging into this dynamic world of strategy, magic, and retro vibes in Early Access!"</p>
<p>A full formal opinion will be saved for when it's released properly, which the developer estimates will be in about 5 months while they add a bit more of everything into the game. So far though, it is a <em>lot</em> of fun to play through as a weird blend of game genres and mechanics that ends up as a bit of a brain-tickling puzzle to get through.</p>
<p>There are a couple of resolution related bugs I've encountered. If the game resolution does not match your desktop, some UI will go off the screen, and if you alt+tab the mouse position is messed up making it basically unplayable. It was supposed to have been solved before, but it's still a problem. You'll need to ensure you match the game resolution up to your desktop for now. This is likely a problem with it specifically with Proton and they <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/below-the-crown-from-the-developer-of-duskers-arrives-november-with-a-demo-live-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">did say previously</a> a Native Linux version is planned.</p>
<p>Misfits Attic have once again crafted something unique, that I really need more hours in the day to play. Deliciously engrossing to try and beat everything in it. It's proven once again that I'm terrible at anything resembling chess, but the challenge of it is so clever it makes me want to dive in again and again. This definitely deserves a whole lot more players.</p>

      <title>Colossal Order and Paradox Interactive split with Cities: Skylines going to a new developer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Colossal Order and Paradox Interactive have ended their partnership on Cities: Skylines, with it moving onto a new developer.</p>
<p>The announcement posted on the <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/an-update-on-cities-skylines-ii.1873154/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Paradox forum</a> notes they've "mutually decided to pursue independent paths "with the decision being made "thoughtfully and in the interest of both teams - ensuring the strongest possible future for the Cities: Skylines franchise". So now further development of the Cities franchise will move to Iceflake Studios, who Paradox acquired back in 2020. Iceflake will be taking over all existing and future development of Cities: Skylines II so that players "will be able to look forward to new updates and content drops for many years".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7836167891763385039gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Iceflake Studios will take the helm from the start of 2026, with a couple bits left to add in from Colossal Order.</p>
<p>Statements from the post:</p>
<p>“For over fifteen years, the Cities Series and our partnership with Paradox have been a defining part of our journey at Colossal Order. When we set out to create Cities in Motion, we never imagined it would grow to become a cherished franchise with a passionate, loyal community of millions of players around the world. We want to thank everyone at Paradox for their trust and collaboration, and of course the community for the incredible support that has made Cities what it is today. We’re confident that the franchise will continue to thrive under Paradox's leadership. As we move forward, we’re excited to channel our experience, creativity, and passion into new projects that align with our long-term vision.” Mariina Hallikainen, CEO of Colossal Order</p>
<p>“Our partnership with Colossal Order is one of the longest-running relationships we've enjoyed here at Paradox. Four games, dozens of expansions, and a community of millions of Cities players; it's remarkable how much we've achieved together. We have deep respect for the Colossal Order team and we look forward to seeing where they go from here. On our end, we’re eager to continue working for the passionate Cities: Skylines community and make sure to provide them with more content and new experiences.” Mattias Lilja, Deputy CEO of Paradox Interactive</p>
<p>“Taking the reins on a genre-leading franchise like Cities is an immense honor and a great responsibility. There's a huge, loyal community out there and I want to say to every member of that community that we will humbly carry this legacy with respect, together with all of you. Iceflake has the capacity and capability to get started. We have a decade worth of experience from making city building and management games. We see a strong foundation and so much potential waiting to be unleashed and I can't wait to show you what we have planned for the next chapter of this incredible game.” Lasse Liljedahl, Studio Manager of Iceflake Studios</p>

      <title>The Many Sins of House Ocampo is one to watch for point and click mystery adventure fans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Many Sins of House Ocampo is a new announcement from the developers of If On A Winter's Night Four Travelers and it looks great. Could be a really good one for fans of point and click mystery adventure games.</p>
<p>In The Many Sins of House Ocampo you play as Lucía, a young woman in 1977 Buenos Aires who discovers she's the last living descendant of the Ocampos, an Argentinian settler family rumoured to be beset by a terrible curse. Reliving the last moments of her ancestors via letters, tapes, documents and diaries, and using an interactive clue board to trace the fate of each family member, Lucía will not stop until figuring out the truth of the Ocampo curse, as well as her own origins.</p>
<p>Very much like Dead Idle's previous game If On A Winter's Night Four Travelers, The Many Sins of House Ocampo features stunning pixel art and animations, dark and mature themes, and an exquisite soundtrack that oscillates between Argentinian folk, dark ambient, and classical piano. What's not to love about all of that? Sounds and looks wild.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

      <title>Timing is everything in the fast-paced arcade racer Wild Horse Racing - try the demo now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you love arcade-styled retro racing games, Wild Horse Racing looks like it could be good fun and there's a demo available with Linux support.</p>
<p>Don't let the name put you off at all, this is not some cutesy horse game. Here it's quite a challenge where timing is everything. You have to master control patterns from easy to godlike difficulty, leap over big jumps, and race through vibrant tracks while managing your horse. Some fun game mechanics included with each track having its own control pattern, and nailing the timing gives you a speed boost. </p>
<p>The horse hoof upgrade system sounds interesting to spice things up a little too, like picking and upgrading your tyres in a car racing game. As here mud and gravel build up during races to slow you to, so you have to manage that. </p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>

      <title>If you love Portal and first-person puzzlers - ChromaGun 2: Dye Hard launches February 12, 2026</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ChromaGun 2: Dye Hard is a very interesting looking first-person puzzler that's now set to arrive February 12, 2026 that's all about mixing colours. It's a pretty clever system, and I did enjoy the first game but it had a number of rough edges.</p>
<p>More about it: you have to navigate various puzzle rooms and corridors using your ChromaGun, allowing you to shoot and mix primary colours together. When doing so you manipulate the environment around you, activate doors, take down drones and much more. They said with this sequel you'll see smarter puzzles, advanced colour physics, new hazardous environmental elements, and a "gripping new narrative".</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<p>From the press release: </p>
<p>“We’ve taken everything the fans loved about the original - the witty dialogue, the fiendishly clever puzzles, and the saturated aesthetic - and dialed it up to 11,” said Benjamin Lochmann, Founder and CEO of Pixel Maniacs. “Dye Hard is bigger, bolder, and requires a level of color coordination and spatial reasoning that will test even the most seasoned puzzle enthusiasts. The team is eager to watch the most insane full game speedruns from the community!”</p>
<p>“ChromaGun 2: Dye Hard expands the creative spectrum of our portfolio with a bold, brainy experience that stands apart from anything else we’ve launched.” states Michael Yum, CEO of PM Studios. “We’re proud to offer a retail edition for a game this inventive - it’s something every fan of clever design should want to have as part of their physical collection.”</p>

      <title>Assetto Corsa Rally has arrived in Early Access - should work well on Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We're finally getting another proper modern rally racing sim with Assetto Corsa Rally out now in Early Access. Thankfully, it won't be in Early Access forever, as they think it will only take around 18 months to finish it all up.</p>
<p>And, surprisingly, even though it's using Unreal Engine 5 most of the early reports on it have been quite positive. It even has a Very Positive rating on Steam. Over email the developers noted how "Supernova Games Studios has extensively customized and optimized Unreal Engine 5 to meet the specific performance and visual fidelity needs of racing simulation".</p>
<p>Something that I think is especially interesting though is the LaserScan tech, which they say is a first for the rally sim genre. Allowing "ultra-precise reproduction of real-world terrain, surface irregularities, and surrounding environments". Not only that but each vehicle was also recreated with laser scans and official CAD data too.</p>
<p>For Linux / SteamOS fans, going by <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/3917090?device=any" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> the early reports there are nice and positive too with multiple reports on it working great out of the box with Proton.</p>

      <title>Deep Rock Galactic set for new biomes, missions and enemies in Season 6</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After bringing in another team to help, Deep Rock Galactic is getting Season 6 sometime early next year with a bumper addition of new content. They also recently delayed the spin-off Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core until Q2 2026, as it needs a bit more time in the oven.</p>
<p>Not played it before? Another you <em>need</em> to stick on your list. A 1-4 player online co-op game about space dwarves that go mining. The world is destructible, it's chaotic and a lot of good fun with all the different types of aliens that come crawling.</p>
<p>So far for it they've confirmed we're getting the Ossuary Depths biome that will come with new creatures to face. Down there you will find Ossiran Scrab, which will appear in large clusters. Plus the Ossiran Pit Jaw, which is a more deadlier version of the Scrab that will attempt to ambush you from below.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9203950041763137842gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9203950041763137842gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13025126461763137845gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13025126461763137845gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>A new mission type too with Heavy Excavation that sees you go hunting for amber. Sounds like another multi-stage event mission with you finding them first, then preparing a dig site to wait for a new supply pod fitted with thrusters to send it back up.</p>
<p>There's even going to be a new season event, a new performance pass (like a battle pass full of cosmetics).</p>

      <title>Brill co-op climbing game PEAK gets a major fix for gamepads</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PEAK remains a favourite this year, easily one of the best casual co-op games and the latest bug-fix update is important for gamepad players. Turns out, they've been a bit broken all along on the sensitivity so it's nice to see that solved with the latest update.</p>
<p>In the patch notes they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Okay, so this is pretty embarrassing. Turns out, gamepad sensitivity has been dependent on user framerate since we originally launched the game. (Remember how this was a game jam...?) That's fixed now, but because of that, If you play on gamepad, there's a good chance your look sensitivity will have changed when you next open the game and you'll need to tweak it a bit.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2534379191763135583gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>There's a bunch of other changes as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>BALANCE/GAMEPLAY CHANGES</h3>
<ul>
<li>The death timer now still ticks down even when carried by another scout if you have enough spores to become a zombie. Good luck...</li>
<li>We're buffing the Scout Cannon!
	<ul>
<li>Scout Cannons can launch zombies now.</li>
<li>Scout Cannon weight reduced 6 -&gt; 4</li>
<li>Scout Cannon forced ragdoll time reduced 2-&gt; 1</li>
<li>Made the Scout Cannon slightly easier to jump out of.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You will now be able to walk in the Caldera lava if you are invincible.</li>
<li>Removed the ability to fly if you have the wind walking ability from a Shroomberry and one balloon. You now need at least three balloons.</li>
<li>Lava will no longer cook items that are being held in your hands. (This was getting a little too crazy now that several more items blow up when cooked)</li>
</ul>
<h3>MAJOR FIXES</h3>
<ul>
<li>Okay, so this is pretty embarrassing. Turns out, gamepad sensitivity has been dependent on user framerate since we originally launched the game. (Remember how this was a game jam...?) That's fixed now, but because of that, If you play on gamepad, there's a good chance your look sensitivity will have changed when you next open the game and you'll need to tweak it a bit.</li>
<li>Removed the prompts to swap your spectate target if your character is unconscious but not fully dead.</li>
<li>Fixed visual issues relating to using the Book of Bones with the Third Eye accessory equipped.</li>
<li>Fixed visual issues on the player ghost when the Third Eye accessory is equipped.</li>
<li>The Checkpoint Flag now respawns scouts slightly above the ground to reduce clipping/physics issues upon respawning.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where zombie footsteps would play from the wrong position.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue caused by the cooking update where dynamite would create two explosions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>MINOR FIXES</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where scouts in a ragdoll state would bounce off mushrooms way too high.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the campfires would no longer burn players.</li>
<li>Fixed shroomberries spawning on the wrong side of the vine.</li>
<li>Fixed players not being able to grab a piton while hanging from a vine.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where holding the Ancient Idol while having thorns stuck on you could cause erratic stuff to happen to your status bar.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where a spawn point could spawn a zombie more than once if an old one died, resulting in some comedic infinite spawns if the spawned zombie ragdolled off a cliff.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where a frisbee that landed in the water would still be considered "in flight" for purposes of the Ultimate Badge.</li>
<li>The Emote wheel can no longer be accessed as a ghost.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where you would take increased fall damage if your wind walking from a Shroomberry expired while in midair.</li>
<li>Dynamite explosions slightly more optimized.</li>
<li>Added a failsafe to ropes being destroyed while they were being climbed (in rare situations).</li>
</ul>
<br/>
OTHER THINGS
<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">PlayerHandler.OnCharacterRegistered</code> event re-instated (modders will know what this means)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They've made some nice updates to the game since release, including adding multiple new biomes to fail in. The latest adding a zombie mechanic, which really makes the game feel more challenging in certain situations.</p>
<p>I think the game mechanic of having your health and stamina bar merged into one is quite interesting, seeing all the status effects bring it down - it's a clever system. If you've not played it, you're missing out.</p>

      <title>Heroes of Might and Magic 2 project fheroes2 version 1.1.12 has been released</title>
      <author>fheroes2</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dear fans of the fheroes2 project! Today we are excited to announce a new version of the <strong>fheroes2</strong> game engine - <a href="https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2/releases/tag/1.1.12" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">1.1.12</a>! This release brings a huge number of updates and stands as one of the biggest releases in recent years.</p>
<p>First of all, we have added an initial implementation of the <strong>Random Map Generator</strong> to the Editor. For now, this feature is marked as in development, as many parts are still unfinished and require further work before it becomes a fully realized part of the project. We plan to refine and expand this feature in future releases.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15263400351763130587gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Another major highlight of this release is the introduction of basic iOS support. While this version still requires refinement before reaching a fully stable state, this marks a big step forward. We will continue sharing progress updates as development continues.</p>
<p>The team has also made numerous <strong>UI improvements</strong>. We updated the icons for Mass Dispel spell and Resolution option, added new buttons in the File Options dialog, moved the Turn Order bar above the battlefield on high resolutions, and enabled playback for multiple videos - restoring missing campaign animations. You can now switch between towns in the Mage Guild using arrows, delete maps from lists, and have a much larger text limit for all resurrection maps, many-many more changes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11034115371763130695gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11034115371763130695gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19629090031763130695gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19629090031763130695gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14325058951763130694gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14325058951763130694gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>This update also includes major improvements to the <strong>AI</strong>. AI heroes can now predict the start of a new week for weekly objects such as Monster Dwellings, Windmills, and Magic Gardens, allowing for smarter task management on the Adventure Map. They also make better pre-battle unit arrangements, improving their chances of success. Additionally, we have introduced new conditions for hero hiring to make the late game more engaging.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy the latest version of the engine, and once again, thank you so much for your continued support of the project!</p>
<p>Don't forget, that you also need to grab the data from <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_2_gold_edition" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG.com</a> which it requires to run. You can find the <a href="https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">fheroes2</a> project on the GitHub page.</p>

Otherwise, it will automatically download if you go to play a game that Valve has set for Proton 10 by default.

      <title>Anti-cheat will still be one of the biggest problems for the new Steam Machine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kernel-level anti-cheat feels like it's everywhere now, and will remain a thorn in Valve's side for the new Steam Machine powered by SteamOS Linux.</p>
<p>On Linux, there's no kernel-level mode available for anti-cheats like they would use on Windows. I know plenty of readers, and gamers across the net probably see it as a benefit due to privacy concerns, and that's fine - but it doesn't change what a lot of people want to play that can't.</p>
<p>This is something many bigger games simply don't want to pull away from including the likes of Call of Duty, Vanguard from Riot, EA Javelin for Battlefield and so on. While we do have some anti-cheat vendors that support Linux like Easy Anti-Cheat and BattlEye (and a few others), it's user-mode with no kernel-level and many developers really don't like that.</p>
<p>Valve's Steam Deck helped a fair bit, with a number of titles that do have something enabled for Linux systems at least, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/arc-raiders-has-seriously-exciting-gameplay-that-has-firmly-hooked-me-in/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">like with the popular ARC Raiders</a>. What about the Steam Machine though? And even the Steam Frame since it also uses SteamOS, and can play standalone games?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-battlefield-6-work-on-steam-machine-valve-hopes-its-new-hardware-will-prompt-a-fresh-discussion-with-developers-over-kernel-level-anti-cheat" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a> spoke to Valve on this, with Valve believing it will help things:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"While [the] Steam Machine also requires Dev participation to enable anti-cheat, we think the incentives for enabling Anti- cheat on Machine to be higher than on Deck as we expect more people to play multiplayer games on it. So ultimately we hope that the launch of Machine will change the equation around anti-cheat support and increase its support."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem is, the Steam Machine needs to actually sell, and probably a <em>lot</em> more than the Steam Deck has managed so far to actually put a dent in things for the bigger publishers to even begin to take notice and certainly above <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/linux-gamers-on-steam-finally-cross-over-the-3-mark/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the 3% Linux overall is at currently on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Not just the AAA lot, but games like Rust too. Alistair McFarlane from Facepunch Studios recently replied on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playrust/comments/1ouvpv1/comment/nojbzts/?context=3" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Reddit</a> to a request to have it enabled, and replied to note:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="py-0 xs:mx-xs mx-2xs max-w-full scalable-text" id="t1_nofbyxo-post-rtjson-content" style="--emote-size: 20px">
<p>"There are no plans to support Proton or Linux. It’s a vector for cheat developers, and one that would be poorly maintained by both us and EAC due to the low user base. When we stopped support for Linux, we saw more cheat users exploiting Linux, than actual legitimate users.</p>
<p>When monitoring cheats for Rust, we keep a close eye on wider cheat communities across several major games. We look at what cheat developers are doing, and how other studios are responding.</p>
<p>From that experience, I’m very comfortable saying that if a game supports Proton or Linux, they’re not serious about anti-cheat. The only exception would be if they have a fully mature, dedicated in-house anti-cheat team, even then, I'm not seeing anyone handle Proton and Linux well.</p>
<p>Apex Legends also dropped Proton support in October 2024 for the same reasons as we did several years ago.</p>
<p>Could we limit Proton to Premium servers? yes, but I think it's total bullshit asking Proton users to buy the game and then $15 worth of DLC. I'd be pissed if I were forced to do that.</p>
<p>When we stopped supporting Linux, users made up less than .01% of the total player base, even if that number has doubled, or tripled, it's not worth it.</p>
<p>I know that every time I post something like this, some Proton and Linux users call us lazy or dismissive. The reality is that fighting cheaters on one front (Windows), is already a never-ending battle. Adding more fronts multiplies that challenge without adding meaningful benefit to the wider player base."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/blocking-linux-steam-deck-in-apex-legends-led-to-a-meaningful-reduction-in-cheaters/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">A similar story for Apex Legends</a> where their team noted they saw a "meaningful reduction in the amount of cheating recently" once they blocked Linux. In that article we also referenced the same McFarlane from Facepunch, who made a similar comment years ago. Nothing there has changed it seems.</p>
<p>So even if the Steam Machine sells a bunch, this is a technical problem that needs solving. Who will be the ones to do it? Valve or game publishers / developers? It's going to be complicated.</p>
<p>We're currently tracking it on our own curated <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated anti-cheat compatibility page</a>.

      <title>Hot on the heels of the Steam Frame announcement, SteamVR Beta 2.14.1 brings more fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve only just released the latest <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/steamvr-2-13-brings-a-whole-lot-of-bug-fixes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">stable SteamVR update in version 2.13</a>, but SteamVR 2.14.1 Beta is now here as well with more tweaks and fixes.</p>
<p>I expect with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-reveal-the-new-steam-frame-steam-controller-and-steam-machine-with-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement of the new Steam Frame</a> (and Steam Machine / Steam Controller), we're going to see a bunch more rapid updates to get SteamVR truly ready for it. Although, the Steam Deck did come in pretty hot, so it will be interesting to see if the Steam Frame launches with many issues. <em>We have till early 2026 to find out…</em></p>
<p>Anyway, here's what's new in SteamVR 2.14.1 Beta:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>SteamVR:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improve startup speed when no HMD is present.</li>
<li>Fix an issue that could cause "Port 27062 in use" (can also manifest as error 309) when no HMD is present.</li>
<li>Fix an issue that could result in error 302 or error 101, especially in unusual startup configurations.</li>
<li>Changed Binding UI to allow saving bindings that don't bind all required actions (with confirmation).</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where HMD simulation would persist after an app using controller simulation ended.</li>
<li>Fixed some scenarios where the wrong render model would be displayed when multiple devices were simulating.</li>
<li>Fix a crash that could occur if the roomview processing was delayed.</li>
<li>Updated dashboard binding for HP Motion Controller to fix screenshots, smooth scrolling, and take advantage of Quick Recenter.</li>
<li>The prompt to setup SteamVR for app containers and web applications now covers cases where SteamVR is installed outside of its normal location.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Steam Link:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fix Steam Link freeze for users with AMD video cards ("Error 250").</li>
<li>Minor judder improvements.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Linux:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fix a shared memory leak that happened each time an app disconnected from SteamVR.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since the Steam Frame will use Linux (SteamOS), I'm really hoping we see Valve eventually get SteamVR into good shape for Linux as a whole. Would be a bit weird if it wasn't improved, considering the Steam Machine runs Linux (SteamOS) too. However, since the Steam Frame is either standalone or you stream to it, this will work in a very different way to say the Valve Index which according to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/817967/valve-index-vr-headset-stopped-manufacturing-frame" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The Verge</a> is no longer in production.</p>

      <title>ARC Raiders is expanding with a new map but first a multi-phase event to unlock it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the first major update for ARC Raiders now available, we have an in-game event for players to work towards unlocking the next map.</p>
<p>Eventually, we'll be able to travel around the new Stella Montis map. First though, we all have to donate a bunch of goodies into the work including Metal Parts, Fabric, Chemicals, Rubber Parts and Plastic Parts. You know, all the junk we keep building up! When you donate, you build up a new Merits credit to eventually spend on rewards on the next stage of the event.</p>
<p>It initially started off pretty darn fast, with developers Embark having to raise the requirements quite a lot otherwise it would have been over far too soon. As they posted in Discord:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have been progressing the unlock event much faster than we anticipated. We had no idea all of you would be so altruistic for the Stella Montis cause, and you are donating so much more than we could imagine. We want this event to be experienced by Raiders all over the world and therefore we are raising the bar to unlock Stella Montis expecting you to surprise us again.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="O9JeiBAAey4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bad9edbee8ce67435392d8e8327df9d8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/O9JeiBAAey4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This new map sounds quite different too, potentially more cramped than all of the current rather open maps as you explore a big facility. Can't wait to see what it really is when it's finally open.</p>
<p>Patch highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Reduced character movement latency on server to improve the "desync" problem where it looks like you get damaged even after behind cover.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that prevented players from completing quests involving multiple objectives or item collections within a single round.</li>
<li>Fixed various achievements not working correctly. Players will need to redo some achievements with only one objective item (e.g. “Destroy the Queen”) while achievements with multiple objectives will only need parts of them completed again.</li>
<li>Reduced delay between shooting at ARC and seeing impact effects on the target.</li>
<li>Fixed various locations where players could fall through the terrain.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>See much more in the <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/north-line-patch-notes/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>
<p>One issue that has come up is their nerf of the Security Locker drop rate. Considering it's a skill you have to unlock, some are not happy about it. In Discord they confirmed they're looking into the "possibility of adding a skill reset mechanic".</p>
<p>Thankfully, even with the major 1.2 update out, there's no problems with it running on Linux still. Perhaps we won't see what we do with THE FINALS, where it ends up breaking for a few days on every update.

      <title>Ready for the Steam Frame, Khronos Group announced a new OpenXR &#34;Best Practices Validation Layer&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Khronos Group, the stewards of various open protocols like OpenGL, Vulkan, OpenXR and more just revealed a new tool for XR (VR / AR) developers.</p>
<p>What is OpenXR exactly? As The Khronos Group explain: "OpenXR is a royalty-free, open standard that provides a common set of APIs for developing XR applications that run across a wide range of AR and VR devices. This reduces the time and cost required for developers to adapt solutions to individual XR platforms while also creating a larger market of easily supported applications for device manufacturers that adopt OpenXR".</p>
<p>So it's the open standard for VR games to be built with, to sum it up easily for you. It's what Valve actually focus on nowadays for SteamVR.</p>
<p>What's been announced? Today, The Khronos Group released the "Best Practices Validation Layer", a tool in their SDK for OpenXR developers to ensure their apps and games will actually work as expected. As they said it "addresses a critical need in XR development: catching suboptimal API usage patterns that can lead to inconsistent behavior across different OpenXR runtimes".</p>
<p>Just because there's an open API, it doesn't mean developers will know exactly how to use it properly or to ensure compatibility across devices, and this should help solve that. As they went onto explain: "While the OpenXR specification defines the features that implementations must support, it doesn't always prescribe the optimal way to utilize these features. Certain usage patterns, though technically valid, can cause applications to behave differently across various XR runtimes or lead to performance issues that are difficult to diagnose.</p>
<p>The Best Practices Validation Layer bridges this gap by providing real-time warnings when developers use API patterns that may cause problems, even if those patterns don't violate the OpenXR specification."</p>
<p>Should be good news for any developers planning to support the likes of the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-reveal-the-new-steam-frame-steam-controller-and-steam-machine-with-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">newly announced Steam Frame from Valve</a> for example.</p>
<p>You can read more in <a href="https://www.khronos.org/blog/new-openxr-validation-layer-helps-developers-build-robustly-portable-xr-applications" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">their blog post</a>.</p>

      <title>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is getting mid-run saves and an endless mode</title>

<p>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is set for some major improvements, although we don't know exactly when but it will make surviving in it a whole lot nicer.</p>
<p>Eventually, they've confirmed recently, they will be adding in mid-run saves. So whenever you visit a shop, you'll be able to save and quit. Having to go through an entire run is a bit of a nuisance, so it's great to see that being solved. Still, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-is-an-excellent-horde-survival-game-1-0-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I very much loved the game</a> from the 1.0 release. On top of that, an endless mode is also in the works too. Posted in an official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2321470/view/590661866525556839" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> here's what they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve got something exciting in the works for you! In this Development Log, we want to tell you about a much-requested feature the team is working on: Mid-run saving.</p>
<p>So how does it work? When you quit the game, your progress will now start at the last shop you visited. That means no more losing a great run because your pet lootbug tripped over the power cable.</p>
<p>This feature is also related to the much-anticipated Endless Mode (yes, still coming). Runs in this mode can take a lot longer, and your decisions will carry even more weight, so being able to safely pause or recover after a crash on a late stage will make the experience smoother and far less frustrating.</p>
<p>It’s a feature that’s pretty seamless but has a big impact, and we can’t wait for you to try it out and tell us what you think. We’ll make sure to keep you posted on when you can expect this feature to drop in the future.</p>

      <title>The excellent CloverPit has sold over 1 million and gets a Hard Mode update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>CloverPit is a rather excellent game that's hit the jackpot for the developer, as they're cashing in on over 1 million sales and celebrating with a big update. No need to stick more coins in the slot, take your hand off that slot machine arm as it's a free update. I really <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/pull-the-lever-to-gamble-and-break-the-machine-in-cloverpit-a-slot-machine-with-horror-vibes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">quite enjoyed my time</a> with this one.</p>
<p>With the hard mode update v1.2 out now it adds a new way to play, where the deadline amount is doubled, which could actually make some of it truly a lot more challenging. There's also lots of tweaks to charms and other assorted improvements throughout the game.</p>
<p>There's a mini-trailer for the update below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vel6NCHRrFU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/159ada30b778f67751384d2b0a5bb575.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vel6NCHRrFU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>And the launch trailer if you missed it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6f_6xETRrOI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cb4332f73ec857571b74fa54c2c37de1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6f_6xETRrOI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The update version 1.2 adds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added Hard mode to memory cards: if you win with a memory card once you will now unlock the possibility to play it with double the deadline ammount.</li>
<li>Winning during hard mode will now make the memory card rainbow, instead of having to win with that memory card 3 times.</li>
<li>Calendar buffed: now it increases the symbols multiplier instead of increasing the symbols themselves.</li>
<li>Calendar is now Rare instead of Uncommon</li>
<li>Ring bell now increases the symbols multiplier instead of the symbols themselves.</li>
<li>Ring bell now costs 2 tickets instead of 3</li>
<li>Hourglass’effect has been changed as it was the most useless thing ever seen in the entire universe. Now it alternates between growing the symbols and pattern multipliers at the end of each deadline, but it takes 1 extra space. It’s really strong and do not argue against me, OK??!?!?! You will need to use ur big brain between using this or the megaphone or the nuke button. They keep me prisoner in a cell under the Pacific Ocean! Please call for help!</li>
<li>Hourglass now costs a bit more and it’s rare. Nothing special to read here. Please continue reading :)</li>
<li>Cigarettes now have an 80% chance of restocking the store with them in it. Sorry guys, it was necessary to prevent endless runs</li>
<li>CloverPot has been nerfed. Sorry guys, it was necessary to prevent endless runs</li>
<li>Nerfed Naughty Dealer</li>
<li>Nerfed Bricks, Wood, Sheep, Wheat, Stone, Harbor &amp; Thief</li>
<li>Charm trait about symbols multiplier now grants +2 instead of 1</li>
<li>Tickets charm trait now grants +3 tickets instead of 2</li>
<li>Buffed fruit basket to 10 rounds duration instead of 7</li>
<li>Deadlines will grow more exponentially after 15 deadlines</li>
</ul>
<strong>VARIOUS</strong>
<ul>
<li>Added game completition % near the toilet</li>
<li>Added counter of how many memory cards the player has fully foiled into rainbow holographic</li>
<li>Added counter of how many memory cards the player has cleared</li>
<li>Made dialogue red after the bad ending, so people will pay attention to it and assume they are not done yet with the game.</li>
<li>Added check for mods. If a game is modded, a gear will show up in the bottom left!</li>
<li>When you click on the door key in the box, once the skeleton is completed, if it’s not the deadline time a dialogue will show up prompting you to keep playing</li>
</ul>
<strong>FIXES</strong>
<ul>
<li>Disabled Twitch integration on Linux platforms for those who experienced crashes when there was no internet connection</li>
<li>Added manual garbage collection in some situations trying to mitigate memory leaks when using linux with proton</li>
<li>Weird Clock now resets its deadline limit even if it’s inside a drawer.</li>
<li>Weird Clock now doesn’t reset the deadline limit when discarded. Only the end of deadline can reset the limit</li>
<li>Weird Clock won’t show up in the store as long as it has reached the usage limit</li>
<li>Fixed bug where some 3d models in drawers would overlap with charms (like the vynil player)</li>
<li>Paredolia effect is now permanent as per description</li>
<li>Added a safeguard to prevent infinity value on patterns value, to avoid crashes. The patterns will be clamped to max value: 1.7976931348623157E+308</li>
<li>Fixed cloverfield tickets bonus. It only granted half of it</li>
<li>Fixed items appearing small in stats screen after death/victory</li>
<li>Fixed localization issues as per player feedback</li>
<li>Rotten pepper now works as it should: doesn’t reset if you continue the previous run after closing the game.</li>
</ul>

      <title>You can grab a free copy of Immortals Fenyx Rising from Ubisoft</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need a free game ready for the weekend? How about Immortals Fenyx Rising from Ubisoft? Well you can claim it free to keeps right now.</p>
<p>The major caveat here is that it's done through Ubisoft directly, not Steam. So for Linux / SteamOS gamers, you'll need to install Ubisoft Connect using Wine or Proton. We have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-battle-net-on-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck-for-world-of-warcraft-and-starcraft/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a guide for Battle.net</a> which is basically the same steps, especially if you scroll down to the second option of just installing in Steam directly using Proton - so you shouldn't have too much trouble with it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="U4zb1yiFlQo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a983de19388dd013d8fa758fc644435c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/U4zb1yiFlQo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>

<p>YOU ARE THE GODS' LAST HOPE.<br/>
<br/>

Face off against legendary beasts like Cyclops, Medusa, or Minotaur, and confront them in fast-paced aerial and melee combat, combining your god-given abilities and weapons.<br/>

      <title>Of course dbrand is doing a Steam Machine Companion Cube</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You've seen the<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-reveal-the-new-steam-frame-steam-controller-and-steam-machine-with-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> brand new Steam Machine from Valve</a> right? But what about a Steam Machine Companion Cube? Yes that's also now going to be a thing. And…I think I want it? Possibly.</p>
<p>Coming from dbrand, who you might know from various skins and a few accessories for other devices (including the Steam Deck). We can expect it sometime next year when the new <s>Gabecube</s> Steam Machine releases, but there's no real details on it on their website at all.</p>
<p>It's "Limited Edition", so you may have to act fast on it. According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/819863/dbrand-companion-cube-valve-steam-machine-skin" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The Verge</a> it's not a normal skin, but a case that attaches to it. With the design still being finalised. Other skins will also be coming, which is not surprising, I'm sure other companies will also be looking to make some accessories too.</p>

      <title>Valve reveal the new Steam Frame, Steam Controller and Steam Machine with SteamOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The day has arrived, Valve have announced a major hardware expansion with multiple devices including the new Steam Frame, Steam Controller and Steam Machine. And of course, they're powered by SteamOS (Linux), exactly the sort of thing we cover! Massive news for Linux gaming, and shows how committed Valve are to open source and having an open platform.</p>
<p>"We've been super happy with the success of Steam Deck," said Gabe Newell, President of Valve, "and PC gamers have continued asking for even more ways to play all the great titles in their Steam libraries. Our work over the years on other hardware and even more importantly on SteamOS has enabled Steam Controller, Steam Machine, and Steam Frame to do just that."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16828161251762970809gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's what they've announced for 2026:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://steampowered.com/hardware/steamcontroller" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Controller:</a></strong>
<ul>
<li>Steam Controller shares DNA with Steam Deck, with all the inputs to play all the games on Steam, wherever Steam is.</li>
<li>High-performance, ergonomic controller with next-generation precision magnetic thumbsticks, full-sized controls, trackpads, gyro, and grip buttons.</li>
<li>Steam Controller is great wherever Steam is: PC, laptop, Steam Deck, Steam Machine, Steam Frame.</li>

<p>Valve do note in the press details how some of the specs are subject to change, so these may not be exactly final.</p>
<p>As part of this, Valve will be expanding the Steam Deck Verified program. This will include new ratings for the Steam Frame and Steam Machine. They will be known as Steam Machine Verified and Steam Frame Verified.</p>
<p>This is what we have been waiting for and why GamingOnLinux exists. We've been covering Linux gaming for years before Valve even came along, and Valve have practically kept us in business with all their open source work (and especially Proton).</p>
<p>Unlike the original launch of the first attempt at the Steam Machine, Valve has come a seriously long way to make it viable. Proton, the tool to run Windows games on Linux, has made it click and play for tens of thousands of games. So now, it makes a lot more sense.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OmKrKTwtukE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4490dea4e1634a49f82eb4bd083b17bd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OmKrKTwtukE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Absolutely amazing. Much like when Valve originally announced Proton, I feel a bit of the shakes over here from excitement. This is truly some world-changing stuff going on for Linux gaming. It's time for the stranglehold that Microsoft have had with Windows to end.</p>
<p>What this also should hopefully do, is put a bit more pressure on developers to get their anti-cheat enabled for Linux, otherwise that's still going to be quite a number of popular games that won't be playable on any of these devices. As we're tracking on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our dedicated anti-cheat page</a>. Especially so if the Steam Machine is priced reasonably, that could be a ridiculous amount of extra players using SteamOS Linux. Developers are going to <em>need</em> to pay a lot more attention to how their games run on Linux.</p>
<p>On top of that, it will be interesting to see if Epic Games will rethink their stance on the Epic Store and Fortnite.</p>
<p>We've opened up some new content tags for you to follow along: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/steam-frame/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Frame</a> | <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/steam-machine/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Machine</a>. You can also <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">join us on Discord</a> with dedicated chat channels.</p>
<p>Sadly, Valve did not provide GamingOnLinux with any heads up on it, so we're playing catch-up on all the details. There's also currently no word on review samples like we had for the Steam Deck LCD and Steam Deck OLED, so if you want to ensure we can grab them <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/support-us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">please do support GamingOnLinux directly</a>.</p>

      <title>The wonderful roguelite farming deckbuilder Cropdeck has a proper demo out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Plant, grow and harvest in the farming roguelite deckbuilder Cropdeck, with a demo out now that you definitely need to put on your list to try.</p>
<p>It's all about clearing fields while planting crops strategically, as you build up a deck of plants, and use items like scarecrows to make some fun synergies to pay off your tax. I played a previous early version of it, and came away pretty impressed by it. A wholesome spin on deck building, while a bit more laid back than others it's still challenging and interesting to play through.</p>
<p>See the previous trailer below:</p>

      <title>Satisfactory gets optimizations, and improved Steam Deck support in patch 1.1.1.7</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Coffee Stain Studios are showing how it's done, with Satisfactory getting a bunch of optimizations, and there's also improved Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>Across all systems you should see improvements to RAM usage in big saves, which sounds nice. As for the Steam Deck, a bunch of improvements for the UI and graphics presets that should give a better overall experience. They're hoping this will get it bumped up to Steam Deck Verified (currently sits at Playable).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7463617661762961801gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The latest patch 1.1.1.7 rolled out November 11th and notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>OPTIMIZATION</strong></p>

	<ul>
<li>This affects Conveyor Belts, Pipelines and Hypertubes and should lead to RAM usage improvements in big saves</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>STEAM DECK</strong>
<ul>
<li>First time experience improvements
	<ul>
<li>Improved font size and UI scaling defaults across the board</li>
<li>Added new values for the default graphical presets for Steam Deck only (Quality and Performance modes are available similar to console, with values you can tweak manually if preferred as well)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Changed confirm button to X on the Server Manager menu to avoid soft locks when inputting text using the Virtual Keyboard on Steam Deck</li>
</ul>
<strong>BUG FIXES</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed visual flickering in the sky around Northern Forest during nighttime</li>

      <title>KOMODO&#39;s Steam Deck store is renaming to KOMODO STATION - perhaps ahead of the Steam Frame</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Something is definitely happening in Valve land, as the KOMODO Steam Deck Store is being renamed KOMODO STATION tomorrow, November 13th.</p>
<p>For those not clued up — KOMODO are the official distributor of the Steam Deck for Asian markets including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong. We've seen many leaks over the years about Valve preparing a new VR kit, along with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/new-valve-trademark-for-steam-frame-looks-like-were-getting-new-hardware/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent Steam Frame trademark</a>.</p>
<p>All signs are pointing to an official Valve announcement to come really soon.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://steamdeck.komodo.jp/announcement-komodo-steam-deck-store-will-be-renewed-as-komodo-station-starting-november-13-2025/?lang=en" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="entry-content">
<p>Thank you very much for using our store.<br/>
We are pleased to announce that the “KOMODO Steam Deck Store” will be renewed as “KOMODO STATION” on November 13, 2025.<br/>
Along with this renewal, the store’s URL will change as follows:</p>
<p>Old Store:<br/>
KOMODO Steam Deck Store<br/>
URL: https://steamdeck.komodo.jp/</p>
<p>New Store:<br/>
KOMODO STATION<br/>
URL: https://komodostation.com/</p>
<p>Please note that customers who have registered or used the old store can continue to use their account information in the new store.<br/>
We sincerely appreciate your continued support.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point, what else could it be? Apart from the Steam Controller 2 as well perhaps. Or, KOMODO perhaps getting into supply hardware from other vendors, that's also entirely possible.</p>
<p>If it is the Steam Frame, I expect it to be a new VR kit powered by SteamOS with Proton supported on Arm to run games from other VR sets. Another possibly huge step for Linux gaming overall. There's a lot of excitement building up here.</p>

      <title>Embark confirm &#34;Duo prioritized matchmaking&#34; for ARC Raiders and lowered store prices</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Embark Studios have confirmed some recent changes to ARC Raiders, including a highly requested change for Duos to have a bit more fun with it. The game has been running very well on Linux, even with the Easy Anti-Cheat as it's enabled. It's listed on our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated anti-cheat page</a>.</p>
<p>The problem with the game previously is that Solo players were matched with other Solos and Trios with other Trios, but if you only had two players for a Duo, you were thrown into Trios games - which made it more difficult than it should be. There is an option to party up with randoms, but that's not always wanted. However, that changed beginning this week as confirmed today in a <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/duo-and-store-update/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> where Embark said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have silently tested and <strong>enabled Duo prioritized matchmaking</strong>, beginning earlier this week. Duo matchmaking will work like this: first, we prioritize Solos and Squads to play separately. After that, we prioritize Duos to play with other Duos, and for Trios to play with Trios. Please note that this is not a 100% guaranteed system, so you may at times run into differing constellations of players other than your own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it may not be perfect, but definitely a <em>lot</em> better.</p>
<p>On top of that, they've also listened to complaints about the in-game shop prices being ridiculous, something I noted in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/arc-raiders-has-seriously-exciting-gameplay-that-has-firmly-hooked-me-in/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my more detailed article on it recently</a>. Adjustments to the pricing to be lower will go live tomorrow, Thursday the 13th at 10:30 CET / 09:30 UTC. They will also be refunding the difference to players who already purchased at the old prices.</p>

<p>Another thing they also confirmed is that the Raider Decks are basically their Battle Pass system. The current one is entirely free, with you earning points to pick stuff from it during the game. They've said they'll be adding more free Decks to it, along with Paid decks too. They made it clear that there will be "no Pay to Win items in the premium Raider Decks" with a focus on "cosmetics and convenience".</p>
<p>Still, I'm a bit concerned what these <em>convenience</em> items will be in the upcoming Premium Raider Decks. They might not intentionally be pay to win, but they could result in an advantage. Then again, items can be just as easily lost to another player during a match. Will have to wait and see.</p>
<p>Overall it's great to see that they're properly listening to players.</p>
<p>If you want to pick it up, it seems Fanatical still somehow have it on a 14% discount.</p>

      <title>Beatblock may look simple but this rhythm-action game is absolutely brilliant (and brutal)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Beatblock has such a simple style to it that it may fool you into thinking it's a rather basic game, but the rhythm-action is provides is properly good.<em> Note: the developer sent a key.</em></p>
<p>Entering Early Access in September, it fell down a bit of a hole in the GamingOnLinux inbox that I'm putting right today, because I'm not usually one for such rhythm games but it won my over during the tutorial. That's how fast it hooked me because of the clever game mechanics, and the wonderfully popping tunes to go with it. It's also really flipping challenging too. In a few ways, it reminded me a bit of the classic Super Hexagon.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17345015731762953339gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Every song literally revolves around you, and so you have to keep up with it. You're in the middle, controlling a little face with a paddle that you rotate around you to catch blocks in time with the clicks from the tunes.</p>
<p>You get basic square blocks to hit, then there's longer curved blocks you need to move the paddle with to keep up, circles that form around you and shrink down until they hit the paddle where you need to mouse-click at the right time and then also blocks that come towards you with circles around them that require a mouse click too. Especially difficult at times when it combines them together, like the longer blocks that additionally require a mouse click at the start, and to take your finger off the button right at the end.</p>
<p>There's a lot more to it than that, as once you get into more tunes you'll see even more game mechanics making it even more varied and challenging.</p>
<p>Just so many little bits together that make sure you give it 110% of your attention. It's one of those deceptively simple looking games, that's anything but simple.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CuCUjDOTtQw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d48f29306f52576a52400079ffe58995.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CuCUjDOTtQw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore new mechanics across 25+ songs in the Atom Map, from learning the basics to tackling challenges!
	<ul>
<li>More songs are planned for future updates to bring the final scope to 40+ songs!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Flow with the music in different ways with multiple block types.</li>
<li>Tailor-made visuals for every song to set the scene (or mess with you...)</li>
<li>Customize Cranky however you want with unlockable costumes!</li>
<li>Chart a new path on your own songs with the built-in level editor!</li>
<li>Accessibility options to tweak the game and have fun on your own terms!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Fantastic, if you can handle the challenge. The "Easy" mode is just a lie, there's nothing easy about it.</p>

      <title>Tabulo is an upcoming Balatro-inspired chess roguelike</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another Balatro-inspired game and this time it's a chess roguelike, and one that actually looks like it could be pretty fun. There's a demo available which has Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Positioning is key here, since it's taking a bunch of elements of chess. Keep enhancing your pieces, purchase new powers and grab some bonuses from different challenges. But with the board being quite compact, it can be a challenge and you have to be careful. Each run has you build up a unique board and fill it with different pieces with their own synergies, but it's still all about increasing that score. As you progress you'll unlock new pieces, tiles and boards.</p>
<p>Check out their trailer below:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Several chess pieces to add to your board.</li>
<li>100  tiles, each with its unique ability.</li>
<li>10 boards with different modifiers to choose from every run.</li>
<li>25 coins that can modify your pieces, board and impact every run.</li>
<li>8 difficulty levels that provide unique and increasingly harder challenges.</li>
<li>20 bosses that make every run a new challenge.</li>

      <title>Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. World Stage silently added Easy Anti-Cheat</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With no official notice from the developer, Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. World Stage recently added in Easy Anti-Cheat. It's not listed on the Steam page either, which appears to be <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-games-will-now-need-to-fully-disclose-kernel-level-anti-cheat-on-store-pages/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">against Valve's rules on this</a>. Valve really need to clamp down on their rules to ensure developers are correctly listing things.</p>
<p>Originally just called Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O., the Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. World Stage rename and update came out at the end of October. There's been a bunch of complaints about it, including the silent addition of kernel-level Easy Anti-Cheat.</p>
<p>I've tried personally testing it on Linux with the update with Proton 9 to confirm, and I can see clearly it loads in Easy Anti-Cheat and the game itself appears to work. You can get into searching for opponents but I have been unable to verify if the online does actually connect now to another player since it never finds a match. So for now, it's listed on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our dedicated anti-cheat page</a> under a new status of waiting on reports from players.</p>
<p>A shame when developers choose to do such things silently, it's a slap in the face to fans of the game to be so secretive about a technical change like this.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="f8mibe385yE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7f1b18f745e87e94aa60c82d01784aea.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/f8mibe385yE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The game is rated Steam Deck Verified by Valve from January and Platinum on ProtonDB, but all current reports on it are older.</p>

      <title>ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN The Forsaken Hollows arrives December 4</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN, the standalone multiplayer co-op survival action game by FromSoftware, Inc. is set to expand on December 4 with The Forsaken Hollows.</p>
<p>The base game does have Easy Anti-Cheat, which much like the first game is enabled for Linux / SteamOS, and so you'll have no problems jumping into it with the DLC. It's listed on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our dedicated anti-cheat page</a>. It also has the GuardIT DRM.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The DLC introduces two new third day bosses, new field bosses, a new Shifting Earth -- a special condition where the map sees massive geographical changes, and new points of interest in Limveld for players to explore. Two new Nightfarers are joining the fray as well, with new abilities to take on the Night’s Tide. Players who own or purchase the Deluxe or Collector’s editions of ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN will automatically receive the DLC at launch; other players are able to purchase the DLC separately.</p>

      <title>SteamVR 2.13 brings a whole lot of bug fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While many of us are no doubt waiting on whatever the Steam Frame turns out to be, Valve have released the latest stable SteamVR release with lots of bug fixes. <em>There's even a couple in there for Linux too.</em></p>
<p>Valve say they are continuing to focus on OpenXR as their preferred API for new games and apps, and so a lot of their work keeps focusing on that. Which would also make sense if the Steam Frame arrives as a VR kit, sticking to an open standard would be good.</p>
<p>Here's everything that's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>SteamVR:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fix a crash that could occur when the AMD GPU driver was installed but no AMD GPU was present.</li>
<li>Fixed compatibility mode bindings showing as custom bindings when they are remapped default bindings.</li>
<li>Automatically prefer installing the <a class="Link _29bMZB6BOQfTQ_3za-w60I" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3824490/Oasis_Driver_for_Windows_Mixed_Reality/?snr=1_2108_9__2107" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Oasis Driver for Windows Mixed Reality</a> when running on a Windows version too new to support the Windows driver.</li>
<li>Roomview is independently enabled for VR vs non-VR gameplay.</li>
<li>Minor UX improvements to improve consistency with Steam (window reflectivity, colors, etc).</li>
<li>Added setting (general -&gt; advanced) to disable IPD HUD.</li>
<li>Reduced memory usage for user interface textures (improved performance).</li>
<li>Fix for the Default / Custom binding toggle in the Settings UI not working properly in some cases.</li>
<li>Fix for Recenter and Room View buttons not showing up in some cases.</li>
<li>Fix desktop settings showing a completely black screen (under error reporting conditions).</li>
<li>By default, Controller Compatibility Mode will now show users their physical controller render models (but still return simulated names to games).</li>
<li>Added new options to Controller Compatibility Mode render model simulation.</li>
<li>Fixed a few cases where controller input would be broken if a game or steam had been moved.</li>
<li>Fixed the Input Debugger not displaying some content correctly.</li>
<li>Fixed some issues with Pico controllers using Controller Compatibility Mode.</li>
</ul>
<strong>SteamVR Home:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed crash when hosting or joining rooms.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Linux:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fix rare crash when attempting to load render models.</li>
<li>Fix settings crash when navigating to “Developer” in SteamVR Settings.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Steam Link:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fix excess CPU usage that could occur when the performance graph was never visible during a session.</li>
<li>New frame pacing: Improves “popping,” judder, and other smoothness / latency issues for controllers or other animated content. Note this change does affect timing for VR applications on the host PC; please report any new gameplay issues.</li>
</ul>
<strong>OpenXR:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Support XR_KHR_locate_spaces.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where apps that didn’t submit projection layers would see a 100ms wait on alternating frames with some drivers.</li>
<li>When a requested time querying xrLocateSpace is outside of reasonable bounds, return XR_SUCCESS with an empty pose, instead of returning XR_ERROR_TIME_INVALID.</li>
<li>Support XR_META_recommended_layer_resolution.</li>
<li>Register SteamVR as an available runtime in the Windows Registry when SteamVR is defaulted to the active runtime.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Developer:</strong>
<ul>
<li>UX architecture improvements to improve consistency with Steam, including library versions and error handling.</li>
<li>Improved UX for 'mirrored device debug rendering'.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Former Humble Bundle staff launch new bundle site Digiphile to &#34;benefit users, creators, publishers, and charity&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Coming from veterans of Humble Bundle, a new bundle site has launched named Digiphile as the creators want to help you discover new games and support charity. They're calling the packs <em>collections</em>.</p>
<p>Why another bundle site? They were "Frustrated with the shortcomings of current bundle sites", and noted how there's so many thousands of games releasing on Steam each year and they believe the solution "isn't more choice, but better curation" to help you find games that are worth playing. With their collections aiming to "bring back the good old days of bundles, with no more than one premium offering at a time, functioning as community-wide events that include curator engagement, guest curator deep dives, and more features to come".</p>
<p>Interestingly, they have a sort-of key exchange system too. You can trade in a key for a game you already have to earn credits towards a title from a previous collection. They're also promising none of the key issues that plague Humble Bundle a bit lately, with keys being reserved the moment you checkout.</p>
<p>With the charity side of it, you can optionally add extra to your purchases to give more money to selected charities while also grabbing some bonus content with the collection.</p>
<p>From the press release: "Working at Humble Bundle was a dream come true for a fan like me. And I'm not alone. We were all fans of Humble Bundle even before we worked there”, said Digiphile Founder Alex Hill. “Now we’re committed to staying true to Humble’s spirit and building what we loved about it in the first place."</p>
<p>Fully independent and self-funded too, so they don't answer to some bigger company constantly chasing a bigger profit at the expense of everything and everyone else.</p>
<p>A first collection "Return of the Immersive Sim" is due to go live today featuring System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster, Perepiteia, Shadows of Doubt, Fallen Aces, Blood West, System Shock and CTRL ALT EGO. Not entirely sure exactly when, it appeared briefly for me earlier, then vanished on the next refresh. The press release did not give an exact time for it.</p>
<p>Well, it's clearly another bundle site but at least they're really <em>trying</em> to be different by the sounds of it. Will be fun to see how this evolves and if they bring out some good bundles. I'm certainly not complaining, I do love a good deal.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma 6.6 to get a great new feature - limit virtual desktops to the primary screen</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The work never ends to improve the KDE Plasma desktop environment for Linux, and with Plasma 6.6 a fun new feature is coming to tweak virtual desktops.</p>
<p>What is it? A virtual desktop acts like having multiple screens on one screen, allowing you to flick between them. You could have specific things open ready on one, ready to swap over to it whenever you need. It can be really useful. However, currently on KDE Plasma the virtual desktop applies to all screens.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13053175211762879953gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13053175211762879953gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - KDE Plasma, multiple virtual desktops.</em></p>
<p>That's going to change with KDE Plasma 6.6, as a new option has <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kdeplasma-addons/-/merge_requests/910" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">been added</a> to let you configure the behaviour between the current way, and limiting it only to your primary screen. This sounds great, there's a lot of times I want something to always stay on (like emails or Discord) while swapping around on my main screen and this would be perfect for that.</p>
<p>Plus more features and bug fixes coming as noted in the latest Plasma development <a href="https://blogs.kde.org/2025/11/08/this-week-in-plasma-virtual-desktops-only-on-the-primary-screen/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post roundup</a>.</p>
<p>Plasma 6.6 should be due out in February 2026.</p>

      <title>Pill-popping medical horror Side Effects from Free Lives arrives November 21</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I love the idea of Buckshot Roulette meets medical horror, so I'm keen to see what all the pill-popping fuss is about with Side Effects. We don't have long to wait, as it's been announced that it's arriving on November 21st for solo play and up to 4 people online together.</p>
<p>Coming from Free Lives who made the likes of Terra Nil, Broforce, Gorn, Stick it to the Stickman and Angerfoot - I think it's safe to say we're in for a good time here.</p>
<p>More about it: "Welcome to Side Effects: a tense, turn-based medical roulette game. Each round you'll be presented with a selection of pills. Some are helpful, some are harmful, and some mean instant death. You never know what you're about to consume or what it might do to your mind or body. Winning means outlasting – AKA, outliving – your opponent across the table."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UMMnkX2UKqA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/33f48d72cc7768af14538651c2a80d2c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UMMnkX2UKqA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights from the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Resist</strong> - Every pill impacts your resistance. Manage it wisely: zero resistance means death.</p>
<p><strong>Experiment - </strong>Between rounds, you can choose from a range of experimental items and treatments that can shift the odds in your favor, from vaccines to mouth clamps.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>You’re not alone</strong> - The other patient wants to outlast you. They’ll bluff, adapt, and use everything at their disposal to keep breathing one dose longer than you.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>The full version of the game will include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Single player mode.</li>
<li>Free Healthcare (endless mode).</li>
<li>Multiplayer mode (2-4 players!).</li>
<li>20+ unique items .</li>
<li>6 pill types to test.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Instead of racing in Backseat Champions you manage an AI driver like an auto-battling racer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Backseat Champions has a pretty clever idea, bringing the worlds of auto-battlers and roguelites to racing games with you managing an AI driver. <em>You're not quite literally in the backseat but close enough.</em></p>
<p>The game will feature races that are basically a short burst around the track, that's hopefully good for people who don't have a lot of time. The developer says it will allow you to "quickly hop in and get straight to the action" across real races, with "nothing scripted" where each race is different. You can play alone, or with friends too. During the race you pick various random upgrades, in the hope of making the fastest car to win. Not just that but you'll be able to manipulate the car in a few other ways too, and you'll also be dealing with dynamic weather.</p>
<p>From what I've seen and read, this seems like a seriously cool idea. Love it. I'm truly <em>awful</em> at driving games, but still getting in on the action through managing a driver directly? That sounds fun.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4Vl9b_HE1w0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3f5ba8bca97aca32be7d97351bd3b7d4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4Vl9b_HE1w0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>However, before you go jumping in worried about any generative AI, it's not that. It's the good old fashioned game AI. As the developer explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The drivers are powered by reinforcement learning using conventional, non-generative neural network models.</p>
<p>All training was done from scratch using self-made training environments built within the 50+ tracks of the game, and run from personal servers.</p>
<p>No copyrighted material, or third-party data, was used during the development of the game. All assets were created either by commissioned artists or myself.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The popular MangoHud performance display for Linux has a new release coming that's now ready for testing, with v0.8.2-rc1 now up.

      <title>Final Sentence is a unique horror battle royale where you&#39;re all on typewriters</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Type accurately and fast, as your life depends on it in Final Sentence. It's a unique blend of battle royale and horror with typing game mechanics.</p>
<p>Quite clever sounding, and looks to be challenging too. There's a demo still currently available, which has proven to be quite popular with over 559,000 players downloading it during the last Steam Next Fest. The full game will feature online typing battles for 40-100 players, along with friends-only games so you can pick how you want to play it. Sounds absolutely horrifying, I can't spell properly half the time (thanks for all the corrections), so this would count me out in a game pretty quickly I think.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Tl07u6hQP4E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2fe61ae72b85e7f39bbdb0e924bb7cce.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Tl07u6hQP4E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Battle Royale on Typewriters - You’ve never played anything like this before. Type fast and type accurately — your life depends on it. There's a revolver pointed at your head… with one bullet in the chamber.</li>
<li>Beat Your Friends - Play with strangers in massive rooms of 40 to 100 players — or battle it out in private matches with 4 or 8 friends.</li>
<li>Deep Stats and Ranked System - Every achievement is tracked and compared with others. See your progress. Know exactly where you're improving — and where you're falling behind.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The full game is due out sometime in Q1 2026</p>

      <title>The classic Unreal Tournament gets a big upgrade with the v469e patch from OldUnreal</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The team from OldUnreal have put up a rather big patch for the classic Unreal Tournament, bringing lots of improvements and fixes to the classic Epic shooter.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, back in December, Epic Games <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/classic-unreal-tournament-and-unreal-now-easier-to-download-free-thanks-to-oldunreal/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pretty much gave it the official stamp of approval</a> too setting the game free with the full thing available via the Internet Archive. Epic also <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/epic-games-update-the-unreal-tournament-website-linking-to-the-free-downloads-from-oldunreal/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">directly link to OldUnreal</a> too. Using the updated releases from OldUnreal is absolutely the best way to play the game, and pretty much required for online play.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8298492581762876578gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8298492581762876578gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Unreal Tournament on Linux</em></p>
<p>I won't list everything that's changed here in Unreal Tournament v469e as the changelog is <a href="https://github.com/OldUnreal/UnrealTournamentPatches/blob/master/ReleaseNotes.md#unreal-tournament-version-469e-release-notes" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">pretty darn long</a> but the main highlights included apart from <strong>tons</strong> of bug fixes are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>We added dozens of major quality-of-life features to Unreal Editor</li>
<li>Our Windows patches now include two great DirectX 11-based renderers: Metallicafan212's ICBINDx11 and dpJudas' D3D11Drv. These renderers offer great performance, low input latency, and lots of features. However, they will only work on recent versions of Windows and require a somewhat recent GPU</li>
<li>Apple users rejoice! This patch includes a brand new renderer that will talk to your machine using Apple's Metal API. You can enable this new renderer by setting the GameRenderDevice option in the [Engine.Engine] section of your game ini to Frucore.FrucoreRenderDevice. Please note that we couldn't call this renderer MetalDrv because that name is still taken by the renderer that targets S3's Metal API</li>
<li>The Windows and Linux patches now ship with dpJudas' VulkanDrv</li>
<li>By popular request, we added widescreen FOV scaling to the game (thanks Masterkent!)</li>
<li>The in-game server browser now needs much less time to populate the server list</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The simplest way to install it on Linux is actually via their own install script, which downloads the game and patches for you. You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/OldUnreal/UnrealTournamentPatches?tab=readme-ov-file" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the GitHub page</a>.</p>
<p>In my own testing today, the resolution was incorrect so I had to edit the full-screen mode to get it to display properly. You can find the settings in "/UnrealTournament/System64/UnrealTournament.ini", when I put "StartupFullscreen" to False it loaded properly and displayed correctly after.</p>

      <title>Sentry gets improved crash reporting for games running via Proton / Wine on SteamOS / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://sentry.io" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Sentry</a> is a toolkit for game devs to monitor errors, performance and more and now it should work a lot better on Linux / SteamOS with Wine / Proton. While the Sentry developers discovered the issues on SteamOS due to games running on Steam Deck, their improvements apply to Linux as a whole for any compatibility layer based on Wine / Proton.</p>
<p>What happened? They detailed in a <a href="https://blog.sentry.io/not-so-mini-dumps-how-we-found-missing-crashes-on-steamos/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">recent blog post</a> how a game developer sent in a support ticket to note they were getting <em>no</em> information from crashes on Steam Decks. Sentry developers realised it worked fine in Linux builds, but not in Windows games running through Proton.</p>
<p>Strangely they saw that non-fatal errors worked just fine and the logs were all sent. The problem with crashes, they ended up figuring out was that each crash dump was over <em>500mb</em> whereas a typical Windows crash dump would be "50-80 KB" and so "Something was catastrophically wrong" they said. This is far over their size limit for what was being sent, and it makes sense, imagine the Sentry systems getting sent tons of large packages like that - it would cause problems fast.</p>
<p>It all gets a bit technical from there, talking about capturing memory and leading onto finding an issue with Wine (which Proton is based on). Not a bug in Wine though, just part of how it works that led to this issue. As a result, they made multiple improvements to their system to account for it and they're now detecting Wine / Proton automatically in their SDK for game developers. And, as a bonus, developers can actually track Wine / Proton issues separately which sounds rather useful.</p>
<p>They said the fix is already in their Unreal Engine SDK and their own Sentry Native SDK for custom game engines, and it's coming soon for Unity and Godot SDKs. Side-note: Sentry also recently <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/godotengine.org/post/3m4zuvbllus2a" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">started sponsoring</a> Godot too.</p>
<p>What does this all actually mean? It will be easier for developers to track down and fix issues with their games running on Linux systems via Wine / Proton.</p>
<p>Pretty cool to see how SteamOS on the Steam Deck is having such a wide effect across the industry, leading to all sorts of toolkits getting better overall Linux support. <em>Long may it continue.</em></p>

      <title>Talking point - what have you been playing lately?</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hello GamingOnLinux readers! It's time again to open up the floor as they say so jump into the comments and give your latest recommendations.</p>
<p>I don't think I really need to talk much more about what I've been playing, because it's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/arc-raiders-has-seriously-exciting-gameplay-that-has-firmly-hooked-me-in/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">quite obviously ARC Raiders whenever I get the chance to</a>. I now have somehow lost 45 hours of my life to this thing, to the point where I've been <em>dreaming</em> about running through it. How wild. This is also another great excuse to show off some more cool screenshots I took during my runs of it. You might have spotted the dance party me and a few other random groups had in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/proton-experimental-gets-fixes-for-multiple-xbox-game-studios-titles-arc-raiders-and-various-other-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the recent Proton Experimental update article</a> too.</p>
<p>ARC Raiders is just screenshot bait quite often, it really does some fantastic things with lighting and world-building that I keep coming across things thinking "oooh cool!", and then bang — dead. Another raider comes over to take everything from me, although I went in with a free loadout. Hah, sucker! Enjoy your <em>nothing</em>!</p>
<p>Here's a few snaps a took recently:</p>

<p>Apologies to the partner, they had to buy a copy because I'm so hooked on it. But hah, now they are too!</p>
<p>ARC Raiders is doing some impressive numbers on Steam too, hitting an all-time peak player count of 462,488 recently. That's a lot, especially when you consider it's a multi-platform game. It's been beating the likes of Battlefield 6 and Rust, even coming pretty close to the constant player count of PUBG.</p>
<p>So, what have you been playing lately (and why isn't it ARC Raiders?).</p>

      <title>Crimson Freedom could be one to watch for single-player RTS fans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you like single-player RTS games with a proper narrative to go with it? You may want to keep a close eye on the upcoming Crimson Freedom. The developer has just announced it with a gameplay reveal to show it off, and it looks promising.</p>
<p>Set on 22nd-century Mars, the game follows the struggle of different ideologies battling for supremacy over the red planet and the future of humanity. Their aim with it is to revive "the golden age of RTS, combining sophisticated base building, complex army composition, and vital resource control, but enhances them with a modern user experience and thoughtful innovations". Coming with three factions each with unique units, tech and strengths.</p>
<p>A single-player first game with what is planned to have "25+ hours" of gameplay during the campaign, with another planned "15+" hours in an update after release. It will also have skirmish battles and they're planning on 1v1 online multiplayer too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HCP65C1ti-s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a93d08d661dcd16d40b151282fdf18b3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HCP65C1ti-s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They said a demo should hopefully be up in December.</p>
<p>“We built Crimson Freedom to be the RTS we always wanted to play, a deep strategy game with a story worth uncovering,” said Marko Gardijan, Game Producer at Yboga Studios. “Each campaign offers a radically different perspective on the struggle for humanity's future. You’re not just building armies, you’re exploring the moral gray area of the red planet, and the choices and failures of humanity.”</p>
<p>All sounds promising, and graphically looks pretty good too. With this sort of RTS being a favourite, I'm looking forward to giving it a try.</p>

      <title>The EasySMX X05 Pro wireless controller is cheap, feature-filled and comfortable with a big flaw</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The EasySMX X05 Pro was sent over for review and after spending weeks with it, this little device <em>nearly</em> turned into a favourite.</p>
<p>Let's get all the good bits out of the way first shall we? A controller designed to remove wires from your life, while also keeping the cost down. I'm genuinely surprised at just how cheap this is (around £30), while also feeling amazing to hold and play games with. It seems truly shocking how good the EasySMX X05 Pro actually is for the price.</p>
<p>What's also nice is how wonderfully quiet it is. The only noise you actually hear is the slight click from pushing in the thumbsticks, every other button is pretty much a whisper, which is great for family life or for those of you like me who really do get irritated by loud controller clicks. Even though it's all muted, all of the buttons still feel good on the feedback from pressing them. Even the D-Pad actually feels quite nice on this, with a clear click you can feel for the direction pressed.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2091738671762789313gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2091738671762789313gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>It has 1000mAh battery, dual-stage vibration triggers, a two-stage trigger lock system to swap between quick clicks and long pulls of the triggers, hall effect joysticks to help fight against stick drift, and compared with previous models they upgraded the D-Pad to help stop any missed diagonals.</p>
<p>The device supports 2.4Ghz wireless via a USB dongle supplied with it, Bluetooth and USB-C Wired.</p>
<p>You also get a bit of fancy lighting on it, which I know how some feel about everything having some form of RGB nowadays - but you can adjust the lighting directly on the controller, no need for an app. You can swap it between a dynamic moving colour bar, a breathing animation with different colours, a solid colour or none at all. <em>Yes, you can turn the RGB completely off.</em></p>
<p>There's also two extra buttons on the top between the triggers and shoulder buttons (M1 &amp; M2). These also don't need an extra app to configure, you can do it all on the controller directly which works perfectly. You just hold down the M button in the middle, with either M1 or M2 and it will flash red to tell you it's ready, then tap the button you want to assign it and press M again and it's done. No fuss at all. Nice!</p>
<p>Plug and play on my Linux Desktop and Steam Deck too, absolutely no issues with input there thanks to Steam Input.</p>
<p>For me, the most important thing was comfort. And I don't know exactly what it is about it, but I find it far more comfortable than my 8BitDo Ultimate and Ultimate 2. It just seems to fit into my hands a whole lot better. It's really nice to hold.</p>
<p>That's all the good stuff, and now onto why I cannot currently recommend anyone purchase it.</p>
<p>The EasySMX X05 Pro looks and feels like a premium controller. It is <em>so</em> close to perfect it's unreal. However, it has one absolutely massive glaring flaw that needs to be dealt with. The triggers are a <em>problem</em>. If you press the triggers a couple of times quickly when in long travel mode (the default / normal trigger experience), it will then incorrectly detect some light pressing as if you're fully pulling on the triggers. Let's say you pull down on triggers three times lightly, after that it will always act like you've pulled it down all the way to 100%, like you've enabled the locks on the back of the device for trigger clicks. You have to pull the triggers down hard to max to get it to reset and act normally again and it will happen constantly. This <em>seems</em> like a software issue, so if they can do a firmware update to solve that trigger problem, it would be pretty much perfection.</p>
<p>It's sad to end the review on such a technical problem, and the controller will now gather dust until that is solved as that's a complete deal-breaker for me.</p>

      <title>D7VK brings Direct3D 7 to Linux using Vulkan based on DXVK</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We've have DXVK and VKD3D-Proton for various versions of Direct3D on Linux, but now it seems we're also getting Direct3D 7 as well.</p>
<p>From the GitHub page the developer describes how it works:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Vulkan-based translation layer for Direct3D 7, which allows running 3D applications on Linux using Wine. It uses DXVK's d3d9 backend as well as Wine's ddraw implementation (or the windows native ddraw) and acts as a proxy between the two, providing a minimal d3d7-on-d3d9 implementation. The project is currently in its early days. Expect most things to run, but not necessarily correctly or optimally.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The project has only recently had a first public release on GitHub (about two weeks ago), but a fresh update on November 5th should make it a whole lot better. As the developer said: "After focusing a bit on performance tuning, things are now anywhere between decent to stellar in most of the supported games".</p>
<p>Sounds like the intent is to keep it as a standalone project, and not merge it into DXVK. Pretty cool to see though, amazing for game preservation to get even more retro Windows games running and most importantly performing well on Linux where even modern Windows will likely struggle with some.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16389232301762787818gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Star Trek: Armada</em></p>
<p>It won't work with every Direct3D 7 game though, things were a bit messy back then with various APIs. The developers notes "d3d7 is a land of highly cursed API inter-operability, and applications that for one reason or another mix and match d3d7 with older ddraw (not ddraw7) and/or with GDI are not expected to ever work". With that in mind, it might also never be an official part of Proton (and certainly not Wine directly) - so this isn't some world-changing thing for Linux (or Steam Deck), but really cool to see anyway.</p>
<p>Going by <a href="https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/List_of_Direct3D_2-7_games" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">PCGamingWiki</a>, there's quite a number of games that use Direct3D 7.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/WinterSnowfall/d7vk" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">find it on GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>THRASHER is thoroughly weird and it&#39;s out now as the follow up to THUMPER</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm not entirely sure what I thought of THRASHER but it's certainly a unique experience and it's officially out now with Linux / Steam Deck support. <em>Note: a key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>For people who played the game THUMPER, this comes from the artist &amp; composer behind it. Not a game I've actually played before, so I went in entirely cold on it. But what I do know, is that they're very different games. Where THUMPER is a rhythm game, THRASHER is an arcade-style smasher that sees you go through some very strange worlds to defeat a bunch of unusual looking otherworldly boss creatures.</p>
<p>The whole thing is just thoroughly <em>odd</em>. I like bizarre stuff though, and this is very much out there. You control a floaty space eel, and the idea is to smash through various moving objects as quickly as you possibly can to progress. Your time left is your score and so you need to be <em>fast</em>. It's all about the leaderboards here to beat your own time, and times from others across the world. Going into it the game feels like some sort of hypnotic psychedelic-infused version of the classic Snake almost, it's really hard to describe. Make the eel move around, smash through objects, while avoiding hazards that take away precious seconds you need or destroy them if you have time. That's really it on the basics.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Ilm63FtWc4U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d1351ebd5b591bed867e84ce1167efc3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Ilm63FtWc4U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The boss battles are very much the same as the normal stages, just tweaked a little with you smashing into an orb at the end of extra boss-battle rounds to then have your eel fly directly into their face to hurt them. If anything, the boss battles are a bit anticlimactic as the game ends up feeling rather samey as you go through.</p>
<p>But, it does expand and open up just a bit as you progress through it with it introducing power-ups, so it's worth it if you stick through it enough to see through the first bunch of realms as there's 27 stages across 9 very different realms to play. You don't necessarily have to be amazing at it to keep beating your times either, as it will allow you to progress regardless.</p>
<p>It definitely feels like a game should be more of a fit for VR, and considering it's supported in VR and was first released for VR, that makes a <em>lot</em> of sense. Although it still works fine as a flatscreen game with either mouse or gamepad, and all ways of controlling it do feel a little bit different.</p>
<p>Overall, it's properly unique. I'm struggling to clearly note down how I feel about it. Visually distinct from anything else, with audio to make it feel a little out of this world. If you like the idea of something firmly different to everything else releasing right now, perhaps give it a go. And as a bonus, it only takes a few hours to complete it.</p>
<p>Not quite the strangest game I've played this year (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/tingus-goose-is-one-of-the-weirdest-games-ive-ever-seen/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tingus Goose</a> wins that) but pretty close to it. I just wished there was something more to it. A lot of it was simply too easy, because it wants you to rush to beat those times and everything surrounds that.</p>

      <title>Halls of Torment is still probably the best survivor-like with The Boglands DLC and free update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Possibly still the absolute best action-roguelike survivor-like ever made, Halls of Torment has expanded with The Boglands DLC and a big free update. <em>Note: a DLC key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>What is it? Halls of Torment looks a bit like the original classic Diablo, but its gameplay is based on Vampire Survivors. You pick a character class, and then run through a series of different halls to take down as many enemies as possible, while collecting experience to level up and completely over-power your character. It has the delicious sort of action that allows you to completely hyper-focus on it as you just tear through enemy after enemy. It gives the kind of pure chaos towards the end of a run that you can't help but appreciate it.</p>
<p>Check out The Boglands release trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mbBMxS9TdM8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5caf79c2668a6e51c431e6e31f453b9f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mbBMxS9TdM8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It already had a <em>lot</em> of content to play through with multiple characters each with their own style, along with multiple rooms to battle through and lots of quests and now there's just more of it? The Boglands <em>should</em> be a no-brainer. The main problem with the DLC though, is that you need to have spent quite a long time in the game to actually be able to unlock the new content, because it requires hunting down potion ingredients across different halls (maps) to access it. A problem amplified by the 30 minute runs every time, which just feels a bit too long. It never wastes your time, but 30 minutes every time feels like a lot. I think I've been spoiled by the many other survivor-likes that have released with more compact runs.</p>
<p>Not an issue for seasoned players I imagine, maybe I'm just rubbish and that required me to put more time into it due to many failed runs, but I think you have to be <em>really</em> into Halls of Torment for the DLC to actually be worth it. Some of the enemy combinations really are tough to beat when put together. Then again, all it takes is one seriously good run to complete a whole bunch of quests, I think I was just unlucky at the start. </p>
<p>Thankfully, with all the quests you get to go through and their various rewards, I think it's worth it. Especially if you do enjoy over-powering your characters and constantly trying out new combinations using the special abilities you pick up from the maps and defeating the mini-bosses.</p>
<p>As for the DLC content, the new characters and maps certainly add a different flavour to the game, that may not be to everyone's tastes but it's fun to see the developers trying to do something a little different with it. It's been a little unstable and unbalanced since the DLC release though, but it's getting better after a couple of patches.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21105913891762783290gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21105913891762783290gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>DLC Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>A New Stage:</strong><br/>
	Trudge through a murky swamp teeming with insects, spirits, and ancient walking trees. Time is not your enemy here—<em>survival is</em>. Victory lies not in the grains of sand in the hourglass, but in the piles of slain foes.</li>
<li><strong>Two New Heroes:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>The Crone</em></strong> summons twisted plant life to ensnare enemies and spread <strong>Decay</strong>, a creeping affliction that weakens defense and shatters block chance.</li>
<li><strong><em>The Alchemist</em></strong> hurls volatile mixtures imbued with elemental powers—customizable for fire, ice, lightning, or earth. He thrives in chaos, and favors builds that harness multiple elements at once.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>50+ New Quests:</strong><br/>
	Earn rewards by experimenting with new mechanics, braving the Boglands, and mastering your tools.</li>
<li><strong>New Abilities &amp; Gear:</strong><br/>
	Unlock three new abilities and a dozen new items—each designed to synergize with the Crone's control and the Alchemist's raw elemental creativity.</li>
<li><strong>Decay Mechanic &amp; Earth Element:</strong><br/>
	Unleash the new <strong>Earth</strong> element and apply <strong>Decay</strong>—a long-lasting, armor-cracking curse that softens even the toughest foes.</li>
<li><strong>6 New Artifacts:</strong><br/>
	Customize your runs with powerful stage modifiers. Risk meets reward as these ancient objects twist the rules to your favor—or demise.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>More Traits. More Blessings. More Ways to Die.</strong><br/>
Expand your build potential with potion-focused blessings and new traits waiting to be uncovered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus there's also the free update that gives you The Bard as a new end-game character with their own unique abilities too, along with a few assorted other new items sprinkled into the game. Plus, some bug fixes and balancing changes and a few bits of improvements for gamepad controller players. I haven't seen any controller issues since the update, it all feels like a perfect fit for a gamepad.</p>
<p>It's still easily one of the best designed survivor-likes available today. Not played it before? You're in for a treat.</p>

      <title>Linux Mint to get an upgraded System Information tool and a spruced up system menu</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A new blog post is out from the Linux Mint team going over some recent work, with the newer Cinnamon Menu coming along nicely and a new System Information tool.</p>
<p>For the Cinnamon Menu that's getting a refresh, it's looking really good. They've recently added the ability to move the search bar and the system buttons. While it might not be one of the fanciest features around, the menu is your window into your system and so it needs to work well. Compared with the current Cinnamon menu, it definitely looks and feels a lot more modern and useful.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4762661291762775049gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Additionally, they've announced a rebrand of the original System Reports tool. It's now going to be called System Information, which will give you a better readout of your system in a (hopefully) easy to understand way. It's been expanded with 4 new pages of system details like a USB page for plugged in devices, a GPU page, a PCI page and a BIOS page.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17377850501762775276gol1.png"/></p>
<p>One thing I always find missing from these system info apps is your current Mesa driver version. KDE is the same with the About this System page. We get things like the Kernel version, graphics card, processor and so on - but the Mesa driver version just seems like it would be a good fit to add don't you think?</p>

      <title>The popular Easy Effects app swaps from GTK over to Qt, QML and Kirigami with a big new release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Originally known as PulseEffects, Easy Effects is an audio manipulation tool for Linux that provides many different useful effects and filters. Hold on a minute, this isn't a game? Correct! But, it's still an incredibly useful application for Linux, and can also be useful for anyone doing any recording and streaming on Linux!</p>
<p>A big new release has been put out with Easy Effects 8.0.0 that completely overhauls the interface, along with a built-in tray icon and menu. Not only that, the app is friendlier to smaller screens, some plugins saw a few improvements, there's bug fixes and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15646219571762774504gol1.png"/></p>
<p>It's looking great on my Kubuntu desktop, might actually have to start messing around with it some more.</p>
<p>Changelog for Easy Effects 8.0.0:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This is our first release using a combination of Qt, QML and Kirigami instead of gtk4. As a result our graphical interface went through major changes.</li>
<li>Now we have a built-in tray icon and menu. Among other things the tray menu shows a list of most used input and output presets.</li>
<li>Our window is now more friendly to small screens. As a result it is friendlier than before to tiling window managers too.</li>
<li>EasyEffects now remembers the last used plugin or tab and restores them when the window is reopened.</li>
<li>The previous global bypass button is now exposed as a [traditional] on/off button.</li>
<li>Out presets menu became a presets window that now has a third tab dedicated for autoloading profiles.</li>
<li>It is now possible to set a fallback autoloading profile. If the fallback is enabled the selected fallback preset is applied for any soundcard or microphone that does not have an autoloading profile.</li>
<li>The preset autoloading tab shows the current routing of the selected input/output device.</li>
<li>Presets can be renamed in our presets window.</li>
<li>Presets backup can be made in our presets window.</li>
<li>Our spectrum is now [drawn] by Qt Graphs. For now only Qt color presets are allowed but this may change in the future.</li>
<li>We added more shortcuts as well as global shortcuts for the global effects on/off and the microphone monitor.</li>
<li>Dry and wet controls were implemented for the convolver and pitch plugins.</li>
<li>The pitch plugin now has a button that allows its history to be reset.</li>
<li>The crystalizer plugin now has an adaptive intensity mode.</li>
<li>Our echo canceller is now based on the webrtc library instead of speexdsp. This should improve echo cancellation quality for many users.</li>
<li>Our manual is now displayed inside our window through WebEngineView. Yelp is not necessary anymore.</li>
<li>The test signal tab now can generate pink noise.</li>
<li>We added a configuration option that allows the microphone monitor output to be sent to the output effects pipeline input.</li>
<li>We added a new Autogain parameter that allows the output level to be forced to zero when the input level is below the silence threshold.</li>
<li>Improved compatibility with the latest Linux Studio Plugins releases.</li>
<li>We are now able to show Calf Studio Plugins native window. This requires the calf package to be built with its native window.</li>
</ul>

      <title>GZDoom successor project UZDoom gets a first preview release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/many-developers-leave-gzdoom-due-to-leader-conflicts-and-fork-it-into-uzdoom/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">After the GZDoom implosion</a>, the rest of the developers split off to form UZDoom and the first preview release has rolled out with some essential improvements.</p>
<p>This release is supposed to be a directly follow-up to GZDoom 4.14.2 with UZDoom keeping the versioning just bumping it up to UZDoom 4.14.3. As the <a href="https://zdoom.org/wiki/UZDoom_version_history/prerelease#4.14.3_(xx_11_2025)" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a> notes, updating to this is deemed "critical" as it has multiple security fixes. With UZDoom they also aim to address some historically contentious issues in the ZDoom community with a change to some of the defaults, to make it closer to how Doom originally looked. That, and, make it easier for users since the current amount of options can be a bit overloading.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10795478991762773389gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Doom 2 with UZDoom</em></p>
<p>Changes from GZDoom 4.14.2:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Multiple security fixes. <strong>This update is being deemed as critical.</strong> It’s highly recommended to upgrade to it.</li>
<li>Added new game-based cursors (courtesy of Nash Muhandes). These are much more cursor-y, and very good at pointing and clicking on things.</li>
<li>Changed defaults to be more balanced between vanilla and modern.</li>
<li>Lowered the master volume so it's less likely to blow out the system audio and become muffled (especially with things like the Plasma Rifle firing sound).</li>
<li>Added the Default option for automap colors, allowing the automap to choose based on which game is being played.</li>
<li>Added a Display option to control the render style of rocket explosions (these now default to additive instead of translucent since we felt it visually fit the other projectiles better).</li>
<li>Made the mouse less sensitive in menus when it’s been dormant for a short period. This should help reduce it accidentally shifting the selected option randomly while idle.</li>
<li>Added the <em>powerup_fade_scalar</em> cvar for controlling the strength of the fade on power ups (e.g. the Radiation Suit’s green tint).</li>
<li>Added support for the <strong>BUSY</strong> script flag for ACS.</li>
<li>Fixed audio not muting properly when the game is unfocused, causing it to build up and play back explosively in certain cases (especially for multiplayer games).</li>
<li>Fixed the master volume not properly applying to music when the game starts up.</li>
<li>Fixed weapon bobbing not disabling correctly when manually set to 0 via cvar.</li>
<li>Fixed the wrong music being played during Strife’s bad endings.</li>
<li>Fixed the opening subtitle for Strife not displaying.</li>
<li>Fixed the Iron Lich’s whirlwind blaming the wrong target for its damage dealt.</li>
<li>Fixed the textured automap being broken.</li>
<li>Fixed mid textures clipping incorrectly when skewed.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash with VisualThinkers when loading from a save.</li>
<li>Fixed IQM models with decoupled animations not displaying correctly if spawned without an animation.</li>
<li>Fixed gun flashes from MBF21 weapons not displaying correctly.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug with <strong>CreateTossable</strong> where items wouldn’t be removed if their amount was 0.</li>
<li>Fixed Quat’s <strong>Conjugate</strong> and <strong>Inverse</strong> functions throwing a JIT error.</li>
<li>Fixed the BrokenLines class being unserializable.</li>
<li>Fixed level data fields e.g. Sector not being cleared properly when transitioning between levels.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can test it out by downloading it via <a href="https://github.com/UZDoom/UZDoom/releases" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. You can also follow UZDoom on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/uzdoom.bsky.social" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully this will be the start of plenty of improvements and a long life for UZDoom and the ZDoom community.</p>

      <title>Fantasy Grounds virtual tabletop (VTT) is now free to play</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Previously known as <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/09/virtual-tabletop-app-fantasy-grounds-unity-appears-on-steam-with-linux-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fantasy Grounds Unity</a>, the developers at SmiteWorks have now made Fantasy Grounds VTT free to play.</p>
<p>Originally, this virtual tabletop required someone to spend at least $50 for an Ultimate License (or a monthly fee) to be able to actually host a game with it. Now, all users gain access to the platform without having to spend anything. While the base software is now free there's tons of content that is not including licensed packs like Alien, Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder and so on.</p>
<p>From the press release: "By removing the license barrier, we’re making Fantasy Grounds more accessible to the global tabletop gaming community," said Doug Davison, President of SmiteWorks. "Whether you’re a veteran GM or a first-time player, we want everyone to experience how powerful and immersive virtual tabletop gaming can be – with zero upfront cost."</p>
<p>They also made a rather odd trailer to go with the announcement:</p>

      <title>Steam&#39;s wider store page refresh is live with plans to improve the home page on the way</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For a while now Valve have been tweaking Steam store pages, including making them a fair bit wider which is now actually live everywhere for all users.</p>
<p>This was originally available via the Steam Beta Client for Desktop <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/steam-is-getting-wider-and-more-responsive-store-pages/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">since August</a>, and rolled out in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/steam-update-gives-wider-store-pages-library-sorting-desktop-accessibility-controls-and-lots-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">September</a> on Desktop for everyone but now they've also put all the changes on the web store too not just the Steam Client. The pages have been widened from 940 pixels to now 1200 pixels, which may not be huge news but it definitely makes a difference. Especially for screenshots, since you'll see them at a higher resolution now too.</p>
<p>With this change the trailer / screenshot section also gained some new tricks with new viewing modes between a theatre mode and full-screen, with controls to scroll through them that's especially nice when looking over new games to just quickly tap through full screenshots directly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5800837441762538569gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Valve also gave developers some new tools to make their game descriptions more interesting, store pages take a bit more background colour from the games too which is subtle but looks quite nice. Plus some other changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a class="Link _29bMZB6BOQfTQ_3za-w60I" href="https://store.steampowered.com/search?term=&amp;snr=1_2108_9__2107" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Search results</a> are wider and each row is slightly taller giving a little more room for the game artwork to increase in size.</li>
<li>Bundle detail pages also now have slightly more colorful backgrounds and larger artwork in the list of contents.</li>
<li>Recommendation pages like the <a class="Link _29bMZB6BOQfTQ_3za-w60I" href="https://store.steampowered.com/recommender?snr=1_2108_9__2107" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Interactive Recommender</a> and <a class="Link _29bMZB6BOQfTQ_3za-w60I" href="https://store.steampowered.com/recommended/friendactivity/?snr=1_2108_9__2107" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Popular Among Friends</a> are wider.</li>
<li>Store hubs such as for individual tags (eg. <a class="Link _29bMZB6BOQfTQ_3za-w60I" href="https://store.steampowered.com/tags/en/Supernatural?snr=1_2108_9__2107" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Supernatural</a>) have always been a little wider than game pages. We updated these now to all be the same width.</li>
<li><a class="Link _29bMZB6BOQfTQ_3za-w60I" href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/?snr=1_2108_9__2107" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Charts</a> and <a class="Link _29bMZB6BOQfTQ_3za-w60I" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/?snr=1_2108_9__2107" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">News Hub</a> were both slightly different sizes and even different sets of colors. These have been consolidated some to bring them more inline with Steam platform colors.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As for the main Steam home page, they said they have some "similar adjustments coming in the near future" but they're not ready to go live yet.</p>

      <title>OpenMW 0.50.0 for Morrowind is out with more enhancements and better gamepad support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Morrowind just got even better with the new OpenMW 0.50.0 release, as the free and open source game engine reimplementation has some big fancy new features.</p>
<p>One of the headliners being vastly improved gamepad support, allowing you to play through it properly and interact with the UI. This is going to make it a whole lot nicer to play on handhelds like the Steam Deck. They've also made "foundational steps in dehardcoding combat, further expands our Lua scripting API and, among the host of user interface fix-ups, introduces the highly requested quick item transfer".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19276896261762533074gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>This brings a new Controller Menus option in the launcher, which slightly adjusts the in-game UI allowing you to use the "controller action buttons to navigate more conveniently through the slightly altered in-game UI" no longer limiting you to the combination of emulated mouse input.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">There's a lot they've improved elsewhere including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better NPC AI pathfinding.</li>
<li>Improvements to sneaking.</li>
<li>Settings are now actually saved when you exit the settings, not the game itself.</li>
<li>Improved graphics compatibility with various modded assets.</li>
<li>Fixes for normal mapping and parallax mapping graphics issues.</li>
<li>Some big improvements to scripting for modders, like allowing modders to manipulate the weather.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Mass Effect&#39;s SSV Normandy SR1 Returns to No Man&#39;s Sky with a re-run of previous expeditions</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hello Games are giving us all another chance to grab some cool stuff in No Man's Sky, like Mass Effect's SSV Normandy SR1 with various expeditions. <em>They're bringing back different expeditions to celebrate another year.</em></p>
<p>What exactly are expeditions? They're special time-limited events where you're given a series of tasks to do, and going through them will net you some special rewards.</p>
<p>The re-run expedition timeline starts today:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Beachhead: 7th Nov - 18th | Nov The inhabitants of the Space Anomaly have detected something impossible: a fluctuation in history already written. A new pattern is emerging in the stories of the ancient Gek, Korvax, and Vy’keen. Something is coming: a legendary weapon that always appears whenever it is needed...</li>
<li>Titan: 19th Nov - 2nd Dec | Chart a dazzling array of new stars and new worlds formed in Worlds Part II: gas giants, endless oceans and cloud-skimming mountains. Earn exclusive rewards, including a unique living ship dredged from the inky depths of a water world.</li>
<li>Relics: 3rd Dec - 16th Dec | Sign up with the Galactic Palaeology Society and join the community on a journey to recreate ancient lifeforms, uncover secrets left undisturbed for millennia, and earn a complete living stone appearance override.</li>
<li>Corvette: 17th Dec - 30th Dec | Your former starship has been damaged beyond repair, and the Sentinel horde is closing in. Assemble your own corvette-class starship, maximise its stats and potential, and take refuge amongst the stars! Earn an array of exclusive rewards, including the one-of-a-kind Mecha Mouse robotic companion.</li>
<li>Breach: 31st Dec - 13th Jan | Traverse a desolate and abandoned universe, confronting both the awe and the horror that lurks in deep space. Follow the tale of the ill-faded Fireship Arcadia, step into zero-gravity, and scavenge modules from its wreckage to enhance your own corvette builds. Complete milestones to earn a set of ancient, powerful Atlas-themed corvette modules.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/275850/view/614305130088497378" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> ended with a reminder of work ongoing for their next game, but they also teased that "we already have so much more content planned and in active development" for No Man's Sky. I'm properly excited to see what else they have cooking, as they've added some really incredible features to the game over the last year or so through a bunch of major free updates.</p>

      <title>Lexispell is a roguelike word game where strategy meets physics</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now this looks like a cool mix, Lexispell brings some roguelike strategy flavour to word games with physics and the trailer easily sold me.</p>
<p>Dare I say it? I'm going to — it's another game that looks just a little bit inspired by <em>Balatro</em>. Yes, a name you've heard a lot I've no doubt, but Balatro has clearly inspired the UI design of a number of more casual games recently and this is another. Not that it's a bad thing, it looks lovely. The gameplay has a similar theme too, as you go through rounds of trying to beat the score but here it's done with words.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="TRuNbAKeo8c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c5399112ac895efd2dd7fe1dd48d0905.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/TRuNbAKeo8c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Craft long words to score high</li>
<li>Merge, merge, merge = more points</li>
<li>Choose specific words to trigger cool upgrades</li>
<li>Defeat bosses with mind twisting rules</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>More than a roguelike - </strong>Explore various game modes: roguelike, time rush, jar puzzle and daily challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Cozy &amp; relaxing - </strong>Sit back, grab a hot drink, and spell your way to victory</p>
<p><strong>Interact how you want - </strong>Play with mouse, keyboard, touchscreen or controller. </p>

      <title>Battlestar Galactica Deadlock is getting delisted starting November 15</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Slitherine / Black Lab Games have announced that the excellent strategy game Battlestar Galactica Deadlock is going to be removed from all stores.</p>
<p>They said "starting" on November 15th, that the game and all of its DLC "will no longer be available for purchase on any platform" and they wanted to "give everyone a proper heads-up to grab the game while it’s still available". If you already own it on platforms like Steam and GOG, you will still be able to play it, but no one else will be able to buy it once it's gone.</p>
<p>Another terrible hit for game preservation. It's such a huge shame when games are just removed like this. There's probably some sort of rights expiration behind the scenes for the removal, but we can only guess as they didn't give an actual reason.</p>

<p>We do also have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/battlestar-galactica-scattered-hopes-announced-and-has-me-terribly-excited/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes</a> upcoming but it's a very different game. Still, at least there will be something expanding the Battlestar universe that I love so much.</p>
<p>If you want to grab Battlestar Galactica Deadlock before it's gone possibly forever, the GOG store has it on a 70% discount until the 17th.</p>

<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="dgOlgyjH7CI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7bdd9db5f871325378f162d6a6651410.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/dgOlgyjH7CI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

<blockquote><strong>MAJOR FEATURES</strong>

<li>11 new badges to earn, each with associated cosmetics to unlock as rewards!</li>
<li>New Roots-specific Items:
	<ul>
<li>ShroomberriesEach color of Shroomberry gives a random effect, which cycles out every day alongside the map. The best way to find out what they do is to try one! (Or feed one to an unsuspecting friend)</li>
<li>Fortified Milk</li>
<li>Cloud Fungus</li>
<li>Bounce Fungus</li>
<li>...And some more we won't tell you about!</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<strong>BUG FIXES </strong>
<ul>
<li>Players can no longer point at stuff (ping) while unconscious</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where status over time (hunger, poison, etc) could result in the stamina bar being visually full of status, but the player would not pass out.</li>
<li>Extra stamina will now reset to 0 when a scout is killed.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where a reconnecting player could spawn with a different player's statuses/inventory.</li>
<li>The game will end properly if all living players disconnect, leaving only dead ones behind.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue causing items with limited uses to spontaneously regain all their uses sometimes.</li>
<li>Improved the interaction highlight on several items where it was missing or partially missing.</li>
<li>Updated a number of badge illustrations lightly for readability.</li>
<li>The Napberry Plant spawns again in the Alpine!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>PEAK works perfectly on Desktop Linux with Proton and pretty great on Steam Deck too. Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified. It's absolutely one of the highlights released in 2025, where me and friends have spent some of the most time together for our more casual gaming.</p>

      <title>SteamOS 3.7.17 released with fixes for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, OS Updates and Discover</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released the latest stable system update with SteamOS 3.7.17 now available bringing bug fixes, but also disabled wake-on-bluetooth for Steam Deck LCD.</p>
<p>The experimental wake-on-bluetooth support for Steam Deck LCD has been repeatedly problematic, being enabled and disabled a few times now. Hopefully Valve can figure out the issues with it soon so all users can benefit from it, as it's especially useful when docking a Steam Deck.</p>
<p>SteamOS 3.7.17 release notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="EventDetailsBody A_A2B6fTn_MPLlGCmsLtd">
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the performance overlay would sometimes not appear in Baldur's Gate 3.</li>
<li>Temporarily re-disabled experimental wake-on-bluetooth support for Steam Deck LCD while issues with spurious wake-ups are investigated.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that could prevent updating from specific older builds of SteamOS.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug with the Discover app in desktop mode that could cause update failures in some scenarios.</li>
</ul>

      <title>CodeWeavers launch a new CrossOver Preview adding Linux ARM64 support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gaming on Linux with ARM64 is about to get more interesting, with the team at CodeWeavers announcing a new CrossOver Preview. They said this has been years in the making through different releases of Wine gradually adding more of what's been needed.</p>
<p>What is CrossOver? It's from the team that support Wine development, which adds their own UI and tooling on top of Wine to make the experience a little bit easier, along with dedicated support. Some of their team also work with Valve on Proton.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/blog/mjohnson/2025/11/6/twist-our-arm64-heres-the-latest-crossover-preview" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In January 2024, ARM64 support was released in <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/releases/wine-9.0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Wine 9.0</a> for running native Windows ARM binaries and emulated i386 code. In May 2024, the CrossOver team completed work making a native ARM64 CrossOver client. The <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/releases/wine-10.0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Wine 10.0</a> release in January 2025 included full support for ARM64EC to run emulated x86-64 code. Tackling ARM64EC involved not only significant Wine development, but also extensive compiler development to essentially implement a brand new architecture. The existing LLVM toolchain already had support for ARM64, and Wine developers worked on the ARM64EC support that was included in the LLVM 21 release. Finally, once ARM64EC development was complete in upstream Wine, the CrossOver team integrated <a href="https://fex-emu.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">FEX</a> into CrossOver to handle i386 and x86-64 emulation and our QA team completed an extensive testing sweep.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CodeWeavers have been testing on the <a href="https://system76.com/desktops/thelio-astra-a1.1-n1/configure" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">System76 Thelio Astra</a> which has an Ampere Altra CPU and an NVIDIA RTX 4060 Ti with Ubuntu 24.04. In their testing they were able to see these results:</p>
<blockquote>

<tr>
<td>Game</td>
<td>Average FPS</td>

<tr>
<td>Cyberpunk 2077</td>
<td>120</td>

<p><em>That's a pretty expensive system though. </em></p>

<em>Pictured - Cyberpunk 2077, credit: CD PROJEKT RED</em></p>
<p>Really interesting tech, and continues to show what's possible with open source. CodeWeavers' Meredith Johnson notes how "we envisage CrossOver as a viable solution for migrating enterprise Windows workloads to Linux for improved security and reduced bloat".</p>

      <title>The Falconeer gets a huge Revolution Remaster upgrade but drops Native Linux for Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Falconeer: Revolution Remaster is now available bringing a massive upgrade to the action-adventure game, but Linux gamers will now need to use Proton.</p>
<p>What is it? You take on the role of Falconeer, a powerful airborne warrior traversing a vast oceanic world torn apart by generations of poisonous decisions and dissent. Throughout multiple campaigns, you will experience life from many different perspectives and loyalties as you embark on a journey of discovery, and solve the mystery of the Ursee, its people and history.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3EErnxbh1Lc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c12dbdf9d60961139a7507e32c836659.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3EErnxbh1Lc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As for what the new edition update brings:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Completely overhauled visuals:</strong> rebuilt environments, redesigned warbirds, new lighting systems, and fully dynamic illumination that brings the skies of the Ursee to life.</li>
<li><strong>Refined flight controls:</strong> experience a smoother, faster, and more responsive aerial combat.</li>
<li><strong>Rebalanced missions:</strong> smarter enemies, faster pacing, and more epic encounters.</li>
<li><strong>The Edge of the World DLC:</strong> fully integrated into the base game, now remastered to the same high standard.</li>
<li><strong>Expanded lore and world:</strong> new settlements, visual storytelling, and subtle narrative updates deepen the Ursee’s mystery.</li>
<li><strong>Improved controls: </strong>a reworked single control scheme providing a more intuitive experience for players on mouse and keyboard.</li>
<li><strong>And More: </strong>New cosmetic armour sets and expanded voice acting.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking about dropping the Native Linux version the developer said: "The native Linux option has been removed. It's simply [too] much for me to support additional platforms for two games. The game runs good on Proton 9 and for now that is the official support. I hope Linux players can understand that for a Solodev there are constraints."</p>
<p>It's currently rated Steam Deck Verified by Valve and this release also came with some specific Steam Deck improvements too like a reduction in shadow quality, a new downsampling option and other performance adjustments and improvements.</p>

      <title>Luanti (formerly Minetest) joins up with Open Collective Europe for funding</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hopefully making this excellent open source voxel game engine project more manageable, Luanti (formerly Minetest) has joined up with Open Collective Europe.</p>
<p>As announced in <a href="https://blog.luanti.org/2025/11/05/non-profit/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the blog post</a>, they now have a <a href="https://opencollective.com/luanti" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">dedicated page</a> where you can directly support the project. This should make it easier for people to donate and for the developers to access the funds to put towards things like hosting servers, promoting Luanti, supporting general development, reducing their legal risk with funding and so on. It should also make it easier for them to attend events like FOSDEM. On top of that, it makes things a lot more transparent too, as you can see what funds are going in and being used for what.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6191724161762434175gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Luanti has made some impressive progress over the last few years, with a lot of popular games available for it and the future is clearly looking bright for this free and open source voxel game engine.</p>
<p>See more about it on <a href="https://www.luanti.org/en/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the official site</a>.</p>

      <title>The open source FOSDEM event for 2026 will have a Gaming and VR devroom</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>FOSDEM is an important event for the open source community, and it seems like FOSDEM 2026 is going to be interesting for Linux gaming fans too.</p>
<p>They've revealed it's going to have a Gaming and VR devroom for the first time, and they're calling for participation. From the <a href="https://lists.fosdem.org/pipermail/fosdem/2025q4/003675.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Gaming/VR devroom will focus on all Free and Open Source gaming, VR and related projects. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<p>- Open Games.<br/>
- Open VR software and hardware.<br/>
- Open gaming related hardware.<br/>
- Gaming and VR engines.<br/>
- Related components.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They said the deadline is "December 1st, 2026" but they most likely mean <u><strong>2025</strong></u> (woops), since the event takes place 31 January - 1 February 2026.</p>
<p>Anyone can submit a talk, so it will be interesting to see what happens with this one. We'll be keeping an eye on it. They're aiming for each talk to be no more than 25 minutes. However, you will have to be in-person to do a talk in Brussels (Belgium) on February 1st, 2026 for it.</p>
<p>It has been a big few years for Linux gaming, so it's not really surprising to see FOSDEM make more space for it.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve put out another small Beta to fix up an issue with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/steam-deck-gets-a-new-low-power-screen-off-downloads-mode/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new Steam Deck screen-off downloads</a>, and some other Desktop Linux fixes that came recently.</p>
<p>I'm seriously happy to see this feature land, and it has been working really nicely in my testing when loading up both my Steam Decks with some more games.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Display-Off Low Power Downloads </strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where PlayStation controller light bar settings did not stick when exiting the controller calibration page.</li>
</ul>
<strong>SteamVR</strong>
<ul>
<li>Reduced or eliminated a bug where the dashboard bar is occasionally missing.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And also (Nov 4th):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Xbox 360 controller mappings on newer Linux kernels.</li>
<li>Fixed 8BitDo Pro 3 controller mapping on Linux when hidraw devices aren't available.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Remote Play</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed mouse position when using multiple monitors with different display scales.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Terminator 2D: NO FATE delayed yet again into December</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Terminator 2D: NO FATE has a delay once again with the developers pushing it back into December due to issues with the physical releases. Perhaps this will be the final delay, as they now actually have the physical releases they just need to prepare them all. The issue has been matching up physical and digital release timings which has pushed the release date again.</p>
<p>It's now releasing December 12th as noted in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1718460/view/580528132884267069" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>. You can see the original game overview trailer below:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>

<li>Shoot, sneak and escape the T-1000’s blades in a wide array of levels, and lead the Resistance as John Connor in critical Future War missions.</li>

      <title>The Crew Motorfest is Steam Deck Verified with the Season 8 update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/the-crew-motorfest-plans-to-be-steam-deck-verified-for-november-5/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ubisoft said it would be</a> when they announced it recently, Valve have given The Crew Motorfest the green tick of Steam Deck approval. This new status comes along with the Season 8 update which is now available, after an extended server downtime delay earlier today.</p>
<p>The BattleEye anti-cheat was already enabled as <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">listed on our anti-cheat page</a>, they've just made some improvements to get it up to the green tick. What changes did they make? Your guess is as good as mine, their <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/the-crew/motorfest/news-updates/5EqmmwTrHLUlOTlX5Ya8uP" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes</a> don't actually mention anything to do with it. I sure do love it when developer say they make improvements but don't say what.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/601730971762347913gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Valve's compatibility notice mentions how it always needs an internet connection. Apart from that, everything else is green ticked. Valve have it set to Proton Experimental by default.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5872943421762348013gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Nice to see a bigger publisher like Ubisoft make the effort where many developers still don't, now we just need them to do the same with The Crew 2.</p>

      <title>Scribbly, open-world action adventure Scrabdackle arrives December 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Follow along the misadventure of a novice wizard in Scrabdackle, a scribbly-art open-world action adventure when it arrives on December 2nd. It will arrive with Native Linux support, built with Godot.</p>
<p>What actually is it? From the developer - Scrabdackle is a scribbly, open-world adventure drawing from zeldalike, soulslike, and metroidvania influences. You can explore the world in whatever direction you want, but may be blocked from some pathways until you learn a new spell to help you get by. Or you can just turn around and head somewhere else first instead! Nearly all spells, bosses, and regions of the game can be found in any order.</p>
<p>The developer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1578720/view/499459531596628486?l=english" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed</a> today their release plan for the first act in Early Access, along with pricing info. Their plan is for it to cost $14.99 for Act 1. They will also be selling the soundtrack for Act 1 with around 40 tracks at $9.99.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QzBF0ZH8qqg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cce0c79581b8080e6d92f306b2896fcf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QzBF0ZH8qqg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>If you want to try it out early, you'll want to be fast as they've decided the demo will be taken down on November 18th in preparation for the release. It's had a demo for a long time but still a shame to see it go.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Scrabdackle Act 1 features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>6 spells to learn.</li>
<li>9 bosses to challenge.</li>
<li>10 regions to explore.</li>
<li>60 unique stickers and stars to find.</li>
<li>90 minutes of music to nod to.</li>
<li>122 notebook entries to scry.</li>
<li>and about 70,000 words to read.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Sonic fan game Dr. Robotnik’s Ring Racers gets a big upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dr. Robotnik’s Ring Racers is a thoroughly great kart racing game made by fans of the Sonic universe, and a big new upgrade makes it better than ever. <em>While SEGA are busy <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/sonic-rumble-has-arrived-on-steam-and-works-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">putting out predatory microtransaction junk</a>, the community delivers.</em></p>
<p>A game made for people who love a challenge, this kart racer is definitely not one you can just instantly pick up and expect to be good in it. You need to master tense combat, resource management, and taking risks under pressure. It's inspired in parts by anti-gravity racers, fighting games and classic kart racers.</p>

      <title>Sonic Rumble has arrived on Steam and works on Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sonic Rumble from SEGA has arrived on Steam, and although it has anti-cheat it is enabled for Linux / Steam Deck so you're good to go on this one. Valve actually rated it Steam Deck Verified and it's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">listed on our anti-cheat page</a> as it's compatible.</p>
<p>Not that you'll want to play it though. It's a free to play cheap imitation of Fall Guys wearing a Sonic skin, filled to the max with pretty crummy monetization. This looks and feels exactly like a mobile game, complete with the big button overlays in the PC release that you would expect to see on mobile.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/402302421762345353gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/402302421762345353gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The gameplay isn't even particularly fun. I've played a good bunch of rounds on it this morning to get the feel for it and after a few rounds you've pretty much seen it all, which wouldn't be too bad if it was actually fun but it just feels incredibly shallow. The maps range from a simple race while avoiding obstacles, to running around mashing a button to smash into things to collect the most coins and that's really all there is to it. It is very much Fall Guys Sonic, there's no other way to describe it.</p>
<p>Speaking as someone who grew up with Sonic on the Sega Mega Drive, I'm quite disappointed in what they've done to the hedgehog world here. I've no doubt mobile players would get sucked in by it, but this is not the type of experience you would expect to see or even work on PC. The monetization here is just — wow. Expensive. Completely <em>ludicrous</em> even.</p>
<p>Some of the skins cost a <em>ridiculous</em> amount of money. Just look at this one below with Neon Suit Sonic being on sale at 729 down from 999 Red Star Rings. How much is that in <em>real</em> money? Over <strong>£40</strong> just to grab that <em>one</em> single skin. Put your wallets away, it's not worth it. You could buy some of the biggest and best games on Steam for the price of a single skin here.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11230890251762344906gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11230890251762344906gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19974143021762344908gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19974143021762344908gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>That is the extreme end, so let's be a bit more fair to it because you can also buy a single emote for 99 red rings which is uh, still requiring you to spend about £10 just for that. Okay sure, it can't get <em>worse</em> right? Sure it can! You can spend £5 (minimum) to purchase a Tune-Up bundle to boost your characters in what looks like some pay to win bonus for your points during a round.</p>
<p>Nothing about this looks good. Crappy monetization and boring gameplay. One to skip.</p>

      <title>ARC Raiders has seriously exciting gameplay that has firmly hooked me in</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ARC Raiders is the new hotness in town and thanks to Embark Studios <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">enabling Proton support for Easy Anti-Cheat</a>, I've been putting hour after hour into it.</p>
<p>Since it's an extraction shooter, something that until now I haven't been too familiar with (I've played a little bit elsewhere), adjusting to the gameplay has been thoroughly interesting. Being a Linux gamer, our options for such games are <em>incredibly</em> <em>limited</em>. Actually, this might be the only game of its class that's properly playable on Linux. Not only that, but ARC Raiders is strangely welcoming even with the often brutal challenge to it.</p>
<p>If I had any hair left on my head, it would have at times make me pull it out from the stress of it. ARC Raiders makes me question my sanity as much as it <em>excites</em> me. The minute-to-minute gameplay is some of the most interesting I've seen in forever in an online action game. <em>Helldivers 2 comes pretty close to it though.</em></p>
<p>You just don't know what's going to happen from one minute to the next. Will you find a friendly player? Will someone gun you down and take all your loot? Will you decide to backstab someone that didn't want a fight? There is simply no wrong way to play it - it's all about those split-second decisions that will decide if you live or die. It is a PvPvE game, so you make the choice on how you play it and what you're going to do during each run.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9747868371762263260gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9747868371762263260gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Those are some big robots in the distance…</em></p>
<p>Also helped by the fact that it's a gorgeous looking game. It's certainly not the best-ever looking, but we've hit a point where most AA/AAA games are just good enough that I don't think we need to keep chasing realism and ARC Raiders makes that clear. It also performs pretty darn well overall too. I'm constantly taking screenshots thinking - "wow, that looks so cool!".</p>
<p>I'm only really scratching the surface in my surprising amount of hours in it, but even so, I've experienced so many different events that constantly leave me just wanting more. The combat is simply wonderful in it, especially with the ARC robot design and the excellent physics that go along with them. Like the simple ARC hover drones for example, one of the most basic PvE enemies you'll face. As you shoot out their individual propellers and they lose control, they often go speeding off into a wall or the floor and explode. <em>It's actually a little funny when it happens.</em></p>
<div class="ckeditor-html5-video" data-responsive="true" style="text-align: center;">
<video controls="controls" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6897082961762342191gol1.mp4" style="height:auto; max-width:100%"></video>
</div>
<p>It's nice that the gameplay isn't just a constant firefight. You do need to be quite sneaky. ARC, and other players, will be attracted by noise. Make too much noise, ARC will come over to investigate and potentially fill you with holes. Or, another player may come sneaking up behind you to say hello. Some types of ARC will also call in backup if you don't take them out quick enough, which can end up a big problem for you.</p>
<p>So many things going on during a game too, each map is pretty dynamic. Not just through time of day and weather systems, but all the mini-events and the ARC NPCs too. Like the ARC Probes that fly down, which have some nice loot in them. It's a rush to get to them, and they're incredibly noisy and attract attention. But sometimes you might find one landing right next to you.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19643080701762264467gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19643080701762264467gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11093441762264470gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11093441762264470gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There was a time our party of three came across another player screaming at us not to shoot, turns out once they calmed down they were rather softly spoken. To thank us for not shooting, they took us on a little trip where they found some good loot. What happened next was rough though. A big rocket drone none of us spotted came to say hello, and promptly ended their run with a big boom. Oh dear.</p>
<p>My enjoyment of it is helped by the PvE and PvP being so clearly distinct. People are always players, the robots are always the ARC NPCs AI. There's no confusion there at all. You know what you're potentially getting into as soon as you see. Not that it really helps you, since anything can still happen.</p>
<p>A run we had last night was pretty epic too. There was an event going on where some top loot was at the top of a very tall tower. So everyone was fighting for it against all other groups, and against all the ARC NPCs flying around it. After a while, and some sneaking, we managed as a duo to get near the top, but came up against fire from a trio. By sheer luck, we defeated all three of them and managed to loot their bodies as well as score some really great weapons. Unfortunately for us, a couple of drones were circling outside due to all the noise and promptly ended our run by firing into the building. It was incredibly tense, and even though we didn't come out with anything it was so fun that didn't matter.</p>
<p>Also, screw this thing in particular:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10875065511762340429gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10875065511762340429gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Finishing a round by extracting is also a heart-pumping rush every single time without fail. Because you just know <em>something</em> is likely to happen. I've saved people as much as I've decided to be <em>completely evil</em>. Like the time I went to extract and saw an ARC drone hovering over a bus, shooting constantly at it. I realised someone was inside, so I took out the drone. A player came running out thanking the heck out of me over voice comms. It genuinely made me feel really good. Or the time someone else was about to extract, and I liked the look of their gun and so…well, I put a hole in the back of their head. Don't judge me, it's a tough world out there.</p>
<p>Or how about you go to extract, look around and think you're safe so you run in and tap on the computer to leave only to turn around and suddenly there's two other players just staring at you.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5791129531762263759gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5791129531762263759gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Where the hell did those two ninjas come from?</em></p>
<p>Being a PvPvE game, it's not just other players lurking around the extraction zones you need to worry about. It's also all the different ARC NPC enemies that can quite easily ruin your run. The various types of drones flying around, some with weapons that can stun you, others that will explode you and make a misery of your day. And then there's this thing that roams around…</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19172301821762264066gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19172301821762264066gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10905850881762264067gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10905850881762264067gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The leaper pictured above is an absolute menace. Quite difficult to take down due to the armour plating, but also an incredibly fun fight.</p>
<p>While it can be overly frustrating to lose everything at times, the loop is what keeps me coming back for more. Okay, so I lost everything, but if I always go in with a plan on each run - it doesn't seem so bad. Like gathering one specific resource, taking in some cheap gear and then coming back to deal with all the crafting and upgrades, to potentially do another run with some better gear.</p>
<p>The crafting system can be a bit confusing though, you don't always know what you're going to need, and their item descriptions on some items intentionally don't tell you that you might actually need them. It's all about figuring it out for yourself, or spoiling it all with a guide (not me though, I like figuring it out). At least loot is colour-coded though, so you know if something is good at least with grey being common, green being uncommon, blue being rare, purple is epic and yellow is legendary.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18594145721762342493gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18594145721762342493gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>While it's true it's an accessible game in terms of extraction shooters, there's so many parts that are just plain difficult and frustrating. So I've decided to note down a few tips for you beginner raiders to hopefully help you along the way just a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> Play entirely solo until you properly understand the game. ARC Raiders matches solo players to solo players (at least usually), and groups of 2-3 with groups. Solo play is far far easier, and usually just a much better time when you're starting off.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> Use the free loadout option, constantly. Especially early-on in the game, it's just stupid not to. When you're readying up for a game, you can pick it at the top instead of your normal loadout. This will give you a randomised set of starter equipment, which is great when you're having a breezy run through to grab a few items. Allowing you a bit more chance of survival rather than going in naked, without the <em>stress</em> of losing your good gear. And, as a bonus, when you've extracted, you can swap the beginner pack for something better at a trader completely <em>free</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1942131141762264753gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1942131141762264753gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> Don't forget your safe pocket! Did you just find something cool or valuable? Stick it straight in, and you'll keep it even if you die. However, the free loadout doesn't have a safe pocket. <em>Just don't ask where the safe pocket is, I don't want to know either.</em></p>
<p><strong>4)</strong> Adrenaline Shots are your friends. They can mean the difference between you outrunning ARC or a player and dying with all your goodies on you.</p>
<p><strong>5) </strong>Put all of your starter level up points into Stamina. Like with 4, they can be the difference between life and a frustrating end.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18001668951762341210gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18001668951762341210gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><strong>6)</strong> Holster your weapon so you run faster.</p>
<p><strong>7)</strong> Even if you're downed, you can still pull the extraction lever and exit the level.</p>
<p><strong>8)</strong> Don't run into an extraction zone as soon as it's available after calling it. Players may be watching and shoot you as you run in. Extraction zones have a 2 minute timer before they close automatically. You have time to scout for a bit.</p>
<p><strong>9) </strong>Arc Powercells can be used to power up your shield if you don't have a Shield Recharger.</p>
<p><strong>10)</strong> You can get free items via the Raider Deck, and by doing Quests. Quests especially can be worth actually going through properly.</p>
<p>Hopefully some of those little tips will help you survive a bit longer.</p>
<p>What's next for it? A lot. It's live-service so it's going to be sprinkling in content constantly and their roadmap for it has me quite excited with new events, new maps, new map conditions and lots more to come.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2189586821762262639gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2189586821762262639gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There are some things I really don't like about it though. Like the cost of the in-game purchases for a paid game, the pricing is a bit overly ridiculous in some cases. They need to bring the prices down. I'm also still feeling a bit off about their use of AI for the text-to-speech voices (used in voice barks, like pointing out items). While it's certainly a lot more ethical than a lot of generative AI use, since they actually hired actors and have their full permission, it still feels a bit weird. It leaves me conflicted because I enjoy it so much.</p>
<p>For the gameplay though, it's just amazing. So dynamic you never know what's going to happen, it truly has its hooks into me and I cannot stop playing. I don't know how things will go once I've put many tens more hours into it and perhaps even hundreds, but right now I cannot think of anything that will make me stop playing it apart from any anti-cheat woes for Linux. All will rest on how the game evolves with the updates planned and if the community sticks around to keep it alive where many other games have failed.</p>
