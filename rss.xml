      <title>SD GUNDAM BATTLE ALLIANCE works out of the box on Steam Deck and Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SD GUNDAM BATTLE ALLIANCE is a brand new release from ARTDINK and Bandai Namco Entertainment. The good news is that it works out of the box at release on Steam Deck and Linux desktop. Battle Alliance is pretty much a hack and slash, blended together with some Anime visual novel story elements in between missions. Available to play solo or online with up to 2 others.</p>
<p>Unlike a lot of releases, there's no issues with movie playback here it all just works. For the Steam Deck specifically, the only quirk I noticed was needing to manually bring up the on-screen keyboard but apart from that it worked pretty great out of the box with all the defaults.</p>
<p>Some Steam Deck footage:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="13O8jy2_TnE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/57b86d4896e13d0e055c0bfa9746abf7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/13O8jy2_TnE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I've also tested it working just fine on my Fedora Linux desktop too where it runs very well.</p>
<p>So far it seems users on Steam are pretty <em>mixed</em> on it. As a <u>huge</u> Gundam fan, I'm not entirely sure what I think of it either. SD GUNDAM BATTLE ALLIANCE is a clear fan-service game but that's not a bad thing. The developer has put in a lot of work and attention to detail in it for Gundam fans, with plenty of different mobile suits available to unlock and upgrade but it does feel a bit lacking overall — mainly the combat, which is quite a basic hack and slash. The environment art is somewhat dull for a 2022 release too.</p>
<p>That said, I'm actually enjoying it a lot, mostly because I am a big fan of the various Gundam universes and stories. Stomping around as a few of my favourite machines and blasting away others is still pretty entertaining.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/sd-gundam-battle-alliance?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/824550/SD_GUNDAM_BATTLE_ALLIANCE/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>CrossOver 22 released for running Windows apps and games on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/" target="_blank">CodeWeavers</a>, the company that works on Proton with Valve and supports Wine development, has announced the released of CrossOver 22.0.0. This is their special proprietary interface for helping users across Linux, macOS and Chrome OS work with applications and games designed for Windows on their platform of choice.</p>
<p>One of the big new things about this release is the refreshed user interface, with the last upgrade to the UI being CrossOver 15 many years ago and no redesign since CrossOver 9. They said their goal with the redesign was to make it "more intuitive to use and offer a more modern look and feel" enabling "users to find the things they need to do most often and to bring the CrossOver interface in line with our branding".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7379494741661453479gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7379494741661453479gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the other big changes to come along with the UI redesign include extensive changes to the installation process, an updated search function. What you get is a more guided install path for many applications, while also still letting you override things to your liking.</p>
<p>They also revamped the bottle view, where you actually install things. Plus there's a new Home view, which is a mash up of their old All Bottles and Favourites views.</p>
<p>CrossOver 22 includes Wine 7.7, Wine Mono 7.2.0 and vkd3d 1.4. They say you also get initial support for DirectX 12 with a "handful" of games running well along with fixes to Office 2016/365 bugs. Seems like they might be having issues with GTA Online <a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/support/forums/general/?t=27;msg=266856" target="_blank">bans</a> though, so be warned.</p>
<p>Why use CrossOver instead of something like <a href="https://usebottles.com/" target="_blank">Bottles</a>? Well, it's largely all about support. You're paying for supported software, while also directly helping Wine and Proton development because CodeWeavers sponsor Wine. CrossOver also has many paid staff working on it, with more quality assurance testing so there's that too. It comes down to what you prefer - choices are great.</p>

      <title>One Lonely Outpost gets a new trailer and a delay until 2023</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One Lonely Outpost is an upcoming sci-fi colonization life and farming sim that was crowdfunded on Kickstarter. It was due this year but it's now delayed but it seems progress is good.</p>
<p>Early Access has now been moved to March 2023 as they clearly mentioned they want to avoid "remotely giving any of you a potentially bad, or even rough game". Delays communicated properly are fine, as long as developers keep people informed (especially for crowdfunded games) there's never really a problem. In this case, the new trailer showcases a game that looks like it's quite nicely coming together that you can see below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nxxwpJ--DI0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d010ee9abd93602d7e59b6b1fd33fc22.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nxxwpJ--DI0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Planned Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Plan your colonist’s farming adventures. Will you explore? Plant? Craft? Build a close-knit community? Delve into mysterious dungeons? Or all of them at once?</li>
<li>Fill out the Omninac by experiencing life on the new planet. Categorize crops, minerals, seasons, animals, and more!</li>
<li>Terraform the desert with a trusty robotic pet. Fertilize the ground, secure water sources, and make the air breathable.</li>
<li>Farm, mine, explore, and carve out a habitat for humanity.</li>
<li>Establish a colony and develop the basics. Your loneliness will be over once colonists start coming - but where do things go from there? Well, time to make some choices.</li>
<li>Pick the Synthetic route and unleash the power of science, hybrid plants, spliced genes (turns out glowing cabbages are great night lights), and unleash productive robo-cows on the newly sprouted grassland</li>
<li>...or go the Naturalist route, carefully tending to all-natural Earth-based crops and livestock, focusing on quality over quantity. Each path has different rewards - and attracts different colonists.</li>
<li>Usher in a new dawn for humanity, building a genuine off-world utopia for your colonists.</li>
<li>Connect with the newfound community, cultivating relationships, and who knows, maybe even finding love among the pioneers?</li>
<li>And just as important as the future, delve into the past of the old world. Just what lies hidden beneath this ancient planet's surface...?</li>
</ul>

      <title>Valve testing new mobile Steam app with QR codes for sign ins</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve are now testing a new version of the Steam app for Android and iOS, which comes with a much more modern design and a QR code login system too.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/3335498663100828298" target="_blank">announcement</a> Valve say it has been rebuilt "on a new framework and modernized the design", joking that 2015 called and wanted their app back. As before you can browse the store, get Steam Guard codes and confirm trades but you also now get the brand new QR code sign in system that many other applications also offer (like Discord). So you can scan it with your phone on the web, and not have to enter a password.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10911149881661438734gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10911149881661438734gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>The new app also has smarter notifications, an improved library views and there's also now multi-account support which has become increasingly important especially with the Steam Deck now too. There's a new <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamMobileApp" target="_blank">Steam Group</a> you can join to get updates on it.</p>
<p>I would have taken some shots, but seeing as I'm now on iOS myself it's limited to 10,000 people and that filled up within seconds of the original announcements. Here's some shots from a reader on Android (click to enlarge):</p>

      <title>Steam Deck reservations continue to grow, now at its highest point</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has confirmed two tasty bits of info today for those waiting on getting a Steam Deck, and for those curious about how things are currently going.</p>
<p>While a Valve developer <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/steam-deck-production-better-than-expected-q4-emails-already-going-out/" target="_blank">teased recently</a> that production was better than expected so more people are getting their purchase emails, as of today the new reservation windows are actually up and so you might find if you were in Q4 you might <em>now</em> be in Q3. As they said on <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1562526092128587783" target="_blank">Twitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Great news! We are making more Steam Decks than ever, and have just updated shipping window estimates for reservation holders. If you were previously in the Q4 (Oct-Dec) window, take a look - you might be in Q3 now!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for how things are going?</p>
<p>Well, it's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u5uHyEF9uY" target="_blank">clearly a success</a> but how much of one? In a follow-up Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1562526092128587783" target="_blank">post</a> they gave a tiny bit of insight without revealing any numbers but it's obviously good news:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another fun stat - the number of Steam Deck reservations being made on a daily basis continues to grow, and is at its highest since our launch earlier this year!📈</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exciting times. This is great for the Steam Deck and SteamOS of course but also Linux Gaming as a whole. No surprise to see the Steam Deck has been in the top 5 of the <a href="https://steamdb.info/topsellers/" target="_blank">Weekly Global Top Sellers</a> for nearly half a year and a lot of that at number 1.</p>
<p>Hopefully at some point we will see more games with anti-cheat roll out support for Steam Deck and Proton, so all Linux gamers can benefit from it. Looking at you, Destiny 2.</p>

      <title>Boneraiser Minions is probably my next 100 hour indie obsession</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Stop me if you've heard this before, but I've discovered another game that takes elements from Vampire Survivors and makes it nicely unique again. Enter the world of Boneraiser Minions. Another really cheap indie game that's released recently at around $1.99 / £1.69 and you can get a great many hours out of this one. It works perfectly on Linux with Proton and it is Steam Deck Verified too.</p>
<p>You run around and attempt to survive and avoid attacks, while collecting up the bones from people your minions skewer. Get enough bones to level up and you can raise the dead, making a bigger army to take on those villagers, heroes and bosses too. Initially you don’t know what any of the options do when you level up, so you’re discovering all the minion types, minion upgrades and special relic power ups as you go.</p>
<p>Here's some of my footage that I recorded from Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HQxZG1XxrTM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ae899c856aade8a88984da6dc2a5f11a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HQxZG1XxrTM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I've truly been having a blast with this one. I'm always on the lookout for indie games that will keep me going for a long time, without taking too much brainpower when needing some downtime and this fits the bill perfectly.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Boneraising auto-battler action: Dash around avoiding enemies and collecting their bones to raise and upgrade minions who fight for you! Each minion type has their own fighting styles, from melee pulverisers, to bomb lobbers and magical missilers.</li>
<li>Multiple game modes: There's several game modes to keep play fresh. From the Mausoleum Awakening where you must protect your crypt against King Gigald and his forces, making best use of traps and contraptions you place before the show. There's the Endless Skirmishes where the aim is to simply see how long you can last against an ever growing horde of meanies. The Daily/Weekly Challenge were you compete against the world on an equal footing. And then there's Clashful Cards, a collectable adversarial card game, a bit of respite from the endless boneraising!</li>
<li>Relics and Spells: There's not just bones to suck on during the fight. You will find curious Relics with strange boosts and abilities, or Spell Scrolls with powerful attacks or buffs to be used at the perfect time!</li>
<li>Boneraise Lore meta: Between games use collected coins to increase your abilities and boneraising powers, such as learning to raise Enboned Giants and Possessed Deamons. Meta can also be upgraded and refunded, encouraging you to play around and find your perfect meta loadout!</li>
<li>Heroic Force meta: You must also bolster the forces against you too if you wish to survive King Gigald. Why not provoke a Beggar's Revolt, Goblin Looters, or Mercenary Cyclops, and use their bones to raise an ever greater army of dead!</li>
<li>Class Heritage meta: By stealing heroes souls you can also learn new abilities and perks for a particular class. Each class offering their own playstyles!</li>
<li>Steam Leaderboard: Battle your foes, and your friends, to reach first place on the online Steam leaderboard! Even after defeating King Gigald the crusade wars are endless, and only the greatest legion of undead ever assembled will reach the top spot!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Waves and Waves 2: Notorious are now free after developer passed away</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/107600/Waves/" target="_blank">Waves</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/217120/Waves_2_Notorious/" target="_blank">Waves 2: Notorious</a> are two rather good twin-stick shooters and sadly, the developer behind them has died after a battle with Cancer and as a dying wish has made both games free to keep for everyone.</p>
<p>Announced in a post on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/217120/discussions/0/5733664933461392610/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, their partner "CJ" mentioned how Rob Hale passed away a fortnight ago (post dated August 14th) and they wanted to make the announcement sooner but understandably that was a little difficult. As they said setting the games free was "something Rob was considering anyway within the past two months as their health entered into more substantial difficulties, so I hope this can be seen as a parting gift to all those out there that haven’t yet played either of these games".</p>
<p>I did play Waves 2: Notorious <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/waves-2-notorious-an-absolutely-mad-twin-stick-shooter-arrives-on-linux/" target="_blank">back in 2019</a> after speaking with Hale, and it was quite a joy to play through.</p>
<p>The post on Steam ends with a note: "So I hope all of you out there, whoever you are and however Rob’s games have reached you, that you can at the very least hold a special place for the Waves games, and that they continue to bring you many more hours of chill, challenge, and possibly even frustration, but most of all I hope that you can continue to feel the passion and love that Rob poured into these games long after the pain of their passing begins to fade."</p>
<p>Rest in peace, Rob Hale.</p>

      <title>Wii U emulator Cemu 2.0 out, goes open source and gets Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It has finally happened. Cemu, the Wii U emulator has a big new 2.0 release and it is now officially open source and available for Linux too.</p>
<p>For Linux, most people do need to compile it from source as there's only an Ubuntu package right now but the developer has said in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cemu/comments/wwa22c/cemu_20_announcement_linux_builds_opensource_and/" target="_blank">announcement post</a> that they're looking into AppImage and Flatpak to make it easier. While Cemu should work fine on Linux, they also mentioned there are some lingering issues mostly around the user interface. Part of the reason it was open sourced, was that the main developer had been doing it alone for quite a while and so now it's open source hopefully more people will help develop it further.</p>
<p>Main changes for Cemu 2.0 include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Major:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cemu is now open-source!</li>
<li>Preliminary Linux builds are available, but be warned that they are still very rough around the edges</li>
<li>Going forward, we simplified the versioning a bit by using shorter version numbers (2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3..)</li>
<li>Updated all dependencies. Most notably SDL (input &amp; motion) and wxWidgets (UI).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other changes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a crash in the H264 video decoder. Resolves crash on Smash title screen</li>
<li>Made nsysnet a little less crash prone. Fixes crash in Call of Duty: Black Ops II</li>
<li>Fixed a logging related crash that could occur under very specific circumstances. Seen in Wind Waker if letting the game idle on the title screen for 2 minutes.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could happen when the path to Cemu.exe contained unicode characters</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could happen when loading .elf homebrew</li>
<li>The account list in the title manager save exporter is no longer empty</li>
<li>Latency for wiimotes should be a bit better now</li>
<li>Added symbol/function list to debugger + other small debugger/assembler improvements</li>
<li>Implemented API: coreinit.FSOpenFileExAsync (used by some homebrew)</li>
<li>Many more under-the-hood changes and fixes</li>
<li>Some more work towards a Stop&amp;Restart emulation feature. Not ready yet but we are getting there</li>
</ul>

      <title>Command armies over voice comms, Radio General - Water Rats expansion out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Radio General - Water Rats is the first paid expansion for the positively rated unique strategy game, where you call the orders over your microphone.</p>
<p>If you've not played it before this is a real-time strategy game where you're like a general sat in a tent. There's no special real-time minimap here, all your info is gathered via reports that help you make decisions. However, not all info is correct and some tough decisions need to be made, all over the radio. It's genuinely quite a clever game and this new expansion gives you 7 new campaign missions (all playable in co-op!), a new Air Support unit with level-up veterancy perks (usable in non-DLC campaign missions too!), bridge construction with Engineers and over 90 new historical photos and videos.</p>
<p>You can check out some gameplay done from the developer below:</p>

<p>You can buy the game and the DLC <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1011610/Radio_General/" target="_blank">on Steam</a>. Available with Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Games publisher PQube accused of &#39;predatory practices&#39; and being manipulative (updated)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PQube, a games publisher that has over 50 games on Steam, has been accused of engaging in "predatory practices".</p>
<p>Toge Productions and Mojiken Studio, who are currently working on the slice of life adventure game A Space For The Unbound, accused PQube of some pretty shady behaviour on <a href="https://twitter.com/ASFTUgame/status/1562319004949028864" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and in an official Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1201270/view/3247679104801781500" target="_blank">news post</a>.</p>
<p>In the statement they mentioned that PQube had left them feeling "manipulated and exploited" leading to a terminated agreement. According to Toge and Mojiken, the people at PQube pulled in funding from a diversity fund that's <em>supposed</em> to help underrepresented game devs. However, instead of giving it to the developers they hid it and then used it for their own gain, including using it to negotiate an increase in their own revenue share from the developer.</p>
<p>We've heard about and seen plenty of pretty terrible publishing agreements over the years, but if this is true this is a pretty new low for a publisher to use the position of a developer for their own gain in such a way.</p>
<p><em>Have asked PQube for a statement, will update if they reply.</em></p>
<p><strong>Update: PQube sent us this statement:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have honoured all obligations of our publishing agreement and have supported Toge Productions at every stage of product development throughout their delays and difficulties.  This support has included offering significant further funding, over and above grant funding, to support development, porting and marketing.  Toge Productions have sought for some time to unilaterally enforce unreasonable revised terms to our agreement and it is disappointing that, as a result of not achieving that and despite PQube's significant efforts to accommodate this, they have sought to deal with the matter in this way.  We will respond through the appropriate channels.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA has released the latest update to their special <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" target="_blank">Vulkan Beta Driver</a>, for developers and users who want to test out the very-latest stuff. Designed mostly for developers, normal every-day users should probably just stick to the regular driver</p>
<p>Here's what's added / changed in version 515.49.14:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New:
	<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_attachment_feedback_loop_layout.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_attachment_feedback_loop_layout</a></li>
<li>Added support for chaining VkShaderModuleCreateInfo when creating compute and ray tracing pipelines</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixes:
	<ul>
<li>Don't read pipeline state when it's not valid for the pipeline library stage</li>
<li>Fixed issue clearing 3D depth images where the end slice(s) weren't cleared completely</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Vulkan applications would crash when running under Wayland</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>open-gpu-kernel-modules release:
	<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/releases/tag/515.49.14" target="_blank">https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/releases/tag/515.49.14</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>VK_EXT_attachment_feedback_loop_layout is a new extension worked on by people from Valve, Collabora, Google, Igalia, Samsung and Arm. As the official spec reads:</p>
<p>"This extension adds a new image layout, VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_ATTACHMENT_FEEDBACK_LOOP_OPTIMAL_EXT, which allows applications to have an image layout in which they are able to both render to and sample/fetch from the same subresource of an image in a given render pass."</p>

      <title>Hearts of Iron IV - By Blood Alone set to release on September 27th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After being announced back in June, we now actually have a release date for the latest Hearts of Iron IV expansion from Paradox with By Blood Alone coming on September 27th. By Blood Alone centers the political and military fortunes of Italy. The historical path, as always, is open to those who want to relive the dramatic years before and during the war. Alternatively, players can engineer the end of Mussolini's rule through a socialist revolution or a strong monarchy.</p>
<p>Just like other Paradox games and as usual for HoI, a free update for all players will be live at the same time.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="KzPi2mGjP4M"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4ec5e6c941d0d015703f9c862ba35826.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/KzPi2mGjP4M" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New Italian Focus Tree: Follow the historical path of Mussolini's Italy or rewrite history by restoring power to the monarchy, leading a Communist revolution or replacing Mussolini with one of a variety of new contenders.</li>
<li>New Ethiopian Focus Tree: Defy the odds to defeat the Italian invader or resist the conqueror from abroad using unique Government in Exile abilities.</li>

      <title>Total War: WARHAMMER III 2.0 out with Immortal Empires, Linux update &#39;as soon as possible&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Creative Assembly and SEGA have announced the massive Total War: WARHAMMER III 2.0 patch which comes along with a Beta version of Immortal Empires. <u>ICYMI</u>: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/total-war-warhammer-iii-cautiously-builds-upon-a-tried-and-true-formula/" target="_blank">check out our previous review from BTRE</a>.</p>
<p>The Immortal Empires Beta is a new grand-scale campaign mode for Total War: WARHAMMER III. If you own all three games in the series, it's free. It brings together the Legendary Lords, gameplay mechanics, war units and much more from across the trilogy into one colossal mode.</p>
<p>"Immortal Empires represents the world-encompassing vision we've been aiming towards since we first partnered with Games Workshop, and it's great to see that become a reality". Said DLC Director, Richard Aldridge. "It's the most ambitious game mode we've ever worked on and will usher in years of post-release content for Total War: WARHAMMER III".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bG9N3xvTQl0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/15a136ce065020380e8375e8329e0c9e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bG9N3xvTQl0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You will also find the Champions of Chaos launch today as well that contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Four New Warriors of Chaos Legendary Lords: The Champions of Chaos have risen through the ranks thanks to their infamous deeds to become the favoured of the four Dark Gods, they are; Valkia the Bloody, the deadly but daemonic consort of Khorne. Festus the Leechlord, the deranged plague-doctor of Nurgle. Azazel, Prince of Damnation, the ecstatic heir of Slaanesh. Vilitch the Curseling, the conjoined sorcerer-twin of Tzeentch.  </li>
<li>A New Campaign Experience: In the ancient arena-city of Zanbaijin, the servants of the Chaos gods have clashed for millennia and the souls of those who fall in battle are sealed within the Altar of Battle. As a Champion of Chaos, you must earn the gaze of your master through bloodshed and ritual before taking the arcane power as your own. From there, the true test awaits.</li>
<li>Over Fifty New Units: Charging into bloodthirsty combat alongside their Champions is diverse host of battlefield units, including the Warshrine of Chaos which bestows terrible gifts upon those who make the appropriate sacrifice, Chaos Knights who ride as a wall of blades and spiked armor to crash through the enemy ranks in an explosion of torn flesh, and the Chosen, an ironclad group of elite slaughterers who form the inner circle of their lord's warband.</li>
</ul>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JCRTUdarkuM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e3919524f3913eb0e08d8fbec89a702e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JCRTUdarkuM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For those of you sticking with the Native Linux version port done by Feral Interactive, I spoke with them today about when to expect all this in the port and they said this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All of the Update 2.0 content, including the Immortal Empires beta and the Champions of Chaos and Blood for the Blood God III DLCs, will be made available on Linux as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Please bear in mind that this update brings a huge amount of new content and significant code changes, all of which need to be incorporated into and tested in the Linux version before release.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also not to be missed is the new Blood for the Blood God III DLC, a very gory effects-pack, that's free if you picked up the pack for the previous two games. It adds in blood spurts, limb and head dismemberment, blood-drenched UI elements, global campaign events that generate greater carnage in battle, and much more.</p>
<p>You can grab Total War: Warhammer III on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/total-war-warhammer-iii?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142710/Total_War_WARHAMMER_III/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>ProtonUp-Qt for easy GE-Proton installs on Linux and Steam Deck v2.7.0 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/DavidoTek/ProtonUp-Qt" target="_blank">ProtonUp-Qt</a> is a simple and great way to manage the likes of GE-Proton (previously known as Proton GE), the Luxtorpeda compatibility tool for Native Linux game engines and more.</p>
<p><em>For those confused on the GE-Proton naming: it switched from being Proton-GE to GE-Proton <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton7-1" target="_blank">back in February</a>, although it seems a lot of people still just call it Proton-GE. Confused? I know I am.</em></p>
<p>Anyway, ProtonUp-Qt is the "easy mode" to install GE and other compatibility layers on Linux and Steam Deck as it gives you a nice UI to work with and you just click a few buttons. New in ProtonUp-Qt v2.7.0:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added DXVK Nightly builds</li>
<li>Added button to install Proton-GE and Boxtron for Steam Flatpak directly from Flathub</li>
<li>Added <a href="https://github.com/Frogging-Family/wine-tkg-git/releases/tag/7.x%2B" target="_blank">Proton-Tkg CI builds</a></li>
<li>Fix bug where download would crash with error message 'no space left' <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/DavidoTek/ProtonUp-Qt/issues/87" target="_blank">#87</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's how it looks:</p>

      <title>Steam Deck production better than expected, Q4 emails already going out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has confirmed that production of the Steam Deck has gone better than expected, and so even more (yes again) people will be seeing their emails to purchase one.</p>
<p>This has happened multiple times recently, so things are going very well over at Valve. Back at the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/valve-speeds-up-steam-deck-production-some-more-all-existing-reservations-this-year/" target="_blank">end of July</a> Valve announced they had sorted issues with their supply chain, then in the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/even-more-steam-deck-purchase-invites-are-going-out-from-now/" target="_blank">middle of August</a> they also announced the number of emails going out was increasing.</p>
<p>Now we're back again because developer Lawrence Yang mentioned on <a href="https://twitter.com/lawrenceyang/status/1561835173800321024" target="_blank">Twitter</a> yesterday:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi all, a few of you may have received an order email for your “Q4 window” Steam Deck reservation today. This wasn’t a mistake! Production has outperformed our estimates, and we’ll be moving more Q4 folks into the Q3 window.</p>
<p>Official announcement and info coming soon. 🎉</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No other announcement has arrived yet, so likely an official Steam news post coming later this week. As a reminder, emails to purchase a Steam Deck go out every Monday and Thursday. <strong>Update</strong>: Yang also <a href="https://twitter.com/lawrenceyang/status/1562079471825350656" target="_blank">clarified</a> on Twitter the reservation dates haven't been updated just yet.</p>

      <title>Cities: Skylines is getting another expansion with Plazas and Promenades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Plazas and Promenades is the next expansion for the city-builder Cities: Skylines, giving you the option to build up some special pedestrian zones. Build up your dream on-foot experience with it, apparently. Goodbye noise and air pollution huh?</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="d0Q8RN9ut4s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9a5a4b6c49e49bfb2e7a454f45e16afe.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/d0Q8RN9ut4s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Main DLC features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pedestrian Streets: </strong>let your citizens walk freely on pedestrian-only streets! Place them in your city like any other road and create new green city centers free of most vehicles and pollution.</li>
<li><strong>Pedestrian Zones and New Policies: </strong>activate three zone-specific policies for your city including Slow Driving: all roads in the pedestrian zone, except highways, get a speed limit of 20 miles/hour. Sugar Ban: increases the average lifespan of citizens in the pedestrian zone but decreases their happiness. Street Music: increases happiness and noise pollution in pedestrian commercial zones.</li>
<li><strong>District Specialization: </strong>we added 3 new district specializations: offices, high-density residential areas, and high-density commercial zones. Setting a specialization on a district affects all zoned squares in that district that will spawn buildings with a different visual appearance and a gameplay effect. Each specialization features 24 new modern wall-to-wall buildings!</li>
<li><strong>City Service Buildings: </strong>service buildings are important, but how about awesome-looking service buildings? Connect them to pedestrian zones by matching their visual style and provide services that contribute to good happiness values.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There will also be two content creator packs and two radio stations released at the same time. No exact date has been shared yet as far as I can see but they did say at release the main DLC will cost 14.99 USD / 12.99 GBP / 14.99 EUR.</p>
<p>You can pick up Cities: Skylines from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/cities-skylines?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/255710/Cities_Skylines/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Mask of the Rose from Failbetter Games delayed until April 2023</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Failbetter Games put a new <a href="https://www.failbettergames.com/news/production-update-and-ui-revamp" target="_blank">production update</a> post up recently for Mask of the Rose that went over the user interface, but they also announced a delay. What is Mask of the Rose? A visual novel dating sim all about mystery, set in the wonderfully weird gothic world of Fallen London. For players of Sunless Sea and Sunless Skies, it gives you a new way to experience the universe,</p>
<p>Originally due towards the end of this year, they said in the post how they've seen signs of "an over-tight schedule: mounting stress levels, team members becoming reluctant to take time off". Instead of getting people to do overtime, cut features and other such ideas they decided to just delay the game instead.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_Vzt2XceW-c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f17eb5cabf22ce48f415e3a305d5beb1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_Vzt2XceW-c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Seems sane enough to me. Given how great their previous games were, it would be nice to have another quality game from them as their writing and world-building is always awesome.</p>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>(Re)invent yourself: who were you before the Fall? Who will you be now?</li>
<li>Create outfits from a selection of clothing and unusual accessories to unlock different story options</li>
<li>Fall in love with a cast of diverse Londoners, each with their own secrets</li>
<li>Matchmake among your friends, or seek love for yourself (by any definition you like)</li>
<li>Write love stories in a delightful minigame, and use them to impress the new Masters</li>
<li>Pick up odd jobs to earn money and gather resources. How are you at rat catching?</li>
<li>Solve the first murder since the Fall, with the assistance of the victim</li>
<li>Discover cosy, mysterious and magnificent locations in a dark and delicious version of Victorian London</li>
<li>Seek deeper and deeper secrets over multiple playthroughs</li>
</ul>

      <title>Humble Store has a big Summer Sale live, lots on offer for Steam Deck &amp; Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's the beginning of a fresh week so maybe you want some new games? Well, Humble Store has a huge amount discounted in their new <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/promo/summer-sale-2022/?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Summer Sale</a> that lasts until September 6th.</p>
<p>Going over their offers, it can obviously be pretty daunting on what to pick up so here's a few suggestions and quick-links to get more.

      <title>Survival city-building game Synergy certainly looks different</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A city-builder not quite like the others it seems. Synergy from Leikir Studio and Goblinz Publishing has a pretty great pastel colour style to it. This is a survival game too, not just a standard city-builder. One I apparently missed that was announced during the PC Gaming Show.</p>
<p>"Humans live on a hostile planet. To ensure their survival, they must learn to survive in extreme weather conditions and in an environment that is not conducive to their development. Careful and pragmatic management of resources has become essential to the survival of human race, as has the morale of the population."</p>
<p>You can see the original reveal trailer below:</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Manage weather, seasons, extreme conditions and natural disasters.</li>
<li>Build a city with the happiness of its inhabitants as its main goal.</li>
<li>Explore and analyze their world in order to adapt the evolution of their city.</li>
<li>Respect the physical and mental needs of the inhabitants.</li>
<li>Live in harmony with fauna and flora.</li>
<li>Make short or long-term choices.</li>
<li>Play different scenarios to enjoy various experiences.</li>
<li>Sandbox mode: experiment with different combinations by yourself.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>No word on an actual release date yet but it should be coming with Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Roller skates, guns and slick tricks — Rollerdrome is awesome</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rollerdrome is a thoroughly odd blending of mechanics and style found in the likes of Tony Hawk Pro Skater, a little Jet Set Radio and Max Payne. This is easily one of my biggest surprises so far this year. Runs great on Linux with Proton and Steam Deck Playable.</p>
<p>Note: key provided by the publisher Private Division.</p>
<p>A game all about style, with combat thrown in. There's no filler here and no crazy unlock systems. Just you, some skates and some guns. This is a single-player third person shooter that has you skate around, take down enemies and do some pretty cool tricks to get your ammo back up. I've been pretty amazed at how ridiculously fluid the skating is in this game and yet somehow it's also a pretty good shooter too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vwwK7gmxQ-8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/10dd9b70e685d0faa5527ebcd83412f9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vwwK7gmxQ-8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's plenty to love about this game. While it's fast-paced it gives you plenty of wiggle room to be rubbish. Not only does it have an element of auto-aim so you don't need pin-point accuracy but there's also a Max Payne style bullet-time to make it that much easier on you. It will still make your fingers and thumbs ache though but it's a whole lot of fun. The point isn't just the shooting though, it's about looking ridiculously cool while doing it and that's largely the focus of it. Perfecting dodging, shooting while grinding, grinding along a wall, spinning in the air while taking out a sniper — it wants you to look awesome.</p>
<p>It is a sport after all, the whole idea of the setting in Rollerdrome is that this is a blood sport in a world where corporations rule and they keep the masses distracted with ridiculous things like this. Sounds almost like real-life.</p>
<p>Another point to like about it is that each mission has various challenges for completionists and high-score chasers. However, even that was done to a point where it's accessible and not overly difficult. You can re-run levels any time you want and completing a challenge doesn't need you to actually win the level again. You can jump into a level, complete a challenge in thirty seconds and die and it keeps that you've done it. I really like this. Something extra to work towards without being annoying about it. Makes me want to come back for more and not need to put it down and take a frustration break.</p>
<p>That's only briefly touching on the gameplay feel. The rest of it is brilliant too from the musical score to the art style. The soundtrack is suitable dystopian sounding like it's out of a futuristic movie and the art is stylized without looking cheap, it all comes together very nicely.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A third person action shooter like no other – an original hybrid shooter-skater that blends high octane, visceral combat with fluid movement and tricking mechanics into one complementary and challenging whole.</li>
<li>A test of skill – Take on a unique challenge throughout the Rollerdrome tournament. Establish your dominance in the field with online leaderboards and push yourself to the limit with the unlockable "Out For Blood" mode for the most extreme test of skill and agility.</li>
<li>An original identity – An all-new fully original soundtrack that merges iconic era sounds and tones with cutting edge production to provide a heart-thumping backdrop to the carnage, brought to life with a unique comic-book inspired art style.</li>
<li>A dark conspiracy – Discover a mysterious, sinister plot in this distinct retrofuture universe.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Tactical battler Tyrant&#39;s Blessing is out now with Linux support and Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Did you enjoy Into the Breach and other similar small-scale strategy games? Tactical battler Tyrant's Blessing has released along with Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified. Swapping out mechs for fantasy, Tyrant's Blessing has a really sweet style to it that instantly draws your attention.</p>
<p>Tyrant's Blessing is a tactical turn-based game where your ability to plan, adapt, and strategize is more important than min-maxing your units or finding the sharpest sword in the hoard. Select battles every day, make challenging choices, and cleverly use the strengths of these rag-tag insurgents to defeat the undead hordes and maybe - just maybe - bring real life back to Tyberia.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="p0dKsW5BpbI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2902263c629d02b2c5bf8d1542f593c8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/p0dKsW5BpbI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>TURN-BASED TACTICAL PLAY - Satisfying turn-based tactical play on small maps – every decision counts!</li>
<li>DIFFERENT BIOMES - Multiple different biomes –desert, forest, frozen wilderness and more– with their own obstacles and hazards</li>
<li>20 UNLOCKABLE HEROES - Start your journey with any of 20 unlockable heroes.</li>
<li>NOTHING IS LEFT TO CHANCE - In a system inspired by Into the Breach, your enemy’s next move is always displayed in advance.</li>
<li>DARK BLESSING - Any living unit who falls in battle becomes a conscript of the Dead Army, including your own heroes!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Funded thanks to people on Kickstarter, it's nice to see another game hit all the goals.</p>
<p>While it's always going to be hard for a game to reach the heights of something like Into the Breach, which really is amazing, I think that Tyrant's Blessing has done an impressive job. It looks fantastic. Seriously, the pixel-art that went into this is just gorgeous.</p>
<p>Much like Into the Breach, where you position your people is absolutely the most important thing. Not only are you often protecting map items but your heroes all have their own unique attack angle so they need to be in the right place. Not only is your positioning important to take enemies down, but you also need to think about what you do after you take them down, as enemies can be resurrected which adds another layer to the tactical battles.</p>
<p>I've been really enjoying this one and I think you will too.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/tyrants-blessing?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1520760/Tyrants_Blessing/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Roadwarden is going to be a unique text adventure worth your time</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Roadwarden is an illustrated text adventure that I've played the demo of a few times through its development, and it's finally getting a release. The developer has announced it release with Native Linux support on September 8.</p>
<p>I'm not usually much of a fan of text adventures, they're often a bit too retro for my tastes. Roadwarden looks and feels different though. The style, setting and writing of it is great and so is the way you progress through it. Blending together elements of high fantasy and medieval adventure and is punctuated by a distinct isometric pixel art style. Combining mechanics borrowed from RPGs, visual novels, and interactive fiction, Roadwarden tells the tale of an explorer hired by a powerful merchant guild, tasked with journeying to a mysterious peninsula to spread the guild’s influence. With over 40 hours of gameplay, dialogue choices that branch into hundreds of thousands of text lines, and progressively upgradable character abilities, Roadwarden is pretty unique.</p>

<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explore &amp; Change the World: </strong>Discover the secrets and face the challenges of a hostile fantasy world — inevitably unveiling its uniquely sinister history</li>
<li><strong>Grow With the Challenge: </strong>Create your own background story, personal abilities, beliefs, and personality to shape your very own future as a Roadwarden.</li>
<li><strong>Classical RPG Attitude: </strong>Prepare yourself for an epic journey, either as a warrior, mage or scholar, and define your character‘s traits; like friendly, playful or intimidating, during interactions with various NPCs</li>
<li><strong>Mysteries Unfold: </strong>Use your savvy and wiles when investigating and drawing your conclusions to understand the true nature of this world. Immerse yourself in detailed dialogues and sidequests with dozens of NPCs to gain their trust and support.</li>

      <title>YouTube thought my Steam Deck video was &#39;harmful and dangerous&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here is your daily dose of what the heck? YouTube and the mighty algorithm decided for no apparent reason, that my Steam Deck video was "harmful and dangerous".</p>
<p>Over the last few months the GamingOnLinux YouTube channel has managed to gain around <em>triple</em> the amount of followers it once had. This is mainly due to the Steam Deck, and my decision to cover updates to it both in articles and in short concise videos (and people seem to really like the format).</p>
<p>According to YouTube though, this video was just a step too far:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="tH0fZKI4u5w"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/72c017a83ddcc7a225e6c7f9d2c383ea.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/tH0fZKI4u5w" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>An email lands in my inbox from YouTube, noting it was removed for violations against their "harmful and dangerous policy". That's right, the Steam Deck is a dangerous weapon and we should all need to carry around a license or something? Perhaps having <a href="https://twitter.com/gamingonlinux/status/1555202872765210625" target="_blank">two of them</a> and dual-wielding is just too much for YouTube.</p>
<p>Thankfully, after going through the appeals process, the video was restored.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="G-OBSvipeB8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/103aa4075dd1348a742935ae2871e8ab.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/G-OBSvipeB8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's another reminder that moderation bots are stupid and having all your eggs in one basket is not a great idea either.</p>

      <title>Witchtastic gets Steam Deck Verified after the dev made improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As time goes on, more developers are tweaking their games to improve the Steam Deck experience and Witchtastic looks like a fun co-op game to try out. What is it? Witchtastic is a 2-4 player co-op game about brewing and delivering magic potions as fast as possible. In a number of ways, the franticness and design is a lot like the Overcooked series.</p>
<p>Recently the developer published a patch that they said ensured all elements properly fit on the smaller screen, and they also adjusted the text sizes to be big enough to be clear — an issue far too many other games still haven't sorted. Thanks to their adjustments, it's also now Steam Deck Verified!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="IKRT7LnMV4Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1d2f738e3f8b667420733d57d60fab21.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/IKRT7LnMV4Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

Witchtastic supports couch coop, true online multiplayer and Steam Remote Play Together! Need a break from all the yelling of your friends? You can practice in a single player campaign as well!</li>

      <title>Dead Cells price hike in Argentina &amp; Turkey due to cross-region purchases</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Motion Twin / Evil Empire have announced that Dead Cells is increasing in price in Argentina &amp; Turkey, as it seems too many people were taking advantage of the cheaper prices from other countries.</p>
<p>This is an issue that we've seen come up before, with people working around Steam's regional pricing to access lower prices elsewhere.</p>
<p>Writing in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/588650/view/3346757662555863561" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam, the developers noted how these two countries have made up a "significant" amount of their sales over the last year but this has not come with an increase in the amount of players there. Usually, developers can see that the percentage of sales in a country matches up to the player count in that country but in this case for Argentina &amp; Turkey "their % of total sales is 3-4x the amount of the % of their total players".</p>
<p>The developer thinks that "it is extremely likely that people are changing their region to take advantage of a 70-90% reduction in price". Dead Cells is not exactly an expensive game when you look at what's available on Steam, something they touch on in the post, and it is regularly discounted too so they say "this is impacting us so heavily".</p>
<p>A sad day for people buying it legitimately in Argentina &amp; Turkey, and another issue smaller developers have to deal with.</p>
<p>What do you think to this issue? Let us know in the comments.</p>

      <title>Capes is a gritty superpowered turn-based strategy RPG from ex-Hand of Fate devs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love your superhero stuff? Keep an eye on Capes, an upcoming turn-based strategy RPG full of people with superpowers. It's being developed by Spitfire Interactive, who have risen from the ashes of Defiant Development who created the Hand of Fate series.</p>
<p>Capes is set in a world where the villains won, brutally. Two decades later, a new generation of heroes are rising up and that's where you come in. You and your little band of heroes will be going out in tactical turn-base battles rescuing people, and it all seems a little XCOM or perhaps even like the upcoming Marvel's Midnight Suns.</p>
<p>"Combine superpowers to create iconic strategies worthy of their own comic book panel, like slinging a spiky-crystal-covered powerhouse head-first into a villain’s chest. Character diversity is at the forefront of Capes throughout its modern take on classic comic tropes. Not just in powers, but in the heroes themselves to showcase a variety of ethnicities, genders, hopes, and dreams. The future is in the hands of the nascent youth as they work together to fight against the overwhelming odds of the generation before them."</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recruit new heroes, train them up, and save the city.</li>
<li>Fight across scores of different locations in turn based combat scenarios.</li>
<li>Team up with your allies to unlock unique abilities.</li>
<li>Stand against a variety of superpowered enemies.</li>
<li>Uncover the secret histories behind the heroes and villains of the piece.</li>
<li>Take your place amongst the champions in this high octane superhero drama.</li>
</ul>
<p>"I started my career writing on <em>Freedom Force</em> alongside Ken Levine, so this feels like a return to where my journey began," said Morgan Jaffit, Director of Spitfire Interactive. “My team and I want to explore the ‘darker side of every coin’ and we have the best people possible to do it.”</p>
<p>Capes arrives sometime in Q1 2023 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2081080/Capes/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Covert Critter is basically Metal Gear Solid with lizards</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sneaking out at some point, Covert Critter is an upcoming stealth action game that will have Native Linux support. It's also pretty much Metal Gear Solid with animals. No really, it looks exactly like the classic and is obviously something of a homage to it and a demo is available.</p>
<p>"You are special reptile operative Koss. With a unique array of gadgets and stealth-based abilities at your disposal, you must infiltrate the compromised GEKO Facility to disarm a slew of tyrannical terrorists known only as the Red Hawks.</p>
<p>Covert Critter is a top-down sneaking game and retro throwback to stealth titles of the mid to late 90's. As Koss, your goal is to navigate through each of the 10 unique stages, all while remaining silent and out of the enemy's sight. The Red Hawks are vigilant creatures, armed to the beak, and around every corner of the facility."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5394040311660836978gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5394040311660836978gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<ul>
<li>An engaging story of heroism, espionage, and animals. Deriving inspiration from action and spy flicks of a bygone era, Covert Critter will host short but memorable cutscenes to carry a narrative along as you complete each scenario.</li>
<li>An impressive arsenal of bitchin' gadgets. Deployable boomboxes, mystery gift boxes, recon drones, and more are scattered throughout the stages. Each one you find is an invaluable asset for any situation while in the field.</li>
<li>Put your best stealth and evasion skills to the test. Your application of speed, luck, and wits are all graded for a combined rank. Circumvent traps, remain swift, avoid enemy contact, and you may just be rewarded something for future scenarios.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the full version of the game they plan to add in controller support, an expanded story, accessibility options and more. The full game release is planned for next year, with an updated demo appearing at some point.</p>
<p>Just couldn't resist giving this one a quick go. Note that the Linux demo worked fine on my desktop, but on Steam Deck the UI did not render correctly. Could be a problem in Unity or a bug in the AMD GPU driver on Steam Deck so there you have to use the Windows version with Proton. Here's some footage from the demo:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FMWxMAd_NJQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ee01b5d0807aa7bda31439862a7bc992.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FMWxMAd_NJQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can follow it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2111370/Covert_Critter/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and try an older demo on <a href="https://sodaraptor.itch.io/covert-critter" target="_blank">itch.io</a>.</p>

      <title>Embracer Group to swallow up Tripwire, Tuxedo Labs, The Lord of the Rings</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Embracer Group are quite terrifying. The amount of power they have in the gaming industry is simply insane and now they're swallowing up more studios and even the full rights to The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit.</p>
<p>Announced across multiple <a href="https://embracer.com/investors/press-releases/" target="_blank">press releases</a> today they've put out their intention to acquire:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limited Run Games - who make physical releases for collectors. This deal will also include something called "Carbon Engine", which is a tech they developed "that allows legacy content and retro games to be effortlessly put out in highly accurate, emulation-based ports for modern platforms".</li>
<li>Singtrix - an award-winning creator of industry leading vocal processing effects technology for karaoke, gaming, and entertainment.</li>
<li>Middle-earth Enterprises - so they will own the full worldwide rights to The Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Hobbit and other Middle-earth-related works across motion pictures, video games, board games, merchandising, theme parks and stage productions. So they won't own the actual literary works, just the IP rights to do basically anything with them.</li>
<li>Tuxedo Labs - they made the pretty awesome game Teardown.</li>
<li>Tripwire Interactive - developed the Killing Floor and Rising Storm games.</li>
</ul>
<p>How long before Embracer Group buy up the rest of the internet? I'm expecting a knock on the door soon, kidding of course.</p>

      <title>SteamOS 3.4 Beta to update the Arch Linux base, new Steam Deck updates out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has announced three things recently including multiple updates that are out now for the Steam Deck, plus a quick tease of what's to come for a Beta of SteamOS 3.4.</p>
<p>Firstly, a new SteamOS update is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3376031059788513870" target="_blank">out now</a> in the Stable and Beta channels that pulls these changes over from Preview:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Temporarily reverted RDR2 VRAM workaround to pre-3.3 behavior</li>
<li>Fixed an issue causing random 0.2s stutter</li>
<li>Fixed an issue causing performance drops when a UI element appeared on screen if the performance HUD was enabled.</li>
<li>Improved performance for Forza Horizon 5</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's also a Steam Deck Client Beta update <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3376031059787746651" target="_blank">out now</a> for those in the Beta and Preview update channels with these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="bbcodes_Header3_KePJs BB_Header3 eventbbcodeparser_Header3_AX80F"><strong>Steam Input</strong></div>
<ul>
<li>Allow users to remove community layouts that they've created. Users who have this config selected won't lose it, but it will no longer be listed in the community layouts.</li>
<li>Removed a check which would only show your layouts in your personal layouts, even when shared with the community - this was causing users to think their configuration has not been exported.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug on saving configurations where the controller type could attempt to use a cached valued which was incorrect, causing the layout controller type to appear to be incorrect.</li>
<li>Changed the OSK chord to be on button release instead of press to resolve some issues with focus on the desktop window.</li>
<li>Added Shared Layout preview of layouts which shows a layout and allows it to be optionally assigned. If the user clicks on a steam url link to a config (via chat for example) while in Game Mode, this will be shown.</li>
<li>Added support for Nintendo Joy-Cons</li>
<li>Improved FlickStick mode</li>
</ul>
<div class="bbcodes_Header3_KePJs BB_Header3 eventbbcodeparser_Header3_AX80F"><strong>Other</strong></div>
<ul>
<li>Added Discovery Queue to Home screen under the Recommended tab</li>
<li>No longer showing a Steam Cloud sync error notification when installing a game</li>
<li>Fixed issue where a 2.9GB read-only library is displayed when the microSD card is unmounted manually</li>
<li>Added game resolution setting to non-Steam app properties</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>On top of that and perhaps even more exciting, is that a Beta version of SteamOS 3.4 is on the way. Confirmed on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1560015983317696514" target="_blank">Twitter</a> by Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais, who mentioned it's being worked on right now and it will "contain an update to the Arch base". SteamOS basically uses a snapshot of Arch Linux, along with tweaks and changes that Valve do, so with SteamOS 3.4 we're likely to see an updated Linux kernel, updated KDE Plasma for desktop mode and a whole lot more updated software.</p>

      <title>Spellbook Demonslayers is the most insane Vampire Survivors-like yet</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You've put 100+ hours into Vampire Survivors and now what? Spellbook Demonslayers is what and there's a free prologue available for you to try out.</p>
<p>For those confused who haven't played anything like it: it's pretty much a reverse bullet-hell with <em>you</em> firing off tons of abilities automatically against tons of waves of enemies. You pick up gems from fallen enemies to level up and pick new skills and upgrades. Boss enemies also drop chests, which you can pick up for ability upgrades too.</p>
<p>It's been creeping up the popular list on Steam, since it's free and Vampire Survivors and anything like it is the current hot indie trend. Easy to see why they're popular though, since half the time you can turn off your brain and all games like it cost next to nothing. Spellbook Demonslayers mixes things up with some wonderful metal tunes, some really great enemy design that feels a lot more alive than others I've played and plenty of meta-progression too.</p>
<p>Here's my footage:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yz4dZTKcYEY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ee12cbe3e34aa30c9910ee1bed1b13c8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yz4dZTKcYEY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With the full release the developer has plans to have many more characters, maps, difficulty options, enemies, bosses, a bigger permanent upgrade system and the list goes on.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2070390/Spellbook_Demonslayers_Prologue/" target="_blank">free prologue on Steam</a>. Works out of the box on Linux and Steam Deck with Proton.</p>

      <title>Blossom Tales 2: The Minotaur Prince out with Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Blossom Tales 2: The Minotaur Prince is a new Native Linux release from Castle Pixel and Playtonic Friends. It hasn't been Steam Deck Verified yet but works great. This is yet another title that developer <a href="https://twitter.com/flibitijibibo" target="_blank">Ethan Lee</a> helped to bring to Linux (like the recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/axiom-verge-2-lands-on-steam-with-linux-support-and-steam-deck-verified/" target="_blank">Axiom Verge 2</a>), with it powered by <a href="https://fna-xna.github.io/" target="_blank">FNA</a> so you can expect a quality port.</p>
<p>A classic and very colourful action-adventure, following on from the 2017 indie hit. However, you don't need to know anything from the first game as it's fully standalone and set hundreds of years later.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="gCYDZ9FhQUY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2a40819319b468d33dfd37896d927b1d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/gCYDZ9FhQUY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Minotaur King has returned...and it's all your fault! Lily's back for a new "classic" action-adventure set hundreds of years after The Sleeping King!</p>
<p>Grandpa's latest tale takes you on a journey through haunted forests, pirate shores, and other mysterious lands across a vast open-world! Charming towns, terrible enemies, tricky puzzles, and powerful weapons await you.</p>
<p>Enjoy a "story within a story" as Grandpa narrates exciting moments throughout Lily's incredible adventure.<br/>
Will you help Lily defeat the Minotaur King and save her brother?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Compelling main story plus engaging side-quests</li>
<li>Classic top-down action-adventure in a retro 2d environment</li>
<li>Dozens of mini-dungeons, caves, and locations to discover</li>
<li>Choices that influence story and events</li>
<li>A wide array of weapons and abilities</li>
<li>15+ hours of gameplay</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The game works great on Steam Deck and will no doubt get a Verified rating whenever Valve get to it. Here's some footage from my Steam Deck:</p>

      <title>Fun games for Steam Deck that won&#39;t break the bank</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Looking for some games to play on Steam Deck that are good, work well and don't cost too much? Here's a few choice picks from me to you.</p>
<p>While there's a number of game lists and videos from various websites and creators, a lot only seem to focus on the top "best" games. Usually, they're made up of the latest AA / AAA. As always, I like to be different. So going over my Steam library and picking out some absolute gems, here's some suggestions with a nice varied mix. All tested directly by me.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="--VmLCYSD_0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/56c0ce8462fdc2dbd8e70a46cb5bd014.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/--VmLCYSD_0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The games mentioned and shown are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/881100/Noita/" target="_blank">Noita </a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/736260/Baba_Is_You/" target="_blank">Baba Is You</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/548430/Deep_Rock_Galactic/" target="_blank">Deep Rock Galactic</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/656350/UnderMine/" target="_blank">UnderMine </a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/302710/BlazeRush/" target="_blank">Blaze Rush</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/384590/Polychromatic/" target="_blank">Polychromatic </a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/29180/Osmos/" target="_blank">Osmos</a> (no controller support but works fine)</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll be repeatedly going over my own Steam library to pick out various games both new and old for you to check out. What games have you found to be reasonably cheap and perhaps a little unknown that work great?</p>

      <title>Airships: Conquer the Skies gets co-op and direct ship control</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Airships: Conquer the Skies is a wonderful Native Linux indie game about constructing various vehicles and conquering everything you can with them.</p>
<p>This isn't a simplistic game of just snapping blocks together either. There's a big array of different modules, weapons, armour types, equipment and more to build your perfect craft. Plenty of detail in them too with sailors you see running around doing their little tasks. Honestly it's great.</p>
<p>With the new update out you can now play in co-op with any number of players and / or AIs on each side, with custom multiplayer battles as well. The game also is no longer 100% pure destruction, with a diplomacy system in so you can form all sorts of deals with others. Even the civilization side of it is now has more depth to it with city upgrades and new buildings. One feature that also wasn't known about before is a way to now directly control craft, which sounds pretty fun.</p>
<p>Showing off the new direct control feature, the developer put up a little video on it as it was a secret:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="r94P1LZ8fYI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a85b90eb260792d22cd61a863f654f84.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/r94P1LZ8fYI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A bunch of other features were also added in this update including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Eight new music tracks by renowned musician Curtis Schweitzer.</li>
<li>Unrest and supply mechanics.</li>
<li>Revamped espionage system.</li>
<li>Optional combat autoresolve.</li>
<li>Prettier map.</li>
<li>New fleet designs contributed by the community.</li>
<li>Reactive hint system for conquest.</li>
<li>Many more achievements.</li>
<li>Updated user interface appearance.</li>
<li>Ability to request siege assistance from your allies.</li>
<li>New weather and landscape including deserts.</li>
<li>New technologies and modules.</li>
<li>All translations should be up to date, for once.</li>
<li>In-game manual (English only).</li>
<li>Local defense budgets.</li>
<li>New heraldic charges and abilities.</li>
<li>Tooltip values now describe what influences them.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The dev mentioned this update concludes development of the game, as they move over to bug fixes. However, sounds like a DLC expansion is likely to come to expand it.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck gets a Stable Client update with Offline Mode fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Not long after a bunch of changes rolled out to Preview and Beta, Valve has updated the Steam Deck Client software with various improvements. These are all changes I've covered just recently in other articles.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3401926123937490701" target="_blank">changelog</a> is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Offline Mode Fixes</strong><br/>
We're continuing to look at making the user experience of playing games without an Internet connection a better, more intuitive experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue where rebooting while in Steam Offline Mode would cause games to fail to launch</li>
<li>Fixed the Cloud Sync error notification popping up when offline</li>
<li>Disabled Steam Offline Mode button when not connected to the internet, as trying to do this currently gets Steam Deck into a bad state.
	<ul>
<li>This change disables this button but does not in any way affect your ability to play games without an active Internet connection.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Keyboard</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed styling for CJK keyboard glyphs so everything appears centered correctly on keys</li>
<li>Fixed Recommended Layout not always showing up for the author of controller configuration</li>
<li>Fixed CJK font issues in SteamOS updater when running on Steam Deck</li>
<li>Fixed focus issue when tapping the show/hide password button</li>
<li>Removed the gap between keys on the virtual keyboard for improved typing</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Temporarily disabling hot / cold temperature notifications while we address issues with false positives</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As I mentioned <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/valve-improves-steam-deck-offline-mode/" target="_blank">in the last article</a> about the Offline Mode changes: the problem of course is that Steam is an online store, and until now they haven't really needed to do all that much with offline mode since they largely assumed people were always online. With the Steam Deck though, that's not the case, it's a handheld designed to be taken with you so it's another older area of Steam to need some effort.</p>
<p>Even so, it's actually a little bit surprising that Offline Mode wasn't improved a lot before the Steam Deck released, it's a bit of an odd one for Valve not to focus on previously considering it is a handheld but they're starting to make up for it now.</p>

      <title>Valve dev understandably not happy about glibc breaking Easy Anti-Cheat on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/easy-anti-cheat-not-working-on-linux-seems-a-glibc-update-broke-it/" target="_blank">Recently it was noticed</a> that users on more bleeding-edge Linux distributions that updated saw Easy Anti-Cheat no longer working on Linux, the culprit was glibc and now a Valve developer has spoken out about it.</p>
<p>Writing in a small thread on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1559683905904463873" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunate that upstream glibc discussion on DT_HASH isn't coming out strongly in favor of prioritizing compatibility with pre-existing applications. Every such instance contributes to damaging the idea of desktop Linux as a viable target for third-party developers.</p>
<p>Our thoughts on the topic from this prior compatibility issue in BlueZ apply more than ever: <a href="https://github.com/bluez/bluez/commit/35a2c50437cca4d26ac6537ce3a964bb509c9b62#commitcomment-56028543" target="_blank">https://github.com/bluez/bluez/commit/35a2c50437cca4d26ac6537ce3a964bb509c9b62#commitcomment-56028543</a><br/>
It is unfortunately yet another entry in a growing list over the years.</p>
<p>We understand that working with a focus on compatibility requires more resources and more engineering trade-offs, but strongly believe it is nonetheless the way to go. We are very interested in helping with any underlying resource constraints.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This prompted CodeWeavers (who work on Wine and with Valve on Proton) developer Arek Hiler to write a blog post titled "<a href="https://blog.hiler.eu/win32-the-only-stable-abi/" target="_blank">Win32 Is The Only Stable ABI on Linux</a>" and their ending statement is something people should think on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think this whole situation shows why creating native games for Linux is challenging. It’s hard to blame developers for targeting Windows and relying on Wine + friends. It’s just much more stable and much less likely to break and stay broken.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hiler certainly isn't the only one to think like that, with another CodeWeavers developer Andrew Eikum <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22922774" target="_blank">mentioning</a> on Hacker News some time ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a long-time Linux dev (see my profile), I have also found this to be true. Linux userland APIs are unstable and change all the time. Some transitions that come to mind that have affected me personally: ALSA-&gt;pulse; libudev-&gt;libudev2-&gt;systemd; gstreamer 0.10-&gt;1.0. All of those changes required modifications to my software, and the backwards-compat tools that are provided are buggy and insufficient. Meanwhile, you can still write and run winmm[1] applications on Windows 10, and they will work in almost all cases. It's simply the case that the win32 API is more stable than Linux userland APIs, so it's entirely plausible that games will run better in Wine, which shares that stable ABI, than they will on Linux, especially as time goes on and Linux userland shifts yet again.</p>

<p>Situations like this can be pretty messy and this is not a case of open source versus secret closed source anti-cheat stuff either, since the glibc issue affected a Native Linux game (Shovel Knight) and Linux software libstrangle. No doubt there are other things yet to be discovered that were broken by the change.</p>
<p>It is of course also a case that Linux distributions need to ensure they do quality assurance testing, especially for gaming which can end up showing up issues quite easily and that bleeding-edge distributions can and clearly do end up breaking things by pulling new software in so quickly.</p>

      <title>Fab deck-builder Across the Obelisk out now under Paradox Arc publishing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Across the Obelisk is a fantastic deck-builder that just left Early Access, as the first game under Paradox Interactive's new publishing label Paradox Arc. You might want to clear your schedule for this one, as it can easily suck away over 100 hours as you constantly want to jump back in for another attempt.</p>
<p>You can play it alone or with up to three others in co-op and it's great either way. One of the most customizable deck-builders I've had the pleasure of playing and it has massive replay value too. Not only due to the characters and the cards but the way you progress through it too, with branching world paths and all the upgrades you can do. Multiplayer is pretty unique too for the genre, with each player controlling a different hero.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="TMs_MVs511w"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/96d8c06ab9550f027962f8271519c223.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/TMs_MVs511w" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dynamic Deckbuilding Roguelite RPG.</li>
<li>Play solo or co-op with up to three friends.</li>
<li>16 unlockable characters to create your party.</li>
<li>+500 cards and items to choose, craft and upgrade.</li>
<li>Procedural generated system intended to be highly replayable.</li>
<li>Events and quests where your decisions affect how the story unfolds.</li>
<li>Face powerful bosses in tactical combat.</li>
</ul>
<p>The big 1.0 release out now adds in new heroes, a new map with new events / enemies / bosses, new items and pets, new music and loads more. So if you've already put plenty of time into it, the game will feel nice and fresh.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>The Paradox Arc publishing initiative is a new program within Paradox Interactive that aims to highlight unique designs and engaging games from small development teams, leveraging the publishing expertise Paradox has built over nearly 20 years of experience. “Our goal with Paradox Arc is to surprise players with games they might not have known they needed to play,” said Sebastian Forsström, Head of Paradox Arc. “We’re publishing the kind of games that suddenly appear atop your ‘Most Played’ list. I can say from direct experience that Across the Obelisk fits this mold perfectly and I don’t think we could have asked for a better game for our premiere. I’m looking forward to sharing more Paradox Arc titles with everyone soon - and to inviting more developers to work with us.”</p>
<p>You can buy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1385380/Across_the_Obelisk/" target="_blank">Across the Obelisk on Steam</a>. Highly recommended if you like turn-based strategy and deck-building.</p>

      <title>Twin-stick shooter Titan Shell looks intense and will be supported on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Titan Shell is an in-development twin-stick shooter from Meatbag Studio that blends in features from roguelikes / rogue-lites to offer a pretty interesting experience not many such shooters give you.</p>
<p>Instead of being a linear shooter, it takes the randomized approach from other popular games to present you with a slightly different run each time you start a new game with the rooms, enemies, encounters and more being randomized to keep things interesting. Featuring fast-paced run and gun levels with a colourful set of core characters each with their own story, goals and some big boss battles. You'll also get online and local co-op and Native Linux support.</p>
<p>You can see the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="f_kWuaI7KQc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c77de68096460c1e130a2472dd9ff8cf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/f_kWuaI7KQc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/meatbagstudio/titan-zero" target="_blank">currently on Kickstarter</a> with 26 days to go and they have over $45,000 of the $50,000 goal already hit so this seems like it will have no problem hitting 100% funding.</p>
<p>You can also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1964860/Titan_Shell/" target="_blank">follow on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Axiom Verge 2 lands on Steam with Linux support and Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Axiom Verge 2 from Thomas Happ Games has jumped over from the Epic Store to Steam and it comes with Native Linux support and it is also Steam Deck Verified! This was made with Ethan Lee's <a href="https://fna-xna.github.io/" target="_blank">FNA</a>, so it's another quality port too and uses the Vulkan API.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DZG0vU9RYSE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/362c2718cd6beecd8c4f9a46a7629547.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DZG0vU9RYSE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>You may have played Axiom Verge, or heard it referenced as a benchmark for indie action-exploration games. This long awaited sequel expands on the universe with completely new characters, abilities, and gameplay.<br/>
<br/>
Indra, the billionaire behind the worldwide Globe 3 conglomerate, heads to Antarctica to investigate the disappearance of her daughter, but ultimately finds herself in an entirely different reality, infected by parasitic machines that both aid and confound her. Where is she? Who is the mysterious person goading her from the other end of the computer terminal?<br/>
<br/>
Explore an alternate Earth-like world, replete with the ruins of an ancient, high-tech civilization. Hack machines. Battle monsters. Use your remote drone to enter the Breach, a parallel but connected reality that is filled with its own dangers. You’ll want to search every inch for the hidden items and upgrades you need to survive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The game seems to run quite nicely across Linux desktop and Steam Deck, which is not exactly a surprise. Any modern port that uses FNA tends to run great. It's another title that feels like it was made to play on something like the Steam Deck for sure with some tight gamepad controls.</p>
<p>Overall it might not reach the heights of excitement that the original did (not many sequels manage it…), but it's still a pretty great game. If you usually enjoy platformer-metroidvania exploration, this is a lovely indie game to pick up and put a good few hours into.</p>

      <title>Backpack Hero is an inventory management roguelike and my new favourite game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Backpack Hero is a dungeon crawling roguelike where you need to constantly sort out your small backpack and it's absolutely sucked me in. A new Native Linux release from Jaspel and IndieArk, I have no doubt this will be something of a hit on Steam.</p>
<p>It reminds me of the first few times I loaded up Slay the Spire, and in a few ways does feel a little bit like it. You know what enemies are about to do, you can hover over them to see and you travel through a map with various different events. There's no cards here though. You're given a small backpack, which you use to store everything from weapons to armour and all things in between. The key point is your limited space, and certain items need to be placed next to other to give a bonus or get around a weakness.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11395088231660643804gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11395088231660643804gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>As you level up you can expand your backpack so you can fit more in but you're always thinking on how to best sort it, what to take from enemies and chests and what to leave behind. Battles are turn based too, so you get plenty of time to decide what to do with your limited energy as all items have some sort of cost to them (although so also have no cost if you're lucky).</p>
<p>It's in Early Access so it's not finished although there's plenty of content to keep you going for hours already. The developer has said they plan to add in proper controller support (although keyboard and mouse mode in Steam Input works fine for Steam Deck), an overworld with meta-progression, more characters, more events and so on. Right now though when you die it's game over, which they said they will be sorting as a priority to give you something more to work towards other than just that feeling of needing one more run.</p>
<p>Gaming is such an odd thing. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/spider-man-remastered-is-awesome-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Spider Man Remastered</a> just released and runs nicely, but here I am sinking plenty of time and planning a <em>lot</em> more in a small indie game.</p>
<p>Works great on a Linux desktop and Steam Deck. Here's a little video going over it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QN9cl-j9Oh8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/00f4ad117a412de51f33adfc69957cb0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QN9cl-j9Oh8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

      <title>Steam finally gets easier to grab free stuff</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It seems Valve has made it easier to claim free stuff on the Steam store, so you no longer need to quickly try to install something free and back out of it to claim it. Seems this happened somewhat silently but it's obvious enough that no one is going to miss it.</p>
<p>On Steam store pages, there's now an Add to Library button which works for anything that is currently free on Steam.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14938103071660640929gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14938103071660640929gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Such a small but needed change. Especially useful when there's a game that has a 100% discount for a limited time, you can now just easily claim it so you don't miss it. Seeing games on a free giveaway happens quite often too, and having to do a pretend install to claim it was quite a nuisance, while not always the case often you would need to do that. This is especially useful for free DLC, as you would pretty much always need to go through it. Now it's just a one click — nice.</p>
<p>Quite happy to see this change finally happen!</p>

      <title>Valve improves Steam Deck offline mode with more to come</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has put out a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3401926123934103826" target="_blank">small upgrade</a> for the Steam Deck in the Beta and Preview channels that seeks to improve the offline mode. This is a much needed fix.</p>
<p>We've seen quite a few complaints about issues with offline mode and when the Steam Deck just doesn't have an internet connection, so it's nice to see Valve put out some adjustments.</p>
<p>Here's what's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue where rebooting while in Steam Offline Mode would cause games to fail to launch.</li>
<li>Fixed the Cloud Sync error notification popping up when offline.</li>
<li>Disabled Steam Offline Mode button when not connected to the internet, as trying to do this currently gets Steam Deck into a bad state.
	<ul>
<li>This change disables this button but does not in any way affect your ability to play games without an active Internet connection.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Valve also said they're "continuing to look at making the user experience of playing games without an Internet connection a better, more intuitive experience".</p>
<p>The problem of course is that Steam is an online store, and until now they haven't really needed to do all that much with offline mode since they largely assumed people were always online. With the Steam Deck though, that's not the case, it's a handheld designed to be taken with you so it's another older area of Steam to need some effort.</p>

      <title>Even more Steam Deck purchase invites are going out from now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has confirmed that they are (again) increasing the amount of people that will be invited to purchase a Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Writing on Twitter, the official <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1559224105471078400" target="_blank">OnDeck account</a> mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi all, just a quick note that starting with this morning's batch of Steam Deck order invites, we've increased the number of emails we're sending out (again). We're excited to get more of these into your hands! (Order emails are sent out Monday and Thursday mornings PT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So keep your eyes peeled on your emails around 5-6PM UTC, if you're waiting for that precious invite to come in so you can spend those big bucks on a Steam Deck.</p>
<p>This comes after they mentioned recently that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/valve-speeds-up-steam-deck-production-some-more-all-existing-reservations-this-year/" target="_blank">production has sped up</a>, so all previous reservations would come this year and the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/valve-teams-with-komodo-to-bring-the-steam-deck-to-asia/" target="_blank">expansion into Asia</a>.</p>

      <title>Tempest Rising looks like the RTS I&#39;ve been waiting for</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>THQ Nordic, 3D Realms and  Slipgate Ironworks recently revealed Tempest Rising an upcoming classic RTS and after watching the trailer I absolutely need this.</p>
<p>While it will no doubt only officially support Windows, it doesn't release until 2023 and the Proton compatibility layer is already at a point where a lot of new releases just work. It also claims to have full controller support, so could be a good Steam Deck RTS!</p>
<p>As someone who grew up playing Dune 2, Command &amp; Conquer and Red Alert — Tempest Rising seems like it's ticking all the right boxes for me.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Na6bvEEPCQ0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/44f8dcecdfdd729094dcae3a2d039b5e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Na6bvEEPCQ0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Classic RTS action meets modern production and performance in Tempest Rising. Inspired by RTS greats of the 90s and 2000s, Tempest Rising is a classic, base-building real time strategy game set in a modern day alternative history war scenario. It features 3 unique factions, each with its own approach to combat and economy and offering a variety of strategies for players of all stripes, maps with neutral structures to contest and neutral populations to contend with, deep and rewarding gameplay that keeps a focus on strategy while rewarding skill, and built-in customization options that allow players to approach the game their way in both single player and multiplayer game modes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classic RTS base building with fast and fluid hard-hitting combat.</li>
<li>3 asymmetrical playable factions, each featuring distinct economy and play styles.</li>

      <title>Avorion - Into The Rift is an expansive DLC out now for this great space sim</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Probably one of the best spaceship building sandbox games around, Avorion has just grown tremendously with the Into The Rift DLC out now.</p>
<p>In this hardcore add-on you'll explore the mysterious and dangerous Rift dimension. Thanks to new technology, it is now possible to send smaller amounts of mass (i.e. a few ships) into the Rifts. Scientists are now intensively researching these Rifts - and they need your help. Travel into the Rifts and uncover their secrets. Face their dangers, complete research expeditions, and earn powerful new rewards. This arrives along with a big version 2.2 patch for all players.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ti0X9bIU23w"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/19da1f5adf447c1e9f570c9bbb8c693c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ti0X9bIU23w" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>DLC Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Discover a new dimension unlike anything you've seen before in the galaxy.</li>
<li>Prepare your ship accordingly to master the dangerous new environments and uncover the secrets surrounding the origins of the Rifts.</li>
<li>Complete Rift Expeditions for the Rift Research Center, and receive new, powerful hybrid subsystems in return - or simply keep everything you find in the Rifts.</li>
<li>Remember, the deeper you venture into the Rifts, the more lucrative and dangerous they become.</li>
<li>New story campaign.</li>
<li>New captain classes.</li>
<li>+ Loads more</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm surprised this one doesn't have a lot more players. With a Very Positive rating on Steam, along with gameplay that offers a good mixture of spaceship building and exploration, there's a lot to enjoy with it. It regularly sees around 2,000 players online at the same time each day and you can play it alone or with others. Native Linux support too and it works really nicely.</p>
<p>You can buy Avorion on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/avorion?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/445220/Avorion/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Tim Burton inspired adventure game Whateverland launches September 15</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Following from the successful Kickstarter campaign in 2020, Caligari Games have announced their Burton-style point and click adventure will release on September 15.</p>
<p>Whateverland, a world where morally grey souls are banished and transformed in a darkly comical way into forms befitting their souls’ selfish desires, ends up being the perfect place for professional thief Vincent. Stranded in this weird place, Vincent must seek an escape out of a makeshift society full of people no one would ever (willingly) get a drink with alongside a newfound–and not-so-helpful–sidekick Nick.</p>
<p>This is not your usual point and clicker though. Not only is it non-linear, it will also include a turn-based strategy game. Check out their new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AeMNuysHYis"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dfb36cfd150b04251724446cfff205a3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AeMNuysHYis" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“We love the renaissance era of point and click adventures and want to bring back the feeling those games gave us to our audience,” said Eli Mikeladze, Narrative Designer, Producer, and Co-Founder, Caligari Games. “We’re glad we got such great support from fans of The Great Perhaps and with our Kickstarter and can’t wait to welcome them to the weird world of Whateverland.”</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A not so classic point-n-click.</li>
<li>You can steal stuff. Or not – it’s your call.</li>
<li>Your actions define the ending and what people think of you.</li>
<li>The most annoying sidekick in the universe. (We still love you, Nick)</li>
<li>You can talk to people. Not sure they’re gonna talk to you though.</li>
<li>Turn-based strategy sport simulator included in the game. With magic.</li>
<li>Loads of mini-games. At least 2.</li>
<li>Music recorded with a real sextet. How sexy is that?</li>
<li>Beautiful hand-drawn art style.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be available on <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/whateverland" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1175840/Whateverland/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Kitsune Zero, prequel to upcoming LGBTQ+ platformer Kitsune Tails, releases September 12</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kitsune Zero is being released on September 12 as a paid DLC for the free platformer Super Bernie World. This will act as a prequel to the upcoming standalone game Kitsune Tails.</p>
<p>Created by developer Kitsune Games (MidBoss, Ultra Hat Dimension, Super Bernie World) in collaboration with publisher MidBoss (2064: Read Only Memories), you get to revisit the original four worlds of Super Bernie World, now set in the Kitsune Tails universe.</p>
<p>There's a bunch of new story sequences and voice acting from the likes of Michele Knotz, the voice of Misty, May, and Jessie from the English dub of the Pokemon anime. Sean Chiplock, whose credits include The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Genshin Impact, Spider-Man in Marvel’s Avengers, and dozens more beloved anime and video game titles, serves as Kitsune Zero’s narrator.</p>
<p>“Kitsune Zero allows us to give fans an early taste of the Kitsune Tails world and expand on the platforming people loved in Super Bernie World,” said Eniko Fox, co-founder, Kitsune Games. “Speedrunners, know that we made sure that Kitsune Zero remains compatible with Super Bernie World any% speedruns, so it’s time to lower those times and start submitting to marathons!”</p>

      <title>Wine compatibly layer manager Bottles adds vkBasalt improvements, vmtouch cache</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://usebottles.com/" target="_blank">Bottles</a> is easily the most simple way to manage installing and running Windows games and apps on Linux outside of Steam. A new release is out now with plenty of useful tweaks.</p>
<p>Version 2022.8.14 adds in support of vmtouch, a way to cache certain things. The Bottles devs say it "lends us resources to diagnose and control cache" and that you can enable it to possibly improve performance. Another one is a new UI for managing the Vulkan post-processing layer vkBasalt, along with the ability to configure vkBasalt individually per Bottle which sounds great.</p>
<p>A new dark mode switcher is in. Originally it was removed, but it has been added back as not all distributions are updated to do it properly automatically so now you can switch it yourself to your liking.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4830875361660555320gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4830875361660555320gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10433656761660555319gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10433656761660555319gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Main Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New vkBasalt settings</li>
<li>Support for vmtouch caching</li>
<li>New dark mode switch as fallback for distributions not supporting the freedesktop Dark Mode</li>
<li>Prevent programs from launching when clicking on the entry instead of the play button</li>
<li>Windows can now be closed by pressing Escape</li>
<li>The Library view now supports program settings overrides</li>
<li>“Add to Steam” and “Add Desktop Entry” now supports integrations (Epic, Ubisoft, etc.)</li>
<li>The bottles-cli “programs” option now list programs from integrations as well</li>
<li>Gamescope is now compatible with FSR</li>
<li>Minor UI improvements</li>
<li>Lots of bug fixes</li>
<li>Translations updated</li>
</ul>

<p>Canonical announced the release of Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS which brings together an updated download with all the bug fixes, updated apps, driver upgrades and more. Users will now also be prompted to update from earlier versions of Ubuntu, or automatically as part of update scheduling.</p>
<p><em>Since this is an LTS release (long term support), it will see updates until April 2027.</em></p>
<p>While not a major new distro release, it's worth noting since this is the first proper big update since the release of Ubuntu 22.04. A long list of the changes can be seen on their <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/jammy-jellyfish-point-release-changes/29835" target="_blank">official Discourse forum</a> like NVIDIA driver updates, Mesa driver updates for AMD / Intel, various crash-bug fixes for desktop users, Snap upgrades, kernel and firmware updates and much more.</p>
<p>From the release announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As usual, this point release includes many updates, and updated installation media has been provided so that fewer updates will need to be downloaded after installation.  These include security updates and corrections for other high-impact bugs, with a focus on maintaining stability and compatibility with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. 22.04.1 also brings new RISC-V platform support, providing fresh images for the Allwinner Nezha and VisionFive StarFive boards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On top of the new point release, Canonical also put out a new trailer for Ubuntu:</p>

      <title>Easy Anti-Cheat not working on Linux? Seems a glibc update broke it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>News has been doing the rounds for a little bit about Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC) suddenly not working after system updates for some users, turns out it's an issue with glibc.</p>
<p>Reported on <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6051#issue-1326758655" target="_blank">GitHub</a> over a week ago, the issue has been growing as more and more users have been updating their systems. Only certain Linux distributions are affected, mainly those that pull in package updates a lot faster like Arch and derivatives.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14337784741660551688gol1.png"/></p>
<p>EAC is not the only thing broken as there have been reports about the frame limiter libstrangle <a href="https://bugs.gentoo.org/863863" target="_blank">also being broken</a> by it, the game <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6051#issuecomment-1212748397" target="_blank">Shovel Knight</a> and there's probably more too.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=29456" target="_blank">upstream bug report</a> for glibc there's been plenty of back and forth on it. Hopefully a true resolution will be found. Until then, multiple distributions seem to be readying up an update (Arch looks to have it out now) that reverts the change to get EAC games to work once again. So if you haven't updated recently, it might be an idea to hold off for just a little bit until this situation is sorted.</p>

      <title>Spider-Man Remastered is awesome on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With Spider-Man Remastered now available on Steam after previously being PlayStation exclusive, I took it for a spin on Steam Deck and Linux desktop.</p>
<p>Just before release it was Steam Deck Verified and thankfully, the rating is absolutely correct here. With some really good defaults, Spider-Man Remastered is fantastic to play on the Steam Deck. I actually completed it years ago on the PS4, so I know the gameplay and story very well. Getting to play it wherever I want on the Steam Deck though — what absolute joy! This is easily going to be my favourite game of this year to play on Deck.</p>
<p>Check out my video on it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="iV1eLjqn1lE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f584a37fb48812cbd8698fe1abf16903.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/iV1eLjqn1lE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>How about the Linux desktop though? How does it run?</p>
<p>Well, it's a little quirky. It will complain about GPU drivers every time without fail and if you have a controller plugged in, it will <em>crash</em> before the intro video every time. Unplug your controller, and it works 100% of the time. Plug the controller back in at the menu and at least on NVIDIA, it works fine then.</p>
<p>Performance seems reasonable during fights, on the High preset settings at 1080p with an NVIDIA 2080ti it was consistently well above 100FPS. When swinging around though, it drops down below 100FPS quite a lot.</p>

      <title>yuzu the Nintendo Switch Emulator gets an easy Linux installer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news for Linux and Steam Deck fans, the yuzu team <a href="https://yuzu-emu.org/entry/yuzu-linux-installer/" target="_blank">have worked</a> to bring the installer for the Nintendo Switch Emulator over to Linux properly.</p>
<p>This was a bit of a sore spot, while you could still install it relatively easily having the proper installer just puts another tick in the box for making it that bit simpler for everyone. Why have they done it now though? As they said previously it was mostly Windows users playing with it but over time they've seen "consistent growth in the number of our Linux users" and so it was only natural for them to improve their own support of Linux.</p>
<p>This new installer supports Mainline and Early Access builds for Linux users. With Early Access builds being available for their Patreon supporters.</p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18351965881660303163gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18351965881660303163gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>The work was done by a user going by the handle <a href="https://github.com/lat9nq" target="_blank">toastUnlimited</a>. As with any new thing, it might have some issues so be sure to report any you find.</p>

      <title>Retro racer Horizon Chase Turbo gets a big free Adventures game mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Horizon Chase Turbo is a very highly rated retro racing game from developer AQUIRIS and today it sees a huge free upgrade. This is to celebrate the 7th anniversary of the franchise.</p>
<p>If you've not played it before, it's directly inspired by a bunch of different classic racers from the 80s and 90s like Out Run, Lotus Turbo Challenge, Top Gear (SNES), Rush and plenty more. This is a straight to the point arcade racer with no extra fluff, just you and the track.</p>
<p>The Adventure game mode update will bring with it a series of five challenges available for each of the 34 cars in the game, totaling 170 different races to beat. You also get a new skin for each of the cars in the game, as a reward for completing each adventure.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="XGreyhCzTtc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8917da69440cba0f4c2cbb41c383a9a8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/XGreyhCzTtc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Sounds like a pretty sweet free update!</p>
<p>Available on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/horizon-chase-turbo?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/389140/Horizon_Chase_Turbo/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.

      <title>Hollow Knight is getting cross-platform Steam Cloud Saves to help Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hollow Knight developer Team Cherry has announced that an update due to go live on Monday, August 15th will bring a much needed change to the saving system.</p>
<p>Mentioned in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/367520/view/3406429723545099871" target="_blank">Steam post</a>, the developer said "Soon we'll be making some changes in order to support cross-platform cloud saves between Windows, MacOS, and Linux (including the Steam Deck)!" with the plan for it to go live on Monday at 5AM UTC. There's a few important notes they also included:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>MacOS and Linux users will need to play the game once for Steam to upload their existing local save files to cloud storage</li>
<li>Windows users should not need to do anything, except:</li>
<li>Cross-platform users who manually migrated their save files between platforms may have conflicting files. When steam prompts you to keep or overwrite your files it is important to choose the correct one carefully (which will depend on your own situation). If in doubt, back up your save files first!</li>

<p>If you wish to make a backup of your save here's the locations:</p>
<p>Windows:</p>

<p>Not mentioned in their post, but there is currently a rare issue where the graphics might glitch-out completely. To get around this, you can set the game into OpenGL mode by setting this in the game launch options in the Properties of the game in your Steam Library:</p>

      <title>Valheim gets a small teaser as Iron Gate get back to work on Mistlands</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valheim is due to get a huge upgrade at some point, which most players are now waiting on and Iron Gate have given the smallest of teasers on it again. Their team took a bit of a break recently they mentioned in a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/3401926123918063730" target="_blank">update post</a>, but they said they're now back at their desks working away on the next update.</p>
<p>Firstly though, a fix is on the way for an unfortunate crashing issue, you can find some help on that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/valheim/comments/vssxdi/how_to_restore_most_recent_working_world_save/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>As for the next major update, Mistlands, Iron Gate say it's going to be "quite a chunky update, with a lot of things we haven’t shown yet". It will come with new recipes and meals with loads of work on that already done and a sneaky teaser picture was included for people to guess away at:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3369940201660300276gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3369940201660300276gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>They also mentioned again the new Black Marble material that's coming which you'll find in the Mistlands. Players were excited about that so they've shown a fresh preview of something with it:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12429990541660300341gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12429990541660300341gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I honestly haven't touched Valheim in ages, as I don't want to spoil myself before this huge upgrade. Overall the game still seems to be doing well though, with it regularly seeing multiple tens of thousands playing each day. I imagine the player count will rocket upwards once the Mistlands update is out.</p>
<p>Valheim is available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/valheim?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Two Point Campus from the dev of Two Point Hospital out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two Point Campus is the next game from Two Point Studios and SEGA, the same lot that gave us Two Point Hospital. It comes with Native Linux support and works on the Steam Deck right away.</p>
<p>It shares a huge amount with Two Point Hospital, as clearly that was the blueprint they've applied here but of course it's a whole new setting. You're building up your own educational campus environment but it's not as boring as it sounds. Naturally, it has a bunch of fun twists on it where your students will be doing all kinds of ridiculous things including spell-casting wizardry, dragon-slaying knight school or top-secret spy school. Oh, and there's a fun announcer once again that has a number of silly lines to read out.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FnjqPkajRnc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8757ad6f88116df86fff3d6237d03945.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FnjqPkajRnc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I've been testing it across both my Steam Deck and Linux desktop and it seems to work great. The Linux version is using Vulkan, so performance seem to be pretty great even on the Deck at high settings. Gamepad support is basically perfect too, so it will suit many different types of gamers.</p>
<p>Here's some quick footage from the Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zyYPiCZbdaU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e56d55c36cc976ffc5fd83a809ef3756.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zyYPiCZbdaU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I can't wait to put a ton more time into this on the Steam Deck while in bed. Saves worked great between the Steam Deck and my Fedora Linux PC too, so no issues there. Good to see Steam Cloud supported properly out of the box.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/two-point-campus?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1649080/Two_Point_Campus/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>W4 Games formed to help developers using Godot Engine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a very interesting development for the world of the open source Godot Engine, as a new company named <a href="https://w4games.com/" target="_blank">W4 Games</a> has been formed to push it further than ever before. Founded by <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> veterans Juan Linietsky, Rémi Verschelde and Fabio Alessandrelli, and veteran entrepreneur Nicola Farronato the idea is to provide commercial assistance to developers of all sorts using Godot Engine.</p>
<p>One of the goals (there will be a number) is to help developers access console markets, which has been a problem for Godot Engine since it's fully open source and can't just include everything needed to publish on consoles as they've historically been restrictive with things like their SDK. So one goal of W4 Games is to help there, as their FAQ mentions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>W4 was created to satisfy commercial needs of the corporate game industry that are currently unaddressed, by providing products and services to companies that need them in order to move to Godot from other technologies. This includes services offering such as enterprise support plans and the possibility to access markets that were previously unreached by Godot, such as console platforms. Stay tuned for more details!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's just one small part of it though, as their <a href="https://w4games.com/2022/08/09/hello-world-w4-games/" target="_blank">announcement</a> explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>W4 Games was formed to strengthen the Godot ecosystem by providing both enterprise and independent developers with a complementary suite of commercial products and services to successfully develop and publish video games to all existing platforms in the market. Further announcements about these products and services will be made over the coming weeks and months as they become available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For anyone suddenly worried — Godot Engine remains community built, owned and run and will continue to be. This is just a few of their team hoping to keep pushing open source to the masses of developers out there.</p>

      <title>What if Pong had &#39;lore, special moves &amp; gay aliens&#39;? You get ZONERS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developer of ZONERS certainly had an interesting pitch when introducing their new game over email and it turns out it's pretty fun. Scanning over my inbox recently and I come across "What if pong had lore, special moves &amp; gay aliens?" as a title and that's certainly one way to grab my attention.</p>
<p>Coming from developer Paris Stalker / ALL iN who also made a hardcore action platformer called <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2018/02/some-thoughts-on-ersatz-the-speed-focused-hardcore-action-platformer-with-a-musical-twist/" target="_blank">ERSATZ</a>.</p>
<p>The developer mentioned that it features "a diverse cast of atypical aliens, tons of ongoing accessibility and customisation work, bizarre lore, an insane original soundtrack (OK, I did write a couple of the songs myself, so <em>mostly</em> insane), way too much effort put into the menus, and the determination of a stubborn git after like 7 rejections from indie focused publishers, what isn't to love?".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Iioz5JuT1AU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3e978d3c52097832089d725fe03e4d65.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Iioz5JuT1AU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What you essential get here is another take on the style of Windjammers. It's basically a hyper version of Pong for sure and if you love these sorts of fast-paced arcade sports games, you can't really go wrong. A little rough around the edges with it being an Early Access game but so much to love about it already.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1598030/ZONERS/" target="_blank">find it on Steam</a> with Native Linux support.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The popular Avatar the Last Airbender series continues to have an influence on game developers, with Emberbane being announced as an upcoming pixel action-platformer with combat revolving around a mixture of four elements with unique abilities.</p>

<p>"Join Ophelia on her journey to slay the malevolent gods of elements and bring equilibrium to the land; unlock the power of the planets and channel the four elemental powers to your advantage. Uncover the secrets of tale untold for centuries and follow the calling of your fate."</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Master the four elements, and use them for both combat and platforming purposes. The elements can be combined to overcome the obstacles.</li>
<li>Let your emotions lead you in this journey. Each element takes its power from a certain emotion. And your emotions decide the key moments in this story, as well as the ending of your journey.</li>

<li>Story revolves around 7 arcs, each one with a unique theme, enemies and platforming sequences.</li>

      <title>Justin Wack and the Big Time Hack is another fun looking point and clicker coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you love your point and click adventures? We have another to highlight with Justin Wack and the Big Time Hack that will have Native Linux support.</p>
<p>In Justin Wack and the Big Time Hack, you play three characters trying to unite lost lovers, getting a fun-loving caveman back to his own time, all while steering clear of the scary-looking robots trying to erase you from the timeline. Originally funded on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/warmkitten/justin-wack-and-the-big-time-hack" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> raising $32k due to the support of 469 backers, including Ron Gilbert (of Monkey Island fame). Linux support was a stretch-goal that seemingly wasn't hit but they're doing it now anyway.</p>
<p>Original trailer:</p>

      <title>Adventure game Nine Noir Lives seems to let you lick everything</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nine Noir Lives is an upcoming point and click adventure game that follows feline private investigator Cuddles Nutterbutter. A new brief trailer is out, showing off a very important game mechanic.</p>
<p>Licking. Yes, you are a cat after all and who knows — licking something might give you an all important clue.</p>
<p>Shown off yesterday for International Cat Day, a new short teaser trailer showed a bit more of the gameplay and the lick mechanic. A bowl of snacks? Cuddles licks it. A sentient computer? Cuddles licks that too. Another cat dressed as a milk carton? I think you get the idea.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cRIuI23ZWeo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1095f1d85e7c467e3c918dd80f4ed222.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cRIuI23ZWeo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Inspired by the likes of Grim Fandango and Broken Sword along with the works of classic film noir from Shakespeare, and Taika Waititi the two-person team at Silvernode Games are working hard to create a point-and-click adventure game that pays tribute to the past while curling up in its own unique niche.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brought Up on Feline-y Charges: </strong>A charming comedy-noir storyline set in the unique and intriguing city of Meow Meow Furrington, inspired by every cat ever and with fewer cat puns than you might expurrct.</li>
<li><strong>A Point-and-Lick Adventure: </strong>Discover a whole new dimension to everything in the game by using Cuddles’ tongue. Lick first, and ask questions later. Questions like "what did you expect that to taste like, Cuddles?"</li>
<li><strong>S’more Cats Equals S’more Fun: </strong>Experience the city from two very different perspectives as you switch between Cuddles and his trusty assistant, Tabby Marshmallow.</li>
<li><strong>Purrfect Voice Acting: </strong>Laugh and learn about the world of Furth with over a hundred thousand words of fully-voiced dialogue performed by an all-star cast including Lucas Gilbertson (<em>Megaman X</em>), Carol-Anne Day (<em>A Hat in Time</em>) and SungWon Cho (<em>Borderlands 3</em>, <em>God of War Ragnarok</em>).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Steam Deck gets a performance fix available in Preview</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After the recent SteamOS 3.3 release, it came with some unfortunate performance issues for the Steam Deck that Valve continues to address. The first was a random bit of micro-stutter <a href="https://youtu.be/53aWJrfIkX8" target="_blank">that I highlighted</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/rIU26Tn-UYI" target="_blank">Valve fixed</a>, but it seems there were other problems.</p>
<p>Now you can opt into the Preview update channel on your Steam Deck to get these fixes in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3360267192939212657" target="_blank">new update</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Temporarily reverted Red Dead Redemption 2 VRAM workaround to pre-3.3 behavior</li>
<li>Fixed an issue causing random 0.2s stutter</li>
<li>Fixed an issue causing performance drops when a UI element appeared on screen if the performance HUD was enabled.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>How to do it?</p>
<p>Just hit the Steam button and go into Settings. Then System and find the Steam Update Channel and select Preview there. Then scroll up and check for updates and let it download. Your Steam Deck will reboot after it's finished.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck hits 4,500 games officially Verified or Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After only being available for a few months now officially and with Valve still going through the reservation queue, the Steam Deck has hit 4,500 titles officially marked Verified or Playable.</p>
<p>Five months in, that's pretty good going don't you think? Usual reminder though, this is only the number that has been formally verified by Valve directly. The actual number of titles playable will be far greater. Going by <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified&amp;refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B1%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Playable" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, which includes unlisted titles, these are the current numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verified - 1988</li>
<li>Playable - 2512</li>
<li>Unsupported - 1834</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the recently Verified titles include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1336120/Bridge_Constructor_The_Walking_Dead/" target="_blank">Bridge Constructor: The Walking Dead</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/259060/Dominions_4_Thrones_of_Ascension/" target="_blank">Dominions 4</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/799640/Dungeon_Munchies/" target="_blank">Dungeon Munchies</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/80310/Gemini_Rue/" target="_blank">Gemini Rue</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1114870/Lennas_Inception/" target="_blank">Lenna's Inception</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1817070/Marvels_SpiderMan_Remastered/" target="_blank">Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1389550/Mind_Scanners/" target="_blank">Mind Scanners</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I recently picked up a game called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1919460/Seraphs_Last_Stand/" target="_blank">Seraph's Last Stand</a> to play on Deck and it's surprisingly sweet. Only £0.79 too! It sort-of scratches the same itch the likes of Vampire Survivors does, with waves of enemies and tons of upgrades to pick but it's inspired by the classic Heli Attack. Instead of you running around a big area, you're running along the bottom of the screen facing off enemies coming down at you and all the firing ends up looking like fireworks. Worth a go, slow to start but once you get going it's absolutely mental.</p>

      <title>Despot&#39;s Game: Dystopian Army Builder releases September 15</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After currently being in Early Access for around 10 months, Despot’s Game: Dystopian Army Builder is set to fully release for all platforms on September 15.</p>
<p>It's a very unique auto-battling dungeon crawler, where you build up an army of people with classes that you won't really find in any other game. They're hilariously varied! You can have a chef, someone with a laser sword, pretzel-throwers, someone with large bionic arms (think Dr. Otto Octavius from Spider Man), someone with boxing gloves and the list goes on. It's ridiculous — in all the rights ways. The full release will come with some reworked mechanics, new quests, new enemies and mutations, an expanded soundtrack and much more.</p>
<p>A new trailer was also just released:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="q8HxA0fkEBQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/61d16ce711245f1f8ff064e51a1396e5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/q8HxA0fkEBQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“Despot’s Game represents our childhood and all of our love for gaming wrapped in one,” said Nikolay Kuznetsov, Game Creator, Konfa Games. “The weapons are filled with easter eggs that represent cult movies, TV shows, games and books we read growing up. It’s really fun to see players’ excitement when they recognize and relate to them as well, because without our community, it wouldn’t have been possible to create this game.”</p>
<p>If you pick up Despot’s Game before the full release, you will receive a DLC named "Despot’s Game: Challenges" free.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/despots-game?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1227280/Despots_Game_Dystopian_Army_Builder/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Linux Mint 21 is out now and you can easily upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In case you didn't already know Linux Mint 21 is officially out now with editions that come with the Cinnamon, MATE or Xfce desktop environments.</p>
<p>Safe to use on the desktop for gaming and work for many years, as it's a long-term support release that will keep going until 2027 with updates thanks to it being based upon Ubuntu 22.04. You will get Linux Kernel 5.15 and depending on which edition you go for Cinnamon 5.4, MATE 1.26 or Xfce 4.16.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2578861191659967663gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2578861191659967663gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Linux Mint Cinnamon Edition</em></p>
<p>Largely the same as the Beta I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/linux-mint-21-beta-now-available/" target="_blank">previously covered</a>. With major changes to the display manager in Cinnamon, based on a much more modern version of Mutter that was previously rather outdated. They've also ported over the display settings from Gnome, plus plenty of theme tweaks to make applications match with the GTK theme.</p>
<p>Some of the other major changes includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A switch from Blueberry to Blueman for Bluetooth</li>
<li>New Xapp project called xapp-thumbnailers, providing thumbnails for many more file types</li>
<li>Upgrades to the Sticky Notes application</li>
<li>A process monitor to inform you when automated tasks are happening that might slow your PC down</li>
<li>Webp support was added to xviewer and thumbnailers.</li>
<li>The WebApp manager supports additional browsers and custom browser parameters.</li>
<li>In Software Sources, the repository list, PPA list and key list support multiple selection. This allows several items to be removed at a time.</li>
<li>Mint now uses IPP (Driverless Printing and Scanning)</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus lots more.</p>
<p>How to upgrade? Linux Mint 20.3 to version 21 is reasonably easy and supported. In terminal run these commands:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">sudo apt update<br/>
sudo apt install mintupgrade<br/>
sudo mintupgrade</code></p>
<p>Then you will be greeted by the official UI upgrade tool to follow along. After it's completed you can run these to finish:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">sudo apt remove mintupgrade<br/>
sudo reboot</code></p>

      <title>Proton Experimental gets Halo Infinite working plus Airborne Kingdom</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hot on the heels of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/proton-70-4-is-coming-to-bring-more-compatibility-to-linux-and-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Proton 7.0-4 getting a Release Candidate</a>, Valve has put up a new build of Proton Experimental and it's quite an exciting one. This is the special version of Proton you can try, that often pulls in new features and fixes earlier to get more Windows games working on Linux desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Newly playable in Proton Experimental from August 5th include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Airborne Kingdom</li>
<li>ToGather:Island</li>
</ul>
<p>They also note that Halo Infinite is now playable. However, it comes with issues. On desktop you'll need the Mesa git drivers and there's lots of graphical issues with NVIDIA. On Steam Deck and an AMD desktop, you will see see some minor artifacts. Hopefully those won't take too long to solve.</p>
<p>Additional fixes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix recent regression that caused VRChat to intermittently hang.</li>
<li>Fix SCP: Secret Labratory not being playable after a recent game update (again).</li>
</ul>
<p>Seems there might be some issues with the Flatpak version of Steam on desktop (and older distros), as it needs a newer version of Mesa so keep that in mind as Experimental now needs Mesa 22 or NVIDIA 510.47 or newer. Changelog available <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a quick look at how it runs on Steam Deck along with how to switch it over to Proton Experimental:</p>

      <title>Proton 7.0-4 is coming to bring more compatibility to Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve are preparing to ship the next version of Proton, their compatibility layer that runs Windows games on Steam Deck and Linux desktop with Proton 7.0-4 having a Release Candidate ready to test.</p>
<p>This only went up a few hours ago and you can try it and report feedback to Valve. As usual for testing releases, the current list of changes may be different to when it's out officially. To test it out you need to opt into the Beta on Proton 7 directly. So search for Proton 7 in your Steam Library, go into the Properties, Betas and select the "release-candidate".</p>
<p>Here's what's new / improved:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Now playable:
	<ul>
<li>Aquarist - My First Job</li>
<li>Trove</li>
<li>Chuzzle Deluxe</li>
<li>Zuma's Revange!</li>
<li>Karmaflow The Rock Opera Videogame - Act I &amp; Act II</li>
<li>The Rising of the Shield Hero: Relive The Animation</li>
<li>Disgaea 5</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Support automatically bringing up on screen keyboard on Steam Deck in Final Fantasy XIV launcher.</li>
<li>Fix Final Fantasy XIV launcher exiting silently when there's not enough space to download the update.</li>
<li>Fix The Ball displaying error message on the first launch.</li>
<li>Fix video playback in: POSTAL: Brain Damaged.</li>
<li>Fix Hardspace: Shipbreaker failing to connect to online services.</li>
<li>Fix music in Let's Build a Zoo.</li>
<li>Fix Azur Lane: Crosswave hanging on a black screen for some users.</li>
<li>Fix Dokyusei Bangin' Summer showing only flickering black window.</li>
<li>Fix Bloons TD 6 crashing on touch input.</li>
<li>Fix Sid Meier's Civilization IV crashing on world creation.</li>
<li>Fix Assassin's Creed Origins hanging during gameplay after recent game update.</li>
<li>Fix Call of Duty: Black Ops II - Zombies and Call of Duty: Black Ops II - Multiplayer crashing after connecting online.</li>
<li>Fix graphical glitches in Cossacs 3.</li>
<li>Fix garbled audio in Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak.</li>
<li>Fix Elite Dangerous and other launchers not working properly when cloned displays are present.</li>
<li>Implement Vulkan other process rendering (used by nw.js games).</li>
<li>Improve performance of HROT.</li>
<li>Improve video playback for many games that previously required targeted hacks.</li>
<li>Reduce space used by game prefixes if filesystem supports copy on write.</li>
<li>Update dxvk to <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v1.10.3" target="_blank">v1.10.3</a></li>
<li>Update vkd3d-proton to <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/commits/proton-v2.6-support" target="_blank">v2.6-1-gc05900da</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you wish to try it and give feedback, Valve are mainly interested in issues that are directly new in the release candidate builds. So if you find something is broken between Proton 7.0-3 and Proton 7.0-4, Valve need to know about it. A lot of the changes are coming over from previous builds of Proton Experimental.</p>
<p>You can report issues on <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6062" target="_blank">the GitHub page</a>.</p>

      <title>Top quick Steam Deck tips and tricks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Since Valve are ramping up production and a ton more people than expected will get their Steam Deck this year, plus the expansion into Asia, it was a good time to get some basic quick tips and tricks sorted for you.</p>
<p>I have plenty of guides on here in various articles and on the YouTube channel, although good they're quite spread-out so this is a nice quick reference to jump back to when you need some info. Consider it something of a starter guide for quickly getting up to speed with the Deck.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="59R3k4s1aPo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8dc5ae2c1c41e4f2396c8806c0f263d2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/59R3k4s1aPo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of what's included:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can hold down the Steam or Quick Access button to get a list of shortcuts, these shortcuts work with both buttons, not just the Steam button. An example is Steam+X for opening the keyboard anywhere, and Steam + Right Shoulder button to make a screenshot. You can also hold down the Steam button and then move the right stick to move a mouse cursor any time too. You can even press the Steam and B button together, to force a game to shutdown if you need to. There’s many other shortcuts, so don’t forget to check back on it.</li>
<li>Plenty of games that aren’t verified work great. You can check <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> for reports on unverified games which is a fully crowdsourced collection, anyone can test a game on Steam Deck or Linux and submit an entry on how it runs.</li>
<li>Run the screen at 40Hz and 40FPS from the Quick Access menu available by pressing the three dot button on the Steam Deck and going into the Performance menu which has the battery icon. It gives you a simple way to maximise battery life with good performance.</li>
<li>If you’re going to open up the steam deck, <strong>take the sd card out first</strong>, or you will snap the card. I died a little inside when I killed a 1TB card doing that.</li>
<li>Steam Input is your friend, allowing you to fully customize the controls of every single game. You can access it via the controller icon on the games page in your library, or while playing a game by pressing the Steam button, going to the right and selecting Controller Settings at the bottom. Here you can map all the buttons to anything like a mouse, keyboard, turn on gryo, map the back buttons, change deadzones and so much more.</li>
<li>Use both trackpads for typing with the on-screen keyboard, it’s a lot faster.</li>
<li>If you find the WiFi not working well, especially on 5Ghz networks, try turning on developer mode and then turning off Wifi Power Management. You’ll see more power usage but it might just fix your issues.</li>
<li>To access the full desktop mode, you can hold the power button down for a few seconds and select Switch to Desktop or press the Steam button go down to Power and select it there.</li>
<li>Change the location of where screenshots are saved, so you can access them easier in desktop mode. To do it, in desktop mode go into Steam settings -&gt; in-game menu and change the folder to where you want it to be. You can also select to have higher quality screenshots here too.</li>
<li>If you’re at home a lot, just buy a long <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08J41QTNN/" target="_blank">USB-C cable</a> and keep it plugged in with a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08GSSZGWV/" target="_blank">charger</a> when gaming if you can, it will save your battery life.</li>
<li>If you’re going to be using a newer Xbox controller over Bluetooth, update the firmware otherwise it won’t connect properly.</li>
<li>Desktop mode has the Discover software centre, giving you the option to install a ton of extra software like Discord.</li>
<li>If you have games on GOG or Epic Games, the Heroic Games Launcher available in Discover is your friend. It allows you to login and download games, and then run them through a compatibility layer.</li>
<li>Adding third-party apps and games to Steam is easy enough too. Open desktop mode, load up the Steam client and go to the big add game button to the left or the Games menu at the top of the client. Then they will also be available in the normal Gaming Mode in the Non-Steam section of the Library.</li>

      <title>Open source game development advances with Godot Engine 3.5 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Godot Engine, the free and open source full game development engine has a big new release available with <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/godot-3-5-cant-stop-wont-stop" target="_blank">version 3.5</a>. This is not the version that comes with Vulkan and the big rendering overhaul, that's coming in Godot 4 which is due for a proper Release Candidate sometime soon.</p>
<p>Godot 3.5 brings with it 9 months of development on new features and bug fixes</p>
<ul>
<li>A fully overhauled navigation system</li>
<li>Physics interpolation in 3D</li>
<li>A lot more powerful and flexible Tween system</li>
<li>Long awaited Label3D node out of the box to display text in 3D scenes</li>
<li>Accessing nodes by unique names</li>
<li>Asynchronous shader compilation + caching</li>
<li>A more adaptable and easy way to add basic occlusion culling</li>
<li>+ Lots more</li>
</ul>
<p>For this release they teamed up with the great people of <a href="https://www.gdquest.com/" target="_blank">GDQuest</a> to show it all off:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NjIJm2jax68"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fe59d6b3bc3855038ba4398923260c8b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NjIJm2jax68" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Wonderful to see Godot Engine advance so much, it's quickly becoming one of the absolute best game engines around and since it's free and open source the rug cannot be pulled from beneath the feet of developers. I do hope more teams take a look at it, especially with the top Linux support it offers for both development and game exports.</p>

      <title>PlayStation 3 emulator RPCS3 gets Save States support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A huge advancement for the PlayStation 3 emulator project <a href="https://rpcs3.net/" target="_blank">RPCS3</a> as it now has support for Save States, which is pretty awesome.</p>
<p>For those who don't know: Save States are not like normal Save Data. What it does it take an exact snapshot of what is happening, so you can re-load to that exact state of the game at another time and it could be while you're anywhere and doing anything in any game. A lot of other emulators already support such a feature.</p>
<p>The new feature was announced on <a href="https://twitter.com/rpcs3/status/1555043140461019136" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, with one of their team mentioning on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/wfrcvg/comment/iivig4x/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="_3cjCphgls6DH-irkVaA0GM" data-testid="comment">
<div class="_292iotee39Lmt0MkQZ2hPV RichTextJSON-root" style="color:#D7DADC">
<p>We didn't think it was realistically feasible several years ago, but after a lot of work, it's here!</p>
<p>Some savestates will be of a couple GBs of size depending on the game, and there are still certain limitations, but those are just small issues in the grand scheme of things.</p>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>With it now in, they can continue improving it and there are some limitations to be aware of. Like right now if you do a Save State, the game will close. You can just reboot it to carry on and the Save State will be sorted as it's just a technical hurdle they will overcome at some point. In future, major updates to RPCS3 might be incompatible with older Save States too but you could just continue running an older version for it.</p>

      <title>Valve spoke to IGN Japan about the Steam Deck, here&#39;s a few takeaway points</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As Valve expands the Steam Deck into Asia, they've begun a series of interviews and one on video with IGN Japan was quite interesting so here's the main points. While a lot of it was already known, it's still nice to reiterate just how all-in Valve are on the Steam Deck and during the video it also shows off some rather fun looking prototype devices.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20951893241659705276gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20951893241659705276gol1.jpg"/></a>Picture credit - IGN Japan</em></p>
<p>I hope they're still working on that new controller design. I've said it before and I'll say it again — I will be first in line for a new Steam Controller. One that has both sticks and the trackpads would simply be amazing, just like the Steam Deck has and would make playing it docked so much nicer for a lot of people.</p>
<p>The full IGN Japan interview (round-up below):</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nEFixPrVdhA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/85fe1139193dc01b8ee4e421def9f6ff.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nEFixPrVdhA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Here's a little round-up of some interesting bits:</p>
<ul>
<li>There's plenty of continuity between their previous hardware and the Steam Deck, with lots that helped to complete the Steam Deck like working on the Valve Index helped their production lines. Steam Link helped towards Remote Play and so on. Valve Index controller for example was an important stepping stone in regards to dealing with batteries.</li>
<li>Valve confirmed again that they will "only use Proton when there's no Linux version of a game", however they learned from Steam Machines and working with developers to get Linux ports that it often wasn't worth it and why they worked on Proton. Since the Steam Deck, it's been far easier to get Proton working for new release as they've been working with developers.</li>
<li>Linux is a benefit to them since it's open source, as it means they can work to fix issues and features quicker than reporting it to someone else and keep improving as they don't have to report it to someone else and wait on them.</li>
<li>Japan was on their list to ship the Steam Deck to from day 1 but they had to work out the distribution.</li>
<li>They think the Steam Deck will be a multi-generational product, they expect there to be future iterations and they're finding the right balance to give developers a stable product to target but they wish to follow the PC model of constant improvement. No time span yet.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam adds support for Nintendo Joy-Con controllers in Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>Steam is ever-improving and constantly expanding what is supported by Steam Input. Just recently they added a new <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3387288790681635164" target="_blank">Steam Client Beta</a> with support for the Nintendo Joy-Con controllers.</p>
<p>This follows on from the recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/steam-gets-support-for-nintendo-online-classic-controllers/" target="_blank">stable Steam Client release</a> which added support for the Nintendo Online classic controllers including the NES, SNES, Nintendo 64 and Sega Mega Drive / Genesis controllers.</p>
<p>With the new Beta released on August 4th Valve has now added the official Nintendo Joy-Con controller support, that can be used individually as a mini-gamepad or them both combined. Additionally, support for the Nintendo Online classic controllers has also now been improved.</p>
<p>So a tiny update in terms of what's new but still a very welcome one.</p>
<p>It's actually pretty incredible just how wide the controller support is on Steam now. It's likely you can just pick up close to any controller and it will work.</p>

      <title>Crypt of the Necrodancer: SYNCHRONY DLC released into Early Access</title>
      <author>anewson</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A pleasant surprise for Crypt of the Necrodancer fans! SYNCHRONY, a new DLC for Necrodancer, released today into early access. This surprise content for the pioneering 2015 rythm-roguelike is itself an act of necromancy, as until recently the game had not seen new content since the Amplified DLC in 2017. Today's release of Synchrony into EA follows a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/crypt-of-the-necrodancer-gets-a-big-surprise-update-with-more-to-come/" target="_blank">July update to the base game</a> aimed at making Necrodancer compatible with Steam Deck.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="MX9JlggiCHo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ca65c1a7f4bd3e0396ea5b57c0f6d01d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/MX9JlggiCHo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The biggest addition in Synchrony is co-operative and competitive multiplayer modes, but there is lots of content for solo gamers as well. Here's the feature list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Online multiplayer support for up to 8 players in co-op and vs modes!</li>
<li>New character: Chaunter -- Posesses enemies and fights using their powers!</li>
<li>New character: Suzu -- Speedy character with an invincible dash attack!</li>
<li>New character: Klarinetta -- Does battle with a huge two-handed sword!</li>
<li>Full mod support allowing most aspects of the game to be modded!</li>
<li>An integrated mod portal, and the ability to load multiple mods at once!</li>
<li>New weapons, spells, items, enemies, shrines, traps, and more!</li>
<li>Even more features to come during Early Access!</li>
</ul>
<p>If you've never played Necrodancer it's an easy recommendation. The game is set up like a classic roguelike but the turns happen to the beat of the music rather than waiting for player input. The phenomenal OST was composed by Danny Baranowsky (Super Meatboy, Canabalt, Cortex Command), and you will be banging your fingers (and occasionally your face) into your keyboard to one of the greatest video game soundtracks ever made.</p>
<p>When I read about one of the competitive modes in Synchrony I was reminded of watching a competitive speedrun of Necrodancer at Games Done Quick where two players raced to finish the game - it seemed like a ton of fun. Here's the video if you'd like to take a look. To be clear, this is not the Synchrony DLC, it's just two very good Necrodancers playing the base game with the Amplified DLC.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="X3a3EcSZeZs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/273f541977f47db3cd3d2d9cb0945830.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/X3a3EcSZeZs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Synchrony is released natively for Linux into Early Access with an expected full release in late 2022.</p>
<p>You can buy it from <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/crypt_of_the_necrodancer_synchrony" target="_blank">GOG</a> (soon) and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/247080/Crypt_of_the_NecroDancer/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Claim the fun and challenging Frick, Inc. from Kenney FREE for 24 hours</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Frick, Inc. is an amusing game with a name that's slightly silly because it's fricking frustrating too. The developer, Kenney, has made it free to <a href="https://kenney.itch.io/frick-inc" target="_blank">grab on itch.io</a> for 24 hours.</p>
<p>In the game you control a little vehicle and have to move it around a small course. However, the controls are what make it interesting. Instead of using traditional mouse, keyboard or gamepad — you have to flick buttons and switches on the screen to direct the vehicle around. It can be surprisingly challenging and a good bit of fun. Each vehicle has a different controls setup too, meaning you need to keep learning. It's a little gem.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EPNE9hMSrVw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/df31ea8529fa7d5995b6b1662b402063.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EPNE9hMSrVw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Easy to learn, hard to master </strong>–<strong> </strong>You'll be switching between trucks (and control methods) in 40 levels to perform various tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Extra challenge in each level</strong> – Each of the levels contains an extra challenge, only for those daring enough to go the extra mile.</li>
<li><strong>Includes game assets</strong> – Ready to get into game development? Use the included 3D models to create your own game inspired by Frick, Inc.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Get it <a href="https://kenney.itch.io/frick-inc" target="_blank">free on itch.io</a> for 24 hours.</p>

      <title>Nara: Facing Fire inspired by Hollow Knight is live on Kickstarter with Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for another beautiful and engaging looking metroidvania? Loved Hollow Knight? You should keep an eye on Nara: Facing Fire that's live on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/glowing-glade/nara-facing-fire-a-hand-drawn-fantasy-metroidvania/description" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>. A game I briefly covered <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/fantasy-metroidvania-nara-facing-fire-blends-hollow-knight-and-ori/" target="_blank">last month</a>, the developer plans to offer full Native Linux support.</p>
<p>It's directly inspired by Hollow Knight, Ori and Celeste with challenging bosses and a focus on the fluid and responsive movement mechanics. Those are some big names to live up to but the early footage in the trailer (that's a work in progress) definitely looks the part. The Kickstarter has a €90,000 goal and 29 days to hit it with over €11,000 pledged already.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CK0vfKd-OwI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/de949b061a1a3c4518c805f17e687fd1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CK0vfKd-OwI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developers mention you will be exploring a vast open world full of secrets, lots of different characters to meet and plenty of creatures to befriend or fight. It's non-linear too and it sounds like there's multiple endings to it too. Since there's a big focus on the combat, they said their main goal was "for the player to have complete control over Nara's actions at all times while handcrafting the animation transitions to be as smooth as possible" with there being no special acceleration added to the character and abilities have a short "windup time", so you get smooth movement and combat that gives you "the ability to truly express their skill and mechanics which allows for very clean and epic looking speedruns".</p>
<p>All looks and sounds pretty good. I'm honestly surprised it's not funded already.</p>
<p>Follow along on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2087320/Nara_Facing_Fire/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam page</a> and fund it on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/glowing-glade/nara-facing-fire-a-hand-drawn-fantasy-metroidvania/description" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>.</p>

      <title>Fantasy city-builder Songs of Syx adds diseases, makes you care for the elderly</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Songs of Syx is a fantasy city-builder that made a bit of a splash at release selling a few thousand copies pretty quickly, but as always many more games appear and some fall off the radar but Songs of Syx continues expanding.</p>
<p>This Native Linux game had a lot going for it at release, so many put quite a lot of hours into it. Since the initial Early Access build in September 2020 they've added in new military units, a much smarter AI, entertainment, religion, reproduction, riots, cannibals, big war mechanics and the list goes on.</p>
<p>A new update just released adding even more mechanics to the game now including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Personal homes</li>
<li>New tech tree</li>
<li>Elderly care</li>
<li>Disease &amp; health</li>
<li>World camps</li>
<li>A new species and religion.</li>
<li>Balance and fixes</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the new update video below:</p>

      <title>Last Call BBS, the final game from Zachtronics has left Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Last Call BBS, the final game from the clever people at Zachtronics has left Early Access and is out now along with Native Linux support. Such a shame to see such a great developer move on. They've had some really amazing games over the years with my personal favourite being <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2018/01/opus-magnum-is-an-exceptional-puzzle-game-available-for-linux/" target="_blank">Opus Magnum</a> from 2017.</p>
<p>"Boot up your Z5 Powerlance and dial into Last Call BBS, the last game from Zachtronics!</p>
<p>The Barkeep’s loaded up his retro computer with a full set of puzzle games for you to download and play. No need to worry about copy protection, they’re all fully cracked and ready to enjoy!"</p>

<p>This is actually multiple games in one package:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>20th Century Food Court</strong>: Design factories to produce food just like they did over 700 years ago in the 20th century. Keep your costs low and your machines running fast!</li>
<li><strong>STEED FORCE Hobby Studio</strong>: Assemble robot models based on the anime smash hit Steed Force right on your computer. No sandpaper required!</li>
<li><strong>X’BPGH: The Forbidden Path</strong>: Enter a cursed world and create bizarre flesh sculptures in exchange for eternal life. The master is pleased… but can you trust him?</li>
<li><strong>Sawayama Solitaire</strong>: It wouldn’t be a Zachtronics release without a brand-new solitaire game. This time it’s a fresh take on Klondike, the “classic” solitaire variant.</li>
<li><strong>Dungeons &amp; Diagrams</strong>: Try your hand at these beguiling tile-based logic puzzles. Can you map out the dungeons and steal all the treasure?</li>
<li><strong>ChipWizard™ Professional</strong>: Build integrated circuits using wires, transistors, and capacitors. Wait a second, is this a game or a CAD program?</li>
<li><strong>HACK*MATCH</strong>: The tile-matching minigame from EXAPUNKS, completely remastered with a single player campaign and local head-to-head multiplayer (with Steam Remote Play support).</li>
<li><strong>Kabufuda Solitaire</strong>: Create matching sets of Japanese kabufuda cards in this retro-demake of the challenging original solitaire game that debuted in Eliza.</li>
</ul>

      <title>No more DLC for Oxygen Not Included, devs decide to do free updates instead</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oxygen Not Included is not getting any more DLC, Klei Entertainment has announced. Instead, they're going to keep pumping out free updates for all players. What is it? ONI is a space colony building game where you have to manage a growing group of people in a hostile environment.</p>
<p>Writing in a post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/457140/view/3388414690589449312" target="_blank">Steam</a>, the developers explained they had been planning a second major DLC but they've decided it "wasn’t the right fit for our long-term goals" and that they want the game to feel like a "true universe" with it continuing to expand. Most importantly, they don't want to split the community again and limit their own design choices with the game as they would have to decide between main features and DLC.</p>
<p>They also explained that the more DLC they would do, the harder it would be to maintain for everyone. So instead they're "shifting our focus to building out a lot of the same content and systems you’d expect from a DLC, and releasing them regularly as free game updates that work for both base game and Spaced Out".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18515855861659619312gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18515855861659619312gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Very nice!</p>
<p>You can buy Oxygen Not Included on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/457140/Oxygen_Not_Included/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It's a Native Linux game and it is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s the current most-played games on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/valve-reveals-the-top-10-most-played-steam-deck-titles-and-theyre-all-fully-verified/" target="_blank">A little while ago</a> Valve showed the current top 10 most played games on Steam Deck and now we have an update on what people are currently playing.</p>
<p>Shared via the official <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1554912282387173376" target="_blank">Twitter</a> account these are the top 10 over the last week, sorted by the daily average user counts:</p>
<ul>
<li>MultiVersus</li>
<li>Vampire Survivors</li>
<li>Stray</li>
<li>ELDEN RING</li>
<li>No Man's Sky</li>
<li>Hades</li>
<li>Stardew Valley</li>
<li>Grand Theft Auto V</li>
<li>Aperture Desk Job</li>
<li>MONSTER HUNTER RISE</li>
</ul>
<p>It's pretty amazing to see the likes of Vampire Survivors continue to stick in the top 10. Who would have thought a tiny little and rather simplistic indie game could keep on going like this? Vampire Survivors has managed to hit over 110,000 user reviews on Steam now, with an Overwhelmingly Positive score.</p>
<p>Not surprising to see MultiVersus there either, given that it's currently a top 10 game on Steam overall and worked right away at release and even before during the Beta as I showed previously:</p>

      <title>Valve teams with Komodo to bring the Steam Deck to Asia</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some huge news for the future of the Steam Deck, as Valve has announced a teaming up with Komodo for the release of the Steam Deck in Asia. This is absolutely massive considering the size of the potential playerbase there, and the continued expansion only continue to show how all-in Valve are with this device.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>"We hope that gamers in Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan agree with us that the performance and design of the Steam Deck makes it a great way to play the games they know and love," said Gabe Newell, President and CEO of Valve.</p>
<p>"We are very excited to be working with Komodo to bring Steam Deck to Asia. We have worked with the team at Komodo for years, and we have high confidence that they'll help us make customers very happy," says Greg Coomer of Valve.</p>
<p>"We are honored to deliver Steam Deck to gamers in Asia, and look forward to showcasing it and our first in-house game in Kyoto this weekend and at Tokyo Game Show next month," said Ricky Uy, CEO of Komodo.</p>
<p>Reservations for Asia will use a different reservation queue, so it will not affect anywhere else.</p>
<p>The first units are targeted to arrive in Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan late this year which can be ordered from the dedicated Steam Deck site on <a href="https://steamdeck.komodo.jp" target="_blank">Komodo</a>. It will start off with Japan with additional units going on to Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan "in the weeks immediately following". Not only that, Valve also plans to be at BitSummit and the Tokyo Game Show.</p>
<p>Starting prices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ľ59,800 in Japan</li>
<li>NT$ 13,380 in Taiwan</li>
<li>HK$ 3,288 in Hong Kong</li>
<li>KRW 589,000 in Korea</li>
</ul>
<p>From the site, it looks like Asia will be getting a slightly different type of carrying case too:</p>

      <title>Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man Remastered is Steam Deck Verified ahead of release</title>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news web slingers, as Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered from Insomniac Games and Nixxes Software has been Steam Deck Verified ahead of the upcoming release. This is the upgraded version of the previously PlayStation exclusive, that launches on Steam on August 12th.</p>
<p>Insomniac Games shared the news on their official <a href="https://twitter.com/insomniacgames/status/1554903491184939009" target="_blank">Twitter</a> account today, so either they've been testing directly or someone lucky at Valve got to swing around for a while.
