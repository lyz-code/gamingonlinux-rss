      <title>AMD FSR 3 arrived today in two games - source code later</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AMD today announced that FidelityFX Super Resolution 3 (FSR 3) is now available in two games: Forspoken and Immortals of Aveum but the source code isn't up yet.</p>
<p>In regards to the source code being on GitHub like they've done with previous versions they simply said it "will be made available soon on GPUOpen with a permissive open source MIT license" so it could be later today, tomorrow or next month.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20967262921696011520gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20967262921696011520gol1.jpg"/></a><em>AMD FSR 3 Data Flow, Credit: AMD</em></p>
<p>More games are planning to have FSR 3 added in like Eve Online, Frostpunk 2, Space Marine 2, Cyberpunk 2077, Squad, Crimson Desert, Avatar Frontiers of Pandora and more.</p>
<p>It's not clear currently how exactly FSR3 will work on Linux with Proton (or any future Native Linux games that get it). It's likely Proton will need some upgrades to support it properly. Testing the demo of Forspoken, which was also updated, just results in massive flickering issues making it quite unplayable and I really <strong>wouldn't</strong> recommend anyone try it as it will probably cause some seizures. As for Immortals of Aveum it seems FSR3 makes it <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/7140" target="_blank">crash</a>.</p>
<p>At least once it gets fixed up properly on Linux, we might see some nice performance boosts from it.</p>
<p>See the AMD <a href="https://gpuopen.com/fsr3-in-games-technical-details/" target="_blank">blog post</a> for more.</p>

      <title>Historical 4x strategy game Old World gets an Egyptian-themed DLC on October 4</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The third DLC for Old World, a 4x strategy game that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/old-world-from-the-civilization-iv-designer-releases-on-steam-along-with-linux-support/" target="_blank">came to Steam with Linux support last year</a> (after being Epic exclusive) is getting an Egyptian-themed DLC on October 4th going through 400 years of Egyptian history with a new narrative campaign. <em>I was rather impressed with it when I checked it out originally.</em></p>
<p>During the story-driven campaign you'll go through the rise and fall of the Kingdom of Kemet (the old name for Egypt) from its initial founding, through its golden age and internal struggles against powerful religious factions, culminating in the Bronze Age collapse and something about "Sea People". With unique mechanics to keep you busy plus this DLC also adds Kingdom of Kush to the sandbox campaign. Overall it sounds like a great addition to the game.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zU_dH1jHgD4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/db3d61dcd5c2140cc45dbc2c64a61a2e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zU_dH1jHgD4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>DLC Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unification:</strong> Start as a small regional power and establish one of the greatest empires of the old world. Lead Thebes against Hyksos and Kerma to unify Kemet and begin The New Kingdom Period.</li>
<li><strong>Dawn of a Golden Age:</strong> Expand your domain into the Levant, Libya, and Nubia, dotting the lands with obelisks and building the Temple of Karnak before erecting a Mortuary Temple and immortalizing your name.</li>
<li>T<strong>he Amarna Period:</strong> Engage in a unique holy war as you fight to establish the world’s first monotheistic religion – defeat cults of pagan gods and partake in battles of faith and conviction.</li>
<li><strong>The Battle of Qadesh:</strong> Play as Pharaoh Ramesses the Great and confront the Hittites in the largest chariot battle in the history of the world.</li>
<li><strong>Hearts of Kemet:</strong> Embrace the concept of Ma’at and seek victory through balance. As the High Priests grow stronger, your goal as Pharaoh Merneptah is to restore a sense of order.</li>
<li><strong>The Sea People:</strong> The Bronze Age Collapse threatens everything you have built over 300 years - how long will your empire hold against the onslaught of this previously unknown threat?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can buy the game on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/old-world?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/597180/Old_World/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Sadly <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/old_world" target="_blank">GOG</a> still doesn't have the Linux version.</p>
<p>The game has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Playable.</p>

      <title>Creature-collecting life-sim Moonstone Island is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a curious blend of deck-building, creature-collecting and a little sprinkle of a life-sim, Moonstone Island is a colourful and very inviting game to add to your collection. It comes with full Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified. Note: key provided by Raw Fury.</p>
<p>Taking some inspiration from Studio Ghibli classics like Kiki’s Delivery Service, Castle in the Sky and more this is a real gem for people who want a more laid-back experience.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_Hb0CjBNQss"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5a2b7eae94a1fa0178968097bdb0ffa8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_Hb0CjBNQss" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explore a Wondrous World</strong>: Travel by balloon, broom, and glider through unique biomes to reach the farthest edges of the sky.</li>
<li><strong>Settle Into Your New Home</strong>: Build, decorate and customize a cozy new home of your own on any of the 100 islands in your procedurally generated world.</li>
<li><strong>Make New Friends &amp; More</strong>: Become a true member of the community – befriend your NPC neighbors, go on dates, and fall in love!</li>
<li><strong>Discover Wild Spirit Companions</strong>: Tame and befriend wild Spirits to fight alongside you in card-based combat.</li>
<li><strong>Go Dungeon Crawling</strong>: Explore dungeons to earn upgrades, collect loot and uncover secrets.</li>
<li><strong>Become a Full-fledged Alchemist</strong>: Optimize your alchemist with unique skills and upgrades, and craft dozens of items and vehicles to prepare for the treacherous wilderness.</li>
<li><strong>Build Your Own Farm</strong>: Grow crops and flowers to brew potions and tame Spirits!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It works great on desktop Linux, although at times it seems the Steam Overlay refused to work. Running it with <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope" target="_blank">Gamescope</a> seemed to get it to work though. There's also some minor stutter while exploring, which is a known issue they're working to improve. Other than that, I haven't encountered any problems so it's good to see another nice release.</p>
<p>Absolutely love the setting, it's just so ridiculously charming and sweet. The exploring is definitely interesting too, quite different to other similar games since it's all based on islands. Although, the exploration is a little slow to begin with, since after the intro you're making use of just a balloon (yes really — dangerous much?!) which also uses up your energy. But eventually you'll get more tools to explore a bit quicker.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14672921751696002675gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14672921751696002675gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3816406321696002887gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3816406321696002887gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em>Sure hope I don't have a bird strike…</em></p>
<p>Overall it really does seem like a lovely game that I've enjoyed exploring and finding new creatures, while going through many quests. The blending of all the different genres together is a bit odd at first but it really does work quite well. Always fun to see how other developers explore creature-collecting like this. Exactly the type of game you're going to want on Steam Deck too, with the colder months coming in - nice to cozy up with.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1092359921696003610gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1092359921696003610gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>How long is it? You can expect somewhere around 40-50 hours, so it's certainly not a short game and once you finish the main story you'll be able to continue after in a more sandbox like way to just keep on doing your thing. It's a single-player game too, with no current plans to add in co-op.</p>
<p>This is one you don't want to miss out out. Wonderful.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/moonstone-island?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1658150/Moonstone_Island/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>EA expanding EA Anti-Cheat - bad news for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>EA (Electronic Arts) are continuing to expand their home-grown EA Anti-Cheat, with an <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/eaac-and-battlefield-2042?setLocale=en-gb" target="_blank">announcement</a> that Battlefield 2042 is also moving over to it.</p>
<p>This <em>isn't</em> actually something entirely new though, as it was given a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/ea-anticheat-could-spell-trouble-for-steam-deck-linux/" target="_blank">Deep Dive</a> back in 2022 and released with Fifa 23 that same year, and it's also in the newly released EA SPORTS FC 24. Battlefield is definitely not the first game to get it but it's a growing issue.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that it doesn't work on Linux / Steam Deck, with it being blocked by EA. It's a kernel-mode anti-cheat and anti-tamper solution, which as we've seen from other anti-cheats is particularly problematic for Linux / Steam Deck. And it's likely EA will continue to use it with new games, and potentially get other older games updated to use it too. So if they got Respawn to switch over to it, this would kill Apex Legends on Linux / Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>Fifa 23 and EA SPORTS FC 24 are rated Unsupported on Linux / Steam Deck due to it, and while Battlefield 2042 previously used Easy Anti-Cheat, they never bothered to hook up support for that on Linux anyway (even though EAC supports Linux), so it's just going to continue to be Unsupported.</p>
<p>We can only hope that Valve are keeping an eye on the situation and speak to EA to eventually get support for it on Linux / Steam Deck with Proton.</p>

      <title>Epic Games sheds 830 people due to &#39;spending way more money than we earn&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recent industry news doing the rounds is from Epic Games, who yesterday <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/layoffs-at-epic" target="_blank">publicly</a> shared an email that was sent by Tim Sweeney about laying off 16% of the company. 830 people lost their job due to "spending way more money than we earn" as they continue "investing in the next evolution of Epic and growing Fortnite as a metaverse-inspired ecosystem for creators".</p>
<p>That is a lot of people, and clearly shows that Epic Games have been relying a lot on Fortnite money. While Fortnite is "starting to grow again" Sweeney said it's being driven now by player-made content which has "significant revenue sharing, and this is a lower margin business than we had when Fortnite Battle Royale took off and began funding our expansion".</p>
<p>In the post Sweeney mentioned how Epic has been making efforts to reduce costs like "moving to net zero hiring and cutting operating spend on things like marketing and events" but all of this "ended up far short of financial sustainability" so getting rid of staff was "the only way" they could stabilize.</p>
<p>Epic is also selling off Bandcamp to B2B music company Songtradr, which they only acquired in 2022, as clearly they didn't actually have a business plan for it to sell it off so quickly. They're also spinning off most of SuperAwesome that they acquired in 2020, <a href="https://www.superawesome.com/blog/superawesome-leadership-to-acquire-company-from-epic-games/" target="_blank">who say</a> they are acquiring most of it back themselves directly.</p>
<p>Psyonix, maker of Rocket League, was <a href="https://twitter.com/FlashFerret/status/1707435527933202442" target="_blank">also</a><small>(1)</small> <a href="https://twitter.com/TedGabbard/status/1707428404822528157" target="_blank">affected</a><small>(2)</small> since Epic acquired them back in 2019 and then made it exclusive to the Epic Store.</p>
<p>The developer Mediatonic who made Fall Guys was also impacted by this, since Epic acquired them in 2021 and then made Fall Guys exclusive to the Epic Store. It's not clear how badly they've been affected but Ed Fear (Game Lead) who was laid off showed off a <a href="https://twitter.com/edfear/status/1707454892900491620" target="_blank">picture</a> on X that showed "Decimated", with many others also posting about being let go so Mediatonic appears to have been hit quite hard by this.</p>
<p>No doubt the exclusives and constant free games on the Epic Store cost a lot of monies.</p>

      <title>Check out the awesome demo of Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is an upcoming spin-off of the very popular online co-op mining action game Deep Rock Galactic, and now a public demo is up so you can try it too and you really should try this one.</p>
<p>It's taking the base mechanics and style from Deep Rock Galactic but blending it with a Vampire Survivor-like setting. So you run through a level mining, while fighting off waves of enemies. As you do this you collect gems to level-up, get new weapons, upgrade weapons and more. Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor does things just a bit differently to the rest of the VS clones though, enough to make it quite unique.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15460179691695911456gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15460179691695911456gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Not only does it have destructible terrain to mine through, but you're also collecting resources here too. Once you've finished off a boss, you then get a drop-ship mine down to you that you have to make it into to finish the level. After that, you'll then get the chance to buy some upgrades with your hard-earned mined resources. This prepares you for the next level, where you'll repeat this loop a few times. In contrast to other similar titles having you go through a certain time on one single level, it's a nice tweak to the idea.</p>
<p>On Linux, it works without any issue I can see using Proton Experimental and performance seems great on my desktop.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16430436161695911639gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16430436161695911639gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Meanwhile on Steam Deck testing also with Proton Experimental on SteamOS 3.5 Preview, it's also running very nicely overall. Most of the time sitting around 60FPS, with occasional dips when there's some big explosive action but it soon sorts itself back out. It also looks quite fantastic on the Steam Deck screen, this could easily be my next game to play in bed when I'm supposed to be sleeping. Text could do with being a little bigger though, which I've asked them to do.</p>
<p>Outside of the levels there's also permanent progression too, using the resources collected during a run.</p>
<p>Looks to be another good entry into the reverse-bullet hell / bullet heaven / survivor-like genre. It's due to enter Early Access later this year. The demo will be available from now until after Steam Next Fest in October, and they plan to keep it up for a week or two after it ends so you've got plenty of time to try it out.</p>

      <title>EU court upholds fine against Valve for geo-blocking</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/04/the-eu-is-going-after-valve-and-others-for-geo-blocking-a-statement-from-valve/" target="_blank">Back in 2019</a> the EU went after Valve and select publishers on Steam for geo-blocking, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/01/valve-and-others-fined-by-the-european-commission-for-geo-blocking/" target="_blank">then in 2021</a> they were issued fines which naturally was appealed but it has been <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2023-09/cp230147en.pdf" target="_blank">dismissed</a> so it's likely Valve will now have to pay up.</p>
<p>As per the <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2023-09/cp230147en.pdf" target="_blank">press release</a> from September 27th it notes Valve and five games publishers including Bandai, Capcom, Focus Home, Koch Media and ZeniMax infringed EU competition law.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Commission found that Valve and the five publishers had participated in a group of anti-competitive agreements or concerted practices which were intended to restrict cross-border sales of certain PC video games that were compatible with the Steam platform, by putting in place territorial control functionalities during different periods between 2010 and 2015, in particular the Baltic countries and certain countries in central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Valve brought an action before the General Court of the European Union, seeking to have the decision annulled in<br/>
so far as it related to it.</p>
<p>In its judgment delivered today, the General Court dismisses the action.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To sum up: Valve allowed the use of Steam keys that were locked to specific regions in the EU, preventing other regions from getting them cheaper which is a breach of EU rules. Valve did already stop doing this years ago as this happened between 2010 and 2015, so this is a more of a historical case that Valve tried fighting on copyright grounds that the EU rejected so they will have to pay the full €1.6m fine.</p>

      <title>Steam Play tool for Native Linux gaming &#39;Luxtorpeda&#39; v67 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Luxtorpeda has a new release out which is mostly upgrades behind the scenes, but worth an upgrade to get the best experience. Read on for more on what's changed and what Luxtorpeda does.</p>
<p>So what does it do? You use it in Steam Play just like you would set a game to use Proton but you set it to Luxtorpeda instead. Luxtorpeda enables you to download Native Linux game engines for various games on Steam. So it would help you get OpenMW for Morrowind, as just one example (many more <a href="https://luxtorpeda-dev.github.io/" target="_blank">available</a>), directly in Steam.</p>
<p>Here's what's changed in v67:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Support copying steam input template from engine.</li>
<li>Update godot controller icons addon.</li>
<li>Remove unnecessary code and dependency around xdg_runtime_dir.</li>
<li>Improve actions time - use built godot export &amp; actions to setup environment.</li>
<li>Build process improvements.</li>
<li>Update to Godot 4.</li>
<li>Request steam app install for steam app id dependencies.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>How to use it? Be sure to check <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/steam-deck-using-luxtorpeda-for-morrowind-warzone-2100-and-x-com/" target="_blank">my previous article</a> but to save you a click here's a video from before. It works the same on Steam Deck as it does desktop Linux.</p>

      <title>Zombie survival in your city – Infection Free Zone</title>
      <author>Etienne Mahler</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What would you do if there were zombies right in your neighborhood? Would you maybe head to the closest supermarket you usually shop at, check out the old police station where your uncle used to work for some guns, or even consider hitting up that pharmacy run by the grumpy lady who always gave you the creeps? Well, that's pretty much the deal with Infection Free Zone. <em>Tested on Linux Mint with Proton Experimental.</em></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nBbVO5tMBn0?rel=0&amp;start=0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bb218ec1f5a32cbbea35bb05b2296358.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nBbVO5tMBn0?rel=0&amp;start=0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Infection Free Zone, cooked up by Jutsu Games and published by Games Operators, drops us right into a post-apocalyptic world that's been flattened by the relentless “Mad Virus”. As survivors in abandoned cities, we're tasked with setting up an “Infection-Free Zone”, repurposing buildings, beefing up our defenses, and scavenging for supplies. Every night, those infected creatures come at us, and we've got to defend our base. We can also do some research and trade with other survivors, though not everyone will be our friend.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal here is pretty straightforward yet challenging: lead our group of survivors, construct a base that can take care of itself, and fend off wave after wave of infected. In this quick look at the game's demo, I’ll delve into the gameplay and see what makes Infection Free Zone stand out.</p>
<p>Infection Free Zone is an intriguing mix of city-building and survival strategy. We're busy setting up our home base, repurposing buildings, and putting up defenses. The whole repurposing thing is a bit different from the usual city builders. Instead of just plopping down new buildings wherever we want, we've got to work with what's already there. It adds a layer of strategy, especially when it comes to defending the base. Some buildings, though, we can place wherever we like, like defense towers.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13786912631695842095gol14998.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13786912631695842095gol14998.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Now, what makes this game super cool is not just how tough it can get, but also the fact that it uses real geographic data from OpenStreetMap. You can explore neighborhoods you know or discover new cities. In my test, I actually found the streets in the game also on Google Maps at the correct location.</p>
<p>When the full game comes out, you should be able to pick any city from around the world. The developers even say they've included specific buildings and their original purposes from OpenStreetMap. So, if you know where the supermarket is in your real world location, it should be right there in the game. I couldn't try this out in the demo because this function is not in the demo, though.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17377409421695842150gol14998.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17377409421695842150gol14998.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>By the way, the game's main designer said in an interview that editing OpenStreetMap doesn't affect the game because the developers use their own version for it. Also, the devs promise different day and night cycles based on the city you pick and the season. It adds some variety to the game.</p>
<p>But this whole city map thing did lead to some weird moments in my test. For example, I saw German signs in a Chinese city. Still, the game's customization options are impressive, and I'd love to start in my current home base, Hanoi, or a little German town.</p>
<p>During my test in the German version, aside from those odd signs, there were some translation issues. Like when I ran out of wood, it said “draußen Holz” (lit. “outside wood”), which probably meant “out of wood”. It was a bit strange, but I think the devs will keep working on the German translation. If you play in English, I'd guess there are fewer translation problems. Either way, it didn't ruin the fun of the game.</p>
<p>And trust me, it's a lot of fun, especially because of how challenging it is. At the start, it feels like your typical strategy game. We've got a base, workers, and soldiers, but we don't directly control the workers; we give them orders, and they do their thing.</p>
<p>One downside is that in open construction projects where we're short on resources, workers tend to get stuck instead of going to get what we need. For example, I couldn't build three fields at one point because I ran out of wood. But my workers just stood there waiting for the wood instead of going to find it. I could solve it by manually moving them away, but it'd be better if they did it automatically in a game like this.</p>
<p>The day and night cycle in Infection Free Zone is super important. During the day, our workers do their tasks, and at night, they hide in our headquarters or specially converted safe houses. Same goes for our squads, these little teams of four that we move around the city during the day to find supplies. Squads also fight for us, with four individual weapons and a shared ammo pool. When that pool's empty, they switch to melee weapons. I thought the day and night cycle went by pretty fast compared to what my squads could do in a day.</p>
<p>Just like with workers, it's a good idea to get squads in a safe house at night because it gets way more dangerous when it's dark. Zombie hordes roam around our base and even directly attack it.</p>
<p>My first night was pretty quiet, but on the second night, a bunch of hordes came right at me. Overall, my first playthrough was really challenging, and I eventually lost because I ran out of ammo, leaving my base nearly defenseless. Even though my squads could fight with melee weapons, they didn't stand a chance against all those zombies.</p>
<p>Besides the tough battles, there are other things that make the game realistic. For example, having a car is super important in this world. We can use it to gather resources, get around faster, and run over enemies. When we send a squad in a car to a house, they get out, collect stuff, and stash it in the car. Same thing when they come back to base, and it all happens smoothly with minimal clicking, which is great. But you've got to be careful with the car because you'll run out of fuel, and it might need repairs. Still, having a car can be the difference between survival and getting wiped out in Infection Free Zone.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13263630641695842159gol14998.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13263630641695842159gol14998.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>In terms of performance and sound, I had pretty stable frame rates, around 38 to 40 frames per second on my Linux Mint system with the game’s default settings. AMD Ryzen 5 2600 (12) @ 3.400GH / GeForce GTX 1660 SUPER.</p>
<p>It wasn't perfectly smooth, but it was definitely playable without any problems. However, I can't say for sure if this will hold up when bigger hordes of infected show up and start swarming my base.</p>
<p>The sound effects and background noises are okay, nothing extraordinary but they do the job. It's nice that all the dialogue is voiced, although it's just in English right now. As for the music, there's not much to say; it's got this eerie ambient sound that fits the game's atmosphere.</p>
<p>But here's one gripe: the wolf sounds were way too loud and not cool at all. I had to turn down the volume while playing, and that made other in-game sounds basically inaudible.</p>
<p>To sum it up, Infection Free Zone is a gripping and tough game that realistically portrays a post-apocalyptic world. Being able to pick real-world locations on the map is a cool twist, and I can't wait to play in my hometown.</p>
<p>In the full game, the devs promise over 40 buildings, different types of infected, research missions, 10 types of vehicles with upgrades, more weapons, and 30 kinds of events. That sounds like a lot, and I'm excited about the full version, though it remains unclear when the game is going to be released.</p>
<p>You can try the demo yourself <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1465460/Infection_Free_Zone/" target="_blank">on Steam</a>.</p>

<p>If you're after benchmarks, it seems they sent <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/raspberry-pi-5-benchmarks" target="_blank">Phoronix</a> an early unit. Going by their benchmarks, it really is an impressive leap over the RPi4. I'm trying to convince myself I don't need it…</p>
<p>With new hardware, comes new software, and so they will also be releasing a brand new version of their first-party Raspberry Pi OS, built on top of the most recent Debian release and that will release mid-October shortly before the RPi5 launches officially in late-October.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/introducing-raspberry-pi-5/" target="_blank">announcement post</a> goes over a little history, including a note about how they managed to sell over 14 million of the RPi4 which is pretty impressive.</p>

      <title>Counter-Strike 2 is out now with Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Counter-Strike 2 from Valve is now officially out and comes with Native Linux support, so it's time to say goodbye to Global Offensive as it has been replaced.</p>
<p>"A free upgrade to CS:GO, Counter-Strike 2 marks the largest technical leap in Counter-Strike’s history. Built on the Source 2 engine, Counter-Strike 2 is modernized with realistic physically-based rendering, state of the art networking, and upgraded Community Workshop tools." — Valve</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nSE38xjMLqE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5ef67c9198a60b5658d8b1b551a0bc2c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nSE38xjMLqE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

<p>Are you as excited as I am? Proton is already pretty amazing, but just think how many upgrades it will have between now and next year — it should run great. I'll be checking it out, will you be? I'm very curious to see how the Steam Deck and my desktop will handle it.</p>
<p>Definitely loving the recent trend of more ports coming to PC so we can all enjoy such games.</p>

      <title>MangoHud v0.7 out now adding presets support like on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud" target="_blank">MangoHud</a>, the awesome tool you can use to get a HUD on top of your games (included by default on the Steam Deck), has released version <a href="https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud/releases/tag/v0.7.0" target="_blank">0.7.0</a> that includes many new options so here's what's changed.</p>
<p>As an example of what it can do, see the shots below playing War Thunder with MangoHud at the top:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20378186511695813255gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20378186511695813255gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20680958691695813254gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20680958691695813254gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Click screenshots to enlarge. If you like my horizontal layout it can be found <a href="https://gist.github.com/LiamDawe/9dd62ccf43635c25050f3cc0e7aaf109" target="_blank">here</a>. The second shot is just "full".</p>
<p>A bunch of new parameters were added in 0.7.0 including:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">gpu_fan</code> displays the gpu fan RPM, only works on AMD.</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">gpu_junction_temp</code> displays the junction temperature on AMD GPUs</li>
<li>removed <code class="inline-code">io_stats</code>, just use <code class="inline-code">io_read</code> and <code class="inline-code">io_write</code> instead</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">engine_short_names</code> shortens the names of engines, e.g <code class="inline-code">VULKAN</code> becomes <code class="inline-code">VK</code></li>
<li><code class="inline-code">text_outline</code> adds a colored outline around all text</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">text_outline_color</code> sets the color of the outline, default: <code class="inline-code">000000</code></li>
<li><code class="inline-code">text_outline_thickness</code> sets the thickness of the outline, default: <code class="inline-code">1.5</code></li>
<li><code class="inline-code">temp_fahrenheit</code> changes all temps to fahrenheit from celsius</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">dynamic_frame_timing</code> dynamically changes the range of the frametime graph</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">duration</code> displays the time since mangohud initialized</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">gpu_voltage</code> shows the current gpu voltage, only works on AMD</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">fps_text</code> override fps text</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">horizontal_stretch</code> sets the background to stretch across width of application (enabled by default)</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">core_bars</code> turns <code class="inline-code">core_load</code> into a histogram</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">device_battery</code> Shows battery level of wireless devices, accepts <code class="inline-code">gamepad</code> <code class="inline-code">mouse</code></li>
<li><code class="inline-code">device_battery_icon</code> shows battery icon instead of percent</li>
</ul>
<p>A nice new feature is the addition of support for different presets, just like found on the Steam Deck in the performance menu, where you switch between different HUD layouts. Giving you the ability to set your own, and easily switch between them with a hotkey (although that switching only works on X11 right now). You need to add a <em>preset.conf</em> file to <code class="inline-code">~/.config/MangoHud/</code>. I gave an example of this in my SteamOS 3.5 Preview video (at around 05:00):</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="A7oxT6oSun0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/90715eb9d2857067cc78c8913d4414b1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/A7oxT6oSun0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>So you can now do the same on desktop with MangoHud 0.7.0.</p>
<p>What do you think to the new release? Do you use MangoHud? Let me know in the comments.</p>

      <title>The Talos Principle 2 from Croteam launches November 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Croteam and Devolver Digital have announced that The Talos Principle 2 is now set for launch on November 2, and it looks to be an impressive follow-up to the previous game which is easily one of the best puzzle games ever made.</p>
<p>More about it:"Set in a distant future where humankind has long been extinct, human culture lives on through interminable robots made in our image. Embarking on a quest to investigate a mysterious megastructure, you will be confronted with questions about the nature of the cosmos, faith versus reason, and the fear of repeating humankind's mistakes.</p>
<p>Familiar puzzles will return in The Talos Principle II, accompanied by unique new gameplay including mind transference and gravity manipulation. There's also a deep character-driven story with multiple endings to lose yourself in, and a series of strange, stunningly beautiful environments to explore—including a city on the brink of a paradigm shift and an island holding the keys to the future."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2NgMGOuoAiA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9d36bf836281b76d94716a61714282d1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2NgMGOuoAiA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This time there's no Native Linux support, so you'll need to run it with Proton. One of Croteam's co-founders, who was involved in a lot of their Linux work also left quite some time ago, and joined Google for Stadia before its collapse. Croteam also swapped from their own tech to Unreal Engine for this one so it will be interesting to see how things have changed overall for the sequel.</p>
<p>Will you be picking it up?</p>
<p>It will be available on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/the-talos-principle-2?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/835960/The_Talos_Principle_2/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Survive The Fog is an upcoming third-person survivor-like action rogue-lite</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One day I may get over my fascination with anything remotely inspired by the popularity of Vampire Survivors but it is not today. Survive The Fog is another one, but this one makes it more like a third-person action game.</p>
<p>More about it: "Survive the Fog is a fast-paced action rogue-lite, with a lot of different builds for each class. The game is all about fighting massive hordes of enemies while experimenting with different combinations of powers and spells. Different characters provide you with various way to approach the battle."</p>
<p>Must admit, this looks like it could end up pretty intense! Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="s7LoGwho3LE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0e723daa442e85ae2b7fddb6124fb748.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/s7LoGwho3LE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Seems like it's going to have some nice variety in the runs too with different classes to play through, along with a bunch of events that happen as you progress through a run. These events include meteor showers, healing areas, gluttonous chests to chase down and more. Lots of upgrades during a run along with meta upgrades for permanent unlocks too, all the standard stuff you've come to love about bullet heaven survivor-likes.</p>
<p>When asked about Linux support on Steam, the developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2180250/discussions/0/3880470762777110655/#c3882722797148211305" target="_blank">confirmed</a> they plan Linux support:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Currently only versions of Windows are supported. I have plans in the future to extend that to Linux, Mac and possibly consoles. But this wont be available on early access launch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So until they you can either try your luck with Proton at the EA launch or wait and see.</p>

      <title>Tony Hawk&#39;s Pro Skater 1+2 Finally Coming To Steam</title>
      <author>Smellbringer</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After almost three agonizing years of waiting, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2, the excellent remake of the first two classic Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games, has been announced for a<a href="https://twitter.com/TonyHawkTheGame/status/1706718375270138282" target="_blank"> Steam release on October 3</a>. Ever since its launch in 2020, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 has been an Epic Games Store exclusive for PC Gamers. The game never even made the jump to Activision-Blizzard's exclusive Battle.net launcher, which struck many as odd.</p>
<p>Since then though fans have been waiting for the game's great PC port to make its way to Steam and be free of the EGS exclusivity limbo. But after 3 years it'd be safe to say that many had given up hope of a re-release. Especially with the follow up, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4, being <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawk-confirms-plans-for-pro-skater-3-4-remake-were-abandoned-after-blizzard-merger" target="_blank">canceled</a> and developer Vicarious Visions being <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23022627/vicarious-visions-merged-blizzard-entertainment-albany" target="_blank">absorbed by Blizzard</a>. So to see 1+2 come to Steam is a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/290722581695807706gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/290722581695807706gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>We know the Steam Deck can handle 60FPS in this game from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKF0Gu9dcS8" target="_blank">testing done on the EGS version</a>, and Activision's Steam Deck support has been pretty great as long as it isn't Call of Duty. So I think it's safe to expect Steam Deck support either Day 1 or Week 1, which is pretty exciting given the Switch version has a 30 fps cap and that's the only other portable version so far.</p>
<p>You can wishlist Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2395210/Tony_Hawks_Pro_Skater_1__2/" target="_blank">Steam</a> now.</p>

      <title>ChimeraOS Linux 44 out now with improved support for various handhelds</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://chimeraos.org/" target="_blank">ChimeraOS</a> is a Linux distribution designed for gamers, especially if you're wanting to get something similar to SteamOS on a handheld similar to the Steam Deck like the ROG Ally. The latest release ChimeraOS 44, has just gone out with improvements pretty much everywhere!</p>
<p>This release comes with Linux 6.5.3, OpenGamepadUI 0.21.7 and Mesa 23.1.7. The list of fixes for various hardware is quite long too you can expect to see improvements for the ROG Ally, AYANEO Air Plus, GPD Win4, Aya Neo 2 and Aya Neo Geek, and various Ayn Loki devices.</p>
<p>ChimeraOS also now has a dynamic swapfile, which they said "has been reported to boost a lot of games". The default is 1GB like the Steam Deck and it's compatible with tools like CryoUtilities. Their version of Gamescope will also now no longer need you to set the resolution per-game to play at resolutions over 720p. Additionally they said that AMD GPU hands / resets should now just automatically restart Gamescope instead of crashing and needing a hard reset.</p>
<p>Emulation has also been improved as they fixed saved games not working on PSP games and they adjusted settings for PlayStation 2 and Nintendo 64 to prevent some graphical issues in some games.</p>
<p>Work has also continued on <a href="https://github.com/ShadowBlip/OpenGamepadUI" target="_blank">OpenGamepadUI</a>, an alternative front-end to Steam Big Picture, which now includes Performance Profile per-game, Power Tools support for "the entire AMD 7000 APU series" along with various input improvements.</p>

      <title>Tropico 6 adds modding support with mod.io, and a new DLC next month</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tropico 6 from Realmforge Studios and Kalypso Media just had a nice upgrade that gives official modding support, with <a href="https://mod.io/" target="_blank">mod.io</a> integration. Interesting to see more games go for mod.io (from the Mod DB crew), which gives the same access to modding across all platforms and stores whereas the Steam Workshop is of course locked to Steam.</p>
<p>Nice to see, since modding support can expand the life of a game nearly forever, and we've seen truly amazing mods for other games and Tropico 6 seems like a great fit to have it. Some of the things you can do with mods:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">Create your own maps - Get ready to create your own maps based on existing or randomly generated ones.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">The whole world at your fingertips - Modify, tweak or replace every asset in the game. Or create your own.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">All the debug-tools you need - Access to all debug modes that the developers are using.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">It's in the blueprints - Use Unreal Blueprints to add gameplay or new UI elements.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They have various videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLITnGW6b6ufBeXc9xVylvL_9utI6HspBV" target="_blank">YouTube</a> going over how to do the modding.</p>
<p>Additionally a new "Going Viral" DLC is planned to launch on October 12th.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2529175031695733526gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2529175031695733526gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Tropico 6 - Going Viral DLC</em></p>
<p>Going Viral DLC Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Find the cure, with Tropico 6 – Going Viral: 4 different diseases</strong> hit Tropico and disrupt daily life; some may severely harm your citizens, others may be just a mild cough *cough*.</li>
<li><strong>Pull the strings &amp; keep control</strong> in a <strong>4 mission-campaign</strong> or fight the diseases on a <strong>new multiplayer map</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Stay calm… or don’t!</strong> Influence the masses with the new <strong>“Panic” mechanic</strong>. The <strong>panic meter</strong> measures how the Tropican citizens feel about the diseases. High panic allows for more powerful edicts to be enacted. Should you raise the alarm in order to exploit the situation with powerful edicts, or keep the population calm in the face of a potentially deadly threat?</li>
<li><strong>Inject first, ask later:</strong> A host of <strong>16 exciting new edicts</strong> will be unlocked as your <strong>panic meter</strong> rises and will give you different ways in which to exploit the disease in Tropico: <strong>Inject first</strong>, ask questions later, mandate <strong>masks</strong>, or choose to gear up for a <strong>viral palace party</strong>, it’s all up to you, El Presidente!</li>
<li><strong>Managing the disease: 9 new buildings</strong> will change the way you manage Tropico and how you deal with outbreaks and diseases. Use the <strong>Healing Howitzer</strong> to speedily distribute the cure to your Tropicans or build the new <strong>Colossal Hospital</strong> to increase your medical capacities and place <strong>Medical Checkpoints</strong> on the streets to find infected people.<br/>
In addition, during the campaign a curious <strong>quack</strong> will also help you manage the disease in <strong>Ambrosius’ Magic Hut</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Fight the plague in style with new design options for El Presidente &amp; the palace!</strong> With new accessories like the plague doctor for El Presidente or the Medical Fencing for your palace, you'll be perfectly prepared.</li>
</ul>

      <title>2.5D puzzle platformer Seedlings has some great photography-based visuals</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seedlings really is a visual treat, and quite a fun puzzle-platformer too that released on 22nd September from Bardsley Creative. If you're after something a little unusual, this is it. <em>Note: key provided by the developer to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4218320-GamingOnLinux/" target="_blank">our Steam Curator</a>. Go give it a follow for game recommendations!</em></p>
<p>Not only is it a treat for your eyes, it's a treat for your ears to. The audio work on this is wonderful too. Really just beautiful, and while it is a puzzle-platformer it's surprisingly relaxing too thanks to the setting. This is the type of game where you need to grab a cuppa, get cozy and just play it through. The creature design is interesting too, with you being a seed that takes over various tree/twig-like <em>things</em>.</p>

      <title>Megaquarium: Deep Freeze is the biggest DLC yet for the aquarium building sim</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>An often overlooked gem is Megaquarium, a game where you build your very own aquarium but developer Twice Circled is still expanding it with Megaquarium: Deep Freeze announced.</p>
<p>They say this is the biggest and most ambitious expansion so far with it adding in popular elements from previous expansions plus loads of brand new features including a five-level campaign.

      <title>SteamVR 2.0 Beta released with a big UI overhaul</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have now released a Beta for SteamVR 2.0, which brings with it a much needed overhaul to the interface along with lots of new features. Work towards whatever <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/linux-updates-tease-valve-galileo-and-sephiroth-steam-deck-refresh-or-new-vr/" target="_blank">Galileo and Sephiroth</a> are? The long-leaked Deckard probably.</p>
<p>In the announcement Valve note it's the "first major step toward our goal of bringing all of what's new on the Steam platform into VR". To access it you need to be in the Steam Client Beta and then opt into the Beta for SteamVR too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12475313341695723073gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12475313341695723073gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Image - Valve - SteamVR 2.0</em></p>
<p>This integrates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most of the current features of Steam and Steam Deck are now part of SteamVR</li>
<li>Updated keyboard with support for new languages, emojis, and themes</li>
<li>Integration of Steam Chat and Voice Chat</li>
<li>Improved Store that puts new and popular VR releases front and center</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8494607591695723093gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8494607591695723093gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Image - Valve - SteamVR 2.0</em></p>
<p>Here's the rest of the changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>SteamVR:</div>
<ul>
<li>Floating overlay windows can now be interacted with while the dashboard is hidden.</li>
<li>Fixed crash on exit for some Unity titles.</li>
<li>Increased the system layer resolution limit. This was previously 1.5x the recommended render target scale, but is now applied to width and height independently.</li>
<li>Fix a case where controller configuration would not be localized in the user’s preferred language (as configured in Steam).</li>
<li>Added a prompt to install the Bigscreen Beyond Driver when the headset is detected.</li>
</ul>
<div>Meta:</div>
<ul>
<li>Hide the SteamVR IPD slider since Meta already shows one.</li>
</ul>
<div>Linux</div>
<ul>
<li>Transition to the Steam Linux Runtime 3.0 (sniper) for improved compatibility.</li>
</ul>
<div>Drivers:</div>
<ul>
<li>For drivers which provide a manifest but don’t specify “resourceOnly”, default to true if there is no bin directory.</li>
<li>Add a manifest entry "showEnableInSettings" which can be set to force a driver to appear in the “addons” settings even if default rules would hide it.</li>
<li>When a specific driver is forced with the "forcedDriver" setting or the VR_FORCE_TEST_DRIVER, load it even if it is disabled.</li>
<li>When a specific driver is forced with the "forcedDriver" setting or the VR_FORCE_TEST_DRIVER, only allow an HMD to activate from that driver (even if other drivers are loaded due to “activateMultipleDrivers” and they activate an HMD first). The forced driver always had the first opportunity to activate an HMD before, but now we will wait for it to hotplug an HMD rather than letting another available HMD win.</li>
<li>The “LastKnown” section in settings (which updates with the manufacturer and model of the last used HMD) now also keeps track of the “ActualHMDDriver” (e.g. “lighthouse”) that provided the HMD.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure if my system is just being a special case, or if Valve forgot Linux but currently on both the Steam Client Beta and SteamVR Beta, I still see the old UI. So it may not be working on Linux right now in this first Beta. Let me know what you find in the comments if you try it too. I have a <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/SteamVR-for-Linux/issues/614" target="_blank">bug report</a> up so maybe the issue can be found.</p>
<p>As for the future of SteamVR, I think it's pretty clear this is work towards a new VR kit from Valve. Why else would you continue investing in it and give it such a big overhaul to include more main Steam features directly?</p>

      <title>Party Animals is really fun on Steam Deck and desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a new casual silly party game? Party Animals recently released from Recreate Games and Source Technology and it works pretty great overall on Steam Deck and desktop Linux.</p>
<p>Spread across around 20 maps and three different game modes, you'll be fighting off other animals across multiple rounds. The idea is similar to the likes of Gang Beasts, with wobbly creatures running around doing completely stupid things. Fight on planes, submarines, trains and more.</p>
<p>First up Steam Deck: the good news is that it runs on Steam Deck, my testing is with SteamOS 3.5 Preview and Proton Experimental. The only issue I had was setting my name at the start requiring the touchscreen and same with editing a custom game name, as gamepad input on the keyboard kept removing it. Apart from that though, it has been pretty smooth sailing.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cMSAJt9WaA8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/db75749f4b16bed1c2dbd0a458571ea5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cMSAJt9WaA8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Performance on Steam Deck isn't as good as expected though, considering the pretty simple style and game mechanics. Even on Low details it wouldn't go much above 40FPS. Thankfully, it feels pretty great though and it looks just fine thanks to the cartoony style to it.</p>
<p>Something to keep in mind is that this is an online-only game, it does not have full offline play and it does also have micro-transactions. You can earn as you play, but you can also pay to get more of the in-game currency to buy more expensive cosmetic outfits from the in-game shop. Two things that have been pulling down the Steam user review score with players not particularly happy about either. Not enough to stop people playing it though, with it being one of the most popular releases of 2023 so far (over 55,000 people played it at the same time today).</p>
<p>On desktop Linux (Kubuntu 23.04) no surprises there as it works perfectly. With good <em>smooth</em> performance on max settings on my desktop at 2560x1440 - Ryzen 5800x / Radeon 6800XT.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15046566411695666520gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15046566411695666520gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>A feature I especially like in Party Animals is that when you’ve been thrown out and the match is still going on, you get a few little tricks to throw into the ring like a banana peel for them to slip on or a bomb to hopefully explode them off. It’s a nice little touch that stops it being too boring when you’re waiting for the round to end while you're spectating.</p>
<p>Overall it's really fun, some properly laugh out loud moments can be had in it and across Steam Deck / desktop Linux you can have a good time with it. I would just suggest turning off voice chat, because for some reason it's on by default and open mic too.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1260320/Party_Animals/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Fantastic Haven is an upcoming magical zoo tycoon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Up for something just a tad different? Fantastic Haven was announced recently that looks and sounds really unique as you explore the world, to take care of various magical creatures.</p>
<p>"In a world where magic is gradually disappearing in favor of technological advances that threaten the balance, you play the role of the Elders, protectors of the continent. While the inhabitants prefer to hunt the creatures and gradually abandon magic, your mission is to restore the balance by saving the fantasy creatures, while using diplomacy and teaching to convince people to live in harmony with them."</p>
<p>Check out the initial trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rt0-s-UPDrE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9f20a93fd64244e39a6ee4aa79921832.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rt0-s-UPDrE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">Establish a refuge - Choose where your refuge will be and build basic infrastructures unlocking new research and buildings, allowing you to welcome more creatures and make your refuge prosper.</li>
<li class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">Welcome Creatures One and All - Bring creatures back to the refuge and rehabilitate them. Place them in proper quarantine structures, then move them to a sanctuary with other compatible creatures and their biotope while keeping them sequestered from others. When the time is right, set them back into the wild, helping to restore magic.</li>
<li class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">Explore the Realm - Send out scouting parties of mages to survey points of interest and to find creatures in need and bring them back to your refuge. While exploring, be sure to collect the five types of ether to use as currency and fuel your creations.</li>
<li class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">Bring Harmony - Negotiate with hostile populations using diplomacy to form strong ties. Train your citizens to properly care for the fantastical creatures at the refuge to increase its reputation and to help bring balance between humans, creatures, resources, and magic.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It should feature Linux support at release, like many other titles published by Goblinz Publishing. We'll know more closer to release and it will also be having a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/goblinzstudio/fantastic-haven" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> crowdfunding campaign in November.

      <title>Mesa 23.2 aims for release this week, with a point release next week</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's been quite a while overdue but Mesa 23.2 is getting set to finally released, with a fourth Release Candidate now available for testing.</p>
<p>Writing in the <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/mesa-dev/2023-September/226062.html" target="_blank">announcement</a>, developer Dylan Baker mentioned they're hoping this fourth RC is the last, with the plan to release it in full on Wednesday. However it will be released as 23.2.1, since they accidentally tagged a 23.2.0 release a little while ago that was removed.</p>
<p>Baker also mentioned that they will continue pulling in some patches, and contacting developers whose patches didn't apply cleanly, and so they're hoping for a shorter cycle to get to the next point release with Mesa 23.2.2 next week.</p>
<p>It's generally advisable to wait for the first point release, so you may want to hold off until Mesa 23.2.2 next week — if the current release schedule actually goes to plan.</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s how Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 runs on Steam Deck and desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 landed recently, and now I've had time to play with it here's a look at how it runs on Steam Deck and desktop Linux after the update. The good news is: it runs out of the box with Proton. My testing has been with Proton Experimental.</p>
<p><em>Quick tip - want to skip the launcher? Add this as a Steam launch option: <code class="inline-code">--launcher-skip</code></em></p>
<p>For the Steam Deck, I've been testing it on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/steam-deck-os-35-now-in-preview-with-hdr-vrr-and-display-colour-settings/" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.5 Preview</a>, where it does in fact run quite well. On Low and Medium, it can for the most part stay above 30FPS and a lot of the time when you're not doing explosive action in the open world, it can even stick around 40FPS. However, even on the Low settings, intense open world action will bring it down but Medium with FSR2 keeps it pretty smooth.</p>
<p>To give you a good overview, I ran it through a bunch of benchmarks and captured some gameplay that you can view below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="f0TxOgF8lYo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2b3bc81a4932ad39cbb549912fd82cd4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/f0TxOgF8lYo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For desktop Linux (Kubuntu 23.04) the game will run but there's one current major issue: you will probably get stuck with on-screen gamepad icons. This is a <a href="https://support.cdprojektred.com/en/cyberpunk/pc/sp-technical/issue/2491/update-2-0-known-issues" target="_blank">known issue</a> for the 2.0 update. On Windows they say to restart the game, but on Linux that doesn't fix it. To fix it on Linux, you can edit the Cyberpunk2077.exe file which can be found here (depending on where it's installed): <code class="inline-code">.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Cyberpunk 2077/bin/x64/</code></p>
<p>After backing up your exe, you can run this command on it in terminal to fix it:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">echo '2C45C6: EB' | xxd -r - Cyberpunk2077.exe</code></p>
<p><em>Testing it myself, this done indeed fix the controls! Credit to <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1091500/discussions/7/3878218563598783920/?ctp=9#c3878218563605539303" target="_blank">this Steam forum post</a>.</em></p>
<p>As for performance, it seems pretty good. When you consider we're running it through the Proton compatibility layer, it continues to be impressive for such AAA games. On the High details preset, with FSR2 Quality at 2560x1440 I've been seeing above 60FPS and it's really smooth. This is with an AMD Ryzen 5800X + Radeon 6800XT.</p>

      <title>Even the Ocean from Analgesic Productions has a source code release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Even the Ocean from Melos Han-Tani, Marina Kittaka and Analgesic Productions recently had the source code released. This follows on from them also releasing the source code to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/04/analgesic-productions-have-opened-up-the-source-for-their-zelda-lite-anodyne/" target="_blank">Anodyne back in 2020</a>.</p>
<p>While the source code and assets are now publicly available, it's not open source since it's using a custom license, the same they used for Anodyne which was adapted from the source <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/01/vvvvvv-from-terry-cavanagh-has-the-source-code-opened-up-to-celebrate-the-10-year-anniversary/" target="_blank">code release of VVVVVV</a>. They did initially say it's open source but after feedback they've adjusted it to say it's "99%-open-sourced". As for why it's not fully open source they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Technically it is not “Open Source” because that would require me to give everything away for free. There’s a clause that prevents us from getting screwed by someone just selling the game as-is or copying it completely.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Unlike other source releases, they provide the full assets so you could get the entire game free, instead of just the code.</em></p>
<p>What is the game? A physics-shifting puzzle platformer where you'll delve into dangerous power plants and massive creatures! Run into Light and Dark Energy-infused hazards to shift your movement physics to conquer each challenge. Explore towns and cities, and help a world thrown out of balance.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="C4DuHzLYUMc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f21a1f405f14ec674877674ad5351bc3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/C4DuHzLYUMc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As for why they open source it they mention how they've "always been worried about its future" and that while "the toolchain to compile it is quite stable, it seems to be broken on Mac, and I can’t figure out how to compile it for Linux". The game is built with open tooling like Haxe, OpenFL, and HaxeFlixel so with the code being open it should allow anyone to tinker with it and perhaps even sort out a Native Linux version.</p>
<p>Read their <a href="https://melodicambient.substack.com/p/i-open-sourced-even-the-ocean-2016" target="_blank">blog post</a> for more, check it out on <a href="https://github.com/analgesicproductions/Even-The-Ocean-Open-Source" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and the game is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/265470/Even_the_Ocean/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 8-16 released with tweaks for Genshin Impact, Resident Evil and Wine upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Valve continues working towards <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/proton-80-4-is-now-in-testing-with-a-release-candidate/" target="_blank">Proton 8.0-4 that has a Release Candidate</a> available, a small but useful update to the community-maintained GE-Proton has been released. GE-Proton 8-16 is on the smaller side but contains some of the usual upgrades to various components.</p>
<p>This is the version of Proton <em>not</em> supported by Valve, so it may have issues at times the official Proton does not. However, it also at times pulls in fixes a bit quicker and can do things sometimes that Valve cannot do. To sum up: use it if you need it for specific games, otherwise sticking with the official Proton is the best idea. More about Proton can be found in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">my Proton beginner's guide</a>.</p>
<p>The changes in <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton8-16" target="_blank">GE-Proton 8-16</a>:</p>
<div class="markdown-body my-3" data-pjax="true" data-test-selector="body-content" data-view-component="true">
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>imported build changes from upstream proton</li>
<li>update wine to latest bleeding edge</li>
<li>updated dxvk to latest git</li>
<li>updated vkd3d-proton to latest git</li>
<li>added patch to fix genshin impact crash on opening long urls (thanks iglu47 and Awekening on discord)</li>
<li>protonfixes: removed various no longer needed video playback fixes for resident evil games (thanks Bitwolfies)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Text Guide to install GE-Proton:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><u>Desktop</u>: head to the <a href="https://davidotek.github.io/protonup-qt/" target="_blank">official website</a>, scroll down and pick your favourite download option either AppImage or <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/net.davidotek.pupgui2" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.</li>

      <title>Mesa getting Vulkan performance upgrades for submission merging</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Mike Blumenkrantz, who is one of many under contract by Valve, has released another blog post highlighting another fun optimization from their ongoing Mesa driver work.</p>
<p>The post as usual is highly technical, so if you want to full info <a href="https://www.supergoodcode.com/tis-the-season/" target="_blank">give it a read</a>. The issue is with how Mesa was dealing with the Vulkan <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/site/guide/latest/queues.html" target="_blank">Queue</a> system, and what they were doing originally seemed to be a bit of a problem where it was "splitting the batched submits into individual ones, each submit also allocates a struct to contain the submit info so that the drivers can use the same interface. So it’s increasing the kernel overhead by performing multiple submits and also increasing memory allocations" with Blumenkrantz mentioning multiple tests that "showcase some driver pain points".</p>
<p>The result is a <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/25352" target="_blank">pull request</a> (not yet merged) that gives a performance improvement on RADV GFX11 (RDNA3) of 1000% in one case and 50% in another. An impressive win but it continues. On Lavapipe (a CPU-based Software Vulkan driver) it saw a 3000% improvement in one case and a 1000% improvement in another, Intel Arc (Intel DG2) one case saw a 5000% improvement and Turnip A740 had a 4000% improvement and a 3000% improvement for another point.</p>

      <title>Godot Engine hits over 50K euros per month in funding</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the big winners of the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-announced-big-changes-following-the-hated-runtime-fee/" target="_blank">Unity debacle</a> is the free and open source <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, which has seen its funding soar to a much more impressive level as Unity basically gave them free advertising. Certainly helps that Godot ended up launching their <a href="https://fund.godotengine.org/" target="_blank">new funding platform</a> on the same day Unity announced their hated Runtime Fee system.</p>
<p>Initially when the Godot developers announced their new funding platform they only had around €25K per month from 438 members. This has now exploded up to €50,323 per month from 1,458 members. A much better and more sustainable amount considering they're building an entire game engine.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3126412501695557841gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3126412501695557841gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>They also recently gained Terraria developer <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/terraria-developer-re-logic-donates-100k-to-godot-engine-and-fna/" target="_blank">Re-Logic as a Platinum sponsor</a>, as Re-Logic donated $100K along with $1,000 a month in ongoing funding. On top of that developer <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/robot-gentleman-dev-of-60-seconds-blasts-unity-switches-to-godot-and-increases-funding/" target="_blank">Robot Gentleman of 60 Seconds!</a> has also upped their support of Godot and no doubt plenty of others.</p>
<p>Hopefully this is going to be a turning point, where developers look more to open source tools where feasible instead of locking themselves into proprietary game engines with predatory business practices. Unity has proven multiple times now they're willing to break developer's trust like their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-nuked-their-terms-of-service-on-github-as-views-were-so-low/" target="_blank">messing around with Terms of Services</a>.</p>

      <title>Unity nuked their Terms of Service on GitHub as &#39;views were so low&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The current saga of Unity is not quite over yet, as they're still trying to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-announced-big-changes-following-the-hated-runtime-fee/" target="_blank">clean up</a> developer concerns after the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-introduces-new-fees-for-game-devs-based-on-revenue-and-game-installs/" target="_blank">botched announcement</a> of the Runtime Fee. One bit currently in the spotlight is their Terms of Service and how they previously pulled the rug from developers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-attempt-to-clarify-new-install-fees-as-developers-revolt/" target="_blank">In a previous article</a> I touched on their TOS but to refresh - in <a href="https://blog.unity.com/community/updated-terms-of-service-and-commitment-to-being-an-open-platform" target="_blank">2019</a> they told developers very clearly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you obtain a version of Unity, and don’t upgrade your project, we think you should be able to stick to that version of the TOS.</p>
<p>In practice, that is only possible if you have access to bug fixes. For this reason, we now allow users to continue to use the TOS for the same major (year-based) version number, including Long Term Stable (LTS) builds that you are using in your project.</p>
<p>Moving forward, we will host TOS changes on Github to give developers full transparency about what changes are happening, and when. The link is <a href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/TermsOfService" target="_blank">https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/TermsOfService</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They later <em>removed</em> that GitHub, stopping their transparency and entirely replaced their TOS with a newer version that completely removed that protection for developers to stick with the terms they accepted for their current version of Unity.</p>
<p>Now they are telling developers as of their latest announcement, that again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We will make sure that you can stay on the terms applicable for the version of Unity editor you are using – as long as you keep using that version.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And they have now restored that GitHub page but the history on it is gone, as they've started fresh with the current terms, although we can still see previous history on it thanks to the archive on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220716084623/https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/TermsOfService" target="_blank">Wayback Machine</a>.</p>
<p>So why did they really remove it? Their newer terms came in on October 13, 2022 so it was <em>quite some time</em> before the newer Runtime Fee announcement. So likely not <em>directly</em> related. The problem is with their promises, the "trust me bro, we really won't do it again, promise" argument they're giving. What assurances do developers actually have that they won't change the TOS on them again to remove protections? There's not really anything.</p>
<p>Making matters worse, on X/Twitter when replying to a developer <a href="https://twitter.com/IndieGameDAV/status/1705297454483095611" target="_blank">asking</a> for a clear answer on how they will guarantee this their questionable and rather laughable <a href="https://twitter.com/unity/status/1705317639478751611" target="_blank">reply</a> was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I totally hear your frustration!❤️<br/>
Just to echo what Marc said, we are so sorry for our earlier actions.</p>
<p>Genuinely disappointed at how our removal of the ToS has been framed across the internet. We removed it way before the pricing change was announced because the views were so low, not because we didn't want people to see it.</p>
<p>And we have heard the concerns from the community about ToS loud and clear. This new Runtime Fee policy will only apply beginning with the next LTS version of Unity shipping in 2024 and beyond. And Marc's response is true, you can stay on the terms applicable for the version of Unity you are using as long as you keep using that version.</p>
<p>We do have a fireside chat ongoing with Marc where he will answer some Q's live, if you aren't happy with my answer, we welcome your attendance and questions <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyLcI5O9iUY" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyLcI5O9iUY</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/561299421695462567gol1.png"/></p>
<p>I honestly can't believe this is a <em>real</em> post from Unity, but it is. They removed a clear, public and transparent legal document they weren't even hosting directly because the views were low. This isn't a YouTube video, this is legal documentation. It absolutely wasn't because they didn't want developers to clearly see the terms being changed to remove the protection of sticking with the terms of each Unity version was it? No, it <em>can't</em> be that of course, it's because views were <em>low</em>.</p>
<p><em>Don't worry, just trust Unity, they're totally not going to pull any of this again.</em></p>

      <title>Unity announced big changes following the hated Runtime Fee</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After the absolute disaster that was their<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-introduces-new-fees-for-game-devs-based-on-revenue-and-game-installs/" target="_blank"> original Runtime Fee announcement</a>, Unity have now put up <a href="https://blog.unity.com/news/open-letter-on-runtime-fee" target="_blank">another apology and announced</a> what the new plan is going forward.</p>
<p>Their new plan will keep Unity Personal free and there's <em>no</em> Runtime Fee for games made with it. The revenue cap there is also moving up to $200,000 and they're removing the requirement to show the Made with Unity splash screen. Additionally, no game earning less than $1 million in a 12 month period will be subject to the Runtime Fee.</p>
<p>For developers on Unity pro and Enterprise, the Runtime Fee will now only apply with the next LTS version of Unity shipping in 2024. So existing games and games with older Unity versions will not be included (unless developers choose to upgrade).</p>
<p>Unity said they will also "make sure that you can stay on the terms applicable for the version of Unity editor you are using – as long as you keep using that version", so they won't change the terms for existing users. Although, we've heard that before and they changed their mind as <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-attempt-to-clarify-new-install-fees-as-developers-revolt/" target="_blank">I noted in a previous article</a>.</p>
<p>For games that are subject to their new Runtime Fee, they will offer a choice of either a 2.5% revenue share "or the calculated amount based on the number of new people engaging with your game each month" and those numbers will be self-reported by developers and they will "always" be billed the lesser amount.</p>
<p>They're also inviting developers to a <a class="text-charcoal underline" href="https://youtube.com/live/qyLcI5O9iUY" target="_blank">live fireside chat</a> hosted by Jason Weimann today at 8 PM UTC.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15736440121695404238gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15736440121695404238gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured Credit - Unity</em></p>
<p>As for how Unity will calculate the Runtime Fee from the FAQ it states: "While we always recommend you supply your own data, in the absence of that, we will use our own data from Unity services that you have agreed to integrate into your project, and readily available external data." and they also confirmed the Unity Runtime does not phone home by default unless developers have hardware stats enabled.</p>
<p>The new plan that has a <a href="https://unity.com/pricing-updates" target="_blank">fresh policy page here</a> is a lot better that's for sure but is it enough? Their original announcement and the anger it caused for developers has broken a lot of trust.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts?</p>

      <title>Microsoft - keep your filthy hands off Valve, leak shows MSFT would buy Valve</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, that's certainly an article title isn't it. But I mean it. Microsoft, don't you dare touch Valve. You're fat enough already and too big as it is, especially with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/microsoft-buyout-of-activision-gets-closer-uk-cma-consulting-further/" target="_blank">Activision purchase clearly about to happen</a>.</p>
<p>"Liam, what's got you all like this?!", I hear you all asking. Well, remember that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/microsoft-leak-shows-fallout-3-and-oblivion-remasters-doom-year-zero-and-more/" target="_blank">recent Microsoft leak</a> that showed off a bunch of potential game releases? There was a lot more to the leak overall you see, and some of it a little <em>disturbing</em> for the industry. In an email from Phil Spencer spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/19/23880146/phil-spencer-microsoft-xbox-acquiring-nintendo" target="_blank">The Verge</a>, there was talk about their plans including wanting to buy up the likes of Nintendo and even Valve with Spencer noting "But our BoD has seen the full writeup on Nintendo (and Valve) and they are fully supportive on either if opportunity arises as am I" (BoD being Board of Directors).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9463520661695400942gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9463520661695400942gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured - Leaked 2020 email, credit to The Verge</em></p>
<p>Could you imagine the disaster it would be if Microsoft acquired Valve? There's just so many ways that would become incredibly problematic and wow — what a monopoly that would make huh? Not that Valve has <em>any</em> need at all to sell, they pretty much print money thanks to their 30% cut from most developers on Steam. Valve is also privately owned, so they can do whatever the heck they want. Valve are far from perfect, but competition is <em>good</em> and <em>necessary</em> and them joining together would really mess the industry up.</p>
<p>You might remember that "<a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/windowsserver/2015/05/06/microsoft-loves-linux/" target="_blank">Microsoft Loves Linux</a>", but the <em>reality</em> is they like Linux when it makes them money. If the above ever were to happen, it's not really likely they would continue all of Valve's big investments into Linux given how even with the Steam Deck the market is small. After all, Valve put all these resources into Linux because they don't want to be entirely at the whims of Microsoft for their store, and Valve clearly want their own platform so Linux with Proton + Steam Deck is key to that. And maybe even more when we find out what the heck <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/linux-updates-tease-valve-galileo-and-sephiroth-steam-deck-refresh-or-new-vr/" target="_blank">Galileo and Sephiroth</a> are.</p>
<p>So, Microsoft, <em>please</em> continue to keep your filthy hands off Valve (but keep putting your games on Steam okay? thanks).</p>

      <title>Lies of P is running great on Steam Deck and desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In the mood for a fresh soulslike? Lies of P released recently from NEOWIZ, and thankfully it really does run nicely overall on Steam Deck and desktop Linux. <em>Note: Key provided to me by ICOPartners.</em></p>
<p>More about it: "You are a puppet created by Geppetto who’s caught in a web of lies with unimaginable monsters and untrustworthy figures standing between you and the events that have befallen the world of Lies of P.</p>
<p>You are awakened by a mysterious voice that guides you through the plagued city of Krat - a once lively place that has been poisoned by madness and bloodlust. In our soulslike, you must adapt yourself and your weapons to face untold horrors, untangle the unfathomable secrets of the city's elites and choose whether to confront predicaments with the truth or weave lies to overcome them on the journey to find yourself."</p>
<p>When it comes to the Steam Deck, plenty of new releases don't exactly run well. As we've seen with the likes of Starfield, Jedi Survivor and more — optimization on the lower-end has become a problem. So nothing is guaranteed which is why it's nice to see Lies of P not only running but being smooth too! Here's a video with a little benchmark and then some gameplay to show on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/steam-deck-os-35-now-in-preview-with-hdr-vrr-and-display-colour-settings/" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.5 Preview</a> with Proton Experimental:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="X0raH_1KbA4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/eb9a7f2d2ba87215ac78db2ee8d41488.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/X0raH_1KbA4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For Steam Deck I would <em>suggest</em> the picking the Medium preset, and you can happily bump up the Visibility and Texture Quality settings to High, keeping on FSR 2 and it runs nicely at 40-45Hz locked in the Steam Deck performance menu.</p>
<p>When it comes to desktop Linux again using Proton Experimental, AMD Ryzen 5800x and Radeon 6800XT with Mesa 23.1.8 on Kubuntu 23.04 it is very much click and play again. It's pretty rare for a more powerful system on desktop to have much trouble with new releases on Proton now which is a great place to be. But given how well optimized Lies of P appears given how it runs on Steam Deck - how well does it run here? Quite impressive actually.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16064783181695395169gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16064783181695395169gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2039258591695395168gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2039258591695395168gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16337840931695395166gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16337840931695395166gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13378988381695395320gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13378988381695395320gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Testing it on the "Best" graphics preset with FSR2 on Quality at 2560x1440, it's been mostly sat around 180FPS in the smaller areas dipping down to around 140FPS in more intense areas.</p>
<p>It's not often that I actually get on well with soulslike games but Lies of P feels accessible, and I actually found myself enjoying my time with the exploration and combat that I don't usually get with other similar titles. The setting is quite interesting too giving a very alternative and clever take on Pinocchio.</p>
<p>Overall I really love it and think you will too if you usually enjoy soulslikes, and perhaps even if you don't. It's certainly not an easy game though, it is designed to be challenging!</p>
<p>You can buy Lies of P on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/lies-of-p?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1627720/Lies_of_P" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Microsoft&#39;s buyout of Activision gets closer with the UK CMA consulting further</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The long saga of Microsoft buying up Activision Blizzard took another step forward, with the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) now consulting on remedies Microsoft put forward to address the CMA's concerns.</p>
<p>Something to be clear on though, is that it has <em>not</em> yet been approved. The CMA simply said that the changes Microsoft put down "opens the door to the deal being cleared". The main concerns from the CMA were on cloud gaming, so under the new plan Ubisoft will have the right to cloud gaming from Activision instead. From the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-microsoft-activision-deal-addresses-previous-cma-concerns-in-cloud-gaming" target="_blank">CMA Press Release</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In contrast to the original deal, Microsoft will no longer control cloud gaming rights for Activision’s content, so would not be in a position to limit access to Activision’s key content to its own cloud gaming service or to withhold those games from rivals. Unlike the remedies the CMA previously rejected, Ubisoft will be free to offer Activision’s games both directly to consumers and to all cloud gaming service providers however it chooses, including for buy-to-play or multigame subscription services, or any new model for providing content that might emerge as the market develops. The deal with Ubisoft also requires Microsoft to port Activision games to operating systems other than Windows and support game emulators when requested, addressing the other main shortcoming with the previous remedies package.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When looking into <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/650d2efd52e73c000d9426a1/Notice_of_consultation_on_undertakings_in_lieu_PDFA_B.pdf" target="_blank">fineprint</a> on the decision, even Proton got mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft must port Activision Games to non-Windows OS following a request from Ubisoft. Ubisoft may also request that Microsoft perform technical modifications, including to ensure that the Activision Games support emulators like Proton. Microsoft must carry out this work at its regular pace and at a quality and standard which is customary in the gaming industry. Microsoft can only charge Ubisoft for the reasonable costs incurred for this work. Microsoft is also required to provide Ubisoft with development and porting plans for Activision Games reasonably in advance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>They called Proton an "emulator" though…best not to argue on what exactly Proton is right now.</em></p>
<p>Why would Ubisoft want Activision games to run well on Proton? Well, that depends who they would license the games to for streaming via cloud gaming (as that's what all this is about). Some cloud gaming providers that end up working with Ubisoft to provide Activision games might run their services on Linux systems.</p>
<p>However, the CMA are not <em>entirely</em> convinced just yet. As they said while it makes "important changes" they still have "limited residual concern" that Ubisoft's streaming rights could be "circumvented, terminated, or not enforced". So Microsoft has again offered remedies to ensure this can be enforced by the CMA.</p>
<p>There's now a consultation going on until October 6th on the proposed remedies so we should hear back sometime around then on the deal finally being approved or not. The final deadline is October 18th.</p>
<p>Microsoft's Brad Smith <a href="https://twitter.com/BradSmi/status/1705107310073512252" target="_blank">said</a> on X: "We are encouraged by this positive development in the CMA’s review process. We presented solutions that we believe fully address the CMA’s remaining concerns related to cloud game streaming, and we will continue to work toward earning approval to close prior to the October 18 deadline."</p>

      <title>Steam Deck and SteamOS are great for Linux as a whole - Open Source Summit Europe 2023</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>At the recent <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/" target="_blank">Open Source Summit Europe 2023</a>, Alberto Garcia a software engineer at <a href="https://www.igalia.com/" target="_blank">Igalia</a> did a talk covering Valve, Steam Deck, SteamOS and how it all helps Linux as a whole.</p>
<p>For people who understand Linux and open source, a lot of this would be pretty obvious but it's always nice to have a refresher from people who work with Valve - talking about how good it is to have all the Valve funding, and how having SteamOS Linux shipping on widely available consumer devices like the Steam Deck is great for Linux in general.</p>
<p>Giving a nice overview reminding people that SteamOS is actually a pretty standard Linux distribution based on Arch Linux, with some customizations and a full KDE Plasma desktop mode. It also goes over: Wine and Valve's funding of Proton working with CodeWeavers, Valve's funding work for Linux kernel improvements like the new futex API, work to solve filename case sensitivity in ext4 to extend it to support case insensitive like Windows (so games can work properly through Wine / Proton), various work on graphics drivers like AMD RADV, the ACO shader compiler, Vulkan Video extensions, advanced colour and HDR, better handling of GPU resets, Gamescope, supporting Flatpak by default on SteamOS and much more.</p>
<p>The main overall point is that Valve contributes a lot, it's all open source and Valve's philosophy is "upstream everything" which improves Linux for everyone everywhere.</p>
<p>The full talk can be seen below with the Steam Deck / SteamOS bit starting at 4:12:07 and ending 4:47:00.</p>

      <title>Valve overhauled Steam Deck &#39;As Mouse&#39; Gyro option in new Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Even though Valve only just recently put <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/steam-deck-os-35-now-in-preview-with-hdr-vrr-and-display-colour-settings/" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.5 into preview for Steam Deck</a>, they're not done with improvements elsewhere with a new Beta Client release doing a bit of a Gyro overhaul to the Mouse mode.</p>
<p>Specifically it's a revamp of the Gyro "As Mouse" mode. Here's all the Steam Input changes from the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/6816816781639310329?snr=2_9_100015_" target="_blank">September 18th update</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New Gyro Mode: "Gyro To Mouse".
<ul>
<li>This is a renovation of the gyro "As Mouse" mode.</li>
<li>Expect frequent changes to UI and behavior while we evaluate this new replacement. ("As Mouse" will remain for now.)</li>
<li>Natural Sensitivity Scale: use "Pixels Per 360°" to calibrate both the Flick Stick and Gyro's real world angles into in-game angles. In this way, your Gyro Natural Sensitivity Multiplier can be consistent across games, with "Pixels Per 360°" being the isolated tuning value for each game.</li>
<li>1€ Filter: Smoothed low level gyro noise without adding delay.</li>
<li>Speed Deadzones and Precision Zones will allow you to tune preferences for hand shake during fine aim.</li>
<li>Yaw vs. Roll Blend: you can now blend between "Yaw" or "Roll" mode.</li>
<li>Gyro Momentum Option: releasing your gyro activation button can maintain some rotation from the gyro. Tune the momentum on independent axes to bias toward horizontal movement vs vertical movement.</li>
<li>Gyro sensor timestamps are now used resulting in better overall accuracy of the Gyro.</li>
<li>Gyro over Bluetooth improvements - gyro motion is extrapolated when Bluetooth packets are delayed, resulting in smoother movement. Any error incurred is corrected gradually over time, during high speed movement to avoid "Ouija effect" during precise aiming.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed Roll axis on Steam Deck for legacy "As Mouse".</li>
<li>Fix delayed input when opening the standalone On-Screen Keyboard</li>
<li>Fix for Razer Wolverine V2 Pro Dualsense gyro.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A quick follow-up release went out after that also had one change <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3741984674870616551?snr=2_9_100015_" target="_blank">noting</a> "Fix default orientation for Steam Deck and Steam Link Mobile App controllers in the new Gyro To Mouse mode".</p>
<p>Have any of you been playing with this newer Gyro mode? Let me know what you think in the comments. Gyro is one thing I just don't do on Steam Deck - as it feels like my brain just gets confused by it.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck a &#39;stable target for a couple years&#39; so no Steam Deck 2 for a while</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently at the Tokyo Game Show Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais spoke to CNBC about PC gaming and Steam Deck, here's what was said during the interview.</p>
<p>As far as I can see, this was only posted to <a href="https://twitter.com/StreetSignsCNBC/status/1704971310361629080" target="_blank">X/Twitter</a> and the audio quality is not the best due to background noise and the first part the interview is simply giving an overview of what the Steam Deck can do and provide for gamers. The interesting bits come later so here's just a quick quote summary of quotes from Griffais:</p>
<ul>
<li>When talking about the power of SteamOS - "we would like to work with other hardware manufacturers, so they can adopt SteamOS in the future".</li>
<li>On VR: "for Steam Deck we don't really have a VR story to it, but it's definitely something we want to explore more in the future".</li>
<li>For the future: "we're not really seeing growth stop after COVID, so for us it's really important to keep working on the current version of the Steam Deck, put together software updates we just released a big <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/steam-deck-os-35-now-in-preview-with-hdr-vrr-and-display-colour-settings/" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.5 update</a> that's added new features we're going to keep doing that - but also work on the hardware side supply chain, retail presence, work with distributors to get the Deck available worldwide and expand its audience so we're going to be focusing on that short term - in the future we're looking at the PC market and where technology is going and see if there's any interesting opportunities there".</li>
<li>When asked about console cycles, games being higher-end and Steam Deck upgrades: "right now we're looking at this performance target that we have as a stable target for a couple years, we think that it's a pretty sweet spot in terms of being able to play all the experiences from this new generation and so far the new releases coming out have been great experiences on Steam Deck. We're working with developers on future releases and we're monitoring the feedback there but so far it's been pretty good on the horsepower front".</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p>Even though Valve say the current Steam Deck is their stable target for a couple of years, it was originally released in February 2022 so it will already be 2 years old next February. So could we potentially see a Steam Deck 2 in 2025? Seems like that might be a good time for it.</p>
<p>Clearly the current generation has a lot of life left in it and Valve plan to continue to upgrade the software and just keep expanding the availability of the current Steam Deck. And if they do get a more generic SteamOS install out, pulling in new hardware vendors would be great for consumer choice.</p>
<p>We have seen some teasers for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/linux-updates-tease-valve-galileo-and-sephiroth-steam-deck-refresh-or-new-vr/" target="_blank">Valve <em>Galileo</em> and <em>Sephiroth</em></a> though so something is cooking, although it's very likely new VR hardware.</p>

      <title>Paradox and C Prompt team up for Millennia and it looks very Civilization</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Civilization is that you? No wait it's Millennia, a new 4x strategy game announced today by Paradox Interactive who have teamed up with C Prompt Games and it does look quite interesting but it's going to get heavy Civ comparisons.</p>
<p>C Prompt Games includes people who have worked on games like Age of Empires II, Age of Mythology and Starcraft II, as well as Orcs Must Die helmed by veteran strategy game developers Rob Fermier, Ian Fischer and Brian Sousa. The first announcement teaser is below but it doesn't really give you much:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vx0NBKcVlH4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4a02cc8d761cdffe148b62c8988b9fbc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vx0NBKcVlH4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features of Millennia include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>History and Alternate History: Lead your people through ten historical ages, steer your timeline into the uncharted alternate history of a Variant Age or the danger and opportunity of a Crisis Age. Each Age involves unique rules, units, buildings, goods, and challenges, which can alter the path of history.</li>
<li>National Spirits: Decide what your Nation is famous for by selecting National Spirits and using the bonuses they provide to achieve your goals.  Combine multiple National Spirits as you progress through history to craft a unique civilization in every game.</li>
<li>Domains: Invest in six different Domains that influence the focus of your Nation – Exploration, Government, Warfare, Diplomacy, Engineering, and Arts.  The better you provide for each, the more your Nation can make use of unique Domain Powers.  Everything from claiming territory, to adopting new governments, to spreading religion, to reinforcing Armies flows from mastery of the Domains.</li>
<li>Deep Economy: Design your economy to support your strategy.  Gather raw materials, then build Improvements to refine basic Goods like logs or iron into lumber, paper, books, ingots, tools, or weapons – specialized products that allow you to improve and adjust your economic engine to suit whatever history sends your way.</li>
<li>Army Based Combat: Customize your approach to war by combining individual Units into powerful Armies.  Each Unit influences the capabilities of its Army, allowing you to employ a vast number of varied strategies.  Once in conflict, watch the action unfold through the Combat Viewer, where battles play out and provide details on how different Armies perform.</li>
<li>And more: discover natural landmarks, build the Pyramids, compete in the space race, finance expeditions, survive plagues, use diplomacy to your advantage, defeat barbarians, unleash innovations, deal with alien visitors, govern underwater cities, manage air combat, and master a host of other historical-themed content.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The screenshots on Steam give a better look:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15871724921695325820gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15871724921695325820gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20649867231695325822gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20649867231695325822gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>No word on system support yet other than "PC". Generally games outside of Paradox Development Studios directly don't do Native Linux support, so it's likely one to run with Proton.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1268590/Millennia/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Core Keeper gets a mod SDK and mod.io support + Shimmering Frontier update due October 4th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The wonderful mining, exploration and crafting game Core Keeper just got a big upgrade adding in modding support via mod.io, there's a new modding SDK and next month a new free expansion launches.</p>
<p>For the modding support that's out now they went with <a href="https://mod.io/g/corekeeper" target="_blank">mod.io</a>, a cross-platform solution for modding from the Mod DB crew and it's integrated into the game directly, so you can browse and install mods directly (on top of viewing via the website). As for the SDK, it's built on Unity.</p>
<p>As for the upcoming free expansion it was previously known as the Crystal Biome, but the new name is Shimmering Frontier that will arrive on October 4th. It looks like a rather blue and shiny area that will come with the new Solarite Ore to let you craft new armour, tools and equipment to expand your adventuring. There's also going to be new enemies and a whole bunch of content sprinkled throughout the game.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="9JUQYpWrbDY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e27e251dab80d8971f671c4b71437f91.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/9JUQYpWrbDY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“Developing the Shimmering Frontier has been an amazing journey for us at Pugstorm. You might remember this one as the ‘Crystal Update’ that we announced all the way back in our first Early Access roadmap, and we know that this is the one you’ve all been waiting for. This update went through plenty of designs and iterations, carefully balancing community-requested features, heaps of new content, and references to the game’s lore until we felt like it was just right!<br/>
” - Sven Thole, Pugstorm COO.</p>
<p>Core Keeper is available to buy from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/core-keeper?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1621690/Core_Keeper/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. The game has Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Squad-tactics heist RPG &#39;Cyber Knights: Flashpoint&#39; launches October 17th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Trese Brothers have now <a href="https://mastodon.social/@TreseBrothers/111103591020803596" target="_blank">announced</a> that their cyberpunk Squad-tactics heist RPG Cyber Knights: Flashpoint is going to launch on October 17th. This follows multiple impressive demos shown off during recent Steam festivals, where they were repeatedly improving it based on feedback so hopefully the full release is looking good.</p>
<p>Most recent trailer (few months old, but gives a good enough look at it) is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Zhuy_W3cAmA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fff425f315fc1414a5fe08987225a7d1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Zhuy_W3cAmA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>3rd Person Turn-based Squad Tactics</strong>: The best of modern tactical RPGs—gridless movement, cover &amp; overwatch, initiative manipulation and more. Outsmart enemy security with creative stealth &amp; hacking or go loud with powerful weapons &amp; abilities.</li>
<li><strong>Unique Cyberpunk Stories</strong>: Contacts, squad members, and world events will weave together in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1021210/announcements/detail/1701735458164171772" target="_blank">stories reminiscent of the pen and paper cyberpunk RPGs</a> we played for years while building the lore of this world.</li>
<li><strong>Thrill of the Heist</strong>: Choose your jobs &amp; work your network for advantages to pull this off. Get the crew you’ll need &amp; gear them up. Finally, look for ways to score a little more—what’s the worst that could happen?</li>
<li><strong>Power-Player Strategy</strong>: Balance factions, favors, reputation and more. Rivals, fixers, arms dealers and corporate big shots... who you work for, who you fail or betray, all of it can open and close opportunities for you.

      <title>MonoGame plan to create a non-profit foundation to support development</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The fallout from the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-considers-tentative-changes-to-controversial-policies/" target="_blank">big Unity mess</a> continues, with the <a href="https://www.monogame.net/" target="_blank">MonoGame</a> team jumping in to present a new plan for the future of this open-source and cross-platform framework for game developers.</p>
<p>If you've not actually heard of MonoGame you've likely still played something originally created with it including the likes of Bastion, Streets of Rage 4, Chasm, FEZ, Axiom Verge, Stardew Valley, Tooth and Tail and a great many more (although some moved to <a href="https://fna-xna.github.io/" target="_blank">FNA</a>). That's just a few taking from their limited <a href="https://www.monogame.net/showcase/" target="_blank">showcase</a> page.</p>
<p>As for what they're planning: a lot! They're going to create a non-profit foundation, to ensure it remains open-source and free for all users. Their <a href="https://community.monogame.net/t/update-on-monogames-status/19457" target="_blank">statement</a> in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the light of the recent news in the game industry and to reassure the community about our commitment, the MonoGame Team would like to share its future plans. The team wishes the MonoGame Framework to become future-proof, both from a technical and governance perspective.</p>
<p>This new era of the open-source project will see the creation of a non-profit foundation to which all rights and properties will be transferred to, with the aim of ensuring MonoGame remains open-source, and free for all and any scenario, including on consoles.</p>
<p>This foundation will allow the adoption of a more sustainable model and will open MonoGame to be supported by more patrons. A new board will be created within this organization with the task to define which projects to undertake, and how they may be funded, transparently.</p>
<p>We will discuss the roadmap at a later time, but we can already state that MonoGame’s goals will be set with regard to the quality of developer onboarding for the framework, its stability and console support of the current version, and the start of a new iteration to further expand MonoGame’s reach and capabilities.</p>
<p>We will communicate the progress of this transition based on developments in future announcements.</p>
<p>We look forward to everyone joining us on this new and exciting chapter.</p>
<p>The MonoGame Team.</p>

      <title>We may see Counter-Strike 2 release next week</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Are you ready for the next generation competitive FPS from Valve? Well, next week you might be able to jump into Counter-Strike 2.</p>
<p>On X (Twitter), the official Counter-Strike account <a href="https://twitter.com/CounterStrike/status/1704541038633959492" target="_blank">posted</a> "What are you doing next Wednesday?" (September 27th), teasing that something is coming and it's not really hard to guess what that will be.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9850484111695311434gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Likely either an open Beta of Counter-Strike 2 for anyone to jump in, or a proper release if they think it's ready enough. <em>Hopefully Valve will also properly put up the Linux version too!</em></p>
<p>Valve said originally that CS2 would release in the Summer, but they've only done a Limited Test gradually inviting more players in so far. At release CS2 will be a free upgrade and replacement for Global Offensive, which is over 10 years old at this point so no doubt many are keen to see all the improvements.</p>
<p>Recently Valve also announced CS Rating — a precise display of your skill in Counter-Strike 2:</p>

      <title>GNOME 45 released with dynamic workspace indicator, camera indicator and much more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GNOME 45 has just been released and overall it looks like a rather nice release for this desktop environment, so here's a short run over what's new.</p>
<p>One of the major changes is the replacement of the Activities corner button on the top bar with a dynamic workspace indicator. It's a small change but looks pretty sleek to give you an idea of where you are at a glance in your workspaces. They also improved search performance across a range of apps like Software, Characters, Clocks, Files, and Calculator. Another great addition is an indicator for when a camera is in use, so no more sneaky camera activations as it should be clearer when one is being used but it's only available for apps using the latest camera tech like <a href="https://pipewire.org/" target="_blank">Pipewire</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="47aZgF6xmS0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/19415940e9ebc6b86f48993a8256fb73.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/47aZgF6xmS0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some other enhancements include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keyboard backlight quick setting</strong>: the quick settings menu now includes a button for controlling keyboard backlights.</li>
<li><strong>Efficient video playback and recording</strong>: when possible, GNOME will now use hardware resources when playing videos and creating screen recordings. This is faster and uses less power.</li>
<li><strong>New quick settings keyboard shortcut</strong>: you can now use the new <em>Super+S</em> key combination to open and close the quick settings menu.</li>
<li><strong>Updated pointer visuals</strong>: GNOME’s pointers (also known as cursors) have a great new look for GNOME 45.</li>
<li><strong>Light system style</strong>: GNOME has a new option to give the system a light interface style, as opposed to the default dark look. This can be enabled using <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/6198/light-style/" target="_blank">an extension</a> or from the command line with:<br/>
<code class="inline-code">gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface color-scheme prefer-light</code><br/>
Further integration is being investigated for future releases.</li>
<li><strong>New wallpapers</strong>: two beautiful new images were added to GNOME’s collection of backgrounds.</li>
<li><strong>Wayland support for <a href="https://github.com/input-leap/input-leap" target="_blank">Input Leap</a></strong>: this provides a software implementation of KVM-switch like functionality, allowing multiple computers to be controlled from a single keyboard and mouse. GNOME 45 allows this software to be used with modern Wayland sessions.</li>
<li><strong>Smoother pointer movement</strong>: performance improvements mean that the pointer will move smoothly even when the computer is busy.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That last one above may sound familiar, as it's something the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/plasma-6-optimized-for-wayland-gaming-plus-compositor-crash-recovery/" target="_blank">KDE team also focused on recently</a>. Having a smooth desktop under load is quite essential!</p>
<p>Of course there's plenty more — check it out on their <a href="https://release.gnome.org/45/" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>
<p>When you get it all depends on what distribution you're on, as they all have different release schedules.</p>

      <title>Halo: The Master Chief Collection multiplayer seems broken on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Posted on <a href="https://twitter.com/HaloSupport/status/1704979565318418783" target="_blank">X</a>, the Halo Support account mentioned they're looking into it - "The #HaloMCC team is investigating reports that players on Steam Deck are experiencing Easy Anti-Cheat error messages after Tuesday's update. Stay tuned for updates on this bug investigation."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12843613521695335386gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12843613521695335386gol1.png"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>After a recent update Halo: The Master Chief Collection seems to have broken online play support for Steam Deck due to Easy Anti-Cheat.</p>
<p>If you remember, back in April they did <a href="https://twitter.com/HaloSupport/status/1643688636091863040" target="_blank">announce</a> Steam Deck support for online play and put up a <a href="https://support.halowaypoint.com/hc/en-us/articles/14589112499348" target="_blank">support article</a> for it. This came with a few minor issues, like needing to pick the Steam launch option that actually says it's <em>off</em> (the options were backwards). Since the update on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/976730/view/6739129688073805114" target="_blank">September 19th</a>, it just doesn't work with Easy Anti-Cheat errors.</p>
<p>When you go to launch multiplayer from the main menu with the option that has anti-cheat turned on you'll see an error like this when you try to go into multiplayer:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11659869531695236516gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11659869531695236516gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>And when picking the Steam launch option with anti-cheat off, which going by their support article is still the option to actually use to have it enabled as it's backwards, you're met with this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11933832251695236516gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11933832251695236516gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Going by the error messages, it seems like they may have put the Steam options actually the right way around now but broke it in the process. I've tested this myself across both Proton 8 and Proton Experimental and neither works. Restarting it doesn't change anything, rebooting the Steam Deck doesn't help either.</p>
<p>Lots of people on <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/16nh6ai/why_did_mcc_suddenly_break/?sort=new" target="_blank">Reddit</a> have noticed it and report the same issue (but a few note oddly it still works for them?), so hopefully Microsoft / 343 will fix whatever they did soon. I've reached out to their teams to see what's going on - will update if I get any reply.</p>

      <title>Robot Gentleman dev of 60 Seconds! blasts Unity, switches to Godot and increases funding</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The fallout from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-considers-tentative-changes-to-controversial-policies/" target="_blank">Unity's recent ridiculous pricing changes</a> and terrible communication continues, with developer Robot Gentleman now waving goodbye to Unity and joining up with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>. Robot Gentleman created the popular 60! series like 60 Seconds!, 60 Parsecs! and 60 Seconds! Reatomized.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/robotgentleman/status/1704495631010816030" target="_blank">statement</a> posted on X (Twitter) they said (copied into text, as it's an image):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The recent Unity runtime fee license change and the way it was introduced has been a shocking development for all of us at Robot Gentleman. The predatory nature of this misguided decision poses a significant threat to the work and independence of many game developers, including ourselves. We do not accept this, and we cannot simply stand by, watching this outrageous violation of trust.</p>
<p>We are bidding adieu to Unity. For good.</p>
<p>Our next project, which has been in development for 4 years, will be migrated to the Godot Game Engine. Furthermore, all our released games from the 60! series will be ported away from Unity as soon as possible.</p>
<p>But there is more. We have been supporting Godot financially since July 2022. We have now decided to increase our support to 1500$/month, effectively redirecting the value of our Unity licenses to Godot. Our engineers will also contribute to the development of the engine, as we pursue our next and future projects in Godot.</p>
<p>The chosen direction is challenging, but in the face of Unity's conduct this was the only decision to be made. This change is likely to introduce a few twists and turns and cause delays in our ongoing projects. However, once we navigate this transition, we believe we will find ourselves in a much better space to continue our independent journey.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a lot of developers looking at alternative game engines and tech now to move away from Unity. This seems to have been a wake-up call for many on how the rug can be pulled from them when relying on proprietary software. Like how Terraria developer <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/terraria-developer-re-logic-donates-100k-to-godot-engine-and-fna/" target="_blank">Re-Logic just donated $100K to Godot + FNA</a> and will continue funding monthly.</p>
<p>Expect more of this to come. Even if Unity change their tune — the damage is done.</p>

      <title>Story focused point-and-click horror adventure Somnipathy is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

      <title>Mortal Kombat 1 released and Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mortal Kombat 1 from NetherRealm Studios, QLOC and Warner Bros. Games has now released and it has been rated Steam Deck Verified by Valve.</p>
<p>Nice to see Valve being able to do some early verification for another big game release. Interestingly, 6 days ago it was only rated as Playable. However Valve re-tested it yesterday and decided to bump it up to Verified with the currently unreleased <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/proton-80-4-is-now-in-testing-with-a-release-candidate/" target="_blank">Proton 8.0-4 that's now in testing</a>. Reports on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1971870?device=pc" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> for desktop Linux are also quite favourable on it! So it's nice to see another release doing well for all types of Linux gamers.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="MYa7L4jp11E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/725a778ea6c3364799cc9a59533da7f2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/MYa7L4jp11E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>If you've picked it up for desktop or Steam Deck, feel free to comment your experiences with it. Not one I'm personally interested in, fighting games like this just aren't my cuppa. Amplified by the ridiculous pricing. It's £59.99 at a minimum and that doesn't even include all the characters, it's actually £84.99 for the Premium Edition if you want more, or there's various DLC (included in Premium) adding up to £67.95 to buy separately. Two of the DLC are just single characters, each at £6.49 — it feels overly greedy.</p>
<p>So far it has gained a <em>Mostly Positive</em> rating from over two thousand user reviews on Steam.</p>

      <title>Proton 8.0-4 is now in testing with a Release Candidate</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve snuck out a Release Candidate build for Proton 8.0-4 last week, which brings with it many improvements to the main stable version of the Windows compatibility layer for Steam Deck and desktop Linux.</p>
<p>It's in the RC stage, as Valve are looking for feedback on any issues that weren't present in 8.0-3.

<p>Here's everything changed in it (which may be different when fully released):</p>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/7095" target="_blank">RC on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>There's no set date for Proton 8.0-4 to release for everyone. When Valve did the RC for Proton 8.0-3, it took over a month to release in full. And looking back, some previous RCs took even longer <em>but</em> then there's been other times where it was only a week. So basically "when it's ready".</p>

      <title>Terraria dev Re-Logic donates $100K to Godot Engine and FNA, plus ongoing funding</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Taking a firm stand against <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-considers-tentative-changes-to-controversial-policies/" target="_blank">what Unity have been doing</a>, Terraria developer Re-Logic announced today they've begun funding <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> and <a href="https://fna-xna.github.io/" target="_blank">FNA</a> with a big donation to each <em>and</em> ongoing funding.</p>
<p>Announced in a <a href="https://twitter.com/Terraria_Logic/status/1704227519027651016" target="_blank">statement</a> on X (Twitter), it reads as follows (copied into text, as it was an image statement):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The team at Re-Logic has been watching the recent events surrounding Unity with both interest and sadness. The loss of a formerly-leading and user-friendly game engine to the darker forces that negatively impact so much of the gaming industry has left us dismayed to put it mildly. While we do not personally use Unity (outside of a few elements on our console/mobile platforms), we feel like we cannot sit idly by as these predatory moves are made against studios everywhere.</p>
<p>We unequivocally condemn and reject the recent TOS/fee changes proposed by Unity and the underhanded way they were rolled out. The flippant manner with which years of trust cultivated by Unity were cast aside for yet another way to squeeze publishers, studios, and gamers is the saddest part. That this move was wholly unnecessary pushes things into the tragedy category - a cautionary tale the industry will not soon forget.</p>
<p>We do not feel that a simple public statement is sufficient. Even if Unity were to recant their policies and statements, the destruction of trust is not so easily repaired. We strongly feel that it is now equally important to get behind some of the other up and-coming open source game engines. Lighting some candles in an otherwise dark moment.</p>
<p>To that end, we are donating $100,000 to each of the open source engines listed below. Additionally, we are sponsoring each of these projects with $1,000/month each moving forward. All we ask in return is that they remain good people and keep doing all that they can to make these engines powerful and approachable for developers everywhere.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17879634681695157671gol1.jpeg"/></p>
<p>Re-Logic has always been supportive of game developers and indie studios that do things the right way. We feel that our actions in this moment are the best way to carry that mission forward - by accelerating and strengthening competing open source game engines, we hope to empower and assist studios that are struggling with how best to proceed given these recent events.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's amazing to see so many people in the industry come together like this. Looking across X (Twitter), there's been a big wave of developers trying out and attempting ports to game engines like Godot so even more backing for it and other open source projects is fantastic. Hopefully this continues to be a wake up call for the industry to rely a little less on proprietary software.</p>
<p>Since the initial uproar over Unity, we've seen the <a href="https://fund.godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine funding</a> go from around €25K per month to €44K, which is a change from around 438 members to 1,119 members.</p>

      <title>Check out the demo for Beacon Patrol based on the popular board game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a planned full release in 2024, developers BrutalHack and Shapes and Dreams have put up a demo for Beacon Patrol - a relaxing game all about exploring the ocean. It's actually a digital adaption of the board game of the same name, one that's quite highly rated too.</p>
<p>You play as the captain of the Coast Guard, as you navigate the North Sea to secure its beacon buoys, lighthouses and waterways. You do so by placing down tiles to gradually expand the map to explore. Each turn you place up to three tiles, connecting to the tile your ship is currently on and then move across, with the game ending once all tiles have been played and you score points for each tile that is connected to other tiles on all four sides.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="fdgT5c7BCuI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f767adcdd0ac6c285ee8ee47be8f7f9f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/fdgT5c7BCuI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Beacon Patrol Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore the North Sea, one tile at a time.</li>
<li>Experience the digital adaptation of the Beacon Patrol board game.</li>
<li>Team up with friends for a cooperative adventure at sea (Steam Remote Play Together supported).</li>
<li>Relaxing turn-based strategy meets calm maritime ambiance.</li>
</ul>
<p>I gave the demo a test today on my desktop and it worked great, seems like a lovely game overall to spend a little time with so be sure to give it a go.</p>
<p>At release it will have full Native Linux support and a demo is available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2273850/Beacon_Patrol/" target="_blank">right now on Steam</a>. The developer mentioned it's planned to be priced at $11.99.</p>

      <title>Embracer Group continues cuts with Beamdog shedding 26 people</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Is no studio safe from cuts? Embracer Group continues trying to reduce costs and now the latest we've seen has affected Beamdog. This news was confirmed via LinkedIn with multiple staffers (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7109542735073738754/" target="_blank">#1</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7109561841374175232/" target="_blank">#2</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7109588123667369984/" target="_blank">#3</a>) noting they had been laid off and multiple sources noting that a total of 26 people were given the boot.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with Beamdog they worked on the likes of Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition, Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition, Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition, Planescape: Torment: Enhanced Edition, Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition, Axis &amp; Allies 1942 Online and they just recently released MythForce.</p>
<p>This is all part of the immense cost-cutting that Embracer Group are doing after swallowing up absolutely loads of publishers and developers and then having a big funding deal <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/after-eating-up-lots-of-game-studios-embracer-group-set-to-close-a-bunch/" target="_blank">fail to go through</a>. Recent other reports include a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/embracers-troubles-continue-as-they-may-sell-off-borderlands-dev-gearbox/" target="_blank">possible sell-off of Gearbox</a> and they also completely <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/embracer-closes-volition-developer-of-freespace-red-faction-saints-row/" target="_blank">shut down Volition</a>.</p>
<p>What studio will be in the firing line next?</p>
<p>Once again, this massive consolidation in the gaming industry causing problems. Bigger companies keep acquiring, and then eventually getting rid of them when they're not hitting some ridiculous goals. Hopefully all of this will cause more companies to think "do we really want to do this?".</p>

      <title>Microsoft leak shows Fallout 3 and Oblivion Remasters, DOOM Year Zero and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems a whole bunch of gamers may be quite happy over the next few years, with a fresh leak from the ongoing saga of FTC v. Microsoft showing off a bunch of games coming. Spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/19/23880132/microsoft-ftc-documents-leak-oblivion-fallout-3-remaster-doom-xbox" target="_blank">The Verge</a>, the list is actually from 2020 so it is a bit outdated and no doubt the plans have changed since ZeniMax Media was acquired by Microsoft in 2021.</p>
<p>Named Titles include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fallout 3 Remaster</li>
<li>Oblivion Remaster</li>
<li>DOOM Year Zero</li>
<li>Ghostwire Tokyo Sequel</li>
<li>Dishonored 3</li>
<li>Indiana Jones</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus there's a few unnamed secret titles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project Hibiki</li>
<li>Project Kestrel</li>
<li>Project Platinum</li>
<li>Licensed IP Game</li>
</ul>
<p>Have to admit, the idea of a Fallout 3 Remaster has me quite excited, as possibly my favourite entry in the series. Hopefully at least some of this is still planned!</p>

      <title>Portal 2 VR mod gets an early release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Still one of the best puzzle games ever made, Valve's Portal 2 now has a community-made VR mod available in the early stages that's already quite impressive. The mod works, although it's certainly a little rough around the edges with various bits not quite hooked up yet. Even so, it's impressive what modders are able to do with bringing games into the VR space.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://github.com/Gistix/portal2vr" target="_blank">mod GitHub</a> it notes that single-player, 6DoF VR view, motion controls for the portal gun, grabbing objects and Workshop content work. And since the most recent update, the in-game menu now works too. They haven't hooked up the full UI yet though but it's playable enough to have a bit of fun with.</p>
<p>I decided to check it out and captured some footage of me fooling around in it. Using Proton, since I couldn't get it to work with Valve's original Native Linux build, along with my Valve Index headset:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="iM-ooCtjbl0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0209d525e537eec037a7048e8fbc6ca5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/iM-ooCtjbl0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Really impressive and they're working on it regularly, so it should just keep getting better.</p>
<p>You can buy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/620/Portal_2/" target="_blank">Portal 2 on Steam</a> and see the <a href="https://github.com/Gistix/portal2vr" target="_blank">VR Mod on GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>Unity Considers Tentative Changes To Controversial Policies</title>
      <author>Smellbringer</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you'll recall from our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-introduces-new-fees-for-game-devs-based-on-revenue-and-game-installs/" target="_blank">previous coverage</a>, Unity Software last week came out with a plan to change runtime policies into what could be mistaken for a suicide note. That plan involved game developers paying a fee of up to $0.20 for every game install after the 200,000 lifetime mark and $200,000 a year in revenue. This change would be retroactive as well, for games already released. It was a plan that left devs both asking questions as to the feasibility of tracking every install and being enraged at what would be a death blow to their operations.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-attempt-to-clarify-new-install-fees-as-developers-revolt/" target="_blank">backlash</a> to this scheme was immediate and painful. Indie devs announced they would either be <a href="https://twitter.com/cultofthelamb/status/1701715971663425897?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1701715971663425897%7Ctwgr%5E9a847cfa91ed7cc9692f1da1b25e7dc9cb0c1038%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fcult-of-the-lamb-developer-threatens-to-delete-game-on-jan-1-amid-unity-backlash" target="_blank">pulling their games</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/TafferKing451/status/1701722515910127745" target="_blank">swapping to a new engine</a>. CEO John Riccitiello got put back on the radar as everyone's CEO to hate after he had done so well to avoid the spotlight since ruining EA. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23873727/unity-credible-death-threat-offices-closed-pricing-change" target="_blank">Death threats were sent in</a> which forced an office closure. And Unity's stock price plunged in the following days as <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/09/18/3-red-flags-for-unity-softwares-future/" target="_blank">doubts over the company's future were cast</a>.</p>
<p>In response, Unity sent out a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-apologises-for-the-new-runtime-fee-say-they-will-make-changes/" target="_blank">feckless apology</a> last night and promised changes. However, they kept hush about what those changes would be, which only served to open them up to more mockery and hate. Now, <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1703815783216709995" target="_blank">as reported by Jason Schreier of Bloomberg</a>, Unity has laid out a tentative plan to try and repair its reputation while still wringing money out of devs.</p>
<p>Unity will now limit fees to 4% of revenue, it will only apply to games making over $1 million and that reaching the install threshold will no longer be retroactive. On top of this, instead of using tracking software, devs will now simply self-report how many installs of a game were made. CEO John Riccitiello also emphasized that this would only affect the top 10% of users, though whether that's true or not remains to be seen.</p>
<p>On the face of it, this is better good news for devs. The problem, at least on Unity's end, is that they've shattered developer trust. How can people trust them to not try and bring those disastrous policies back when no one is looking?</p>
<p>The idea of taking a small share of revenue was something devs had proposed as a potential monetization idea for Unity. If Unity had done that in the first place it would have avoided this whole embarrassing mess it finds itself in. More embarrassingly for Unity, one could assume that the swap to an install reporting scheme seems to be admitting the install tracking was either unfeasible or a bad idea entirely. Which it is a bad idea, and we should all be glad they're dropping it. But simply put, the whole thing has turned into a gigantic mess that could have been avoided if Unity had simply talked with it's users first about these changes to monetization.</p>
<p>As these plans are tentative however, it remains to be seen whether this is the path Unity goes down or not. Regardless, I think it's safe to say that Unity's days as the game engine of choice for many devs are over.</p>

      <title>Plasma 6 optimized for Wayland gaming, plus compositor crash recovery</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>KDE developer Nate Graham has two quite interesting updates in regards to the upcoming Plasma 6 desktop release, including some fun optimizations landing. The KDE team are pushing hard for Wayland right now, so it's no surprise to see a focus on improving performance.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2023/09/15/this-week-in-kde-more-plasma-6-dev/" target="_blank">update</a> posted a few days ago Graham mentions how work was done to improve cursor responsiveness for Plasma Wayland so it's "really very responsive now". The initial bug <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=472663" target="_blank">report</a> noted how "When the kwin_wayland compositing can't keep up, it doesn't just make the desktop stutter, it also makes the cursor stutter" so this has now been improved. Graham mentioned that work "also substantially improved latency in general, especially for games" which linked to another <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=431707" target="_blank">bug report</a> on how certain latency options on Plasma would cause frame drops when gaming so they've improved that too.</p>
<p>Various other improvements are coming like Discover having release data for SteamOS system updates displayed in a "prettier and more comprehensible way", plus the About page in Discover has been refreshed to look better.</p>
<p>They also changed the Activity Switcher shortcut to Meta+A as Meta+Tab is going to be used for something else that's "coming soon".</p>
<p>Lots more fixes came in recently too like Spectacle now properly taking Rectangular Region screenshots correctly when you're using any screen scale factors less than 100%, fixed a rare case where KWin would crash in the Plasma Wayland session when waking from sleep, while updating a lot of Flatpak apps at the same time, discover can no longer exhaust the system’s set of available file handles and then fail and more.</p>
<p>Another <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2023/09/17/so-lets-talk-about-this-wayland-thing/" target="_blank">blog post</a> from Graham also goes over what's really going on with Wayland, that's worth a read, giving a bit of a quick history lesson and going into where things stand right now including some issues it has noting that KDE, Valve and Blue Systems have been funding work to improve various areas.</p>
<p>On the subject of Wayland and Qt that you might also find interesting is that developer David Edmundson showed off seriously impressive work in a <a href="https://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/blog/qt6_wayland_robustness/" target="_blank">blog post</a> and videos "to make Qt clients more robust and seemlessly migrate between compositors, providing resistance against compositor crashes and more". In one video Edmundson showed killing off Kwin and having it properly recover everything that was open:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="u4HnwqidYFo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ef429e13151e4e033e2d7b0f27fefe30.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/u4HnwqidYFo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Just as exciting is the ability to switch the entire desktop environment, while keeping everything open. In the below video Edmundson starts off on KDE Plasma with Counter-Strike: Global Offensive open and starts just jumping through other desktops with it. Very cool!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JYfzAuRmBjo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/012b56396256772e3cad87e9dc3b8633.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JYfzAuRmBjo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some seriously good stuff going on for Linux and Wayland right now, great to see!</p>

      <title>Gamescope added support for ReShade shaders on Linux / SteamOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope" target="_blank">Gamescope</a>, the microcompositor from Valve that is used on the Steam Deck that can also be used on desktop Linux, just got a major upgrade.</p>
<p>What exactly does Gamescope do? Think of it like a piece of software that handles display output. So for the Steam Deck, it's what actually displays your games in Gaming Mode. For desktop Linux you can use it to run games directly to force resolution, AMD FSR, NVIDIA Image Scaling, border-less window, full-screen window and more.</p>
<p>Developer Joshua Ashton has been hacking away on HDR support, some of which has shipped in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/steam-deck-os-35-now-in-preview-with-hdr-vrr-and-display-colour-settings/" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.5 Preview</a> but another fun addition recently is work on support for ReShade. The documentation for Gamescope has now been updated to note it supports a "subset of Reshade effects/shaders" and so this provides an easy way to layer "shader effects (ie. CRT shader, film grain, debugging HDR with histograms, etc) on top of whatever is being displayed in Gamescope without having to hook into the underlying process".</p>
<p>On their Fediverse social media page, they <a href="https://idtech.space/notice/AZkig3bhAe2XaRkgoy" target="_blank">mentioned</a> with some screenshots:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I got Reshade shaders working under Gamescope/SteamOS today!</p>
<p>Which means we can get Lilium/EndlesslyFlowering's amazing HDR Analysis shaders to work on all HDR games on SteamOS.</p>
<p>This will be super useful for users and developers.</p>

<p>Some other notes from the changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is currently no way to set the value of uniforms/options, they will just be their initializer values currently.</p>
<p>Using Reshade effects will increase latency as there will be work performed on the general gfx + compute queue as opposed to only using the realtime async compute queue which can run in tandem with the game's gfx work.</p>
<p>Using Reshade effects is <strong>highly discouraged</strong> for doing simple transformations which can be achieved with LUTs/CTMs which are possible to do in the DC (Display Core) on AMDGPU at scanout time, or with the current regular async compute composite path. The looks system where you can specify your own 3D LUTs would be a better alternative for such transformations.</p>
<p>Pull requests for improving Reshade compatibility support are appreciated.</p>

      <title>Nintendo 3DS emulator Citra adds Vulkan support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nintendo 3DS emulation is about to get a whole lot better, as Citra <a href="https://citra-emu.org/entry/citra-vulkan-announcement/" target="_blank">now has Vulkan</a> support bringing better performance for players. This follows on from the devs teasing Vulkan back in an <a href="https://citra-emu.org/entry/citra-progress-report-2023-q1/#surprise-announcement" target="_blank">earlier</a> progress report in March.</p>
<p>Joining many other emulators in modernising their rendering systems like Dolphin, Ryujinx, RPCS3 and yuzu. In the announcement they showed the difference with an Intel Core i3-1005G1 going from 75FPS to 115FPS. It's currently in their <a href="https://github.com/citra-emu/citra-nightly/releases" target="_blank">nightly</a> releases and will eventually be in their main downloads.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11969395441695041616gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11969395441695041616gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Super Mario 3D Land</em></p>
<p>This brings with it improved Android support, support on macOS once again thanks to translation to Metal via MoltenVK, users on older AMD GPUs and more.</p>
<p>Since it's still early days though, it won't be anywhere close to perfect so you should expect to see issues. They have a few noted things to be aware of:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Do not expect Vulkan to fix old emulation bugs that are not related to graphics or rendering.</li>
<li>Do not expect Vulkan to render games correctly that our OpenGL backend does not render correctly. Aside from OpenGL or Vulkan driver bugs, switching between the APIs shouldn’t show any visual difference. If that is the case for you, please report this to us!</li>
<li>Do not expect Vulkan to be an improvement over OpenGL in every aspect, on every device. Whilst Vulkan provides better performance than OpenGL in most cases, that is not always the case.</li>
<li>As of writing, Vulkan does not have full feature parity with our OpenGL backend. We will list some of the missing features below.</li>
<li>Whilst Vulkan currently has a disk pipeline cache, as well as runtime shader caching, an actual Disk Shader Cache for it is not yet implemented. As such, you may still experience some shader stutter at the start of each session until that is properly implemented.</li>
<li>Recording your gameplay using Video Dumping is not yet implemented.</li>
<li>Texture Filtering and Post-Processing Shaders are not yet implemented.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see more projects pick up Vulkan support, should keep it running nicely into the future. Especially when they add in all the features, the performance should be great.</p>

      <title>Unity apologises for the new runtime fee, say they will make changes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After leaving developers furious for nearly a whole week after the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-attempt-to-clarify-new-install-fees-as-developers-revolt/" target="_blank">recent announcement</a> of making developers pay for game installs, Unity put up a fresh statement. I really do suggest you read that previous link for context, where I went over various issues.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/unity/status/1703547752205218265" target="_blank">statement</a> from Unity posted on X is as follows: "We have heard you. We apologize for the confusion and angst the runtime fee policy we announced on Tuesday caused. We are listening, talking to our team members, community, customers, and partners, and will be making changes to the policy. We will share an update in a couple of days. Thank you for your honest and critical feedback."</p>
<p>So right now game developers have to wait and see what changes Unity come up with. For some, nothing short of entirely reversing it will do. Plenty of developers are already quite unhappy with the latest statement since it has nothing of actual substance after waiting nearly a week.</p>
<p>The problem is, as said by many developers, the trust has been <em>broken</em>. They've shown a total disregard for game developers since they're willing to change the terms on them at any point. Even if they put in protections against that, as shown before, they could just remove them again. How can a company rebuild trust when it has been so badly broken? It certainly will be interesting to see what they actually do.</p>
<p>Looks like we're in for an interesting week ahead for the industry…</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 8-15 release fixes Mafia Definitive Edition</title>
      <author>Smellbringer</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Not one to be left out of the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/steam-deck-os-35-now-in-preview-with-hdr-vrr-and-display-colour-settings/" target="_blank">updating festivities</a> it seems, Glorious Eggroll has dropped GE-Proton 8-15. This version makes a few changes but honestly it's a smaller update than <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/ge-proton-8-14-released-deprecated-workarounds-removed/" target="_blank">8-14 was</a>. The biggest news here is for fans of Mafia Definitive Edition but here's the <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton8-15" target="_blank">full rundown</a>:</p>

      <title>Heroes of Might and Magic II game engine fheroes2 v1.0.8 out now</title>
      <author>fheroes2</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A fresh <strong>1.0.8</strong> version of the Heroes of Might and Magic 2 game engine has been<a href="https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2/releases/tag/1.0.8" target="_blank"><strong> </strong>released</a> recently and here're some tips about what's new in the <strong>fheroes2 project</strong>.</p>
<p>The most noticeable change every player will notice, is the enhanced look of the <strong>Save/Load file window</strong>. This window was expanded to support much longer filenames and not to be so compressed in size.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1650453631694881889gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1650453631694881889gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>The <strong>AI</strong> in this release became smarter during battles and will <strong>kite</strong> their <strong>shooters</strong> if necessary instead of waiting to get hit. On the other hand, on <u>lower difficulties</u> the AI's use of "<em>Dimension door</em>" spell has been given <strong>restrictions</strong>, making these modes easier.<br/>
<br/>
The team spent a lot of time improving multiple aspects of the UI, including <strong>expanding</strong> existing <strong>translations</strong>, adding missing <strong>letters in fonts</strong>, and making more elements <u>translatable</u>. One of the examples of this work is translated <strong>vertical buttons</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15176869411694881912gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15176869411694881912gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>The work on the <strong>Editor</strong> continues. In this release, we completed <strong>terrain connections</strong> logic to make smooth transitions between terrain types. An interesting fact is that the team is working on the translation part for the Editor in parallel. At the time when we make it accessible to the public, you will be able to use the Editor in a language of your choice.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7979833711694881930gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7979833711694881930gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Besides these major changes, this release contains a lot of small changes to polish the game engine and make the game play even better. Adding High Score for multiplayer game, fixing rendering issues in the Kingdom Overview dialog, speeding up file loading and many more such things are included in this release. All major translations have been updated bringing most of them to 100% coverage.<br/>
<br/>
More than <strong>50 bugs</strong> were fixed for this release.<br/>

      <title>Steam Deck OS 3.5 now in Preview with HDR, VRR and display colour settings</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For those who wish to test out the very latest improvements to the Steam Deck, Valve has put up Steam Deck OS 3.5 into Preview now. In the official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3686804163591367815" target="_blank">announcement</a> Valve go over a big list of new features and fixes, so here's some of what's included.</p>
<p>The most immediate change you'll notice is that Valve tweaked the default display colour settings, as they said it has been adjusted to "emulate the sRGB color gamut, resulting in a slightly warmer and more vibrant color appearance". This is adjustable, with the new display settings being added:</p>
<ul>
<li>Native: The native display color appearance (the color rendering for Steam Deck prior to this update).</li>
<li>sRGB: Emulate the sRGB primaries, in a smooth manner that does not introduce gradient clipping.</li>
<li>Boosted: Emulate a wider-gamut display appearance, resulting in increased apparent vibrance. May result in gradient clipping.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/351668591694881214gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/351668591694881214gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>On top of that for external displays the Steam Deck now supports HDR, and you can also enable VRR if supported by the USB-C adaptor you're using. Valve also adjusted the Quick Access scaling options, separating them from the filters with added Stretch and Zoom scaling options.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5157395231694881327gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5157395231694881327gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Plus there's some performance improvements with compositing being avoided in additional scenarios, which Valve say will reduce latency and stutter when you have multiple overlays. On top of that they even improved latency in some cases where games / apps render slower than the refresh rate.</p>
<p>There's so much more to it, with this likely being the biggest upgrade for the Steam Deck since release. There's an upgraded graphics driver that has lots of improvements like better performance for Starfield, fixed corruption in Amnesia: The Bunker, fixed launch failures for Immortals of Aveum and Kaiju-A-GoGo and no doubt lots of other fixes.</p>
<p>Some other quick picks from it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved sleep resume speed.</li>
<li>Improved Bluetooth connection stability.</li>
<li>The performance overlay can be customized via configuration files.</li>
<li>An upgraded Arch Linux base for the operating system.</li>
<li>An upgrade to the KDE Plasma desktop mode.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where certain workloads would exhibit severe CPU performance issues unless SMT was manually disabled.</li>
<li>External storage devices are now auto-mounted when connected to Steam Deck.</li>
</ul>
<p>Valve also noted Firmware 116 was released bringing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added voltage offset settings.</li>
<li>Improved robustness of the Firmware Settings Reset chord (Volume Down + Quick-Access + Power) against some boot hang scenarios.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare issue that would set the processor TDP limit too low causing CPU and GPU frequencies to be stuck at 400 MHz and 200 MHz respectively.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue when the charging light would turn back on when plugged in for a while after fully charged.</li>
</ul>
<p>How to get it? Press the STEAM button -&gt; go to Settings -&gt; System -&gt; System Update Channel and pick Preview. It will then reboot, then hit Check For Updates.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12306241081694881103gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12306241081694881103gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16131353281694881104gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16131353281694881104gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Since it's in Preview, it means it's ready enough for anyone to try it out and they will send it as a Stable update to all users once it's had more testing.</p>
<p>What's your favourite addition in this update?</p>

      <title>qomp2 is an artful reimagining of Pong that looks pretty wild</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A sequel to the qomp, a minimilist and supremely clever reimagining of Pong was not on my bingo card but here we are. Atari and Graphite Lab recently revealed qomp2. The first game in the series qomp was short but a damn fine experience, and actually one of my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/02/qomp-is-a-brilliant-example-of-minimalist-mechanics-and-a-fantastic-idea/" target="_blank">indie highlights from 2021</a> because it really was fun. So a proper full expansive follow-up sounds great to me.</p>
<p>qomp2 captures the simplicity of Pong by giving players only two buttons to navigate a series of labyrinthine levels packed with “harder than they look” challenges. Stepping into the spherical body of the renegade runaway, players will ping-pong their way through the dangerous, minimalistic world of qomp2. With a variety of enemies and bosses helping to mark the journey, the escapee will adventure through 30 challenging levels across four distinct worlds.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="tah154H6i1o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7123b6223d236c9124c0d19fceffe15b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/tah154H6i1o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Cerebral Puzzling: The simple, two-button controls belie complex and compelling gameplay. Use your reflexes to think ahead and master 30 tricky levels. Hidden collectibles on the map push you to explore every inch of the creatively rich minimalist environment.</li>
<li>Bounce Between Emotions: qomp2 is an enigmatic story of doubt, fear, and self-acceptance, told wordlessly with simple animations, effects, and the game mechanics themselves — a surprising twist based on the classic Pong.</li>
<li>Surprises Galore: If the game’s premise doesn’t raise an eyebrow, just wait until you dive into the challenges, which get increasingly difficult as you master new aspects of gameplay. And don’t worry, death is not the end in this arcade-inspired world. Quick respawn makes sure you’re back in the action in seconds.</li>
<li>Bountiful Bosses: Four bosses block your escape at the end of each world. Use your newfound skills to master their attacks and defenses in order to move on. Much like a real game of Pong, you must be prepared to defend your position!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Secret underwater Bees? The APICO 3.0 update sounds interesting</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>APICO is a really sweet game about saving and breeding Bees, and the free 3.0 update is now set for flight on September 26th with plenty of fun sounding additions. Taking ideas from real-life with a bit of fantasy mixed in, APICO blends together beekeeping, gardening, crafting and exploration into a cute relaxing gem. A portion of the proceeds from sales also goes towards bee conservation.</p>
<p>Here's what they say will be in the 3.0 update:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>New areas:</strong> Dive deep down to the bottom of the ocean and discover a new bee-ome with new areas to explore that include deep-sea flora and fauna, a coral reef system, and more!</li>
<li><strong>New Bees:</strong> Discover, collect, build homes and breed new species of bees found only at the furthest depths of the ocean, and collect their resources for craftables and quests.</li>
<li><strong>New Quests:</strong> Harness the help of your newfound bee friends to restore the damaged coral reef system and clean up underwater pollution to help the bee-cosystem and its inhabitants thrive.</li>
<li><strong>New Fishing Mechanic: </strong>Skipper’s dad, Captain, arrives at the archipelago to teach you the ins and outs of a new mechanic — fishing!</li>
<li><strong>And More:</strong> New quality-of-life improvements, including a newly added trash can and nearby chest auto-deposit, will help your beekeeping bee-come more efficient than ever! </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>What the heck are Bees doing underwater? Check out the new trailer:</p>

<p>It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified. According to Steam users have given it a Very Positive rating. Beeautiful to see. I quite enjoyed my own time with it, although I do need to go back and explore a lot more with it because it's really lovely.</p>
<p>Main features of the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Play together</strong> with up to four in online co-op, with cross-play available on all platforms!</li>

      <title>Cyberpunk 2077 gets the 2.0 update on September 21st</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>CD PROJEKT RED have now revealed the 2.0 update for Cyberpunk 2077 releases on September 21st, plus there's a new cinematic trailer for Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty DLC that releases September 26th.</p>
<p>It's currently rated Steam Deck Verified, and works great on desktop Linux, but will that change with the huge upgrade and DLC? Only time will tell, hopefully there won't be many issues but I'll be taking a look at the update at release to see how it runs and let you know.</p>
<p>Some of what's coming to the 2.0 update includes an overhaul to the perk system, vehicle combat, an updated police system, various AI improvements, and much more. It's going to make it feel like a very different game. Check out the new 2.0 update trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="odf7Q8Plcvw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e531caab9eabfbe5c1221a7553bd6080.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/odf7Q8Plcvw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Here's the cinematic trailer for the Phantom Liberty DLC which adds in a whole new area with a new story, a new skill tree and much more:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="sJbexcm4Trk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/412a17a72618044558531c908477c164.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/sJbexcm4Trk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developers also released a new <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/build-planner" target="_blank">build planner</a>, since it's such a big overhaul so you can plan ahead as you'll be given a one-time chance to redistribute all your points when you jump in after the 2.0 update lands.</p>
<p>Are you looking forward to them both? Let me know in the comments.</p>
<p>You can pre-order the DLC on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2138330/Cyberpunk_2077_Phantom_Liberty/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store (GOG Key)</a> and <a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/cyberpunk_2077_phantom_liberty?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> direct.</p>

      <title>Heretic&#39;s Fork is an unholy blending of deck-building and tower defense</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I think my love for Vampire Survivor like games has ended, and a new relationship has been made with Heretic's Fork because it's simply brilliant. Note: personal purchase.</p>
<p>Merging together a deck-builder with a tower defense game isn't that unusual, but what it does with it is fantastic. Your job as Hell's Manager is to punish sinners. You do so through their weird computer system, the Heretic's Fork, which has you go through a tower defense game where you place down towers and buildings that spawn units, while continually upgrading them as it constantly ramps up the difficulty. You only get the middle of the map, with enemies constantly swarming in around you and it's chaos.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13518015911694703783gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13518015911694703783gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19959801151694703785gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19959801151694703785gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Click pictured to enlarge them.</em></p>
<p>It's sort-of turn based because as your towers and creatures take down enemies, the bar on the right fills up to then start a new "turn". This is where you will pick your cards to place down towers, units, upgrades, combine cards to upgrade them, banish useless cards so they don't come back during a run and more. However, as you're doing all this, time is only slowed down — so you can't take your sweet time, you need to get going as it's all still going on in the background just a lot slower.</p>
<p>Thankfully there <em>is</em> a pause button if you need a breather, and you can also speed it up if you find the initial speed a little too slow, although I would like to see another additional speed to breeze through the start.</p>
<p>Outside of the tower defense, there's plenty of meta features going on with the computer system. You have card upgrades, character unlocks, a hellish version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant" target="_blank">clippy</a> constantly telling you things and more. It's delightfully devilish in giving you that burning feeling of needing not just one more run, but ten more runs. It will absolutely suck you in.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="I692_iRf6SY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c653a139d13bdd8c27a3edea9a4ccfb0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/I692_iRf6SY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You'll want to unlock that second character as soon as you can too, having more tower slots unlocked from the start is incredibly useful to get further into a run to earn more money to then use to buy more things in the meta computer desktop section. Oh, and the second character can lock a card each turn if you have the energy for it too - very useful.</p>
<p>I'm no stranger to tower defense games, with my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/send-help-as-i-have-discovered-bloons-td-6/" target="_blank">previous favourite being Bloons TD 6</a> but this is like if Bloons had a serious nightmare that made it wake up sweating and screaming. It's just as deliciously addictive, if not more. It can take a little while to properly get into it, especially as the game sprinkles in the extra meta features as you play through and learning about the different upgrades and combinations takes a while. But as you play more, you get a lot more out of it, as you start to see the different stages and different types of enemies as you come up with ways to take them down.</p>
<p>Once you start getting quite a few runs in, and build up some monies, the game will continue to expand. There's a shop where you can buy more cards and trust me, you'll want to as some of them are quite powerful and you'll also start gaining new types of towers here too — but you won't know what they are until you buy them.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5842239541694713106gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5842239541694713106gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>This feels like the first time discovering <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/loop-hero-is-out-now-and-im-going-to-need-help-to-tear-myself-away-from-it/" target="_blank">Loop Hero</a> all over again, another game where plenty of it puts you in the backseat as you watch it all unfold. This is why I love indie developers, they make some of the coolest most unique experiences around that won't make your wallet bleed. Oh, and the music absolutely slaps too.</p>
<p>During a run you're not only dealing with your cards though. At the end of a section, you also get to pick a special upgrade like a big boost to HP regeneration, another tower slot, a big boost to tower attack power and much more. Additionally, some cards will give you active abilities like adding to your HP, placing down an area to curse enemies and more and these abilities can be set to auto-fire when ready if you wish. There's just so many little bits that add up to a really entertaining time.</p>
<p>Heretic's Fork also has leaderboards to let you see how you stack up against your friends. So GamingOnLinux contributor Scaine doesn't know it yet, but we're now officially locked in a battle for who can punish the most sinners. Even if it takes me all night, I will take the crown.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2819363291694715370gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2819363291694715370gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>On Linux desktop it works without any issues with Proton Experimental. Perfect performance, and no problems through any part as far as I can tell. For Steam Deck, it doesn't have controller support, but that's actually not a problem at all since the controls are just simply moving a mouse around a little bit so it also works pretty much to perfection on Steam Deck too. Some of the text on Steam Deck is a little small but not a big problem here.</p>
<p>I find the more I play, the more it tickles my brain in a similar way the Vampire Survivors once did. I need to play more, I need to find some ridiculous tower combinations and upgrade them to become as powerful as the devil himself.</p>
<p>There's not many times in the history of this website where I will tell you so crystal clearly to just go and buy the damn game but here we are: go and buy Heretic's Fork. It's awesome. My new favourite game to kill time with and ignore emails over.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2181610/Heretics_Fork/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. For under £10 this is an absolute gem.</p>
<p>Here's a video of it on Steam Deck:</p>

      <title>Valve puts the Steam Deck and Dock on sale again, get up to 20% off</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Joining the Steam 20 year celebration, the Steam Deck and Docking Station are now discounted across all three models when buying brand new from Valve.</p>
<p>This is only the third time they've ever been on sale, and stock tends to run out quite quickly whenever there's a discount so if you've been sitting on the fence now would be a good time to pick one up. It's an incredibly versatile Linux machine and my favourite gaming device.</p>
<ul>
<li>64GB - 10% off (£314.10 / $359)</li>
<li>256GB - 15% off (£390.15 / $450)</li>
<li>512GB - 20% off (£455.20 / $519)</li>
</ul>
<p>With the Docking Station also 20% off at £63.20 / $71.20.</p>
<p>A good time for another reason, as last month Deck Verified hit <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/over-11000-games-now-rated-steam-deck-playable/" target="_blank">over 11,000 titles playable</a>. That's only what Valve has directly tested though, plenty more will run just fine. From some of the latest AAA games, indie games to classics from many years ago - a lot is possible to run on it. Even some great emulators too with the help of projects like <a href="https://www.emudeck.com/" target="_blank">EmuDeck</a> and <a href="https://retrodeck.net/" target="_blank">RetroDECK</a>.</p>
<p>Buy the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" target="_blank">Steam Deck on Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeckdock" target="_blank">Dock here</a>. Additionally the Steam Deck is also on sale in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong <a href="https://steamdeck.komodo.jp/" target="_blank">via Komodo</a>.</p>
<p>The sale lasts until September 21st while stock lasts.</p>

      <title>Tomb Raider I-III Remastered heads to Steam from Aspyr</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Releasing in February 14th, 2024 - Tomb Raider I-III Remastered is heading to Steam thanks to Aspyr Media. The remasters were announced today for various consoles, with it also appearing for pre-order now on Steam. Time to replay a bit of history!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="68hISohBKmI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b5ec2a583843ecf225dac38e2674861b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/68hISohBKmI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Discover Lara Croft’s Original Adventures, Lovingly Restored</p>
<p>Play the Original Three Tomb Raider Adventures: For the first time ever, play the complete experience with all expansions and secret levels on modern platforms in this definitive collection.</p>
<p>Included Game Titles</p>
<ul>
<li>Tomb Raider I + The Unfinished Business Expansion</li>
<li>Tomb Raider II + The Gold Mask Expansion</li>
<li>Tomb Raider III + The Lost Artifact Expansion</li>
</ul>
<p>Key Features</p>
<p>Solve Ancient Mysteries: Uncover treasures of the ancient world by solving puzzles and unraveling mysteries lost to the ravages of time.<br/>

</blockquote>
<p>While they won't have a Native Linux version, no doubt they will run well in Proton. With full controller support, they could be great games for the Steam Deck too. Nice to see more classic games getting updated properly for modern platforms without completely remaking them.</p>

      <title>Unity attempt to clarify new install fees as developers revolt</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The saga with the Unity game engine continues, after their completely botched announcement of a new fee system game developers will need to pay.</p>
<p>Just to briefly bring you up to speed from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-introduces-new-fees-for-game-devs-based-on-revenue-and-game-installs/" target="_blank">the previous article</a>: once developers hit <em>both</em> a revenue and install threshold for their games, they will then need to pay Unity for <em>each</em> install after the threshold is met. For example: based on their "standard rate" on Unity Personal if developers made at least $200K in the last 12 months, and had at least 200,000 total game installs, each install after would cost them $0.20 per new install but it's less on Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise (and less again on each when install milestones are hit).</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that Unity <em>very</em> badly explained it, although the whole idea just doesn't seem to be very good. One big issue is that this change is <em>retroactive</em> for <em>existing</em> released games. So any game currently on the market that uses Unity will need to begin paying for each time a new player installs their game, if they're over those thresholds after January 1st, 2024.</p>
<p>It didn't help that when Unity tried to clarify these details, initially they said that re-installs of games will count towards the installs <em>and</em> that would include installs on new hardware. They've since clarified <a href="https://forum.unity.com/threads/unity-plan-pricing-and-packaging-updates.1482750/" target="_blank">again</a> to say it's only for the "first install and we have no desire to charge for the same person doing ongoing installs".</p>
<p>In another clarification <a href="https://twitter.com/unity/status/1702077049425596900" target="_blank">post</a> on social network X, Unity mentioned "more than 90% of our customers will not be affected by this change", which means at least 90% of Unity users <em>don't</em> make $200K a year and have fewer than 200K installs total at a minimum. <em>Not exactly the best advert for their game engine.</em> They also clarified these details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How we define and count installs: Assuming the install and revenue thresholds are met, we will only count net new installs on any device starting Jan 1, 2024. Additionally, developers are not responsible for paying a runtime fee on:<br/>
- Re-install charges - we are not going to charge a fee for re-installs.<br/>
- Fraudulent installs charges - we are not going to charge a fee for fraudulent installs. We will work directly with you on cases where fraud or botnets are suspected of malicious intent.<br/>
- Trials, partial play demos, and automation installs (devops) charges - we are not going to count these toward your install count. Early access games are not considered demos.<br/>
- Web and streaming games - we are not going to count web and streaming games toward your install count either.<br/>
- Charity-related installs - the pricing change and install count will not be applied to your charity bundles/initiatives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh, and their updated <a href="https://unity.com/pricing-updates" target="_blank">FAQ</a> <em>still</em> claims that different devices are a different install so they will count again. So if you switch between a PC, a laptop, a Steam Deck, ROG Ally - or other devices, developers will have to pay each time. I don't need to explain why that's ridiculous do I? Why should a game developer pay their game engine multiple times just because a user who purchased their game installed it in more than one place. Absolute idiocy.</p>
<p>The big problem is: how are they tracking these installs? Well, they <em>won't</em> actually tell anyone. They just <a href="https://twitter.com/unity/status/1701689241456021607" target="_blank">claim</a> "We leverage our own proprietary data model, so you can appreciate that we won’t go into a lot of detail, but we believe it gives an accurate determination of the number of times the runtime is distributed for a given project." — so you have to trust them.</p>
<p>According to Facepunch developer Alistair McFarlane on <a href="https://twitter.com/Alistair_McF/status/1701997285167489522" target="_blank">X</a>, "The Rust cheat community already has a working reinstall script for Rust with a unique HW spoofer on each install". No doubt there will be more like it. Detecting and accounting for spoofed installs is going to be a nightmare for developers by the looks of it.</p>
<p>Even with the clarifications, and even if Unity eventually did a big u-turn on all this, it doesn't change that the trust is broken to just spring such a complete overhaul to their fee system including making it retroactive. Compounding that issue is how Unity previously said in <a href="https://blog.unity.com/community/updated-terms-of-service-and-commitment-to-being-an-open-platform" target="_blank">2019</a> that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you obtain a version of Unity, and don’t upgrade your project, we think you should be able to stick to that version of the TOS.</p>
<p>In practice, that is only possible if you have access to bug fixes. For this reason, we now allow users to continue to use the TOS for the same major (year-based) version number, including Long Term Stable (LTS) builds that you are using in your project.</p>
<p>Moving forward, we will host TOS changes on Github to give developers full transparency about what changes are happening, and when. The link is https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/TermsOfService.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That GitHub was taken down but hey, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220716084623/https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/TermsOfService" target="_blank">Wayback Machine archive</a> exists. However, it was also made clear in their <a href="https://unity.com/legal/terms-of-service/software-legacy" target="_blank">legacy TOS</a> as well when you read "if the Updated Terms adversely impact your rights, you may elect to continue to use any current-year versions of the Unity Software (e.g., 2018.x and 2018.y and any Long Term Supported (LTS) versions for that current-year release) according to the terms that applied just prior to the Updated Terms" but this TOS was <em>replaced</em> in October 13, 2022 with a <a href="https://unity.com/legal/editor-terms-of-service/software" target="_blank">new TOS</a> that entirely <em>removes</em> this protection for developers. <em>Nice bait and switch there Unity.</em></p>
<p>Developers certainly aren't pleased, <em>pissed-off</em> would be an massive understatement, with many putting out statements calling for Unity to reverse the whole thing, some even mentioning they will remove their games. Lots of developers are now looking at Godot, Unreal, Game Maker and other engines to see if they can switch for their next or existing projects too.</p>
<p>Some choice picks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mega Crit, developer of Slay the Spire, with their statement on X <a href="https://twitter.com/MegaCrit/status/1702077576209207611" target="_blank">noting</a> that they will switch game engine unless it's entirely reversed and that "We have never made a public statement before. That is how badly you fucked up.".</li>
<li>Cult of the Lamb developers <a href="https://twitter.com/cultofthelamb/status/1701715971663425897" target="_blank">say</a> they will delete the game on January 1st.</li>
<li>Publisher Devolver Digital now <a href="https://twitter.com/devolverdigital/status/1701685282129539485" target="_blank">say</a> to "Definitely include what engine you’re using in game pitches.", as no doubt this install fee will heavily complicate the developer-publisher relationship with tracking it accurately across so many places.</li>
<li>Developer Rami Ismail <a href="https://twitter.com/tha_rami/status/1701656537352028373" target="_blank">mentions</a> an important bit in a thread on X, on how "Hey but seriously, if you're a marginalized dev at risk of hate brigading and your Unity game is available on any DRM-free platform, basically you're utterly fucked at this point unless this gets reversed. There's a moral imperative to tell Unity leadership to get fucked here.".<br/>
<em>Given how, noted above, Rust cheaters already have a hardware spoofer it's not looking good.</em></li>
<li>Garry Newman of Facepunch said "Unity can get fucked" in a <a href="https://garry.net/posts/unity-can-get-fucked" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</li>
<li>Innersloth, developer of Among Us, <a href="https://twitter.com/InnerslothDevs/status/1701731398498013575" target="_blank">mentioned</a> they would "delay content and features our players actually want to port our game elsewhere".</li>
<li>Brandon Sheffield of Necrosoft Games wrote a blog post titled "<a href="https://insertcredit.com/opinion/unity/" target="_blank">The death of unity</a>" that mentions "But now I can say, unequivocally, if you're starting a new game project, do not use Unity. If you started a project 4 months ago, it's worth switching to something else. Unity is quite simply not a company to be trusted."</li>
</ul>
<p>I could pull out hundreds more, but you get the idea. It's not small names being annoyed by this, it seems like one of the few times almost the entire industry has rallied around something like this. Even Geoff Keighley <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1701791508285063587" target="_blank">replied</a> to Unity on X to say "What a joke.".</p>
<p>Worse still, is that developers at Unity did reportedly give <a href="https://twitter.com/georgebsocial/status/1701678249086992478" target="_blank">their concerns</a> about the announcement which were ignored.</p>
<p>The reality is that install tracking will be a nightmare. It's something that might sound good in theory, but it has so many problems it just seems like it wasn't really properly thought-through.</p>

      <title>VKDoom is a ZDoom-based source port with a focus on Vulkan</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this is pretty fun to see! The ZDoom / GZDoom family is expanding with VKDoom, a new source-port that has a focus on expanded Vulkan support and modern rendering. Now it's worth noting that GZDoom already supports Vulkan, but VKDoom has a focus on making the Vulkan support much more modern with advanced rendering features for modern GPUs.</p>
<p>Currently the official site doesn't go into a lot of detail about it since it's quite new. What we do know is that VKDoom is being synced with the main GZDoom as they work on it, so all the GZDoom modding and editing features should work out of the box.</p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18661676511694628893gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18661676511694628893gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Pictured above is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2113270/DISDAIN/" target="_blank">DISDAIN</a> an upcoming fast-paced, visceral retro-styled first person shooter built on VKDoom by the people making VKDoom. It's launching sometime "soon" with Linux support.</p>
<p>Some features it has from their <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/VKDoom" target="_blank">Wiki</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>All features from latest version of mainline GZDoom (<a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/ACS" target="_blank">ACS</a>, <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/ZScript" target="_blank">ZScript</a>, <a href="https://doomwiki.org/w/index.php?title=ZMusic&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" target="_blank">ZMusic</a> etc)</li>
<li>Vulkan based renderer:
<ul>
<li>Raytraced baked lightmaps (produced from <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/ZDRay" target="_blank">ZDRay</a>)</li>
<li>Raytraced dynamic shadows</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Support for the <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/DEHEXTRA" target="_blank">DEHEXTRA</a> standard</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Engine_1" target="_blank">Unreal Engine 1</a> style light coronas</li>
<li>Modified defaults as per community feedback (like None - Linear texture filtering and more optimized defaults to better represent the IWAD games - full list here <a href="https://github.com/dpjudas/VkDoom/commit/896102c1793e565cb9832d4b2ecc5edf0e41a5c6" target="_blank">https://github.com/dpjudas/VkDoom/commit/896102c1793e565cb9832d4b2ecc5edf0e41a5c6</a>)</li>
<li>Hitbox rendering with r_showhitbox</li>
<li>Alternate mouse cursors for the IWAD games</li>
<li><a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/ZScript" target="_blank">ZScript</a> extensions related to save games and automap access</li>
<li>New <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/MAPINFO" target="_blank">MAPINFO</a> property NoAutoSaveOnEnter, and a CHANGELEVEL_NOAUTOSAVE flag for ChangeLevel (both ZScript and ACS) - that disables the hardcoded saves when entering a map</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They said they will also continue to push code back to GZDoom so "eventually GZDoom will inherit much of the technology on display in VKDoom". For now, it seems it was easier to get all the advanced features done in a fork.</p>
<p>In regards to a question about Linux builds being available or needing to be built manually the official VKDoom account on X <a href="https://twitter.com/VKDoomEngine/status/1701577696529289456" target="_blank">replied</a>: "There will be, eventually. There's still lots of work to be done on other parts of the engine currently, so we can't spare enough manpower to take care of Linux and Mac yet. Stay tuned!"</p>
<p>See more on the <a href="https://vkdoom.org/" target="_blank">official site</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dpjudas/VkDoom" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>Linux Mint Debian Edition 6 &#39;Faye&#39; enters Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For those of you who want a stable Linux distribution with the Cinnamon desktop, Linux Mint Debian Edition seems like a nice choice and the latest release is <a href="https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=4562" target="_blank">now in Beta</a>. It should be much the same as the normal Linux Mint distribution, but directly based on Debian instead of Ubuntu.</p>
<p>Their goal with it is to ensure Linux Mint could carry on, in the event of something problematic happening with Ubuntu, they say it's "also one of our development targets, to guarantee the software we develop is compatible outside of Ubuntu".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17961074521694620422gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17961074521694620422gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
Pictured - LMDE 6 "Faye"</p>
<p>Based upon Debian 12 "Bookworm", it should be a nice upgrade for anyone who was still using LMDE 5. The Mint team don't really go into any detail on what exactly has changed yet, and the <a href="https://linuxmint.com/rel_faye.php" target="_blank">release notes</a> are simply going over some known issues. It should be largely the same as the most recent main Linux Mint release like Cinnamon 5.8 desktop, updated apps, an improved look and feel, full support for HEIF and AVIF image files, a resizable main menu, multi-threaded thumbnails for the Nemo file manager and more.</p>
<p>Do you use LMDE? Let us know why in the comments.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck not picking up your SD Card? Check for the latest update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After Valve recently launched a stable Steam Client update for desktop and Steam Deck, along with the recent SteamOS 3.4.10 release - SD Cards became a bit problematic.</p>
<p>For some reason, SD Cards just wouldn't appear. Sometimes you could pull it out and put it back in and it would appear, other times you might need a reboot. Quite a nuisance, especially when this would happen every time you turned on your Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Valve just <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3687940304703787199?snr=2_9_100015_" target="_blank">released</a> another Steam Deck update that notes they "Fixed a failure to recognize the microSD card after a system reboot.". So if you've been having issues make sure you press the STEAM button -&gt; Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Check For Updates.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1837265021694602933gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1837265021694602933gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Nice to see Valve continue to quickly respond to such annoying issues. Now where's SteamOS 3.5 huh?</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In the wake of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-introduces-new-fees-for-game-devs-based-on-revenue-and-game-installs/" target="_blank">Unity setting everything on fire</a> with their new revenue model for developers, here's a reminder on what other game engines and tech is out there for developers to look into.</p>

      <title>Steam goes green as Valve celebrate 20 years</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While we already marked the anniversary of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/happy-birthday-to-steam-as-it-turned-20-today/" target="_blank">Steam turning 20 in a previous article</a>, Valve has now done their own announcement along with turning a bit green.</p>
<p>Valve has playfully updated the Steam store to match the original colour scheme of Steam when it launched, and it all looks a bit retro. Plus there's a fun <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steam20?snr=1_4_4__118" target="_blank">timeline of events</a>, which goes over various points in Steam's history along with the top games each year.</p>
<p>Almost all Valve games are now on sale too (there's a couple that aren't right now like Half-Life: Alyx - but it may just be a bit delayed). No big announcements so far, but Valve did say on the timeline that Counter-Strike 2 will be launching "soon". On top of that there's some additions to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/points/shop/event/sale_steam20" target="_blank">Points Shop</a> and a quick little thank you video below:</p>

      <title>The open source Godot Engine has a new Godot Development Fund</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The same day that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-introduces-new-fees-for-game-devs-based-on-revenue-and-game-installs/" target="_blank">Unity confused all their developers</a> with a new pay per user install revenue model, the team behind the open source <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/godot-developer-fund/" target="_blank">Godot Engine just announced</a> their new <a href="https://fund.godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Development Fund</a>.</p>
<p>Godot Engine is free, open source and has no revenue sharing because you can pretty much do whatever you want with it. However, they still need to fund developers working on it. So now they're officially properly launching a direct way where anyone can contribute to Godot Engine financially.</p>
<p>According to their website at time of writing they have €25,591 per month coming in from this fund. They do also get £9,587 a month from <a href="https://www.patreon.com/godotengine" target="_blank">Patreon</a> but they're hoping to move over to their direct funding. There's also less fees for their direct funding platform compared to the likes of Patreon, so more of the money will go directly into Godot development.</p>
<p>As stated in their announcement: "By relying more on recurring user-funded contributions and company sponsorships, we reduce our dependence on large one-time grants from corporations. This financial independence empowers us to prioritize the needs and interests of our community and the open source principles at the core of our projects. Your help ensures that we can create our own journey, uphold our core values, and continue to evolve the engine in ways that truly benefit you, the users."</p>

      <title>Western Digital announce the SN770M NVMe for handhelds like the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need a storage upgrade for your Steam Deck, ROG Ally or other handheld? Western Digital are the latest to enter the game with their new WD_BLACK SN770M NVMe SSD.</p>
<p>Available in 512GB, 1TB and 2TB it seems like a great upgrade to get more space. While their actual press release didn't mention the Steam Deck, and focused more on the ROG Ally, their actual <a href="https://www.westerndigital.com/products/internal-drives/wd-black-sn770m-nvme-ssd#WDBDNH5000ABK-WRSN" target="_blank">store page</a> clearly mentions the compatibility with the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>From the press release: "With game sizes continually becoming larger, it's easy for handheld game consoles to fill up over time with new games and regular updates," said Eric Spanneut, vice president of client SSDs for Western Digital. "The new WD_BLACK SN770M NVMe SSD boosts available storage up to 2TB and is specifically designed to handle the peak performance of demanding games for handheld gaming PCs."</p>
<p><span style="background-color:var(--article-main-background); color:var(--font-color); font-size:16px">The drives come with a 5 year limited warranty with the 512GB model available directly through WD and other retailers, the 1TB is only available direct from WD and for now the 2TB model is exclusive to Best Buy. The specs also vary across the models with differing read and write performance.</span></p>
<p>Not just for handheld gaming though, there's a number of other devices out there with a M.2 2230 slot which is becoming steadily more popular for the size of it which really does give us some tiny cards to slot in.</p>
<p>A few other companies have also been stocking a few different M.2 2230 models that I've covered in the past including SCAN UK with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/scan-uk-to-offer-ssd-upgrades-compatible-with-steam-deck/" target="_blank">multiple</a><small>(1)</small> <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/scan-uk-now-selling-a-wd-1tb-ssd-compatible-with-steam-deck/" target="_blank">models</a><small>(2)</small>, and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/framework-begin-offering-2tb-ssd-upgrades-for-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Framework</a>.</p>

      <title>Unity introduces new fees for game devs based on revenue and game installs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Unity Technologies have announced an overhaul to their fees for game developers, which now includes tracking game installs and revenue. <em>Update notes: future updates will be at the bottom of the article.</em></p>
<p>In the <a href="https://blog.unity.com/news/plan-pricing-and-packaging-updates" target="_blank">announcement</a> they call it the Unity Runtime Fee, which is based upon a qualifying game being downloaded by users. They said they chose it because they believe "an initial install-based fee allows creators to keep the ongoing financial gains from player engagement, unlike a revenue share". Given that it's a flat-fee though, this will likely sting game devs who sell games at a lower cost since this fee will be on top of all their other fees (like Steam's 30% cut for example).</p>
<p>What games will be hit? As they explained:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unity Personal </strong> and <strong>Unity Plus: </strong>Those that have made $200,000 USD or more in the last 12 months AND have at least 200,000 lifetime game installs.</li>
<li><strong>Unity Pro</strong> and <strong>Unity Enterprise</strong>: Those that have made $1,000,000 USD or more in the last 12 months AND have at least 1,000,000 lifetime game installs.</li>
</ul>
<p>This plan comes into place on January 1st, 2024 and they gave this breakdown of it:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10657751081694524453gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10657751081694524453gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Note: Unity said it won't be applied retroactively when you hit the cap, the install fee is charged after the threshholds have been met for additional installs. However, it <em>will</em> apply to games already on the market. However, games that do not hit the thresholds or aren't monetised at all will <em>not</em> be required to pay the fees.</p>
<p>This is on top of the Unity subscription developers already pay, although Unity will be removing the annual revenue limit on the Unity Personal plan when this launches. For anyone on Unity Pro though, for example, the above is on top of the subscription cost which is $2,040 per year or $185 a month per-person.</p>
<p>One of the concerns with this is from a privacy standpoint: how exactly will they be tracking this? Since they will be invoicing developers directly based on their install tracking. They don't really make that clear. There's various other problems that Unity need to make clear. As just one example - what about keys for a game in a charity bundle, how are they going to be counted if the game is paid but they're given away? What about if there's a pirated version, how are they tracking legit paid installs? There's probably numerous other examples where it may cause problems.</p>
<p>Another change buried in the FAQ is that people on the Unity Personal plan need internet access to continue to use Unity. If you lose internet, you can only continue using it for 3 days while offline. </p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: since there's been a huge uproar from Unity developers, especially on their official Unity forum, one of their team has <a href="https://forum.unity.com/threads/unity-plan-pricing-and-packaging-updates.1482750/page-2#post-9289318" target="_blank">clarified</a> some details about the monthly rate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ya, sorry, I get how this wording is confusing. So, let's say you have your 1,000,001th install, officially pushing you over the cap. You will have a fee of 15 cents. You will not pay that 15cents every month. Just a single time. The monthly thing is to indicate a monthly assessment to see where your installs are and revenue is to see if you had more installs or dropped below the cap. Does that help?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In another post, they also <a href="https://forum.unity.com/threads/unity-plan-pricing-and-packaging-updates.1482750/page-9#post-9290938" target="_blank">clarified</a> it's "Per game / project".</p>
<p><strong>Update #2</strong>: On social network X, Unity put up this <a href="https://twitter.com/unity/status/1701650081403842851" target="_blank">statement</a> I've copied below in case you can't access X:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today we announced a change to our business model which includes new additions to our subscription plans, and the introduction of a Runtime fee. We wanted to provide clarifying answers to the top questions most of you are asking.</p>
<p>Yes, this is a price increase and it will only affect a small subset of current Unity Editor users.</p>
<p>Today, a large majority of Unity Editor users are currently not paying anything and will not be affected by this change. The Unity Runtime fee will not impact the majority of our developers.</p>
<p>The developers who will be impacted are generally those who have successful games and are generating revenue way above the thresholds we outlined in our blog. This means that developers who are still building their business and growing the audience of their games will not pay a fee. The program was designed specifically this way to ensure developers could find success before the install fee takes effect.</p>
<p>We want to be clear that the counter for Unity Runtime fee installs starts on January 1, 2024 - it is not retroactive or perpetual. We will charge once for a new install; not an ongoing perpetual license royalty, like revenue share.</p>
<p>We looked for ways to lessen the impact on developers, and provide ways to bring the Runtime fee to zero. If you’re using any of our ad products, Unity Gaming Services or cloud services, etc. please contact us to discuss discounts.</p>
<p>We are actively listening to and following your questions closely. Please review our FAQ (<a href="https://on.unity.com/3PAiqHH" target="_blank">https://on.unity.com/3PAiqHH</a>) on today’s announcement. We also invite you to continue to discuss these changes with us on our forums: <a href="https://on.unity.com/3RmyLRx" target="_blank">https://on.unity.com/3RmyLRx</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Update #3 13/09/2023</strong>: Unity have now compiled a list of common questions and answers in their <a href="https://forum.unity.com/threads/unity-plan-pricing-and-packaging-updates.1482750/" target="_blank">official forum post</a>, which doesn't seem to have made things any better. In fact, it only confirmed some of the worst fears from developers. Like this for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: If a user reinstalls/redownloads a game / changes their hardware, will that count as multiple installs?<br/>
A: Yes. The creator will need to pay for all future installs. The reason is that Unity doesn’t receive end-player information, just aggregate data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, at the current time with their plan, developers need to pay each time you uninstall and re-install. And each time you install on a different device. As they briefly explained there, they have no way to tell the actual difference on reinstalls since it's just aggregate data.</p>
<p>Then there's this too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: If a game that's made enough money to be over the threshold has a demo of the same game, do installs of the demo also induce a charge?<br/>
A: If it's early access, Beta, or a demo of the full game then yes. If you can get from the demo to a full game then yes. If it's not, like a single level that can't upgrade then no.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What this means is that if developers have a demo for their game, and this game is over both the install and revenue threshold, if the demo progress carries over into the full game the demo itself is classed as another install that will cost developers money (even if the demo player doesn't buy the game).</p>
<p>As for how Unity are tracking installs, especially for things like pirated installs and people having a grudge against a developer to spin up lots of reinstalls (it will happen…), Unity basically tell you to trust their black-box proprietary tech on that (from their FAQ):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We do already have fraud detection practices in our Ads technology which is solving a similar problem, so we will leverage that know-how as a starting point. We recognize that users will have concerns about this and we will make available a process for them to submit their concerns to our fraud compliance team.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also from their <a href="https://twitter.com/unity/status/1701689241456021607" target="_blank">replies</a> on X:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We leverage our own proprietary data model, so you can appreciate that we won’t go into a lot of detail, but we believe it gives an accurate determination of the number of times the runtime is distributed for a given project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>So it's just a "trust me bro" situation here for developers.</em></p>
<p>A lot of developers are absolutely furious at Unity. Not just because it has been communicated so badly, and because even just based on that one answer above the cost to developers will be ridiculous, but because Unity just pulled the rug from under developers with entirely new terms even for existing games. Even if they reverse course, it shows that Unity are willing to change anything at any time which is incredibly risky for developers embarking on multi-year game development. <a href="https://twitter.com/tha_rami/status/1701864575031775516" target="_blank">This thread</a> on X from respected developer Rami Ismail highlights things quite well.</p>

      <title>Happy Birthday to Steam as it turned 20 today</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Where has all that time gone? It's pretty hard to believe that it was 20 years ago that Steam arrived, and with it that glorious green interface.</p>
<p>They weren't even close to being the first digital store to provide games, but requiring Steam to run Half-Life 2 regardless of digital purchase or a boxed copy was likely the defining moment that helped push it to success for Valve. This was likely my own introduction to Steam as well, back in the day where my PC could only <em>just</em> about run Half-Life 2 when you had long loading screens between sections. How time flies huh?</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10139832541694519337gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10139832541694519337gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured - Steam homepage back in 2004 after Half-Life 2 released</em></p>
<p>Valve has a long colourful history of expanding Steam from a basic launcher to a full store and later adding in the Steam Workshop, Early Access, Greenlight, Steam Direct, User Reviews, Virtual Reality, Steam Machines, Steam Deck, Remote Play, Points Shop, Movies and TV, Soundtracks and the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>Not everything Valve has tried went well like the original Steam Machines, and killing off their ambitions for non-gaming video content but they keep on trying and expanding and it seems there's really no stopping it. It grows every year with Valve's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/steam-had-83000-new-customers-every-day-in-2022/" target="_blank">2022 overview</a> noting they had seen 83,000 new first-time purchasers every day of the year.</p>
<p>Naturally, without Steam and Valve, Linux gaming wouldn't be where it is today so we're doubly thankful for its existence. Just look at how <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/5-years-ago-valve-released-proton-forever-changing-linux-gaming/" target="_blank">Valve's Proton has changed things</a> in the last 5 years.</p>
<p>Whatever will they announce next — more <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/more-teasers-appear-for-upcoming-valve-hardware/" target="_blank">new hardware perhaps</a>?</p>
