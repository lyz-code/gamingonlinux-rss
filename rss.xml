      <title>Grab the Steam Deck LCD 256GB for cheap as Valve gave it a discount</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve just put the Steam Deck LCD 256GB on sale, so you can get ready for the upcoming Steam Autumn Sale ahead of time with some new hardware.</p>
<p>While the Steam Autumn Sale doesn't start until September 29th, right now you can go ahead and grab the Steam Deck LCD 256GB model with 20% off. This discount on the Steam Deck will run from now all the way through the Steam Autumn Sale until October 6th. So there's no hurry, but stocks also do tend to fly whenever Valve put the Steam Deck on a discount.</p>
<p>That makes it only £279.20 / $319.20, which is an absolutely <em>ridiculous</em> bargain for what you actually get. And with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/steam-deck-and-steamos-hit-20000-playable-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">over 20,000 games playable on it</a>, you're sure to find plenty to love about it. Just be sure to also keep an eye on our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat compatibility page</a>, and our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">growing list of tips and guides</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14918610701758561983gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Head over to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the Steam store</a> to buy one.</p>
<p>Now if you'll excuse me, I'm actually going right back to playing on my Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Megabonk is Risk of Rain 2 fused with Vampire Survivors and it&#39;s glorious</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>An unholy fusion of Risk of Rain 2 with Vampire Survivors is what you'll find with Megabonk and it absolutely freaking rocks. Seriously, this is some glorious and delicious stuff that you don't want to miss out on. <em>Note: personal purchase.</em></p>
<p>You pick a character and then jump into a randomly generated map. Run around with auto-firing weapons, pick up experience gems and pick a random level up boost to keep powering up your character. You know the drill by now. However, with it being in 3D, it adds some fun flavour to it. Not just because you can run, jump and slide about - but the characters are just plain silly too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="9h5eUbIXg-M"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8869d3e5c19874736caf348785646dc9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/9h5eUbIXg-M" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For the Risk of Rain 2 spice, there's various chests spread around you can buy to open to pull out special relics as well. The general setup of it just really feels like RoR2 blended with Vampire Survivors and anyone who has played both will be quite familiar. Run around as long as you can, fight bosses and just keep on going.</p>
<p>It really leans into the comedy too, not just on the silly descriptions and items, but the fact that I can slide all the way down a hill on a sword while all my abilities fire off — it's so satisfying and dumb you can't help but love it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21293113681758548951gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21293113681758548951gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>A lot of developers have tried to replicate the success of Vampire Survivors, and only a few have managed to actually carve out their own place in a now very crowded genre. Megabonk thankfully feels fresh enough that I'm willing to spend hours of my personal time playing it. Being in full 3D really gives them more leverage, like how one unlock you can get is to add more jumps and so eventually you'll be leaping across the map over enemies and obstacles high up in the sky. It's so fun to find all the weird combinations you can add together.</p>
<p>The maps are littered with some funny characters to find and interact with, and in some cases rescue. There's a shady guy to buy upgrades from, a microwave that will magically clone a relic you've acquired and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6011147861758550806gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6011147861758550806gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Currently it has 240 in-game quests, 20 characters with unique abilities, over 70 items all with their own different synergies and more to discover.</p>
<p>Out now with Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified. Megabonk is just pure stupid joy to play. The Linux version has been running very nicely too.</p>
<p>It's going to take over my life. I fully expect it to be a huge success, and I hope so because I want to see this have a long life with lots of additions. What's there is fantastic but I want more, lots and lots more from it. Early indicators are it doing well, with an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam and it hit over 21,068 people playing recently.</p>

      <title>Need more metroidvania action? Stardust Demon is an overlooked gem</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Finished Hollow Knight: Silksong? Didn't find it punishing enough? You should really take a look at Stardust Demon. An overlooked gem with some pretty rad looking design, and a game that just keeps on expanding as you go through it. I was quite shocked to see it only had 67 user reviews on Steam.</p>
<p>What is it: Stardust Demon is a Cave Story-inspired metroidvania with an emphasis on its world's story and cute characters, and challenges that ramp up in difficulty including precision platforming elements. The aesthetic of the game uniquely combines colourful pixel-art with retro FMV cutscenes. Its eclectic soundtrack melds chip-tune, electronica, and metal influences together. </p>
<p>It originally released back in October 2024, and last month they added a major upgrade including a new Boss Rush game mode. </p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="23a9R62-YLU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a03b16ca576ba41ea2e5ae5f517bb7a6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/23a9R62-YLU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It has Native Linux support, and on Steam Deck it's rated Playable (need you to manually change resolution). If you can handle the difficulty, if you love a proper challenge - it's one not to be missed.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Mixture of platforming, action, and puzzle gameplay.</li>
<li>Exploring multiple planets.</li>
<li>Weird and wonderful NPC's, rich and vibrant worlds.</li>
<li>Shops and optional quests.</li>
<li>Cutscenes with charming sprite animations.</li>
<li>Puzzles with varied mechanics including teleporting, reversing time for specific platforms, and more.</li>
<li>Many secrets and upgrades to be found.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Scribbly adventure Scrabdackle looks fantastic with a new trailer and demo upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Scrabdackle is an action adventure I've been excited about for years, and now it has a proper fresh trailer along with a big demo upgrade.</p>
<p>What is it: Scrabdackle is a sprawling, scribbly adventure that blends exploration, challenge, with genuine joy. Players take on the role of novice wizard Blue, flung from the safety of the academy into a vast, hand-animated world full of secrets, tough-but-fair bosses, curious creatures, and a journey home that's anything but straightforward.</p>
<p>During the  Six One Indie Showcase it had a new trailer show up:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QzBF0ZH8qqg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cce0c79581b8080e6d92f306b2896fcf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QzBF0ZH8qqg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Act I will arrive sometime later this year with it in Early Access. Until then, you can try the demo which was refreshed with all these changes listed in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1578720/view/499458897750261919" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>More readable fonts (larger sizes, better character differentiation),</li>
<li>A new "taskroll" quest menu replacing the one that, uh, no one knew was there or how to use (it was kind of hidden in the minimap),</li>
<li>Completion/collectible tracking per-region (via the taskroll),</li>
<li>Notifications for when quests are started and completed, and better tagging for when a quest will continue in the full game,</li>
<li>A huge performance/optimization pass that should be pretty clear to see the gains of for anyone who played the previous build,</li>
<li>Speaker tags indicating the name of who's speaking, and a conversation log in the pause menu,</li>
<li>Controller support (finally! - although, I do want to tune it more as feedback comes in),</li>
<li>A pretty substantial batch of misc QOL features,</li>
<li>Aaand a general fresh coat of polish on like, everything.</li>
</ul>

      <title>The story-driven Roguelike RPG &#39;Blanksword&#39; looks absolutely rad with a wild setting</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sometimes I come across a game that really just immediately jumps out at me as something that could be special, and Blanksword is one of those times. I'm getting some vibes from Undertale, DELTARUNE for this, just a little anyway.</p>
<p>What is it: Blanksword is a Roguelike RPG with strategic turn-based battles, a rich layered story, and a one of a kind brain management system. Enter a land full of dangers as BLANK, an amnesiac wandering Angel, and come to the aid of those that were wronged by God’s cruel law.</p>
<p>The setting of it is what really pulled me in, as it really does sound unique and interesting. Be sure to check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UmOtTNW1mAo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c17cdf61c7b6e5182dd1169ff82ff7a1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UmOtTNW1mAo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's currently crowdfunding on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/283910083/blanksword/description" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, with the developer hoping to raise €48,000 by October 17th. There's also a demo on Steam. Officially, they'll be supporting Windows so you can run it with Proton but they did say "ideally" they want to launch it for other platforms like Linux and macOS officially too.</p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Experiment with 15+ Brain Parts with game-changing properties.</li>
<li>Explore various regions such as a mushroom forest, a sprawling radio tower or moldy apartments.</li>
<li>Fight against a large panel of enemies, each with unique attacks and behaviors.</li>
<li>Customize your loadout each run with 150+ attacks &amp; skills that can fit into any playstyle.</li>
<li>Get to know a rich cast of well-fleshed out characters.</li>
<li>Beat challenges ranging from precise platforming to fight arenas and races against the clock.</li>
<li>Strengthen yourself between runs with permanent upgrades.</li>
<li>Line your pockets as you complete tasks… but not too much: in Blanksword, money is a curse!</li>
</ul>

<p>With all the different Proton versions it can get confusing so see <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the GamingOnLinux explainer on the different Proton versions</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-ge-proton-on-steam-deck-steamos-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the GamingOnLinux guide to install GE-Proton</a> to get started with it. Usually, you don't need GE-Proton unless it has some specific fix not available in Valve's official Proton.</p>

      <title>Baby Steps is Steam Deck Verified - I&#39;m ready to fall over everywhere</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a delay due to Hollow Knight: Silksong, the hilarious looking physics walking sim Baby Steps is Steam Deck Verified for the new September 23rd launch.</p>
<p>This really does look like an absolute gem and I can't wait. I actually adored the challenge of the travel system in Death Stranding with you falling over plenty - and this looks like it turns things up quite a lot. The whole idea and setting of the game just looks completely absurd, to the point that one of the videos publisher Devolver Digital put up recently is how the game has a…breast milk slide — yes, that's a thing.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SroBK1KwpEI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ad2af61eb03ac92d15647e2c254f40e4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SroBK1KwpEI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Every bit of footage of this game makes me confused, in the best possible way. It really does seem hilarious. The highlights of it make me laugh too, like how it has a "Fully dynamic onesie soilage system", just how dirty can one man on a walk get?</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about it (from Steam):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Play as Nate, an unemployed failson with nothing going for him, until one day he discovers a power he never knew he had… putting one foot in front of the other.</p>
<p>Explore a world shrouded in mist, one step at a time. Hike the serene mountains by placing each footstep yourself, in original physics-based gameplay from the minds behind Ape Out and Getting Over It. Take in the sights, fall in love with the local fauna, and try to find meaning in a wasted life.</p>
<p>Get ready to fall for Nate, in Baby Steps, a literal walking simulator.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Need to know more? Well, here's 10 minutes of falling in Baby Steps:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fully-simulated physics based walking.</li>
<li>A world that seems to come alive with a dynamic soundtrack built up out of four hundred and twenty beats and vibes.</li>
<li>A lengthy trek up a mountain-sized mountain that you can explore at your own pace, or slower.</li>
<li>Fully dynamic onesie soilage system.</li>
<li>Non-collectible hats.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Exciting train combat deckbuilder roguelite Fogpiercer gets a new trailer and publisher</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fogpiercer was a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/build-a-train-to-expand-your-deck-and-fight-off-bandits-in-the-demo-for-fogpiercer/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">highlight here on GamingOnLinux back in April</a>, and now it's coming back stronger with a brand new trailer and they've found a publisher.</p>
<p>What is it? A deckbuilder roguelite in which you build and upgrade your train to build your deck, fight off bandits on a square grid using unique carriage cards. Combat here is all about positioning, with you able to trick enemies into hitting each other or smashing them off the grid. It's releasing sometime in 2026 with Linux support and a demo is still available right now.</p>
<p>On Steam they just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3219010/view/515221496441865362" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> that Hooded Horse who published Manor Lords, Norland, Old World and more have become their partner on it. From the announcement the developer said: "This is a huge pickup for us, and we’re really looking forward to having Hooded Horse’s support as we make Fogpiercer the best game it can be. With their resources, we’ll be able to localize the game into more languages, reach a wider audience, have additional QA support, and spend more time actually developing the game!"</p>
<p>Check out the shiny new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OuEIQH6AsCU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/83907b4cae05e53313f5a1f7f67dc41b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OuEIQH6AsCU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“Fogpiercer has a great setting and innovative train-based gameplay, we think fans of roguelike deckbuilders are going to love this one,” says Hooded Horse CEO Tim Bender. “We're honored to be serving as their publisher."</p>

      <title>The golden age of real-time strategy returns? Dying Breed releases October 7</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Made in the spirit of Westwood classics like Command &amp; Conquer and Red Alert, Dying Breed really does look awesome and it's releasing October 7th. Developed by Sarnayer with publishing from MicroProse Software, it looks incredibly promising.</p>
<p>I definitely miss the days of playing through games like this for hours and hours, and it really does look the part. Base building? Check! Resource gathering? Check! FMV cut-scenes? Heck yeah gimme that! Super weapons? Looks like it ticks that box and all.

      <title>Please make it stop - Google Chrome to be reimagined with AI</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A break from the usual gaming news to moan about Google for a moment, thanks to their new blog post we have a glimpse of the future of Chrome and it's AI AI AI.</p>
<p>Google say they're about to take a step that will result in "fundamentally changing the nature of browsing" to move from a "passive experience to a more proactive and intelligent one". With that they've announced some major changes will be coming to Chrome.</p>
<p>The first is Gemini, their AI assistant, it's going to be your new "browsing assistant" that will "answer questions about articles, find references within YouTube videos, and will soon be able to help you find pages you’ve visited so you can pick up exactly where you left off" and it will integrate with other Google services.</p>
<p>On top of that they're planning to make "more advanced agentic capabilities for Gemini in Chrome that can perform multi-step tasks for you from start to finish". Difficult things like "booking a haircut" or "ordering your weekly groceries" will be a thing of the past Google hope, as they'll get their AI to do it for you.</p>
<p>Another change will be to the address bar, their "omnibox", as it's going to get "even smarter" with their new AI Mode.</p>
<p>Although, they only mention Windows and macOS for this in the post, no doubt it would come to Linux <em>eventually</em>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WjOvZ8n9MK0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/78bf9c01dd8c77f3d711743cf56d50e8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WjOvZ8n9MK0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More info across their <a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/chrome-reimagined-with-ai/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> and another <a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/new-ai-features-for-chrome/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> on some of the features.</p>
<p>So soon, you'll be told to add glue to pizza right in the address bar in Google Chrome! <em>Because we all know how factually accurate these AI tools are of course, they never ever make things up. </em>And with their AI Mode right in the browser, the idea of course like with AI Mode on Google Search, is to get you to never click away from anything Google. They want you to stay in their products longer, to generate more data and more revenue from you.</p>
<p>Firefox has also started adding in more AI features too, because apparently that's what everyone will be getting whether you like it or not. You simply must become part of the AI machine.</p>
<p>At no point in my entire browsing history have I ever thought - you know what would make this better? AI!</p>
<p>I think it's time I gave Vivaldi another chance, with <a href="https://vivaldi.com/blog/keep-exploring/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">their commitment</a> to keeping things human.</p>

      <title>Frostpunk 2 gets full controller support and should work better on Steam Deck / SteamOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>11 bit studios have published a major upgrade for Frostpunk 2, adding in full proper controller support with an adjusted UI to match. This should hopefully make it a lot better on Steam Deck and other SteamOS devices, and anyone doing some couch gaming.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/11-bit-studios-working-on-getting-frostpunk-2-up-to-steam-deck-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Back in March</a>, 11 bit studios did confirm they wanted to work towards getting it Steam Deck Verified and this seems to be a solid step on that front. It not only gives you a controller styled UI, but they've also added in a new circular menu system that they reimagined from Frostpunk: Console Edition.</p>
<p>Example shots from the developer: </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3603297501758270213gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3603297501758270213gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13493696321758270211gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13493696321758270211gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>All the changes are below:</p>
<blockquote><strong>Interface</strong>
<ul>
<li>Implemented full controller support, featuring supporting UI .</li>
<li>Hospitals now display positive district notification when they heal people instead of the side notification.</li>
<li>The number of homeless people is now displayed in the Main District and in the Heatmap overlay.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Gameplay</strong>
<ul>
<li>Homeless people now also get sick in addition to dying.</li>
<li>Reduced and delayed the number of deaths among the homeless.</li>
<li>Warm districts cure people directly instead of impacting disease statistics.</li>
<li>Progress generator upgrades now unlock additional levels of heating in districts.</li>
<li>Added a new research for increasing the capacity of Stockpile hubs.</li>
<li>Fixed game freezes on automatic heat allocation.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Prologue</strong>
<ul>
<li>Rebalanced the number and rate of people getting sick from cold districts .</li>
<li>Reduced the amount of heat needed to heat districts.</li>
<li>Reduced the maximum number of heat allocation levels from 5 to 3.</li>
<li>Increased the Food in food deposits by 20%.</li>
<li>Slightly reduced the Scraps generation rate.</li>
<li>Increased Frostbreaking tile cost from 37 to 40.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Art</strong>
<ul>
<li>District panel illustrations now have parallax animations.</li>
<li>Other minor updates to 2D artwork.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Other</strong>
<ul>
<li>Various community reported bug fixes.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition is Steam Deck Verified ahead of release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition from Survios releases on September 30th and ahead of release Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified / SteamOS Compatible.</p>
<p>This was originally a VR-only game simple called Alien: Rogue Incursion, which is now titled Alien: Rogue Incursion VR. that was released in December 2024. Now it's being remade for flat-screens so that everyone can get in on the action, even if you're on a handheld. A great time for it to release, with Alien: Earth seeing the last episode release next week (which has been a great show in my opinion).</p>
<p>Check out the launch trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="TF79l6It5fo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c6b6a7ed333d2b6e2621988cc0752e32.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/TF79l6It5fo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Made for <em>Alien </em>fans. Built for action-horror. Re-envisioned for PC.</p>
<p>Play as rogue Colonial Marine Zula Hendricks in the terrifying first chapter of a two-part saga set between the <em>Alien </em>and <em>Aliens </em>films. Sent to investigate a distress call on the remote planet Purdan, Zula uncovers a secret Weyland-Yutani blacksite overrun by deadly Xenomorphs.</p>
<p>Stalking, hunting, and attacking at every turn, these Xenomorphs' ferocity is matched only by their unpredictability. Aided by your synth companion, Davis 01, fight and survive using your weapons, skills, and sheer determination against a deadly Xenomorph incursion in this gripping original story.</p>
<p>Rebuilt for PC with stunning visuals, 60 fps, 3D audio, haptic feedback, and adaptive triggers, <em>Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition</em> delivers a cinematic action experience that makes you truly feel like you’re inside the world of <em>Alien</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I should note, that this is only Part 1 and ends on a cliffhanger. Back when the VR version released, they failed pretty badly on the marketing and had to release a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1850050/view/520826430987174742" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a> as it being only the first part was a surprise. Their prior communication on it was pretty poor. If you know it's an episodic game, it should have always been advertised as such. Anyway, hopefully the main PC release goes well so they do actually finish the next part - I would love a new proper Alien game.</p>

      <title>Digimon Story Time Stranger is Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Digimon Story Time Stranger was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/digimon-story-time-stranger-rated-steam-deck-playable-steamos-compatible-ahead-of-release/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously rated Steam Deck Playable</a> but ahead of release this has been improved and it's now Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Valve put it back through testing, and it appears the developer has solved the issue of it sometimes showing the wrong keybinds which was the only thing they noted as preventing it being Verified. Great news, as this one is sure to be a popular choice.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8998986391758268519gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8998986391758268519gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The compatibility notice still mentions it needs an internet connection for the first-time setup, plus it also has Denuvo Anti-Tamper listed on the Steam page.</p>

      <title>Stop Killing Games update - UK petition to see a debate in Parliament</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A short update for you on the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Stop Killing Games</a> movement - a UK petition is actually going to Parliament for a real debate.</p>
<p>The UK Department for Culture, Media and Sport did actually reply to the petition <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/uk-gov-responds-to-the-newer-stop-killing-games-petition-no-plans-to-amend-uk-consumer-law/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in February 2025</a>, although the response was pretty much what was expected on these sorts of things giving a very wordy answer that basically boiled down to "nothing will change".</p>
<p>However, the petition did cross over the 100,000 threshold (189,888 total) to be <em>considered</em> for a debate in Parliament. Petitions that cross over this number are never <em>guaranteed</em> to see a debate, as they still have to actually be <em>selected</em>. Seems this has been popular enough that it now has been, and a date has been set for November 3rd, 2025 which will be shown on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/UKParliament" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">UK Parliament YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>Not surprising though, considering the massive push for it in the EU that saw about <a href="https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2024/000007_en#" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">1,448,270 signatures</a> of support, with the UK still pretty close with the EU some lawmakers have no doubt taken notice of what's going on there.</p>
<p>I'm hoping we'll see a proper adult debate on this, but I know how the UK goes with this sort of thing - but it's progress at least. Let's wait and see what happens. I'm not expecting any big surprises or sweeping changes, but at least the ball is rolling on it.</p>
<p>Really, a lot of this could be sorted by major publishers releasing server files to the community when they move on from games. Just look at <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/the-crew-from-ubisoft-gets-revived-thanks-to-the-the-crew-unlimited-project/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Crew Unlimited community project</a> to show how it <em>can</em> be done.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA are investing $5 billion in Intel to develop new chips together</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A huge announcement for the entire computing industry came today, with NVIDIA and Intel teaming up to make new chips for data centre and consumers too. This is of course, largely about AI, and they want to ensure they stay ahead of AMD and Arm chip makers.</p>
<p>NVIDIA have been wanting to do some proper CPUs for a while, so it's no surprise that with this deal Intel will then be building custom CPUs for NVIDIA to use in data centres. But for personal computing, us normies, Intel plan to build " x86 system-on-chips (SOCs) that integrate NVIDIA RTX GPU chiplets".</p>
<p>That will be <em>very</em> interesting to see on the desktop, laptop and handheld gaming side. Can you imagine a future Steam Deck 3 that has an Intel CPU with NVIDIA RTX? Sure would be an interesting way for both Intel and NVIDIA to suck up some more of the market from AMD.</p>
<p>Their statements from the press releases:</p>
<p>“AI is powering a new industrial revolution and reinventing every layer of the computing stack — from silicon to systems to software. At the heart of this reinvention is NVIDIA’s CUDA architecture,” said NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang. “This historic collaboration tightly couples NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing stack with Intel’s CPUs and the vast x86 ecosystem — a fusion of two world-class platforms. Together, we will expand our ecosystems and lay the foundation for the next era of computing.”</p>
<p>“Intel’s x86 architecture has been foundational to modern computing for decades — and we are innovating across our portfolio to enable the workloads of the future,” said Lip-Bu Tan, CEO of Intel. “Intel’s leading data center and client computing platforms, combined with our process technology, manufacturing and advanced packaging capabilities, will complement NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing leadership to enable new breakthroughs for the industry. We appreciate the confidence Jensen and the NVIDIA team have placed in us with their investment and look forward to the work ahead as we innovate for customers and grow our business.”</p>

<p>I should note, the deal is not complete yet. They need to go through regulator approval first as usual for such a big deal.</p>

      <title>Modding-friendly arcade racer Formula Legends is out now - works well on Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you have the need for speed but don't want to play one of the various full simulators, perhaps Formula Legends might be just the ticket you need. <em>You <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">can't even play the latest F1 games on Linux</a> systems anyway.</em></p>
<p>With bright colourful and inviting visuals, this is a game designed for racing fans who find the serious sims just a bit <em>too</em> demanding. Formula Legends is a bit of a weird one though that sits somewhere between an arcade racer and a light simulator, because without any assists on it does feel a bit more like a proper sim but with controls and an overall feel that are a bit more like an arcade game - and when you turn on assists it's very much an arcade racer so you could call it a "sim-cade" racer.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3_7zXatQjBA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d21ff87af2cc5add6603e8f7a7c431a6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3_7zXatQjBA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For the content and gameplay, I don't have a whole lot special to say about it. There's only 3 different game modes split across story mode, time attack and a custom mode where you can set things up how you like. All pretty standard stuff there for such a racer. The vehicles and tracks are only inspired by the real world too, as they don't have the licensing. So with the story mode (which doesn't exactly have any story) you just run through AI races using vehicles inspired by various eras.</p>
<p>Even with the more approachable nature of it, there's still a fair bit you need to keep an eye on when you're burning rubber. It has tyre wear, tyre grip, fuel consumption, damage simulation and weather conditions - all to keep you on your toes. There's even a tiny mini-game when you go into the pit to press a few buttons to get repaired and refuelled. </p>
<p>I really like that they're leaning into the modding community too. While other bigger racers stick in anti-cheat and try to protect their precious micro-transactions and such, this is a single-player modders delight (if a community builds up around to to make some that is). Although, modding support will come "soon" after launch.</p>
<p>On Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 25.04) with Proton 9.0-4 it has been working perfectly, my PC hasn't broken a sweat with all the settings cranked up to max. Not overly surprising though, it's not exactly graphically demanding.</p>
<p>For Steam Deck gamers, even with the details all on "Very High" it will stick to nearly 60FPS. Just turn them down one notch to High and you should be absolutely fine on performance.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13273461791758207802gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13273461791758207802gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Formula Legends on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>Don't go in expecting <em>any</em> multi-player features at all though, this is firmly designed as a single-player experience. And, honestly, that works against it. The AI drivers are…quite often complete morons. Completely bunching up, smashing into each other in groups around some corners and so on. If you're going to make a pure single-player racer, the AI needs to be better than this.</p>
<p>Aside from the racer stupidity, the actual racing is a real blast. The vehicles sound great, and mostly control great apart from some strange quirks at times with the handling. Soaring past opponents, and then attempting to stay on the track as I'm going way too fast for the corner. It's a challenge that still surprised me given the inviting nature of the game.</p>
<p>From the developer: </p>
<p>"We’ve all poured our hearts and souls into Formula Legends’ development," said Francesco Bruschi, CEO of 3DClouds. "We have been blown away by the positive response to the game from media, content creators and players, with launch being just the next step for us."</p>
<p>"We’ve designed Formula Legends to be fully mod-able - from the smallest in-game livery logo to entire car models and more," Bruschi added. "The PC version of Formula Legends can be easily decompiled and recompiled allowing the community to mod, tweak and create whatever they want and share their efforts with others. We can’t wait to see what they create!"</p>
<p>They have some big post-release plans too including:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Just a few days after launch</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Free update With Minor Fix and Custom Configurations (MOD) available.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>October</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Free update including <strong>bug fixes</strong>, various improvements, and new features such as the <strong>Custom Camera (Cockpit)</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>November</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Double free update with new features currently in development, including <strong>wheel support</strong> and <strong>manual gearbox</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>December</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Release of the first seasonal <strong>“Early ‘10” DLC</strong>, featuring:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>New teams and drivers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 new vehicle models</p>
</li>
<li>A new chapter of the <strong>Story Mode</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Overall it's a fun time if you're in the market for a new racer that's hard to pin down where it belongs. Just keep in mind it's single-player only and the AI racers do need some tweaks to not be so stupid.</p>
<p>You're not going to be making your wallet cry with this one either at £19.99 / $19.99 / €19.99.</p>

      <title>Alabaster Dawn from the devs of CrossCode has a demo out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Radical Fish Games known for the awesome CrossCode have just put a demo for their next action-RPG with Alabaster Dawn now available to test.</p>
<p>Quite a unique demo because it's split across two parts. The first is the beginning of the game, and your save will carry on to the full game. The second part as an extra skips ahead to showcase a number of other game features along with a part of a dungeon. They say it should give 1.5 - 2.5 hours of play time.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hL1zcGLwxG4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5541f54a40afc97f71fc9570c2ab9d1d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hL1zcGLwxG4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Alabaster Dawn</strong> is an Action RPG building on top of the best aspects of Radical Fish Games' previous title <strong>CrossCode</strong>, featuring a deep and engaging combat system, challenging puzzles and an epic story set in a curious world full of secrets to discover and places to explore.<br/>
<br/>
The shadow of Nyx has fallen, warping the world into a wasteland and vanishing the gods and their people. Now, Juno, the Outcast Chosen, awakens to an impossible task: <em>bring it all back.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>A (planned) 30-60 hours of playtime await you in this massive adventure, with 7 unique areas and many secrets to uncover. Rebuild settlements, establish trade routes and advance science by helping people. Each new advancement will be accompanied by the settlements changing visually, opening up new paths and opportunities!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The full game will have Native Linux support and the new demo does too. No release date set for the full game yet. Looks thoroughly to be worth a go though.</p>

      <title>Dying Light: The Beast rated Steam Deck Verified ahead of release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A few hours before Dying Light: The Beast releases today, Valve put up a green tick for it to be Steam Deck Verified and SteamOS Compatible. There's no special notices about external gamepads or any online requirements, so hopefully that will make it easy to take it on the go and to dock to a TV too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9524350551758202649gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>It's going to be a big release, with over a million pre-orders so this is exciting to see. However, performance is always a concern when it comes to bigger games like this. The Steam Deck Verified badge doesn't <em>always</em> mean the performance is actually where you would expect it to be, Valve are a bit inconsistent on the rating when it comes to overall performance. Mostly correct, but there's been a few definite odd cases that shouldn't be Verified.</p>
<p>The developers seem happy with it, since they <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3008130/view/787688820859471060" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> the rating too. In their announcement Techland said: "Want to UNLEASH THE BEAST wherever, whenever? Well, you can because Dying Light: The Beast is Steam Deck Verified and fully optimized for smooth gameplay!".</p>
<p><em>I'm even more curious about it now.</em></p>
<p>Need a catch up? Techland released a new "The Story So Far" trailer you can view below:</p>

<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>

      <author>fheroes2</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

<p>Today we’re excited to present a new version of the fheroes2 engine - <a href="https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2/releases/tag/1.1.11" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>1.1.11</strong></a> This release includes several major changes and many smaller but important updates.</p>
<p>First of all, map makers can now set any <strong>spells in Mage Guilds</strong> within Towns and Castles. This allows precise control of available spells and enables truly unique maps.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20861121981758197486gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20861121981758197486gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Additionally, map makers can ban specific spells in Mage Guilds so that they never appear, offering new ways of balancing the gameplay.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12078434231758197502gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12078434231758197502gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Secondly, map makers can select which monsters will appear in the <strong>Random Monster</strong> objects. Previously these objects generated completely random creatures, but now you can narrow down the selection - for example, to shooters only. This provides more control without reducing map replayability.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10879279871758197517gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10879279871758197517gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>During battles, the battle queue now highlights monsters with an <strong>outline</strong> when you hover the mouse over them, showing the order of their turns. It’s a small but helpful improvement when you're unsure of the turn order.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12633379191758197535gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12633379191758197535gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Among other UI changes, the team added <strong>icons</strong> for the Monster of the Week and Monster of the Month event dialogs, and the monster <strong>upgrade cost</strong> is now shown in the upgrade dialog.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10234898391758197558gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10234898391758197558gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21228635401758197559gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/21228635401758197559gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>In total, over 40 issues have been fixed since the last release.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy this upgraded version of the engine, and we thank you for your continued support of the project!</p>

As a roguelike there's also an upgrades and unlocks system where you can buy new items in a shop.</p>
<p>It also has Native Linux support built with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot</a>. Check out the trailer:</p>

      <title>Excellent theme park builder Parkitect gets a surprise Dinos &amp; Dynasties DLC out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Texel Raptor just surprise launched a brand new DLC for the theme park building game Parkitect, adding in two new content themes. I have a real soft spot for Parkitect, a really great mixture of a building sim with casual business management and years later it still looks great. This sounds like an excellent excuse to go and jump back in.</p>
<p>This DLC adds in "two new themes, full of exotic and classical decorative objects to expand your park into new areas, along with some exciting new attractions". This includes dino-inspired objects to decorate your parks and a classical theme full of Roman and Greek themed decorations. There's also a free update that added in a new cheat window with sandbox tools enabling things like adding cash, changing the weather and more.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<p>The developer is currently working on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2261380/Croakwood/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Croakwood</a> which they say is a creative, relaxed town building simulation game about frogs and nature. No word on when it might release yet.</p>

      <title>GOG did a little upgrade to their user reviews system</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">DRM-free store GOG</a> have recently launched a bit of a refresh of their user reviews system, to make it a little bit more modern and useful. V<em>alve also recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/valve-announce-language-specific-user-review-scores-for-steam-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">upgraded the reviews system on Steam</a> too.</em></p>
<p>GOG said it themselves that their review system "hasn’t been ideal" and they're aware of how important reviews are, so they decided to do a little something about it.</p>
<p>Here's what's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Edit or delete your reviews anytime</strong> (with timestamps to keep changes transparent).</li>
<li><strong>Better summaries</strong> with rating breakdowns at a glance.</li>
<li><strong>Your own review is always pinned on top</strong>, so you can find it right away.</li>
<li><strong>A dedicated “Reviews” tab</strong> on your profile (with the option to make it visible or hidden).</li>
<li><strong>Up to 8,000 characters per review</strong>, plus better formatting, smoother scrolling, and dark mode support.</li>
<li><strong>Improved reporting flow</strong> to help keep reviews fair and constructive.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you think GOG need to do more on their reviews system? What's missing from it? Leave a comment and let us know what you think.</p>

      <title>GNOME 49 released with new video player, document viewer, improved app store and disabled X11 session</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GNOME 49 "Brescia" has been officially released today with improvements big and small across this popular Linux desktop environment.</p>
<p>Some of the highlights you can expect to see include <em>Showtime</em> their fancy new video player, that they say "prioritizes a distraction-free viewing experience" with some essential features like adjustable playback speed, multiple audio and subtitle tracks, rotating video, and screenshot capture. Another new app with<em> Papers</em> as their new document viewer that supports "viewing, searching, annotating, and organizing formats like PDF, DjVu, TIFF, and comic-book archives (CBR, CBZ, CBT, CB7), with added features such as digital signature integration".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3586941711758126238gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3586941711758126238gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

<p>Other changes include various improvements to the Calendar app for exporting events to a file and improved accessibility. The Web browser has better ad blocking, a site menu, enhanced security, better in-page search and more. The GNOME Software app store also has various performance improvements to greatly reduce memory usage and speed up parsing of Flatpak repositories like Flathub.

<p>Another one of the big changes here is that they've now disabled the X11 session, as part of their work towards a full migration to Wayland. Apps on GNOME desktops that need X11 will continue working with XWayland as you would expect.</p>

      <title>ZOE Begone! is a fab hand-drawn fusion of bullet hell with a run and gun</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Inspired by drawn-on-film animation of the 1930s, ZOE Begone! masterfully blends together a bullet hell with a run and gun shooter and you need to check it out.</p>
<p>It certainly looks, feels and sounds the part too. The design of it is quite brilliant. Simple, but makes great use of a few screen effects, along with the film roll idea to really make it looks a bit like a retro animation reel and it really is charming to see in action.</p>
<p>Quite a challenge as well thanks to the controls, the design of the enemies and the health / energy system. You can run along the floor and shoot in 5 directions, or fly around but then only be able to shoot left or right. You'll be mixing between the modes constantly to avoid enemies and you really do have to pay attention to what's coming your way.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21065084311758124835gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21065084311758124835gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Especially tricky when enemies come flying at you and you're running on the ground, as those 5 limited firing directions will often miss, so you'll be running and flying and then swapping back again constantly. It's always keeping you on your toes. The animator will also appear at times during a level with their brush, to draw on a squiggly line where various enemies spawn along and that can get a little frantic to deal with and has been the cause of quite a few failures in my run.</p>
<p>You also have dash and pound abilities. Dash allows you to smash through multiple enemies at the same time, which is often needed when they're stacked together and in your way. While pound is needed to grab extra energy for your dash and ammo for when your weapon is powered up, as well as grabbing more health. There's various orbs along the bottom of the screen which you pound into for your energy or health, which then does a fun background change where it paints a different colour - some sweet art design there.</p>
<p>Each level is also just like a rolling film, it keeps going and loops back on itself so you can really just keep on running and gunning until all the enemies are defeated.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Hn1RHUN6ZWU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d1fb800d763a868ef8f458586e45efcc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Hn1RHUN6ZWU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As you destroy all the different types of enemies, you'll also get drops of apples, which can be used in a shop that appears to enable some upgrades. These can be a more powerful gun, homing shots, a spreading shot and more.</p>
<p>Works perfectly on Desktop Linux PCs with Proton and it's great on the Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>If you usually enjoy twin-stick shooters this is one you don't want to miss. A great example of a game doing a lot with a little, really enjoyable to sink some time into and smash through it.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>"ZOE Begone! is all about embracing imperfection - every jitter of ink, every ragged edge, every chaotic bullet," stated Graeme Hawkins, Retchy Games. "I hope players lean into that messiness, because for me, that’s where the magic lives."</p>
<p>"At PM Studios, we love championing creators who dare to be different; Graeme’s vision for ZOE Begone! is exactly that," says Ami Blaire, CMO, PM Studios. "It’s a perfect reminder of why indies matter, and we’re honored to launch it with Retchy Games."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Striking Hand-Drawn Visuals: </strong>Fully hand-drawn animations inspired by the animations of Norman McLaren and the golden age of arcade shooters.</li>
<li><strong>Enemy Chain Scoring System:</strong> Keep the action going with high-risk, high-reward chain combos, rewarding aggressive yet strategic gameplay. <br/>
<strong>Global Leaderboards: </strong>Compete with players around the globe (as well as yourself) to bag the highest score possible.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Upgrades:</strong> Choose between spending your Apples to gain new power-ups, weapons and abilities, or save them for game-altering updates later in a run - the choice is yours.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Modes:</strong> Switch between classic arcade runs, time-based challenges, and a high-octane boss rush; tackle the action however you want, and learn to master your favourite playstyle.</li>
<li><strong>Multilayered Difficulty &amp; Combat:</strong> Fly or fight on foot across Easy, Normal, and Hard difficulties—each with unique scoring potential and enemy patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Resource-Based Combat System:</strong> Manage your Energy to fly, dash, and pound through enemies—or trade it for short-lived, powerful weapons.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Mixing retro Resident Evil vibes with a mystery dungeon, House of Necrosis arrives in October</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Looking a lot like a classic Resident Evil game but switching things up to be turn-based, with dungeon exploration - House of Necrosis looks genuinely very cool. It will have Native Linux support and a demo is available right now, with the release date recently announced to be October 6th.</p>
<p>What a lovely unique blending of genres we have here. Indie developers really do come up with some wild combos.</p>
<p>Check out the brand new trailer for it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ox_OOSuDPME"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4d3f430435f75c94deda47ac64612097.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ox_OOSuDPME" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>

      <title>Line up the perfect shot to bump enemies in the wonderful and clever Flick Shot Rogues</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Flick Shot Rogues is a turn-based tactical roguelike about flicking your characters across the map, to bump into enemies. It's clever and a new favourite. <em>Disclosure: a key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>You've played with a deck of cards, you've dropped balls down boards filled with pins - but have you flicked your characters around a map like they're in a big crossbow before? Probably not. It's incredibly inventive with the game mechanics and really is a joy to play. Also works perfectly on Desktop Linux PCs with Proton and it's Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>What is it? A turn-based strategy roguelike where you fight across small arena boards by flicking your characters around, as they bounce off the walls and into enemies dealing damage.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6644519451758115173gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6644519451758115173gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Each character you control has different abilities and you only have one on the board at a time. You switch between them at any time before you flick them, so it's up to you to make the most out of each flick to properly use their abilities as best you can. It's not punishing in the difficulty, but it certainly can be a challenge when you have an assortment of enemies of the board with their own abilities too. You also have to constantly think about the turn after yours, for where you'll end up after your flick and what trouble you might land into with enemy movements.</p>
<p>During your run you also get to pick up powerful items, talents, curses and more with various effects that can be rather game-changing and perhaps even a little game-breaking at times when you become a bit ridiculously powerful on your flicks. Each run is fresh too since it's a roguelike with the enemies and items to collect being shuffled about. The setup is similar to Slay the Spire and FTL with you picking nodes on a map which could be a fight, a campfire to heal, an event and so on.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-q0plGoBP_E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e9f840c5226e61352d91d5f4af13548b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-q0plGoBP_E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Especially nice when you get a good trick-shot in, and manage to set off some chain reactions as you watch enemies burn and bump into each other to see the burning spread to others. And, as you progress you can unlock more characters for future runs too each with their own abilities.</p>
<p>One thing I do feel is missing is a clearer way to see how much damage you're going to deal or be dealt, especially versus how much health each enemy has. I love that in games like Slay the Spire, where you get shown what they're doing. Other than that, no issues with it at all. I enjoy the challenge of it, although some of the curses can be real tricky to deal with.</p>
<p>It really is supremely satisfying to get some good shots in on this one. It easily gets its teeth into you for that just <em>one-more-run</em> feeling. It feels quite like playing some sort of combat billiards, your mouse is the cue and your characters are your white ball to smash into the others.</p>
<p>This definitely gets the GamingOnLinux seal of approval. Go buy it and flick some people around.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Super-satisfying gameplay where you literally flick your hero into battle!</li>
<li>Turn-based tactical depth - make sure you always think ahead!</li>
<li>Unleash crazy combos as your attacks ricochet across the board!</li>
<li>Enemies and rewards reshuffle after each defeat!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is an excellent horde survival game - 1.0 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor 1.0 has now officially released, so you can deep dive into one of the best horde survival games around and dig for riches. Time for some more Rock and stone! <em>Note: I personally purchased it a good while ago, but was given early access to the release build.</em></p>
<p>Regular readers will know by now how I seem to have a complete fixation on anything Vampire Survivors inspired, I try to play anything resembling it in the horde-smashing genre <em>that we can never agree to a name on</em>. When I say it's one of the best, I really mean it. This has a great mixture of everything. And thanks to Proton, it runs great across Desktop Linux PCs and the Steam Deck too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/401925011758112566gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/401925011758112566gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Deep Rock Galactic on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>For those who haven't played it or any in the genre: you're one dwarf on a mission to mine for riches and upgrades. You go continually deeper through the Planet Hoxxes, mining through rocks and squishing every alien in the swarms that come running at you using your auto-firing weapons. Mining isn’t just a fluff feature here, it’s an important part of the game as it rewards exploration to find different ores needed for upgrades. You also need to mine-out specific areas for loot drops and to get away from swarms at times.</p>
<p>The key hook for these games are the build varieties, and how much you can ridiculously overpower your character to watch the fireworks. As you take down the bugs, they drop little experience orbs to pick up which allow you to level up and unlock some new weapons and upgrades.</p>
<p>Check out the new launch trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UFAHKmgswio"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cacfc036bf172999047b420f4a789df7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UFAHKmgswio" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What I especially like about this one is how descriptive it is. You always know what's going on and what's coming. There's a timeline always visible at the top of the screen, like a loading bar for your progress during a level. You know approximately how far away each swarm and boss is which is a nice touch.</p>
<p>Once you finish a level, all is not well — as you need to actually escape by running to the drop pod that appears on the map. Easier said than done, especially when you're completely surrounded (which can easily happen if you're not paying attention). That's another thing to love about it, the action is seriously <em>intense</em> and when you have to run to the pod it's dramatically amplified. </p>
<p>Steam Deck performance could be a bit better though, I've seen it drop right down to 30FPS when it gets incredible intense. I hope this is something they will actually work on later to improve it. Overall still worth playing and fun enough there. No issues with performance on Desktop Linux.</p>
<p>If you had played it previously, now is an excellent time to jump in as the progression has changed quite significantly. The new gear drop system does add some more features to make it worth it to keep coming back to it. You'll see gear drop during missions, and boss encounters can guarantee you a piece. You can then equip the gear <em>between</em> missions to give you various bonuses (and from the main menu for future runs). There's a really nice wide variety to the gear too and you can sell / upgrade specific gear and change them around any time.</p>
<p>Plus, a big new escort mission was also added, where you not only have to survive but protect a machine while it smashes through rock (players of the original Deep Rock Galactic will know it well).</p>

      <title>Soldat dev releases demo for Jackal, a brutal new top-down action game inspired by Hotline Miami</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From Transhuman Design who made Soldat, King Arthur's Gold and Maniac is a fresh action game with Jackal and you can now try it early with the demo release. Like their previous releases, it has Native Linux support too.</p>
<p>Before I even saw their noted inspiration, I immediately thought - this looks a bit like Hotline Miami. And that's just some of the inspiration that went into this one including OTXO, I Am Your Beast, John Wick, Cowboy Bebop and more. Enough about what they're taking from though, what's it all about then? The developer explains: "You're a drug-enhanced hitman with the moral compass of a broken slot machine, turning iconic Vegas hotels into impromptu abattoirs. Every table, chair, and kitchen utensil becomes a weapon in your hands because apparently, even the cutlery wants in on the action".</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HKKExRvpKMY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4d7c797b144c1a370c9d606bcf2ba0eb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HKKExRvpKMY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Every finisher a brushstroke. Every room a spectacle of carnage</strong> - Jackal is undoubtedly the most satisfyingly violent and unhinged murder simulator since Hotline Miami.</li>
<li><strong>From sofas to shotguns - everything is lethal</strong> - Become a coked-up John Wick who can turn an entire Vegas hotel into a stage for improvised carnage. </li>
<li><strong>Rhythmically Pleasant Frantic Violence</strong> - With drug-fueled superpowers rooms become physics kill boxes. From tables to kitchen utensils - everything is weaponized.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀</li>
<li><strong>No two massacres are alike</strong> - Each raid is different with randomly generated rooms, unlockable drug superpowers, stackable gameplay mutators, an arsenal of brutal finishers, enemy types, iconic Las Vegas locations, weapons and weaponized items fueling endless creative carnage.</li>
<li><strong>Tarantino - Hunter Thompson - Palahniuk - Scorsese</strong> - Immerse in a psychedelic noir story where a hitman and his associate navigate a 1970s mob filled Vegas where every housecleaning job bleeds into the next and reality's just another bad trip.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Check out the demo for Kokoro Kitchen, a sweet farm-to-table cooking game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The 2.0 demo of the casual sweet farm-to-table cooking game Kokoro Kitchen is out now, and it really does look wonderful. It also has a Native Linux version.</p>
<p>More about it: Welcome to the spirit world! You might not remember how you got here, but don’t worry—Alan, the cutest (and grumpiest) poultry-geist, has a plan! In this farm-to-table cooking game help Alan restore a rundown Japanese restaurant, serve delicious meals, harvest fresh crops, and prepare special ingredients to meet all your customers’ needs.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer they recently put up too:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="KHjYmiIf6sQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/60515ad29310baee8d5dd82de8bd2981.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/KHjYmiIf6sQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">For the 2.0 demo now live it covers 5 in-game days which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting cut scene and tutorial.</li>
<li>15 recipes.</li>
<li>8 upgrades.</li>
<li>1 very special NPC.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall this seems like a really nice mixture of gameplay features. A bit of casual farming with you planting, watering and harvesting ingredients and then you move it all through the restaurant. There's mini-games, you need to manage finances, an upgrade system, NPCs to talk to and do challenges for and much more.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck plugin adds AMD FSR4 support to improve visuals</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You're supposed to only be able to use AMD FSR4 with the latest AMD GPUs, but thanks to a woops from AMD - even the Steam Deck can now use FSR4.<em> It's all a bit of a hack though and completely unsupported.</em></p>
<p>Back when AMD released <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/amd-fidelityfx-super-resolution-4-fsr-4-now-available-for-all-developers-with-fidelityfx-sdk-2-0/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FidelityFX SDK 2.0 to include FSR4</a> for developers, they initially did a massive oops by including the full source code. Not something they can really take back either, as not only does the internet never forget but it was under an open source license before they scrubbed it.</p>
<p>Now, Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/radeon/comments/1nhkkr8/fsr_sdk_leak_contained_fsr_4_files_that_work_on/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">AthleteDependent926</a> has caused quite a stir by compiling the DLL needed to allow AMD FSR4 on older AMD GPUs and sticking it online for anyone to use. And so, of course people are. For Steam Deck, it's especially nice, as older versions of FSR have some pretty jarring visual issues due to the low resolution.</p>
<p>For Steam Deck owners first you'll need to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-set-up-decky-loader-on-steam-deck-steamos-for-easy-plugins/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">install Decky Loader using the GamingOnLinux guide</a> to get your Steam Deck ready to work with plugins. Then you can use the <a href="https://github.com/xXJSONDeruloXx/Decky-Framegen" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Decky Framegen Plugin</a> which has just recently updated in version v0.11.15 to include it.</p>
<p>To install it you can follow the Decky Framegen Plugin install steps from their GitHub page (to ensure the newest version), which I've tweaked below to be hopefully clear enough</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Go into Desktop Mode</strong>: STEAM button -&gt; Power -&gt; Switch to Desktop.</li>
<li><strong>Download the Plugin</strong>: Look for "Decky-Framegen.zip" from the <a href="https://github.com/xXJSONDeruloXx/Decky-Framegen/releases" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">releases page</a> via your web browser.</li>
<li><strong>Go back into Gaming Mode</strong></li>
<li><strong>Install the Plugin</strong>: In Decky Loader, select the "install from zip" option in developer settings.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5680579061758104045gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5680579061758104045gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6075732071758104043gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6075732071758104043gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Setup OptiScaler</strong>: Open the plugin and click "Setup OptiScaler Mod".</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5951073541758104086gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5951073541758104086gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Configure Games</strong>: For each game you want to enhance:

	<ul>
<li>Click "Copy Patch Command" in the plugin.</li>
<li>Go to your game's Properties → Launch Options in Steam.</li>
<li>Paste the command: <code class="inline-code">~/fgmod/fgmod %command%</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20719666861758104208gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20719666861758104208gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20634025971758104209gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20634025971758104209gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enable Features</strong>: Launch your game and enable DLSS in the graphics settings</li>
<li><strong>Adjust Steam Input</strong>: Add the Insert key to one of the back buttons on the Steam Deck. You'll need it to open the OptiScaler settings overlay.</li>
<li><strong>Adjust Settings</strong>: Once in-game, press the Insert key for OptiScaler settings to change modes.</li>
</ul>
<p>It will likely suck away a bit more power from the Steam Deck, but if you have a charger handy or you're docked to a TV, the visual bump compared to what you'll get with older FSR on Steam Deck appears to be worth it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10793334021758105514gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10793334021758105514gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20930199771758105515gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20930199771758105515gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered on Steam Deck with FSR4</em></p>
<p>Pretty amazing to see, and only shows that AMD could if they wanted to, actually put up FSR4 for older GPUs officially. Naturally though, they want people to buy their latest tech.</p>

      <title>A second Hollow Knight: Silksong patch is ready for testing - here&#39;s the details</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Team Cherry clearly aren't slowing down on making improvements to the smash-hit Hollow Knight: Silksong, with a second patch already available to test. The first patch only released a few days ago on September 12th, and now there's an opt-in Beta test for the second.</p>
<p>As of two hours ago when <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/546746634645557243/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the post</a> on Steam was last edited, these are the current patch 2 changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Patch Notes</p>
<p>- Added Dithering effect option in Advanced video settings. Reduces colour banding but can slightly soften the appearance of foreground assets. Defaults to 'Off'.<br/>
- Updated Herald's Wish achievement description to clarify that players must both complete the wish and finish the game.<br/>
- Fixed Savage Beastfly in Far Fields sometimes remaining below the lava.<br/>
- Fixed rare cases of Shrine Guardian Seth getting out of bounds during battle.<br/>
- Added catch to prevent Lugoli sometimes flying off screen and not returning during battle.<br/>
- Further reduced chance of Silk Snippers getting stuck out of bounds in Chapel of the Reaper battle.<br/>
- Fixed various instances of dying to bosses while killing them causing death sequences to play messily or out of sync.<br/>
- Fixed Shaman Binding into a bottom transition causing a softlock.<br/>
- Cocoon positions in some locations updated to prevent it spawning in inaccessible areas.<br/>
- Fixed Liquid Lacquer courier delivery not being accessible in Steel Soul mode.<br/>
- Fixed some NPCs not correctly playing cursed hint dialogues in certain instances.<br/>
- Fixed Pondcatcher Reed not being able to fly away after singing.<br/>
- Fixed Verdania memory orbs sometimes replaying layered screen-edge burst effects.<br/>
- Fixed the break counter not working for certain multihitter tools eg Conchcutter.<br/>
- Fixed Volt Filament damage multiplier not applying for certain Silk Skills.<br/>
- Fixed Cogflies and Wisps inappropriately targeting Skullwings.<br/>
- Fixed Cogflies incorrectly resetting their HP to full on scene change.<br/>
- Fixed Curveclaw always breaking on the first hit after being deflected.<br/>
- Fixed Plasmium Phial and Flea Brew sometimes not restoring as intended at benches.<br/>
- Various other smaller tweaks and fixes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They said to expect "a few more additions and tweaks before full release", so only jump in if you're willing to test and report back on it. Probably best not to throw you current run into a Beta.</p>

      <title>SteamOS support is being explored for the Lenovo Legion Go 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Depending on what region you're in, the Lenovo Legion Go 2 might have already landed and it seems like SteamOS <em>might</em> come officially in future.</p>
<p>For the original Lenovo Legion Go and the new Legion Go 2, the only officially supported operating system is Windows 11. However, Lenovo did launch the Legion Go S with a SteamOS version officially supported but they've stayed pretty quiet about SteamOS for the Legion Go 2. The only note about it I've seen previously to now was a minor mention at the bottom of an article on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/769776/legion-go-2-official-lenovo-new-flagship-handheld-cost" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The Verge</a> where they were told simply "Lenovo isn’t announcing a SteamOS version of the Legion Go 2 at this time".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10345405701758033467gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Lenovo recently did an AMA (Ask me anything) on Reddit, where the Lenovo Legion team were answering questions. And, of course, someone had to ask about SteamOS. From the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LegionGo/comments/1nhni67/comment/necsj7t/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Reddit</a> post by a Lenovo official:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While the Legion Go Gen 2 is optimized for Windows to deliver broad compatibility and a full gaming experience out of the box, its open hardware platform allows for users to explore alternative configurations if they choose. We are exploring official support for SteamOS on the Legion Go Gen 2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While usually you could mostly ignore such a comment, and put it down to the usual non-committal marketing speak, the fact that Lenovo <em>have</em> done a SteamOS machine before adds a bit more credit to it. They could have just continued to say no like they did to The Verge.</p>
<p>Hopefully they won't leave it too long if they plan to do it. Otherwise, you'll have to wait for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/bazzite/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bazzite</a> to continue improving support for it to get Linux on it yourself.</p>
<p>The Legion Go 2 starts at £1,099.99.</p>

      <title>Funny dungeon crawler Lucky Tower Ultimate 1.0 arrives Q1 2026 with an extra content update coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lucky Tower Ultimate is truly a brilliantly silly dungeon crawler and one you need to play! The 1.0 has been announced for Q1 2026 and more content is coming.</p>
<p>If you haven't played it - you're missing out. It's slapstick comedy, so it's pretty daft and stupid but thoroughly charming at the same time. I really love diving into it to see all the encounters, and some of it really will make you laugh out loud or jump with surprise.</p>
<p>Since Q1 2026 is a while away to prevent people waiting too long, they've also revealed a new update is planned for sometime soon that will include "new items, new decorations, new traps, and new enemy variations" with the developer seeing how much they can cram into the update.</p>
<p>Their new 1.0 teaser is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AnerEvK8U20"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a9f8f7fd0366f334b00f34b12fb35420.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AnerEvK8U20" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The game works brilliantly on Linux PCs and Steam Deck (Verified) with Proton.</p>
<p>Priced at £12.99 / 14,99€ / $14.99 it has a Very Positive rating from players on Steam.</p>

      <title>Full Circle / EA confirm again that skate. will not support Linux, Steam Deck or macOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>skate. from developer Full Circle and Electronic Arts (EA) is about to enter Early Access, and due to the anti-cheat there's no support for Linux / Steam Deck. <em>And macOS is out too.</em></p>
<p>This shouldn't be surprising news to regular GamingOnLinux readers as we <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/the-upcoming-skate-from-ea-will-be-unsupported-on-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck-due-to-anti-cheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">covered this back in July</a>, since this skating game is using the kernel-level EA Javelin anticheat. One of those anti-cheat systems that likely sends a shiver down the spine of anyone gaming on Linux PCs, Steam Deck or other handhelds running things like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/bazzite/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bazzite</a>.</p>
<p>In a fresh <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/3354750/announcements/detail/738149224958395252" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam with the specifications, they confirmed again:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>MacOS, Linux are not supported.</li>
<li>While skate. will be Steam Native, Steam Deck will not be supported.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>By "Steam Native", they mean it doesn't additionally force the EA app.</em></p>
<p>Don't expect it to <em>ever</em> be supported either, not at least until the day Linux as a platform grows to a point where EA can't ignore it by blocking it like they also do for Apex Legends, Battlefield and more.</p>
<p>See more about <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat compatibility on our dedicated page</a>. And be sure to follow the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/anti-cheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat article tag</a>.</p>
<p>For skating games that do work you can try the likes of Session: Skate Sim and Skater XL.</p>

      <title>Palworld 1.0 arrives next year with a huge update and plans to fix all the jank</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pocketpair have revealed that Palworld 1.0 will arrive next year, with updates being quieter for the rest of the year while they fix all the quirks and jank.</p>
<p>In a video posted to their official YouTube account, their Communications Director and Publishing Manager spoke about the updates they've added previously and went onto explain plans for the future. They noted how there's "no secret that Palworld has a lot of quirks and jank" and that "we want to take the time to properly address those before releasing the game".</p>
<p>Later in the video they go on to mention the Winter update will not be as big as Feybreak due to their focus on fixing all the little issues. However, they have "a few surprises planned" for the Winter update this year. That, and there's a "truly massive amount of content planned for the 1.0 update" as they're not slowing down.</p>
<p>Some teasers will be coming on the planned content to come.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="tEVIBHP37eM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e721d1237fec7683bc91ece5eb9cf518.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/tEVIBHP37eM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They also have more games to come from Pocketpair Publishing but no word on what yet.</p>

      <title>Call of the Void is an epic new Quake 2 Remastered crossover mod with Quake 1</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love some Quake? You're not going to want to miss this one. Call of the Void is an impressive new crossover mod release for Quake 2. Designed to be fully compatible with Quake 2 Remastered it brings together the worlds of Quake 1 and Quake 2.</p>
<p>More about it: "Call of the Void" picks up where "Call of the Machine" leaves off. With our protagonist trapped in the void, they suddenly hear a voice in their mind. The entity speaking identifies itself as one of the ancient gods, Vadrigar, who proposes to the protagonist that they escape the void by sending them on a new mission for revenge against the Stroggs. This is in response to the Stroggs transforming the fallen Vadrigars (Chton and Shub-Niggurath) and their followers into partially mechanical creatures in the service of the Strogg leader Makron. Our protagonist will travel to a new, unknown dimension where levels from both Quake 1 and Quake 2 converge, and they will confront enemies from both franchises.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>18 new monstrous Strogg hybrid creations plus 2 new final bosses plus 11 Hybrids Prototypes.</li>
<li>Quake 1 Original monster roast ported to Quake 2 Remastered</li>
<li>A new campaign with 5 huge new maps mixing new and old scenarios from both franchises.</li>
<li>Made to be fully compatible with Quake 2 Remastered.</li>
<li>A new story that takes as its starting point the ending of the new official expansion "Call of the Machine."</li>
<li>Old monsters from Quake 1 adapted to the new Quake 2 Remastered.</li>
<li>Source code and FGD file available for the community to expand content.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the release trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5jkpK4swtuo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/aa95e59e65e9229d13de9958a73beceb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5jkpK4swtuo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can download it from <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/quake-ii-call-of-the-void" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Mod DB</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/call_of_the_void" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to run it on Linux with Quake 2 Remastered using Proton from Steam, it's quite simple. Just extract the mod folder contents from the zip file into the "rerelease" folder inside where you installed Quake 2. So the "q1q2" folder sits next to "baseq2". Then add this launch option to Quake 2 inside Steam:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">+set game q1q2</code></p>
<p>You'll then be able to select Call of the Void in the New Game menu.</p>

      <title>GPD WIN 5 highlights support for running Bazzite Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The upcoming pricey and strangely designed GPD WIN 5 is coming later this year, and it's now confirmed to have support for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/bazzite/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bazzite</a> Linux.</p>
<p>Bazzite is a popular choice of Linux for handhelds, with its SteamOS-like appearance but offers up advanced hardware and software support. On the <a href="https://gpd.hk/gpdwin56773453f" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">official page</a> for the GPD WIN 5, they actually repeatedly highlight its support for Bazzite. However, the tech specs show it will still be shipping with Windows 11, so this is again a bring your own Linux if you want a change on it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/704284781758013291gol1.png"/></p>
<p>On their official product page they talk about using Bazzite to make the "Ultimate Steam Gaming Handheld" and the "Ultimate Steam Gaming Console" when docking.</p>
<p>I'm not particularly fond of GPD hardware, or how they've previously acted as a company (like blocking GamingOnLinux on social media for pointing out they were pinching YouTube videos without credit or permission), but found it interesting to see how Linux as a gaming platform continues expanding across other hardware vendors.</p>
<p>The GPD WIN 5 is just a weird device. Powerful? Sure, but there's <em>no</em> internal battery. You either play with it plugged in, or stick it into an external battery pack designed for the device which makes it quite bulky.</p>
<p>Just look at how odd this is:</p>

<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="T0vd_38tB_8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a4830b69bdfc10c8231e7c21b63d57a4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/T0vd_38tB_8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What's even sillier, is this external battery doesn't come as standard, it's a separate purchase.</p>
<p>It will come with either the AMD Ryzen Al Max+ 395 (AMD Radeon 8060S) or AMD Ryzen Al Max 385 (AMD Radeon 8050S), with either 32GB / 64GB / 128GB RAM (Quad Channel LPDDR5x 8000 MT/s) with either 1TB / 2TB or 4TB storage.</p>
<p>Definitely not a device I would be going for, I prefer my portables to be actually properly portable without the <em>requirement</em> of attachments. It's just a thoroughly confusing device. Much like the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/the-lenovo-legion-go-2-launches-in-october-its-heavier-and-very-pricey/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lenovo Legion Go 2</a> which is also heavier and pricey, handheld gaming definitely seems to go going in the wrong direction with some companies.</p>
<p>The GPD Win 5 is coming to <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/gpd-win-5-the-ultimate-external-battery-handheld/coming_soon" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">IndieGoGo</a> crowdfunding sometime soon. It's likely to be priced around US $1,400.</p>

      <title>The Crew from Ubisoft gets revived thanks to the The Crew Unlimited project</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Crew can now live on thanks to the community, after Ubisoft completely shut it down the The Crew Unlimited project has released to keep it alive.</p>
<p>If you still have a copy somewhere that is, since Ubisoft no longer have a way for new players to legitimately access it. Still, this is an important project for game preservation. Truly is a shame that bigger publishers just decide to dump games like Ubisoft did with The Crew, projects like this show what's possible with a little extra effort. Ubisoft could have clearly done something like this themselves but chose not to.</p>
<p>You can download it from <a href="https://thecrewunlimited.com/home/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The Crew Unlimited website</a>.</p>
<p>The original shutdown is what led to the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Stop Killing Games</a> movement that's continuing its push to get laws amended to hopefully prevent publishers just leaving people with entirely broken games in future. Verification of signatures for the EU campaign is currently underway, and from a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StopKillingGames/comments/1nfvxk1/campaign_update/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Reddit</a> post "early reports from several countries show around 97% of signatures being valid" which is great. They're also continuing to work in the background to counter "misinformation and industry lobbying".</p>

      <title>AMDVLK has been discontinued as AMD are throwing their &#34;full support&#34; behind RADV</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AMD have announced the end of AMDVLK, their official open-source Vulkan driver and will instead now be focusing on the much more popular RADV.</p>
<p>Most people gaming on Linux will likely be using RADV anyway, since Mesa comes as pretty much the standard on Linux distributions and has Valve's backing too with it being the graphics driver used on SteamOS.</p>
<p>On the official AMDVLK GitHub, an <a href="https://github.com/GPUOpen-Drivers/AMDVLK/discussions/416" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> was posted by AMD's JianRong JIN:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a move to streamline development and strengthen our commitment to the open-source community, AMD is unifying its Linux Vulkan driver strategy and has decided to discontinue the AMDVLK open-source project, throwing our full support behind the RADV driver as the officially supported open-source Vulkan driver for Radeon™ graphics adapters.</p>
<p>This consolidation allows us to focus our resources on a single, high-performance codebase that benefits from the incredible work of the entire open-source community. We invite developers and users alike to utilize the RADV driver and contribute to its future.</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn more about RADV: <a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/drivers/radv.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Mesa RADV Documentation</a></li>
<li>Contribute to the code: <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/tree/main/src/amd/vulkan" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Mesa GitLab Repository</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We are excited about this focused path forward and are committed to the continued success of open-source Vulkan on Radeon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a result they've also archived the <a href="https://github.com/GPUOpen-Drivers/pal" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> page for PAL (Platform Abstraction Library), the <a href="https://github.com/GPUOpen-Drivers/gpurt" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> for their GPU Ray Tracing Library and others related.</p>
<p>I'm quite excited by their mention of throwing their "full support" at RADV, which will hopefully mean actually providing some resources for the Mesa driver to improve.</p>
<p>What do you make of this news?</p>

      <title>The cute co-op game LEGO Voyagers has released and it&#39;s Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>LEGO Voyagers is the cutest looking co-op game and it's available today, along with it getting Steam Deck Verified for the release. So it will work great on other Linux / SteamOS systems too. Created by Light Brick Studio, who also made LEGO Builder's Journey.</p>
<p>The initial release had a bit of a blip with people not being able to play, as it was showing as the Friend's Pass version, the developers have already solved this before publishing the article. The Friend's Pass is a nice system, allowing you to jump into the game with a friend, so only one of you need to purchase it. I wished my co-op games had something like it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1J4Zq-A6FAw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b90a59ccdbb5f102486dd9c4e4dc22e7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1J4Zq-A6FAw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about it below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When two friends make it their mission to rescue an abandoned spaceship, they embark on a journey beyond their wildest dreams, ultimately learning the value of being connected.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Experience what it feels like to be a LEGO brick. Tumble, jump, snap together, and build your way through rich brick worlds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unravel a poetic, non verbal narrative, set in beautiful brick built environments, supported by an atmospheric soundtrack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cooperatively solve the game's many challenges and discover how two bricks are better than one. Play locally on the same screen, or online.</p>
</li>
<li>Invite a friend to join your adventure for free with the Friend’s Pass. As long as one of you owns LEGO Voyagers, you can both play the full co-op experience together.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Really need to get finished with our play-through of It Takes Two, as this looks wonderful and will no doubt be the next game we co-op over here.</p>

      <title>Car combat game FUMES improves support for controllers and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>FUMES really is awesome and it has an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam which it gained quickly after release, and the developer keeps improving it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HvQr6nI5mdI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/50a650fe3538e1b1b08337fe3565ec2c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HvQr6nI5mdI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In the most recent Early Access update, they've focused on making it a lot more playable on controllers and the Steam Deck. Most menus now have proper controller navigation and so it should feel a lot better now. Additionally, they've made these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added gamepad navigation to menus.</li>
<li>Added rumble/vibration for gamepads (can be adjusted in settings).</li>
<li>Added missing input glyphs.</li>
<li>Adjusted font sizes on some UI to make text more readable on Steam Deck.</li>
<li>Various buttons remapped. Because of this we had to reset controls setting - adjust them if needed.</li>
<li>Rework of controls remapping UI to make it easier to use.</li>
<li>Added separate controls categories for gameplay, menus and photo mode.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>An auto-aim feature is also coming to help with gamepads, but that's for a future update they said. Steering wheel support is also experimental but they said with this update it should be "much more usable now". There's also some bug fixes, UI improvements, changes to how loot works and more.</p>
<p>For the upcoming updates they're planning to work on continued controller improvements, achievements and getting Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>DRAGON BALL GEKISHIN SQUADRA works great on Linux PCs and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bandai Namco Entertainment released DRAGON BALL GEKISHIN SQUADRA, a free to play MOBA set in the Dragon Ball universe and it works well on Linux / Steam Deck.</p>
<p>There doesn't appear to be any anti-cheat problems with this one, and no anti-cheat is actually noted on the Steam page and in my testing <em>everything</em> seemed to work without issues with Proton 9.0-4. It's a free to play game, and so of course - there's micro-transactions. They want you to pump some coin into it to help unlock more characters and skins for your account, so it's something to keep in mind.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12704155011757932701gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12704155011757932701gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5668571901757932703gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5668571901757932703gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>As a MOBA, it does a pretty competent job at the gameplay with mixing in the Dragon Ball characters and compared with the likes of Dota 2, it's incredibly accessible and simple to get into. From the games I've played and completed, I've surprisingly really enjoyed it. The mixture of characters, the world and all the abilities do make for quite a fun and engrossing time. Especially since it works great with a gamepad, I can sit back and chill with it.</p>
<p>Since it's a MOBA, it's a hero battler. You pick a lane on the map, and fight through taking down specific enemies that act as the towers, while the opposing team tries to do the same to you. You'll battle various AI enemies to help your character level up, and fight other real players directly too. All in the name of trying to get to the opposite team's base, to steal their Dragon Ball and win the match.</p>
<p>Chaotic too at times when you're battling multiple opponents, and you're all firing off these huge abilities, you can definitely get a bit lost in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4402172701757934113gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4402172701757934113gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19646213981757934115gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19646213981757934115gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Performance on max settings has been without a problem, even with all the action going on with multiple characters fighting and throwing all their abilities into it - I've seen a very smooth 120FPS. Not exactly surprising though, the graphics aren't exactly pushing anything, especially as it was made for mobile too so I expected this to run well anyway. Even on lower-end machines you shouldn't have many issues with the performance in this one.</p>

<p>Since I was enjoying it on Desktop Linux, I checked it out on Steam Deck as well to see if it would make a good competitive multiplayer game for the Steam Deck. Especially since the controller support is perfect on Desktop, I would have thought it would make a great Steam Deck game — and it is!</p>
<p>Appears to be a solid 60FPS on the default settings (everything on High or Max) on Steam Deck without breaking a sweat.</p>

<em>Pictured - Steam Deck screenshots</em></p>
<p>From my time testing it out, this really does look like a great fit for the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>However, it does have a major problem.</p>
<p>You'll probably find that quite a few of your games <em>can't</em> be finished as someone quits. It's seriously abrupt too, the game just pauses with a message about it and after a few seconds that's it - game over. So if anyone has a connection problem, or rage quits - that's your game done. Very annoying.</p>
<p>The trailers also barely show any gameplay at all but here they are:</p>

<p>As a free to play MOBA, my main concern is: how long will it live? It does currently (at least on Steam) have a somewhat healthy player-base. But these types of games don't tend to last overly long on PC. At least in this case it has cross-platform play across Steam, Switch, PlayStation, iOS and Android so it might last.</p>

      <title>Super Mario Bros Remastered open source fan project brings an impressive remake to PC</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nintendo likely won't be happy about this one, so get it while it's hot, Super Mario Bros Remastered is out now and open source. It doesn't actually include the original assets from the classic Nintendo games, so you need to supply that yourself with a ROM. That might keep it out of reach for Nintendo lawyers, but probably not.</p>
<p>Anyway, this open source fan project is free, open source and made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot</a>. So could even be a nice way for others to learn to hack away with Godot to make something. Or just, play Mario on PC.</p>

      <title>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Legends of the Zone Trilogy gets a big upgrade and Steam Deck improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GSC Game World continue improving the recent S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Legends of the Zone Trilogy release, with version 1.3 out for all three titles. The pack includes S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Prypiat - Enhanced Edition, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky - Enhanced Edition and S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chornobyl - Enhanced Edition.</p>
<p>Gamers on Steam Deck will appreciate it, as they've overhauled the fonts to make them "more familiar to veteran stalkers and increased font size for better readability on Steam Deck". On top of that they also fixed "mouse simulation gyroscope support for better experience on Steam Deck". Nice to see a little extra effort there.</p>
<p>There's also a useful new quick slots system that was added for Shadow of Chornobyl (SoC) and Clear Sky (CS), which functions that same as Call of Prypiat (CoP) but it seems like you have to manually enable it in the game settings.</p>

      <title>Mate&#39;Morphosis is an upcoming chess-inspired puzzle game about becoming the piece you capture</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What have they done to chess? Mate'Morphosis warps it into a puzzle game where you become the piece you capture where you constantly have to adapt.</p>
<p>You have to navigate one single piece to capture the queen, and since you turn into whatever you capture, every move will change the game so you have to really plan ahead with this one. Love the idea of it and it looks good too, with a nice simple style to get the point across.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2v9uU2IKSQw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9946497f89a35be0e620fc41d0486816.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2v9uU2IKSQw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights (from Steam):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Morph</strong> - Pawns become knights, knights become bishops; your route evolves with every move.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Evolving mechanics</strong> - Fresh mechanics beyond chess keep boards surprising from start to Mate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hand-crafted challenge</strong> - tight levels with a steady difficulty climb and clean, readable pixel art.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Instant learning loop</strong> - quick restarts and fast pacing make puzzle experience painless.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Play your way</strong> - A lot potential moves. <em><u>well kinda</u>.</em></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It should be released in November.</p>

      <title>Slay the Spire 2 delayed and now arrives March 2026 - nothing to do with Silksong</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>Slay the Spire 2 was originally due in Early Access this year, but the developers have announced it's moving into March 2026. Made with Godot and with plans for full Linux support, I'm excited and I do hope the extra time will allow them to make the best of it. The original was simply amazing!</p>
<p>Writing in a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/646570/view/529856925490218829" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> post on the original game's store page, they said there's no big dramatic reason as to why. It's down to a mixture of their personal lives (everyone is fine) and they kept saying "wouldn't it be cool if..." too many times so they just need more time to get it ready.</p>
<p>They also put up an official FAQ:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Is the real reason for the delay the timing of the Silksong release?</strong><br/>
We got together as a team to determine our new release window before Silksong’s date was announced. The timing just worked out like that, but on the bright side, everyone can keep busy playing Silksong during the wait!<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Is the real reason for the delay that you’ve been spending your time on making merch/community events/etc?</strong><br/>
Our merch is made by 3rd party partners and our community manager is the primary liaison on our team for collabs like that. No game development was harmed in the making of those plushies! Likewise, anything community-focused that we create, participate in, or promote is generally handled by the CM and doesn’t cut into any game development time.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>So is it because you’re adding in a bunch of new features and content?</strong><br/>
Yes, in part. Because you know what does cut into game development time? Game development! Compared to Slay the Spire 1's early access launch (and for that matter it's final 2.0 form) this new sequel has a lot more content that we can't wait to share with you. In addition, we want to make sure we're upholding the quality bar that both we and the gaming community have come to expect for Early Access titles.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>So what’s so different from StS1?</strong><br/>
In case you haven’t been keeping up with our trailers and Neowsletters–quite a lot. There are new characters, more cards/potions/relics/events/etc, more visual polish, more animation and VFX, quality of life changes, entirely new mechanics, and still a whole lot more we can’t tell you about just yet. Although, if you read on to the next section you'll learn about a pretty big one...<br/>
<br/>
<strong>When was the game originally planned to launch?</strong><br/>
2025! Ok, but in all seriousness, we were initially aiming for a Fall 2025 release window. For now, we’ll just have to savor these moments of anticipation a little longer.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Will this be anything like other games that get repeatedly delayed with no explanation?</strong><br/>
No, for one thing, you should never expect radio silence from us. That’s why we’re here talking to you now. And, as opposed to a general release year, we have an actual specific date that we’re aiming for internally and are confident we can hit this time. As you've already heard, it’s releasing on a Thursday, but the exact date will be revealed closer to launch.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>So, do you regret the “Still coming in 2025” gag at the end of the TGA trailer?</strong><br/>
Demi, the CM, who is writing this, pushed for that one so she can take the fall for it. In her defense, it was pretty funny at the time.</p>

      <title>Wine 10.15 released bringing Unicode 17 and some initial NTSYNC work</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wine 10.15 has rolled out as the latest development release on the Windows compatibility layer towards eventually the Wine 11 release next year. <em>And then eventually Proton 11 too for Steam from Valve.</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The main highlights from the <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/releases/wine-10.15" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release notes</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unicode character tables updated to Unicode 17.0.0.</li>
<li>Zip64 support in Packaging services.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>

<p>Looking closer, there's some initial NTSYNC work that made it into Wine directly now too, although it's still not all of it yet as some of it is being reworked to fit properly.</p>
<p>As for bug fixes they've noted issues solved for wow64 in multiple games, Sims 2, Wayland improvements, Steam, CapCut and mire.</p>

      <title>Valve fixes Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 issue on Steam Deck / SteamOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Baldur's Gate 3 players on Steam Deck and SteamOS may have noticed recently it appeared like it uninstalled itself, here's what's going on.</p>
<p>Writing on Bluesky, Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais simply <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/plagman.bsky.social/post/3lyrpgnaf7s2m" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A fix has been deployed for the Baldur's Gate 3 install issue. May have to restart Steam Deck for it to pick up the new configuration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The game from what I understand <em>wasn't</em> actually uninstalled, it just <em>looked</em> like it due to a change on Steam's backend configuration. However, players may not have been able to actually get it to reinstall to pick it up either.</p>
<p>A little background info — currently, Baldur's Gate 3 runs the Windows version through the Proton compatibility layer to make it playable on Linux systems like Steam Deck with SteamOS. However, it seems like the developer Larian Studios are working on a Native Linux version specifically for the Steam Deck, which you can see in the depots on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1086940/depots/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> with a Native Linux version set for Steam Deck only (if a depot is set for Steam Deck it's <em>not</em> available on Desktop Linux).</p>
<p>What happened is that Valve's automatic Steam Deck Verification ended up picking this up, and setting the Native version as the default (<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1086940/history/?changeid=31089396" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>). Even though it's not yet public and hasn't been announced, which caused problems with players who have it currently installed. I've seen this issue before with Deck Verified testing and approving a Beta release for a different game, it just seems to be an issue Valve need to solve to separate somehow between public and non-public builds of games.</p>
<p>So Valve have now just put a separate <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/891390/history/?changeid=31100695" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">configuration</a> on Baldur's Gate 3 to force it onto Proton, which is likely to be removed if / when Larian release the special Steam Deck Native Linux build if Valve's retesting then shows it to be better to set that as the actual default.</p>

      <title>DRAGON QUEST VII Reimagined announced for February 2026, already rated Steam Deck Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>DRAGON QUEST VII Reimagined has been revealed and it will be launching February 2026, and we already have Valve testing it on Steam Deck ahead of release.</p>
<p>Valve have given it a Steam Deck Playable rating due to some in-game text being too small, which is an easy problem for the developer to solve between now and the February 5th 2026 release date. Valve also note the first-time setup requires an internet connection. On top of that the Steam page notes it also has Denuvo Anti-tamper.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3c8xcYHboPs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f377b61e2ec9a99da7a05dbfefc7313b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3c8xcYHboPs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A Diorama Brought to Life</strong></p>
<p>DRAGON QUEST VII Reimagined blends a beautiful diorama art style with Akira Toriyama's iconic character designs to make every encounter feel vibrant, heartfelt, and full of adventure. From lush forests and bustling towns to ancient ruins and whimsical monsters, every environment is bursting with color and personality.</p>
<p><strong>Travel through History to Restore the Present</strong></p>
<p>Scattered stone fragments unlock portals to long-lost eras with their own challenges to solve. Restore the islands, solve mysteries, and make allies in the past to breathe life back into the present.</p>
<p><strong>A Beloved Tale with a Streamlined Narrative</strong></p>
<p>DRAGON QUEST VII Reimagined is told through a series of vignettes with an overarching narrative. The main story has also been streamlined to make the journey more accessible to all players.</p>
<p><strong>Classic Combat, Improved!</strong></p>
<p>The battle system in DRAGON QUEST VII Reimagined has undergone significant changes. Turn the tides of battle with new vocational perks. Each vocation has its own unique ability, from all-out attacks to those that support your allies. Battle speed adjustments and an auto-battle feature are also available. Battles can progress without interruptions between each turn, depending on the tactics selected for the protagonist and allies. While on the field, players can pre-emptively strike monsters and instantly defeat them If the monster is weaker than the party.</p>
<p><strong>Moonlight and Level Up Two Vocations at the Same Time!</strong></p>
<p>Customize your playstyle with the new Moonlighting mechanic. Having two vocations assigned at once provides access to the skills, magic spells, and unique perks from both.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's up for pre-order for £49.99 and the Deluxe Edition has Advanced Access to play it 2 days early.</p>

      <title>Steel Knight&#39;s ARMIS turns Vampire Survivors into an anime inspired mecha shooter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Could be a fun twist for the genre. Steel Knight's ARMIS takes the ideas of Vampire Survivors with the upgrade system and tweaks it to be like a mecha anime.</p>
<p>It has a number of twists to help set it apart from all the other survivor-likes, and it could be one to watch. There's a demo available to try right now that works perfectly with Proton on Desktop Linux and it's set for release on October 8th.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4815315301757687370gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4815315301757687370gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8545631731757687616gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/8545631731757687616gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>While it has the traditional survivor-like gameplay of tackling enemy hordes, auto firing weapons, collecting orbs and selecting upgrades constantly when you level up - what sets it apart is the overall structure of it.</p>
<p>Since it's inspired by classic mecha anime, it has a story to progress through various chapters. With all sorts of pilot and enemy chatter going on during the missions. That, and the gameplay will switch between you flying around destroying enemies in a basic area map into a vertical shoot 'em up mode, so it keeps things feeling quite fresh.</p>
<p>They also have a new gameplay trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="efLigPvMb70"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/910b2be1df6bfdff4a8f62cdb0ee968a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/efLigPvMb70" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The only part of it that I didn't particularly like, was the constant chatter for the story during the battles. The battles are pretty hectic, and you simply don't get time to read what they're saying (the audio is in Japanese). If they had tweaked that to be more between battles, it would have worked a lot better. At least, until half way through just the first mission, becoming so powerful I could just sit still and then I could read all the chatter. <em>Seems they have some balancing to do as it does get quite easy.</em></p>
<p>Overall it feels like a really unique blend of ideas so give it a shot and see what you think in the demo.</p>

      <title>Catch bugs and fight both sides of the battles in Dicey Bugs - out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dicey Bugs is a cute looking roguelite bug-catching strategy game, it just released from ProdigalSon Games and has Linux / Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>A little different to other catching games, with you controlling both sides of the battles which is a little weird sounding at first. It's all about maximising what you want to achieve in each battle using your dice <em>and</em> your enemy dice, to grow your collection of bugs. The idea of putting them in little jars to capture them was a sweet touch I thought.</p>
<p>During the game you get to customize your team of recruited bugs along with what dice you take with you all in the name of gaining new abilities, chain attacks and more as you progress further to capture more elusive bugs.</p>
<p>Check out the release trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7_I42ZZbPe4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/aad19ac69aa1e4b5d2219ab44011f781.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7_I42ZZbPe4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's also a demo available. The latest update to the game and demo in August before release added Steam Deck support, with it already having a Native Linux version.</p>
<p>If you love creature collecting and want a different kind of challenge - this is it.</p>

      <title>Nanuka: Secret of the Shattering Moon looks great in the new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Inspired by the style of 90s animation, Nanuka: Secret of the Shattering Moon really does look great with the blend of action-platforming and some huge enemies.</p>
<p>The artwork going into this is really awesome, and some of the animations look really fun too, especially with what looks like some of the boss battles. Appears very much to be a platformer that will be well-worth picking up when it releases with Linux support (no current date yet though).

      <title>You have to try the demo for Berserker&#39;s Domain if you love boomer shooters</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Berserker's Domain seems like it's going to rock when it's released! A shooter inspired by Quake, Doom, ULTRAKILL, and Blood with a roguelike twist. The developer just recently put up a demo (works with Proton) and it's a bloody good time.</p>
<p>With some smooth fast-paced action and fun level design, along with the variety of upgrades and the roguelike loop to it with you picking your path — it has a fun blend and I think you're going to enjoy this one. I can definitely see the inspiration between ULTRAKILL and Doom on this one, not that it's a bad thing, it wears it with clear pride.</p>
<p>Check out the demo release trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="fsTMLO--MM4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0cd7398e664acd308f3a555fdbfae62e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/fsTMLO--MM4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights from Steam:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Run, dash, and double-jump around the battlefield at break-neck speed, tearing through swarms of cultists, demons, monsters, soldiers, sorcerers, and demigods.</li>
<li>Wield a brutal arsenal of nasty-ass weapons, each with a bunch of nonsense upgrades.</li>
<li>Unlock ultimate "synergy upgrades" that combine bonuses from different weapons. Want a Dynamite that explodes into shotgun pellets? Sure, why not.</li>
</ul>
<p>Press the Play button and you're shooting stuff in 5 seconds.</p>
<ul>
<li>No menus, no waiting for load screens, no tutorials. Just run the game and have fun.</li>
<li>Each death starts a new, randomized run with fresh maps, weapons, upgrades, and enemies. No two runs are ever the same.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Anti-cheat looks like a no-go on Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck for Arena Breakout: Infinite</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Arena Breakout: Infinite releases soon from Morefun Studios and sadly, this is yet another online multiplayer title that will not work on Linux / SteamOS.</p>
<p>It's going to be using Anti-Cheat Expert (ACE), which is one of the most annoying anti-cheat systems when it comes to supporting Linux. Multiple games as listed on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our dedicated anti-cheat page</a> use it and either only work on Steam Deck or don't work at all.</p>
<p>On their official FAQ post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2073620/view/496079294980686979" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>Does the game support Linux or Steam Deck?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> No, not at this time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doesn't get much clearer than that.</p>

      <title>THE FINALS gets a huge upgrade for Season 8, plus anti-cheat changes confirmed</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>THE FINALS is a popular online shooter which has the anti-cheat enabled for Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck and with Season 8 it has a lot new.</p>
<p>Currently, you'll need Proton Experimental to play it due to it having fixes for some crashes during matches. This and more is noted on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our dedicated anti-cheat page</a>. Changes are coming though. They've announced that they'll be moving forward with Denuvo Anti-Cheat (not Denuvo DRM) as their previous testing was a success. It will be an incremental rollout, so more systems will see it over time.</p>
<p>They've also "asked VAIIYA to build a solution for us, which is a complicated and time consuming effort" and on top of that they're also partnering with Anybrain and have "rolled out their solution to a small percentage of our playerbase as a test with plans to continue throughout Season 8".</p>
<p>As per their previous announcements we've covered on GamingOnLinux, they do plan to keep Linux compatibility going.</p>
<p>See the trailer for Season 8 below:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Some of what's new includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>New weapons.</li>
<li>An instant replay mode.</li>
<li>A new match recap.</li>
<li>Improved level destruction with knock-on effects.</li>
<li>New pre-made characters for new players to help ease people in.</li>
<li>Tutorial upgrades.</li>
<li>Faster game loading times.</li>
<li>Head2Head is now a permanent game mode.</li>
<li>And <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2073850/view/541115291253343131" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">lots more</a>.</li>

      <title>Steam Link VR for Meta Quest on Linux now appears to work in the latest updates</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you have a wireless VR headset and a Linux system, you might be excited to know that Valve's Steam Link VR now appears to actually work.</p>
<p>Valve haven't actually formally announced it yet, but with SteamVR Beta 2.13.2 you should be able to use Steam Link to connect up to your Linux PC to play games on Meta Quest headsets. This Steam Link VR feature originally launched for Windows back in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/3823053915991825336" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">November 2023</a>, so we've been waiting quite some time for this to arrive on Linux - where VR has historically not been great.</p>
<p>On Valve's GitHub page there's a <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/SteamVR-for-Linux/issues/655#issuecomment-3275863346" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">bug thread</a> with multiple confirmed reports of it working, although it's clearly still a work in progress with game support being limited as some don't work at all yet. Also keep in mind that Steam Flatpak is not a supported configuration for it, you'll need a proper Steam package installed.</p>
<p>Nice to see progress on it though, as eventually that will be another gap with Windows gaming closed off giving more people a chance to switch to Linux without losing access to streaming their VR games.</p>
<p>My Valve Index continues chugging along (much better since moving from NVIDIA to an AMD GPU), although perhaps I'll have to upgrade soon to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/new-valve-trademark-for-steam-frame-looks-like-were-getting-new-hardware/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's next VR kit or whatever the Steam Frame turns out to be</a>.</p>

      <title>Antivirus Survivors 2003 Professional is like an infested Windows XP as a survivor-like bullet hell</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Retro Windows style as a survivor-like action roguelite? Antivirus Survivors 2003 Professional is giving me hilarious nostalgia.</p>
<p>Releasing sometime in early 2026, it gets you to dive into your infested family computer to beat off viruses and malware with an "arsenal of nostalgic Y2K-inspired weapons". With a style that resembles the old Windows XP, it genuinely looks like a lot of fun — and you can even download more RAM!</p>
<p>From the Steam page: "In Antivirus Survivors 2003 Professional, dive headfirst into a corrupted file browser where rogue viruses run wild and your cursor fights back. Traverse through folders as you dodge obstacles, fight malware, and scramble around pop-ups. Consider a multitude of weapon combinations, search for XP and apply the rarest upgrades to create the best chance of survival against treacherous waves of danger."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="KKwJyf94v4U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0dc3c77535d7c4197ce561b4574a7ac6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/KKwJyf94v4U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Seems like the standard experience of Windows XP doesn't it? Hilarious.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fight back with nostalgic weapons including the Pinball, Firewall, C: Drive and many more</li>
<li>Navigate a corrupted file browser, jumping between infected folders and double-clicking suspicious programs but beware, some clicks bring chaos</li>
<li>Endure escalating waves of infected enemies and hold out long enough to avoid the blue screen of death</li>
<li>Immerse yourself in a vibrant Y2K-inspired aesthetic packed with charm and all the nostalgic vibes</li>
<li>Designed for big or small screens, keyboards or controllers. Play it your way!</li>
</ul>

      <title>The Spell Brigade is ending Native Linux support due to multiple issues</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You'll still be able to play The Spell Brigade with Valve's Proton, but the Native Linux version is no longer going to be supported or updated.</p>
<p>What is it? The Spell Brigade is an online co-op focused survivor-like (so like Vampire Survivors). You attempt to complete team-based objectives while unlocking upgrades to make overpowered spell synergies, it also has friendly-fire so no one is safe which makes it quite chaotic.</p>
<p>In the latest update posted on Steam under "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2904000/announcements/detail/500584162306031821" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">News for Linux Players</a>" they said they're ending support for the Native Linux version. Here's what they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re moving away from the native Linux build, but you can keep playing without interruption. All your progress will carry over to the Windows build under Proton, so you can continue where you left off and enjoy the latest updates.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">We’re making this change for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Persistent visual bugs on NVIDIA cards on Linux, which are resolved by switching to Proton</li>
<li>Technical changes to the game’s netcode that prevent full compatibility with a native Linux build</li>
<li>Certain Linux-specific bugs, such as issues with screen resolutions and refresh rates</li>
</ul>
<p>Native Linux build support will end with our next update on September 24th.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They're certainly not alone in facing these issues, I've seen a number of Unity game engine titles suffer from an increasing amount of problems lately. Seems Unity's Linux support isn't particularly great right now. Not all developers though, like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/wheel-world-adds-a-native-linux-version-for-steam-deck-with-a-significant-performance-improvement/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wheel World recently added a Native Linux version</a> mentioning better performance.</p>

      <title>No date yet for the Team Fortress 2 MvM update but Valve still working on it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Team Fortress 2 is still set for a nice upgrade to the Mann vs. Machine (MvM) game mode, with Valve providing a brief update on it.</p>
<p>Back in June, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/mann-vs-machine-is-getting-an-upgrade-in-team-fortress-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve put out a call for help</a> to the community to submit maps and missions to be added in, along with whatever else they have planned to improve it. They set a deadline there for August 27th, which came and went. In the latest official blog post, they noted work is going on through the submissions and other updates to TF2 are still planned.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=252400" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We wanted to thank everyone for all the Workshop submissions. You've given us tons (and we mean WAY more than we expected) of amazing stuff to look through and test.</p>
<p>We don't have a release date for the update yet, but we'll be going through the submissions and working on it. And for those of you interested in the usual seasonal updates? Yup. We're also still working on those.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gotta love that <em>Valve Time</em> right?</p>

      <title>NVIDIA driver 580.82.09 released for Linux - the latest recommended driver</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA released driver version <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/details/254273/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">580.82.09</a> which is the new recommended driver, although it only has a single fix but an important one for some users. This follows on from the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/nvidia-580-82-07-driver-released-for-linux-the-new-recommended-driver/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">580.82.07 driver</a> released on September 2nd which had a few more fixes.</p>
<p>The one-liner for this update is:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Updated the driver to fall back to 8 BPC when 10 BPC output is not supported for a particular mode. This prevents some HDMI displays from showing a black screen.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like that is quite an annoying issue, good to see it solved so people aren't pulling their hair out trying to figure out why their Linux system is giving a black screen.</p>
<p>Hopefully soon we'll actually finally see that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/nvidia-are-working-on-a-general-optimization-for-vkd3d-directx12-games-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VKD3D / DirectX12 game optimization</a> actually in a released driver, but it might still be a few months away as NVIDIA never give an actual roadmap or timings on anything. Unlike Mesa, which has a dedicated release schedule.</p>
<p>NVIDIA also released the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/details/254141/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">570.190</a> driver as well for the older series, which includes this one-liner:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Minor bug fixes and improvements.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Proton Experimental updated for Dune: Awakening, Tales Of Berseria, Arken Age and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Proton Experimental was updated for September 10th to bring more Windows game fixes to Linux Desktop, SteamOS and Steam Deck. </p>
<p>This will show up as an update in your Steam Downloads. Or, it will install automatically if Valve have it set by default for a game when you go to play it. Otherwise, search for Proton Experimental in your Steam Library to install it. </p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Listed in the update <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a> as now playable includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Arken Age</li>
<li>Ninja Reflex: Steamworks Edition</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">The other fixes and improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Proton Experimental regressions:
	<ul>
<li>Red Dead Redemption 2 should no longer hang on a black screen on certain setups</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed Tales Of Berseria crashing with certain paths used for the location of the Steam Library.</li>

<em>Pictured -  Tales Of Berseria</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">And to save you an extra click here's what was changed in Wine Mono 10.2.0:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Mono's handling of arrays with no defined size in native wrappers now treats them as having a size of 1, matching .NET Framework. This fixes a crash in some winforms applications when used with accessibility tools.</li>
<li>Fixed an assertion failure when using the undocumented "VtblGap" runtime feature. Terraria's multiplayer server encounters this.</li>
<li>Modified FNA's <code class="inline-code">Texture2D</code> class to be xml-serializable. This is used (but not really) by Meridian: New World. It attempts to serialize a class containing a null <code class="inline-code">Texture2D</code> field, but just having the field is enough to cause an error.</li>
<li>Implemented some <code class="inline-code">Microsoft.DirectX.DirectInput.Device</code> methods used by the Sega Rally launcher.</li>
<li>Technical
	<ul>
<li>Some warning fixes in WpfGfx to support newer llvm-mingw.</li>
<li>mono-basic has been merged into Framework Mono.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Upstream updates
	<ul>
<li>SDL to 3.2.20</li>
<li>FNA to 25.08, plus a few additional commits with fixes for Galactic Arms Race on NVidia GPUs and Ring Runner.</li>
<li>llvm-mingw to 20250709</li>

      <title>Digimon Story Time Stranger rated Steam Deck Playable / SteamOS Compatible ahead of release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Digimon Story Time Stranger is coming soon from Media.Vision Inc. and Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc. and it's now it has a Steam Deck and SteamOS rating.</p>
<p>Ahead of the release scheduled for October 2nd, Valve slapped the Steam Deck Playable (and SteamOS Compatible) rating onto it with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/proton-10-0-2d-beta-released-with-a-few-small-fixes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the latest Proton 10 Beta</a>. The only mark against it seems to be it sometimes showing the wrong keybinds (like keyboard instead of gamepad), which shouldn't be difficult for the developer to solve to get it bumped up to a green Verified tick.</p>
<p>One other note is that Valve say it needs an internet connection for the first-time setup.</p>

      <title>Airborne Empire an open-world city-building RPG gets a Linux / Steam Deck freezing fix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Airborne Empire is an interesting hybrid that mixes city-building, with open-world exploration and the latest update should fix it up on Linux / Steam Deck.</p>
<p>They launched a big upgrade for the game on September 1st, and they're continuing to clean up various bugs as a result of it. One bug caused the game to repeatedly freeze and hang on Linux systems (including SteamOS / Steam Deck), which should now be resolved with the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2438680/announcements/detail/509590727168100536" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">latest update</a>. They also mentioned the update has a few text fixes too. Nice to see direct support like this.</p>
<p>Currently the game is rated SteamOS Compatible / Steam Deck Playable with Proton. Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4gr6SS4JjNo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/92ddf54e9dd0c0cfacc59dece83decb7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4gr6SS4JjNo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More from the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>

They traverse a vast and rich open world full of new dangers, exotic wonders, and many hidden treasures. They must manage lift, balance, and propulsion needed for a flying city. Sky pirates can upend the city’s tranquility, and players must defend their inhabitants – and the kingdoms below! – from destructive attacks.

They’ll also gain access to better tools for defense – and offense – against the pirate threat; defense towers, cannons, and attack planes can be researched, upgraded, and augmented with the tools found by combing the world and unraveling its mysteries. With full systems for building upgrades, fires, sickness, injuries, light, morale, and augmentation relics, there is plenty of treasure to discover!</p>
<h4>Reforge a harmonious world</h4>
<p>If players can manage the challenges along this adventure, they’ll find themselves the leaders of a sprawling sky city, with enough prowess to defend against any incoming threats. It shall be the capital of a harmonious empire – the Airborne Empire of legend – reforged under their banners.</p>

      <title>The free unusual extreme speed shooter Ecto added Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ecto is a very fast-paced shooter playable in solo or online co-op up to 8 players, where you bunny hop around blasting robots with flower guns.</p>
<p>It sounds, and looks, rather bizarre. I'll be honest - I read the Steam page, watched the trailer and I still don't entirely know what the heck is going on here. Wild. From the Steam page: "Ecto is a highly-randomized nature world, featuring smooth, addictive movement. Jump around on colorful, nature-inspired floating islands with your friends or solo. Pick up trinkets, buy and upgrade stick guns, hang out with frogs and fight robots in the underworld."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<p>In the latest <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2256970/announcements/detail/510717261468663879" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> the developer revealed the new Native Linux version with a note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>LINUX SUPPORT!!! This was actually so painful to get working but I had to do it for the love of the game. If I see the word "libsteam_api.so" or "SteamAPI_Init" one more time I'm going to lose it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The update also has a bunch of other gameplay tweaks.</p>
<p>Ecto is currently in Early Access and the developer considers it "pre-alpha" level. Eventually, once it's finished, they do plan to attach a price to it. But for now, it's free while they build it up.</p>

      <title>Build a deck of powerful programs in the cyberpunk deckbuilder Into The Grid in November</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Into The Grid is a cyberpunk roguelike deckbuilder that looked very promising from the demo (that's still available to try), and now we have a release window for November.</p>
<p>At some point in October they plan to give us a <em>proper</em> date, but at least we know to mark our calendars for Into The Grid for sometime in November for the Early Access release now.</p>
<p>The what (from the developer): "Ever wondered what the love child of a Roguelike Deckbuilder and a Tabletop Boardgame would look like? Here’s the answer: Into The Grid features action-packed card battles and deeply tactical map exploration with resource management. We designed a unique dual-resource system where each card is played for its effect while simultaneously generating Virtual Memory (VIM), which allows the player to take advantage of even the most suboptimal hands. Use your VIM to activate your Commands during battle and obliterate your enemies’ defenses!"</p>
<p>The latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2576200/view/509590727168100325" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">developer update</a> mentions how they've reworked the exploration grid to provide a deeper experience, with it now being layered to provide clearer checkpoints at each layer, with each layer taking around 40 minutes to get through. The demo also received an update back in August, so it might be worth checking it out again.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Core Features</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Roguelike replayability</strong>: no two runs are the same.</li>
<li>Unique books with <strong>distinct personalities</strong>, innate abilities and spell lists.</li>
<li>Tactical grid combat fused with roguelike deckbuilding.</li>

</ul>
<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>A Roguelike Deckbuilder with Tactics at Its Core</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Choose 3 Books </strong>at the start of a run. Each book holds a unique set of cards and abilities themed to its content. From blood-soaked hooks and cleavers to cutting words from court jesters.</li>
<li><strong>Battle on a tactical grid</strong>, where positioning matters as much as the cards you play.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>The Dual-Component Card System</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify">Every card can be played in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Primary Effect</strong> - Utilise the card as a base spell. This will act as the base which can be empowered by any amount of secondary effects.</li>
<li><strong>Secondary Effect</strong> - Burn the card to empower a base spell. These can add modifiers, stat boosts or unique bonuses.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify">When combined with the tactics combat, this creates <strong>endless combo potential</strong>, but every decision matters. Cards used as secondaries are also discarded, so care must be taken when constructing the perfect turn.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Cleanse the Books, Expand Your Collection</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Each wing of the library is <strong>tied to a corrupted book.</strong></li>
<li>Defeat its boss to <strong>cleanse the book </strong>and permanently add it to your collection.</li>
<li>As your collection grows, so does your ability to craft varied starting decks.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Use a mind-controlled spork in Psycutlery, a wild free platformer with lots of gimmicks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a free game that you should try out. It's called Psycutlery, an action-platformer where you bring down an abomination of evil with a piece of silverware. I have to admit, the synopsis alone sold me on this one, and since it's free you'll only lose a bit of time trying out it and potentially find a game you love!</p>
<p>The what: "With an emphasis on variety through the constant introduction of new gimmicks and ways to play, Psycutlery is a game that prompts the question: 'what's next?!'. Take control of Lillian the Alien and her mind-controlled spork (that YOU can name). Grab things. Throw things. Eat things. Jump in mid-air up to five times! Bring down an incomprehensible abomination of evil with a single piece of silverware (plus around 30 different power-ups!), and witness copious craziness unfold across Planet Geozaic!"</p>
<p>Definitely sounds like one for fans of totally weird and wonderful indie gems. It looks retro, and for good reason, it was originally designed to be very much like a retro console game.</p>
<p>It starts slow and then just gets more and more interesting with all the different level mechanics you have to face. Have a look at the trailer below:</p>

<p>The developer also seems to be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3577630/view/524221084670628373" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">quite a big fan</a> of the Steam Deck. They also recommend you play with a controller on Desktop PCs too and you'll need Proton to run it on Linux.</p>

      <title>A tribute to classic 90s games and comic books, the RPG adventure Heroes of the Seven Islands is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Heroes of the Seven Islands is an intentionally badly drawn challenging tribute to classic role-playing video games and comic books.</p>
<p>The developer said the artwork for it was first hand-drawn on paper, scanned, then coloured and animated digitally. It certainly won't be for everyone, but I actually love the ridiculous art for this one — it's weirdly charming. Giving a sort-of cosy vibe to it.<em> I also just like highlighting weird stuff at times.</em></p>
<p>A non-linear adventure that blends point and click with RPG mechanics. More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>FURAX THE INDESTRUCTIBLE</strong>, fleshless carcass and soulless body, has arrived through an inter-dimensional rift in the colorful, carefree world of Émeyralia, to spread <strong>SADNESS</strong> and <strong>DESPAIR</strong>. Nothing seems to be able to stop him: his influence grows daily, many disciples join him and <strong>NIGHTMARE CREATURES</strong> appear on every continent.</p>
<p>According to the prophecy, only <strong>THE ORACLE</strong> could defeat him, but he retired centuries ago. To find him, the 7 keys held by the 7 rulers of the 7 islands of the Emerald Archipelago must be gathered. <strong>FOUR HEROES</strong>, the bravest of the brave, are chosen for this quest. The future of Emeyralia is in their hands.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Point-and-click exploration and gameplay</li>
<li>Turn-based yet fast combat system</li>
<li>Hundreds of (poorly) hand-drawn unique illustrations</li>
<li>Play the main quest or explore the open world and start side quests</li>
<li>Discover 7 biomes with villages, cities, dungeons, caves, forests and so on</li>
<li>Approximately 7-12 hours long on a first playthrough</li>
<li>Inspired by Might and Magic 3-8</li>
<li>Dungeon Synth Music</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The release arrived with Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Nintendo get another problematic patent in their fight against Palworld for summoning characters</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the ongoing Nintendo and Pokemon versus Palworld lawsuit, another patent has been found recently that's rather problematic for the whole gaming industry.</p>
<p>There's actually <em>two</em> recent patent approvals in the USA, but I'll focus on the main problem here. As spotted by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/last-week-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-received-a-u-s-patent-on-summoning-a-character-and-letting-it-fight-another/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">games fray</a>, the patent in question was approved in the USA on September 2nd, which focuses around summoning another character — something that a great many games do. It was originally filed in March 2023, with it only now being approved.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Reading through the patent the important bit it covers in plain English includes all these together:</p>
<ul>
<li>A PC, Console or similar device where the game is stored.</li>
<li>The ability to move your character in a virtual space.</li>
<li>Summoning a "sub character":
	<ul>
<li>That sub character can fight enemies either automatically or by your control.</li>
<li>That sub character being automatically controlled when not fighting enemies (so wandering around with you).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From creature collectors to RPGs and more, there's a <em>lot</em> of games that have this mechanic. Probably in the hundreds if not <em>thousands</em> at this point.</p>
<p>It doesn't mean Nintendo <em>will</em> actually go after a lot of games that use it, this is most notable due to their fight with Palworld in Japan, but it could open up any developer with a summoning mechanic to a legal spat with Nintendo in the USA. This is why such game mechanic patents are problematic, they can (and do) stifle competition.</p>

      <title>Steam update gives wider store pages, library sorting, desktop accessibility controls and lots more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest update for Steam Desktop and Steam Deck is out now bringing a lot of bug fixes, along with a bunch of fun new features for all platforms. Valve clearly continue leading the way here, with helpful additions to make the gaming experience even better.</p>
<p>Some of the big stuff includes: desktop accessibility settings, the ability to set a custom title for how games are sorted in your library, more upgrades to the new in-game overlay, Legion Go S Joystick LED controls under Settings-&gt;Customization for SteamOS, and more. Another big fix that applies to Big Picture Mode / SteamOS Gaming Mode, is where your position could be lost when navigating back from the app details - finally, navigating should be a lot less annoying. </p>
<p>This also brings the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/steam-is-getting-wider-and-more-responsive-store-pages/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wider store pages</a> now to everyone in the Steam Client, although it's still not on the web in your browser just yet.</p>
<p>Going through the changelogs here's what's specific to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/529856925490219191" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Deck</a> / SteamOS:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Updated the featured app in the recent games carousel to use the new larger format Library Header image when available.</li>
<li>Improved performance profile switching time.</li>
<li>Improved startup performance for users with large libraries that include non-Steam games.</li>
<li>Fixed the Game Text Entry screen staying up if you exit the game via the overlay while it is being displayed</li>
<li>Fixed a steam crash/UI restart when the SteamOS Manager service restarts.</li>
<li>Fixed the overlay menu failing to scroll when selecting alternative game windows.</li>
<li>Fixed sort titles not being restored to the correct title on clear for games that already have a sort title set in their app info.</li>
<li>Fixed logo images sometimes flashing at the wrong position for games that have custom logo positions set.</li>
<li>Fixed a failure to enable bluetooth via Settings-&gt;Bluetooth if it was previously disabled in Desktop Mode.</li>
<li>Fixed a case where per-game performance profiles would fail to activate.</li>
<li>Desktop Mode: Fixed scaling of on-screen keyboard when accessibility display scaling is enabled.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And also the full <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/500583527919651039" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Desktop</a> changelog is below:</p>
<blockquote><strong>Accessibility</strong>
<ul>
<li>Added an accessibility settings menu to desktop mode. It includes features such as:
	<ul>
<li>High Contrast mode,</li>
<li>Reduced motion settings,</li>
<li>UI Scale controls.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added accessibility annotations to many UI components.</li>
</ul>
<strong>In-Game Overlay</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed fonts and UI in the overlay being somewhat fuzzy, aligned unevenly, or appearing over anti-aliased for users with Display Scale (DPI) &gt; 100%.</li>
<li>Implement DPI scaling of Performance Monitor display (if you have &gt; 100% display scale, your size will change on update and you may need to adjust it again, this should be a one time inconvenience).</li>
<li>Fixed a case where DLSS vs game FPS numbers could be incorrect in some games loading DLSS modules.</li>
<li>Fixed some cases where numeric labels in the Performance Monitor display could cut off their last digit when drawing.</li>
<li>Fixed Performance Monitor hot-key changes while in-game not immediately taking effect.</li>
<li>Performance improvement for Vulkan overlay rendering (most obvious when Performance Monitor FPS chart rendering).</li>
<li>Performance improvement for Open GL overlay rendering in games using the Open GL shader pipeline (again most obvious when Performance Monitor FPS chart rendering, this fix doesn't impact old games using the Open GL fixed function pipeline).</li>
<li>Performance monitor and general overlay rendering performance significantly improved in some D3D12 titles that are at times CPU bound and use high async rendering.</li>
<li>Fixed Performance Monitor rendering on macOS if certain fonts are not available.</li>
<li>Performance monitor FPS numbers improved to not overcount by 1 frame in certain vsync or frame rate capped scenarios.</li>
<li>Performance Monitor now supports CPU temperature on Windows and Linux, on Windows this requires a kernel mode driver, and there is an option to disable if you don't want that. The driver is only installed and running when Performance Monitor is visible at full CPU detail levels and only if you don't disable the driver in the In-Game settings.</li>
<li>Adjusted Performance Monitor GPU Utilization measurement on Windows+NVIDIA GPUs to closer match some other tools. This will again shift the number to match task manager less, but match some other tools measurements more closely. The percentage you see will not change in many games, but may now show higher utilization in some games. <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/3462-CD4C-36BD-5767" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">See our Performance Monitor FAQ for more info on how we measure.</a></li>

      <title>Wheel World adds a Native Linux version for Steam Deck with a &#34;significant performance improvement&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wheel World from Messhof and Annapurna Interactive released back in July to some great reviews, and now it should be even better with the latest update.</p>
<p>What is it? A chilled-out, open world biking adventure. From the Steam page: "You are Kat, a young cyclist with one mission: save Wheel World from total collapse.

<p>The third post-launch patch has just arrived, and something we don't see too often now is the developer worked on and released a Native Linux version. They said for the Steam Deck it "provides a significant performance improvement" and to swap over to it if you were previously using Proton to play the Windows version which is the default. Valve even rated it Steam Deck Verified with Proton, so hopefully this Native Linux version really is even better as they describe.</p>
<p>A bunch of other improvements also came with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1497460/view/524227425953909063" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the update</a> including a photo mode and a bunch of bug fixes.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Race and Dominate</strong>: Take on elite cycling teams and quirky rivals in high-stakes races where every second counts.</li>
<li><strong>Upgrade Your Ride</strong>: Scour the world for rare parts to build the ultimate bike, perfectly tailored to your style.</li>
<li><strong>Carry Out Your Destiny</strong>: Recover your stolen Legendary parts to ultimately perform The Great Shift ritual and save the world. No big deal.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Check out the fantasy comedy point and click adventure Broken Relic</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fans of classic point and click adventures will want to check out Broken Relic, a fully voiced fantasy comedy adventure from a solo developer. It's a passion project from Pablo Morales, also known as Sandpenguin, a professional game designer currently at King (previously Ubisoft and Rebellion).</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You play as <strong>Tim</strong>, an overeager library intern who breaks an age-old wax seal and frees <strong>Kaelvorn, the Cursed Devourer</strong>. Armed only with wit and questionable advice from his mentor, Tim must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore ruined coliseums, forgotten cathedrals and an underworld ruled by creepy monsters.</li>
<li>Reunite <strong>three shattered shards</strong> of a legendary seal, the only thing able to bind Kaelvorn once more!</li>
<li>And basically save the world.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="saH9diPrHMg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/eb4e62b9c93c98d1eeb45d3cbb4d618a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/saH9diPrHMg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer notes that the puzzles will reward your observation skills so expect inventory combos, environment tricks and dialogue clues (no random guessing). With hand-crafted pixel art at they explained as "320×240 backdrops inspired by early-90s adventures, rendered in modern palettes".</p>
<p>Currently, the Native Linux demo is only on <a href="https://sandpenguin.itch.io/broken-relic-final-demo" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">itch.io</a>. It's crowdfunding on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/broken-relic/broken-relic" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> where they're hoping to raise at least £10,000 and they have until October 9th to hit the initial goal to release in 2026.</p>

      <title>The first Hollow Knight: Silksong patch arrives next week - here&#39;s what&#39;s in it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is clearly a smash-hit, reaching an incredible player milestone quickly after release and Team Cherry are readying a first update.</p>
<p>The game managed to hit an all-time high of 587,150 concurrent players only 2 days after release (<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1030300/charts/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>). Also fun to see is that the original Hollow Knight also hit an all-time high of 95,655 concurrent players on September 7th, years after the release. So the hype and clear success of Silksong is no doubt causing a sales surge still for the original.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10897090831757433965gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>As for the upcoming Silksong patch, it's currently in a public Beta you can try. Here's the current details on what's in it for the patch release next week (sometime midweek according to <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/595159519774039622/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">their post</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Fixed situation where players could remain cloakless after Slab escape sequence.<br/>
- Fixed wish Infestation Operation often not being completable during the late game.<br/>
- Fixed wish Beast in the Bells not being completable when Bell Beast is summoned at the Bilewater Bellway during the late game.<br/>
- Fixed getting stuck floating after down-bouncing on certain projectiles.<br/>
- Fixed courier deliveries sometimes being inaccessible in the late game.<br/>
- Fixed craft bind behaving incorrectly when in memories.<br/>
- Fixed Lace tool deflect soft-lock at start of battle in Deep Docks.<br/>
- Fixed Silk Snippers in Chapel of the Reaper sometimes getting stuck out of bounds.<br/>
- Fixed Claw Mirrors leaving Hornet inverted if taking damage during a specific moment while binding.<br/>
- Fixed Snitch Pick not giving rosaries and shell shards as intended.<br/>
- Removed float override input (down + jump, after player has Faydown Cloak).<br/>
- Slight difficulty reduction in early game bosses Moorwing and Sister Splinter.<br/>
- Reduction in damage from Sandcarvers.<br/>
- Slight increase in pea pod collider scale.<br/>
- Slight reduction in mid-game Bellway and Bell Bench prices.<br/>
- Slight increase in rosary rewards from relics and psalm cylinders.<br/>
- Increase in rosary rewards for courier deliveries.<br/>
- Various additional fixes and tweaks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They've confirmed a second patch is already in progress with more fixes. Hopefully some controller improvements for the Linux version will come with it, which has been a bit problematic for some players.</p>
<p>For those of you diving into it - do share your experiences with Hollow Knight: Silksong in the comments. </p>

      <title>Turn everything into a weapon in Rogue Labyrinth a new action-narrative roguelite</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rogue Labyrinth is a new action-narrative roguelite from Tea Witch Games that gives you the ability to turn everything on the map into a weapon. Trees, rocks, other enemies - check, all can be flung across the map. </p>
<p>In Rogue Labyrinth, you take control of Iris, a sarcastic punk swept into a deadly reality show where ratings matter more than survival. Constructed by the egocentric mogul Echelon, the colossal Labyrinth turns combat into spectacle and contestants into entertainment fodder. Armed with a massive smacking stick and biting wit, Iris must battle through randomized arenas, forge strange alliances, and discover the secrets of Lantanas — all while everything around them, from rocks to rival contestants, can become a weapon.</p>
<p>It recently launched with Native Linux support, and it's also now Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3rxSDObyyhc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/58cec6e2a2bf15ef74cfcd9fffd4caf0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3rxSDObyyhc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Since it's a roguelite, replayability is the core of it. Blending together fast-paced action with "dynamic narrative systems" that gives you opportunities to grow stronger. It's not all about the battles though, as there's various silly mini-games in between giving you a little break from the chaos.</p>
<p>Game Highlights (from Steam):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Countries Have Come:</strong> The Labyrinth shifts and changes every run, with different choices generating new and exciting maps. Roguelite levels are split into 4 biomes with 100s of different rooms you can encounter throughout your run, each based on the countries participating. You're not only fighting against the labyrinth, but other rivals who all have their own reasons for being there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make Everything a Projectile:</strong> There are multiple weapons and forms to choose from and builds to gain in each run, made different every time through given upgrades and choices. You can hit everything across the map like trees, rocks, other enemies, projectiles, and so on. It feels like a "controlled-bullet hell" which is unique and fun!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fight Your Way:</strong> Bash with your branch, throw thornballs, or use rival abilities like pulsing pillars, spiky bubbles, spinning boomerangs, and more!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Play Politics:</strong> Make friends (or enemies) with rivals, employees, &amp; monsters in-between fighting in the labyrinth to upgrade your abilities. Learn their battle techniques or maybe invite them to dinner?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Attract the Audience:</strong> The more enemies you defeat, the higher your fan fame meter gets. Once the fans are hyped, they’ll watch you battle and may reward you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Benefactor Boons:</strong> Rich folks from around the world are betting on their favorites to win. Use their boons to enhance your abilities and make them look good!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fishing Minigame:</strong> Because ALL good games have a fishing minigame…</p>
</li>
<li><strong>100+ unique abilities</strong></li>
</ul>

      <title>The Boglands DLC and free update for Halls of Torment land October 28</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The million+ seller Halls of Torment from Chasing Carrots is set for a sweet free update and content-filled DLC on October 28th.</p>
<p>But first, to address the comments on the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/the-excellent-survivor-like-halls-of-torment-is-getting-a-big-dlc-and-free-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previous article</a> where I incorrectly called it an "auto-battler". You are of course right, it's <em>not</em> an auto-battler, it's <em>clearly</em> a survivor-like bullet heaven one or two stick horde survival shooter roguelite. Did I get that right? <strong>Perfect</strong>.</p>
<p>Since we actually have a date for it all now all players can look forward to a new character, new abilities, new end-game content, new music tracks and a manual level-up system. For the DLC you'll get a new stage, two new characters, 50+ new quests, new abilities and gear, new game mechanics and much more.</p>
<p>Anyway here's The Boglands DLC trailer again if you missed it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CwsyoVTyT7g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6359789f1862db929a9f91c36e7c48ba.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CwsyoVTyT7g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Might have to take an entire week off when the update and DLC release. Fantastic game that blends Diablo style with Vampire Survivors-like gameplay mechanics.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>Valheim has been upgraded with the Call to Arms update bringing in new content along with entirely new gameplay mechanics, while we all wait for a new biome.</p>
<p>The new Trinkets system sounds interesting, giving you a new item to wear that grants temporary adrenaline during battle giving you all new perks. You will only gain adrenaline while you have a Trinket equipped and once it's full during combat, you'll get an adrenaline surge giving you whatever perk comes with your selected Trinket. Wooden weapons sound fun too, giving you a way to practice the combat with friends. </p>
<p>You're gonna need that little bit of help too, as there's some new creatures to fight in the update as well. Check out the trailer for it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ikMCSydI0-E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6829131651c4e4d9c67e45cf87888399.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ikMCSydI0-E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The main non-spoilery highlights include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Forsaken Powers rebalanced.</li>

</ul>

      <title>SnowRunner should look a little better on Steam Deck with the new update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The excellent driving sim SnowRunner was already pretty great on Steam Deck but the latest update should make it just that little bit better.</p>
<p>Sounds like it's time to get a truck stuck somewhere again for a while. I'm truly rubbish at it, but the challenge is one that's surprisingly good to keep you involved and wanting more.</p>
<p>With the Season 16 DLC out now they've given players 3 new "massive" maps along with 3 new trucks to master with a whole bunch of new add-ons and trailers. There's also a healthy injection of bug fixes to: vehicles, co-op play and the mod browser. Plus steering wheel improvements and for Steam Deck players specifically, there's also a note that they "Improved UI for Steam Deck version" which is great to see.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer for Season 16 below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Krbye_T9pI0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ed22e4c07a2b07ba702b022952cd5191.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Krbye_T9pI0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>At time of writing it's rated Steam Deck Verified by Valve with Proton 9. ProtonDB also gives it an overall Platinum rating from the community.</p>
<p>Don't have it yet? It's currently 50% off across most PC stores.</p>

      <title>Sci-fi adventure Ultrasound will bring a different kind of body horror</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A different kind of body horror as you diagnose bizarre malformations all over a spaceship, Ultrasound is a grim (but great) looking point and click adventure. No release date is being given for it yet other than 2026, but they've said that a demo will arrive to try it out later this year.</p>
<p>Set aboard a long haul space freighter hurtling towards a star, Ultrasound sees players step into the shoes of Medical Officer Dana Voss, as she diagnoses and performs surgical procedures upon a grotesque alien infection which is rapidly spreading aboard the ship.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FrCsJHPbyEE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6dc71caec4df86691456c5ccf11dea7c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FrCsJHPbyEE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Ultrasound is being developed by two new fathers - Walter Woods (Lead Developer) and Jason Scalfano (Lead Artist) - and is inspired by their respective tragic and joyful paths to parenthood. "So many of us know the hope and horror of the ultrasound machine. The mystery. The ambiguity. The flickering image of life and death." said Walter Woods. "We hope our game captures these difficult feelings and resonates with players."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>A MYSTERIOUS INFECTION IS SPREADING</strong> aboard a long haul space freighter. As Medical Officer Dana Voss, you must diagnose and perform surgical procedures on ship systems. Restore functionality before your collision course with a star comes to cosmic end.</li>
<li><strong>USE A PORTABLE ULTRASOUND MACHINE</strong> to discover and diagnose bizarre malformations that hide within your ship.</li>
<li><strong>PERFORM SURGERY</strong> to repair infected systems in tense and gruesome procedures that will test your skills.</li>
<li><strong>MAINTAIN UNIQUE SHIP SYSTEMS </strong>such as life support, power, cargo manifests, and more. The failure of each system has drastic effects on your play experience, forcing you to adapt and manage resources effectively.</li>
<li><strong>CRAFT STRANGE MEDICINES</strong> to heal and eradicate foreign growths. Navigate the risks, rewards, and unexpected effects of your creations.</li>
<li><strong>MULTIPLE ENDINGS</strong> and high variety in each playthrough. Discover hidden secrets and new dimensions of the story each time.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Tic Tactic arrives September 18 turning tic-tac-toe / noughts and crosses into a deck-building roguelike</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Turning noughts and crosses into a deck-building roguelike isn't something I wasn't expecting, but it's real and Tic Tactic releases on September 18th. There's a demo available on Steam right now too that should run fine with Proton on Linux.</p>
<p>Tic Tactic transforms the classic childhood game into a high-stakes roguelike. Players face off in turn-based battles, using a tic-tac-toe board to deal damage by creating combos. Every move counts as the board doesn’t clear, meaning mistakes linger and opportunities stack. Each run introduces new enemies, environments, and narrative discoveries as players push further into the mystery of what happened at the Duck Pond.</p>
<p>A deck-builder too as you get to place down over two dozen unique tiles, adding another layer to the classic game. These tiles give abilities ranging from board-wiping moves to precision strikes on the enemy.</p>
<p>Seems like another unique little indie game that might be worth a bunch of your hours. Release date trailer is below:</p>

      <title>Microsoft&#39;s 6502 BASIC is now officially open source</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some fun computing history for you here as Microsoft recently open sourced Microsoft 6502 BASIC under the MIT license.</p>
<p>While there have been versions of it floating around for a long time, Microsoft decided just to play nice and make it official and give it out to everyone. Back in 2024, they <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/microsoft-open-sources-ms-dos-40/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">also open sourced MS-DOS 4.0</a>. This is perhaps even more important though for computing history, with it being Microsoft's first official product and served as the foundation for the modern software industry.</p>
<p>From their <a href="https://opensource.microsoft.com/blog/2025/09/03/microsoft-open-source-historic-6502-basic/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> going over the background of it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is <strong>BASIC M6502 8K VER 1.1</strong>, the 6502 BASIC lineage that powered an era of home computing and formed the foundation of <strong>Commodore BASIC</strong> in the PET, VIC-20, and the legendary Commodore 64. This very source tree also contains adaptations for the <strong>Apple II</strong> (“Applesoft BASIC”), built from the same core BASIC source. The original headers still read, <strong>“BASIC M6502 8K VER 1.1 BY MICRO-SOFT”</strong>—a time capsule from 1978.</p>
<p>The version we are releasing here—labeled “1.1”—contains fixes to the garbage collector identified by Commodore and jointly implemented in 1978 by Commodore engineer John Feagans and Bill Gates, when Feagans traveled to Microsoft’s Bellevue offices. This is the version that shipped as the PET’s “BASIC V2.” It even contains a playful Bill Gates Easter egg, hidden in the labels STORDO and STORD0, which Gates <a href="https://www.pagetable.com/?p=43#comment-1033" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">himself confirmed in 2010</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And a snippet from the GitHub on why it's historically important:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. Foundation of the Personal Computer Revolution</p>
<ul>
<li>This BASIC interpreter was the software foundation that powered many of the most influential early personal computers.</li>
<li>It democratized programming by making it accessible to non-technical users through a simple, English-like programming language.</li>
<li>Without this software, the personal computer revolution might have developed very differently.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/BASIC-M6502" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. And see the Microsoft <a href="https://opensource.microsoft.com/blog/2025/09/03/microsoft-open-source-historic-6502-basic/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> for more background.</p>
<p>Pretty cool to see it official like this.</p>

      <title>Squad got a big upgrade with the 9.0 update, as the devs address Linux compatibility</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Squad from Offworld recently released the 9.0 upgrade bumping it up to Unreal Engine 5, which came with some issues but it should be working well again.</p>
<p>Overall it was a huge update for the popular online shooter, one of the few with anti-cheat that actually do try to keep it compatible with Linux / SteamOS. It features a new Commendation System, a big remake to the Al Basrah map, a new lighting system for all maps, new weapons and equipment were added, a new physics system and so much more.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it initially rolled out with the Easy Anti-Cheat broken on Linux. This has since been fixed, and they've addressed Linux compatibility in a new official <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/squad/announcements/detail/498331728096528214" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Squad doesn’t have a native Linux build, but can be played through Proton. The challenge with Proton is anti-cheat. EAC has Linux support, and we do our best to integrate the latest updates as needed. Sometimes, we miss a step there as we don’t usually test on Linux clients, so we appreciate the Linux gaming community reporting any issues. The best place to provide feedback and bug reports is on the Squad Community Discord. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's great to see at least this level of effort, while so many just block Linux like GTA Online and Apex Legends. See more on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our dedicated anti-cheat page</a>.</p>
<p>The update trailer is below:</p>

      <title>Tusk Force is the next major update to War Thunder featuring the first Ukrainian-made tank</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>War Thunder is heating up again with the new Tusk Force update coming soon that features War Thunder's first Ukrainian-made tank, along many other additions.</p>
<p>The Tusk Force update will bring a brand-new subtree of Thai ground vehicles (within the Japanese tech tree), the American battleship USS Maryland, the British Sky Sabre SAM system, the Russian Buk-M3 SAM system, and the Canadian CF-188A fighter jet. As for the first Ukrainian made tank, from the press release about the details in the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Oplot-T tank is <em>War Thunder</em>’s first Ukrainian-made tank. A modification of the T-80UD main battle tank built for the Royal Thai army, these vehicles saw combat during the brief 2025 border clash with Cambodia. The Oplot-T sports reactive armor, a Laser Warning Receiver (LWR), and an optronic countermeasures system. Thanks to its upgraded transmission, it can reverse at up to 30 km/h, allowing it to quickly fall back to cover. In addition to ammunition typical for the USSR tech tree, the Oplot is armed with Chinese-made ammo like the GP125 ATGMs and the new top-end BTA4 APFSDS round - capable of penetrating over half a meter of armor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the update trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="L93Bfc0fk-o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/911b81244a63740d64c9c09c27633900.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/L93Bfc0fk-o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release it should launch sometime in "mid-September".</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support, although it is missing some graphics features it mostly works well. I have a lot of hours in this one. I think the only thing that annoys me is how terrible the spectator camera is when playing with friends. Apart from that I really enjoy the action in it.</p>
<p>The game uses BattlEye which is enabled for Linux platforms. See more on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our dedicated anti-cheat page</a>.</p>
