      <title>Party-based soulslike Deathbound aims to be Steam Deck Verified at release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Trialforge Studio and Tate Multimedia are bringing their party-based soulslike set in a harsh world where Faith clashes with Science to Steam on August 8th and it should be good to go for Steam Deck players. Which is good news for desktop Linux players too since both will use <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> so it should work great.</p>
<p>Not to be confused with an online party here, instead you gain the skills and identities of fallen warriors found throughout the world. This gives you the option to seamlessly switch between all of them while you craft a play-style through the talent trees available. Sounds pretty fun!</p>
<p>Friday last week the developers posted an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1277130/announcements/detail/4334235468138941634" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have good news for all Akratya citizens! Deathbound is playable on Steam Deck, and we aim to receive the Deck Verified status on release day. Right now, all Fallen Warriors can play the Deathbound demo on Steam Deck, and it’s fully compatible with Valve’s handheld device.</p>
<p>We tested Deathbound on Steam Deck and were consistently satisfied with the results— the game runs smoothly, and we did not encounter any major bugs on this platform. Similar feedback was received from many members of our community who had the opportunity to play Deathbound on this device.</p>
<p>Therefore, we are aiming for Deathbound to receive Verified Game status on Steam Deck on the release date, which is scheduled for August 8th.</p>

      <title>Immersive idle RPG &#39;Bloobs Adventure&#39; recently got lots of Steam Deck improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bloobs Adventure is an idle game with a difference, bringing together adventuring and RPG styled mechanics into a more casual game. Idle games don't often have you do all that much, which is why Bloobs Adventure is a little bit more interesting with a whole world to explore.</p>
<p>More about it: "Watch on as you command your Bloob to seamlessly navigate his way around a sprawling, ever-expanding world automatically. Choose which skills to train, items to create, and enemies to defeat. Push your and your Bloob's skills farther, and become the most powerful force in the the world. Forge your own path, and your own equipment on your way to conquer every boss that stands in your way. Do it on your time, because after all, Bloob will do the hard work for you."</p>
<p>You can check out the slightly chaotic trailer below:</p>

<p>It launched on Steam on July 15th, and has already gained a Very Positive rating and has hundreds of players checking it out right now. At the end of last week, the developer also put up a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2942780/announcements/detail/6957581711060460996" rel="noopener" target="_blank">big update</a> that fixed up numerous issues with people playing it on Steam Deck. Just some of the improvements include:</p>

      <title>Developing a Video Game with Unreal Engine 5 on Linux</title>
      <author>Vasilis</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In November 2022, we started a side project in my company, a video game called Cuprum 2929. Because I love Linux (being a full user since 2009) and I'm the owner of the company, I made the bold decision to fully develop it on Linux. While this is largely true, I have to put a disclaimer now that we are not building everything on the Linux OS, but about 95%, which is still impressive in my opinion.</p>
<p>In the article below, I'll discuss in detail our choices, our setup, how we helped some parts of the ecosystem support Linux better, and why some work couldn't be done on Linux. I'm also going to share some tips and tricks that I discovered myself to make the experience better and unlock some features that may not be available on the UE Linux build, and how we get the most out of it.</p>
<h2>Setting up Unreal Engine</h2>
<p>As is the case for a lot of things on a Linux OS, there are multiple ways to do this. If you are committed to developing your video game on Linux, I'm going to suggest the best thing that worked for us so far. If you want to experiment yourself, you can follow the <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/linux-development-quickstart-for-unreal-engine" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>unreal engine guide</u></a>, which would be redundant to repeat here.</p>
<p>After we tried a few ways, the best flow for us (which is going to make more and more sense the more you progress in this article) is to build our own Unreal Engine fork. To get access to the Unreal Engine source code, as described in the previously linked guide, you can also fork it.<br/>
<br/>
Because the Unreal Engine project is huge in size, we only have a copy of the latest commit (git clone --depth=1 ) . But why go to all that effort?</p>
<p>Later on, you'll see that we make changes to the code, build plugins that are not available for Linux in the Unreal Engine store, and we have a synchronised way of all of us using the same engine with the same plugins available.</p>
<p>The process to build UE from source is not different when you have your own fork and it's already provided by Epic Games <a href="https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/blob/release/Engine/Build/BatchFiles/Linux/README.md" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a> .</p>
<h2>Using Third Party Plugins</h2>
<h3>Live Link</h3>
<p>We found ourselves early on experimenting with cutscenes/cinematics in our project. A key part was making character dialogs realistic, so we tried using LiveLink. This was in May 2023, and we found out that a lot of the plugins were not available in the Linux build. After a short dig through the code, we found out that you could try to enable those plugins through some configuration and rebuild the engine.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18868024571721650161gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18868024571721650161gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>It worked without issues, and all the code was compiling! We also created a proof of concept with a cutscene using Metahumans and Quixel Bridge. Later on, these plugins became available by default on Linux, so now you don't have to change anything.</p>
<p>We then committed the code to our fork and rolled it out to all three of our developers.</p>
<h4>Quixel Bridge</h4>
<p>Quixel Bridge is available when you build UE from source. However, it wasn't available when we used any of the provided pre-made binaries. Now, it seems to be available, but it may not always be for the latest release.</p>
<h3>Smartsuit</h3>
<p>In the winter of 2023, we acquired the Rokoko Smartsuit and gloves. It's a suit with sensors that allows you to create animations quickly by wearing the suit and gloves. We acquired it knowing that Linux was not supported, but we wanted to make it so, just for the fun of it (and because I may have anger management issues when they tell me something doesn't work on Linux, but just maybe!).</p>
<p>The first issue was that Rokoko Studio, the software that you interface with to use the suit and create animations, despite working with Wine, wouldn't recognize the hardware for the initial pairing (connected via USB). I spent 3-4 days tinkering with the Wine source code, but it seemed it needed a lot of work.</p>
<p>Luckily, we had acquired a Mac because of the needs of another project, where a certain video game educational studio would not work consistently on Linux. We then did the initial pairing through the Macbook (the rest of the connection works wirelessly). So how it worked is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the suit and gloves connected through the USB (one by one).</li>
<li>Set the IP of the Studio to be on the Linux machine (running under Wine).</li>
<li>Have a static LAN IP for the Linux machine so you won't have to repeat this pairing all the time.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>All of the other features of Rokoko Studio work flawlessly on Linux.</p>
<p>We then found ourselves with another problem. The Rokoko Smartsuit plugin was not available for Linux. We <a href="https://github.com/Rokoko/rokoko-studio-live-unreal-engine/pull/55" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>provided a PR</u></a> that was kindly merged, with all the changes needed to make it buildable and usable on Linux (along with some bug fixes). Since then, our integration works flawlessly.</p>
<h2>Cross Platform Collaboration</h2>
<p>Since building a video game is a task that involves multiple disciplines and managing often short-term needs (like doing some technical animation or some special programming), we need the services of short-term contractors. We thus cannot expect every contractor to use the same setup as we do.</p>
<p>To collaborate, we need to ensure that we are using the same release version of Unreal Engine (to the patch level). It then doesn't matter if ours has some extra changes that do not affect the core of it.</p>
<p>When you open a project that was done on a different platform, you'll get a message to convert or skip conversion. Convert in place works (<strong>please have a version control system in place before you do that</strong>).</p>
<h3>Version control system (VCS)</h3>
<p>We use Git for VCS, with LFS. Basically, all the files apart from any C++ source files and configs go to Git LFS. That includes textures, sounds, maps, blueprints, and literally everything that's not a text file. We identified very early on that using Git LFS would be a problem. We used GitLab, which provides an LFS backend with a 10GB limit, and we had to do a lot of careful work to not exceed that limit.</p>
<p>As the work progressed, we needed to find another solution. One of our engineers took the initiative to create a setup that would be cheap and easy to use, while still using GitLab. His work is summarized in <a href="https://www.vaslabs.io/post/migrating-from-gitlab-lfs-to-s3-to-save-money" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>this article</u></a>, and we <a href="https://github.com/vaslabs-ltd/git-s3-lfs" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>open-sourced a Terraform module</u></a> that helps with the setup.</p>
<p>This, of course, is not a Linux-specific problem, but I'd like to emphasize how committed we are to helping both ourselves and the community. The setup with S3 costs us about 0.20 EUR per month, effectively nothing.</p>
<h2>Building Projects from Source</h2>
<p>It's come to our attention that writing C++ is somewhat problematic. Now, I'm not 100% sure if this is due to our setup or not. Basically, it seems that the generated Makefile is missing a few targets to be operational. I'm going to describe how we are fixing that, using a starter project called Lyra, which is available through the <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/paths/Z4/lyra-starter-game" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>Epic Games store</u></a>. Note that the most efficient way we found to download content from the store on Linux is the <a href="https://github.com/AchetaGames/Epic-Asset-Manager" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>Epic Asset Manager</u></a>.</p>
<p>When you download and open the project, you are going to get a version warning; you can select convert in place. Then, in our case, there is an error that the source code cannot be compiled.</p>
<p>If you open your terminal and run make, you'll get an error that some targets are missing. This is an issue we have when we are working on other video games as well. The way we fix it for now is with trial and error, using the Makefile from Unreal Engine as a guide. We are planning, though, to find the root cause and, if necessary, send a PR to get it fixed.</p>
<h2>Our progress</h2>
<p>Finally, I want to share our progress to give you an idea of the ecosystem state for developing a video game on Linux as well. So far, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigation menus, sound effects, and visual effects (using Niagara)</li>
<li>Imported customized Metahumans, with all the features working</li>
<li>Short cutscenes, animated from the Smartsuit and edited inside Unreal Engine</li>
<li>A rich collection of 3D assets, created in Blender3D and imported successfully into our project</li>
<li>AI behavior for some of our levels</li>
</ul>
<p>You can follow our progress on our <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2660240/CUPRUM2929/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>Steam Page</u></a>. As I am writing this, we are also creating a Discord server; unfortunately, it is not ready yet to make public. Look for us in Steam October Fest, where we'll be releasing a demo and broadcasting our gameplay!</p>

      <title>Open-ended physics building-puzzler Captain Contraption&#39;s Chocolate Factory is out now with a demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Build various contraptions in an almost Zachtronics-like automation puzzle game, Captain Contraption's Chocolate Factory is quite reasonably priced and is available now with a demo you can try too. It has Native Linux support too.</p>
<p>It's an open-ended puzzle game where you get to design and build your own Rube Goldberg styled crazy machines to combine ingredients to make <em>chocolates</em>. Automate your production using simple components to create ingenious contraptions, which are as satisfying to watch as they are to optimise. Once it gets going, and you see all the moving parts, it is quite something. A little Opus Magnum and World of Goo combined perhaps.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CkYecZ_V3Uo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/543cf9a4375d34129108e5c6a93b6956.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CkYecZ_V3Uo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It even includes an easy to use level editor, the same they use to build the game so you can create your own challenges. With Steam Workshop support, you can put your creations online and play those of others too. They even have leaderboards to compete against others on them too.</p>
<p>For £8.50 you can't really go wrong with it if you like designing machines and automation.</p>

      <title>Oxygen Not Included: The Frosty Planet Pack is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oxygen Not Included has a new expansion out with The Frosty Planet Pack, which seems like a chill way to blow through another few hundred hours. Perhaps not quite as big as the Spaced Out! expansion, but still sounds like a lot of good stuff has been added into the game to give you some new ways to play it.</p>
<p>Great to see Klei Entertainment still updating one of my favourites. I'm going to have to stay away, or I really won't get anything done. Anyway, here's the highlights of what you get with it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A brand-new icy starting world.</li>
<li>New critters: Flouncy Floxes! Behemoth Bammoths! Sweet-toothed Spigot Seals!</li>
<li>Three new biomes: Ice Cave, Cool Pool and Nectar.</li>
<li>New plants: Pikeapple Bush, Alveo Vera, Sherberry Plant, Plume Squash, Bonbon Tree, and Idylla Flower.</li>
<li>New buildings: Wood Heater, Snow Tile, Deep Fryer, and more!</li>
<li>New elements: Cinnabar, Tallow, and Nectar.</li>
<li>New Duplicant: meet Freyja!</li>
<li>New POIs: a Gravitas live/work showroom! An enlightening Research Portal! A power plant that may or may not have wreaked havoc on past colonies!</li>
<li>Exclusive, cold-themed new blueprints collection!</li>
<li>Revised temperature mechanics.</li>
<li>...and more!</li>
<li>The universe can be a cold, cold place...conquer it all from the questionable comfort of your cool new snow fort colony in The Frosty Planet Pack DLC!</li>
</ul>

      <title>FlatOut 1, 2 and Ultimate Carnage now Steam Deck Verified with Steam Workshop support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ZOOM Platform put out a major update for FlatOut 1, 2 and Ultimate Carnage with all three now Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Ultimate Carnage was actually <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/flatout-ultimate-carnage-updated-with-steam-deck-support-and-no-more-drm/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Deck Verified earlier this year</a>, so that status is <em>new</em> for FlatOut 1 and 2. In addition, <em>all three</em> of them now have Steam Workshop support along with Steam trading cards, backgrounds, emojis, and badges too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16977109161721643357gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16977109161721643357gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage Collector's Edition</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">FlatOut 1 and 2 got the biggest updates. FlatOut 1 received:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added Steam Cloud support.</li>
<li>Added widescreen support. (Up to 21:9)</li>
<li>Added Czech, Russian, Hungarian and Polish languages.</li>
<li>Fixed texture issues with Blocker and Pepper cars.</li>
<li>Higher quality music tracks.</li>
<li>Improved model pop-in.</li>
<li>Minor fixes and improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">While FlatOut 2 also got:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added Czech, Russian, Hungarian and Polish languages.</li>
<li>Added Steam Cloud support.</li>
<li>Added Steam rich presence.</li>
<li>Restored unused track: "Papa Roach - Blood Brothers"</li>
<li>Improved model pop-in.</li>
<li>Improved FOV set by the game.</li>
<li>Improved aspect ratio for widescreen monitors.</li>
<li>Increased Lua memory limit.</li>
<li>Increased buffer size.</li>
<li>Enabled multiplayer hosted by OpenSpy.net.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimate Carnage also fixed some Czech letters not showing up.</p>
<p>On top of that, work is ongoing to get FlatOut 3 to work properly, although the game overall was really not well received (Overwhelmingly Negative on Steam). Zoom Platform mentioned to me via email they've done a minor change to get it to actually launch with Steam's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> now, they're "just waiting for Steam to merge in disabling esync and fsync in Proton for that to work". But for now you can set a launch option for it to work:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">PROTON_NO_ESYNC=1 PROTON_NO_FSYNC=1 %command%</code></p>
<p>Where to buy:</p>
<p>FlatOut - <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/flatout?partner=gamingonlinux" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> / <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/6220/FlatOut/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a></p>

      <title>Acre Crisis looks like a fun throwback to the original Dino Crisis</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Directly inspired by the visual style of classic PlayStation 1 (PS1) games, Acre Crisis has a lot of clear Dino Crisis vibes and it's out now. It comes with Native Linux support.</p>
<p>A first-person shooter with a survival horror theme that features a story mode, arcade mode and there's even both co-op and competitive multiplayer.</p>
<p>About it: "In 1992, following a series of mysterious deaths caused by wild animals, as well as strange sightings of cryptids in the sparsely populated and underdeveloped Amazon region of Acre, a special operations brigade from the Brazilian Military Police was sent to the area to gather intelligence. However, the situation took an unexpected turn for the soldiers, who soon found themselves cornered in the midst of a jungle infested with hungry dinosaurs."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-DMJpAuabhU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fea9d8fee24c8841da8273a089b67ada.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-DMJpAuabhU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short Length: The story mode can be completed in 1-3 hours, depending on the player's skill.</li>
<li>Replayability: The game features an Arcade mode where quick survival matches can be played.</li>
<li>Multiplayer: The game features a Multiplayer mode where you can participate in competitive or cooperative matches with your friends or face off against different people around the world.</li>
<li>Point System: While playing solo, you can collect points that you can later redeem for better weapons or cosmetics for your character.</li>
<li>Atmospheric: Explore the Amazon jungle with a wide variety of visual and sound effects, weather, and a day-night system that will completely immerse you in the game.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think younger me would have absolutely jumped at the chance to play something like this, having fond memories of similar games.</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2932900/Acre_Crisis/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">out on Steam now</a>.</p>

      <title>Bazzite Linux 3.6 out now bringing full ASUS ROG Ally X support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bazzite, the "next generation of Linux gaming" has a new release out with Bazzite 3.6 bringing support for the new ASUS ROG Ally X handheld.</p>
<p>Getting support in even before it's officially released, which is really nice to see. The ROG Ally X is due out on July 22nd. As the developers said: "Patches and kernel arguments have been added to make sure the ASUS ROG Ally X is supported before its even sold to most consumers. This update also brings fixes and new features for the original ASUS ROG Ally hardware as well making this update dedicated to the Ally and other handheld PCs. Notable fixes to RGB, calibration for controller deadzones, and better default controller endstops."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12992369621721386761gol1.png"/></p>
<p>So how did they get support in like this? Well, you can thank YouTuber Fan The Deck for it (<a href="https://x.com/kylegospo/status/1813660409536336076" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Twitter/X</a>), who had access early and decided to get testing and reporting for the Bazzite team so they could get everything ready.</p>
<p>Other improvements also come with Bazzite 3.6 including ASUS ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go get their audio enhanced, so now it should be closer to Windows. The Legion Go also now has accurate colours in Desktop Mode to match up with the type of screen it uses along with adaptive brightness support.</p>
<p>Also Handheld Daemon saw a <a href="https://github.com/hhd-dev/hhd/releases/tag/v3.2.0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new release</a>, which was pulled into Bazzite.</p>

      <title>Streets of Rogue 2 delayed until October 22 - Playtest coming soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While I'm a little sad to wait a bit longer, I know the delay for Streets of Rogue 2 is going to be worth it. Originally planned to hit Early Access in August, the release date has now been moved to October 22.</p>
<p>A reminder on what it is: Streets of Rogue 2 is a crazy, immersive RPG sandbox set in a vast randomly generated open world where freedom and fun are dialed up to 11. Fight, sneak, hack, farm, build, steal, or talk your way to power as you try to topple a corrupt president in countless possible ways – solo or with friends.</p>
<p>Even though it's delayed, thankfully though, we're still going to get a look into what to expect sometime soon as there's going to be a Playtest on Steam that anyone can join in on. Speaking about the delay, developer Matt Dabrowski <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2165810/view/6233628070476600070" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While SoR 2 has had a few more folks working on it than its predecessor, I’m still the sole programmer/designer of this thing. Compared with other disciplines, programmers are notoriously bad at predicting how long a given task will take. Now replace “task” with “entire Early Access-ready game,” and as you can probably imagine, guesstimating correctly gets a tad trickier. I’d been targeting a summer launch for a while, which has led to a pretty intense 2024. And while the original release date would have been technically achievable, it would have also been tighter than I was comfortable with. The new date allows me some breathing room and the opportunity to make the game that much better.</p>
<p>The new release date will also give me time to conduct a large-scale Pre-Release Playtest. If Streets of Rogue’s history tells me anything, this should benefit development. Before the original SoR went into Early Access, I released a bunch of builds of the game for free. This was super useful for getting player feedback and paved the way for a smooth launch on Steam.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Follow it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2165810/Streets_of_Rogue_2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Steam page</a>. If you're logged in, you can add yourself to the Playtest requests which should happen sometime late August or early September.</p>

      <title>1047 Games announced Splitgate 2 for release in 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>1047 Games have now revealed Splitgate 2, an upcoming free to play shooter building on the basics of the original.</p>
<p>This time around it's coming with a three faction system that they said gives you the ability to choose and progress based on your preferred gameplay style or competitive strategies. There will be a large variety of arenas, weapons and modes keep things fresh and play alone or with friends.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8zPMku7q9hU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b353331591734af3f07c19d33d77ed58.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8zPMku7q9hU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“The original Splitgate’s development was ambitious but scrappy; the game was created from a dorm room, and the massive success and community it earned surpassed our wildest dreams,” said Ian Proulx, co-founder and CEO of 1047 Games. “This time around, Splitgate 2 has been designed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5 to deliver the AAA FPS experience our fans deserve, with the series' signature action completely overhauled by an all-star team composed of the most talented individuals in the industry. This is a revolutionary step forward for competitive shooters. It's the perfect entry point for players new to the world of Splitgate and a comprehensive upgrade worthy of our existing community."</p>
<p>Hopefully there will be some kind of Linux and Steam Deck support. The first game was a lot of fun, felt like classic Halo but with portals.</p>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 gets a Summer Event Update, new comic on the way</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have updated the free to play Team Fortress 2, with a new Summer Event that runs through September 15th, 2024.</p>
<p>Not only that though, there's finally going to be a new comic. As confirmed by Erik Wolpaw on Twitter/X that <a href="https://x.com/Wolpaw/status/1811057658004222125" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mentioned</a>: "Jay and I are done with script (my proof: last page)(note: 184 script pages != 184 comic pages). If me and Pinkerton die in a writing accident, comic still comes out. If Heather and Maren die, though, you're screwed. Pray for them. 3 variant covers!".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1035631221721380727gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>We've also seen recently that Valve has been a bit more active on dealing with the bots too, which briefly saw the TF2 player counts (<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/440/charts/#3m" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>) shoot up earlier in July although it has stabilised again now, the Summer Event has caused another little bump in more players. Valve even put up a new <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/37C7-829B-5DE3-CC3B" rel="noopener" target="_blank">support page</a> that's real firm about TF2 bots and cheaters noting that "Team Fortress 2 game bans are permanent, non-negotiable, and are not removed by Steam Support".</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The Summer Event includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Featuring 10 new community maps: Embargo, Odyssey, Megaton, Cachoeira, Overgrown, Hadal, Applejack, Atom Smash, Canaveral, and Burghausen</li>
<li>Added the Summer 2024 Cosmetic Case
<ul>
<li>Contains 23 new community-contributed items</li>
</ul>

      <title>NVIDIA talk up their transition to open source GPU kernel modules</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/nvidia-releases-open-source-linux-gpu-kernel-modules-beta-driver-5154304-out/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Back in May 2022</a>, NVIDIA surprise released their open source Linux GPU kernel modules, and they've steadily been improving their open source support in general. Now they're talking up all the work to promote it a little more.</p>
<p>In a fresh developer <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-transitions-fully-towards-open-source-gpu-kernel-modules/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a>, the NVIDIA team give a round-up of their recent work including how the open-source GPU kernel modules have expanded to include various new features like heterogeneous memory management (HMM) support, confidential computing and more.</p>
<p>They also mentioned again that the plan is currently to transition to fully using the open source GPU kernel modules for the 560 driver release series. Not all GPUs though, with older GPUs from the Maxwell, Pascal, or Volta architectures requiring the proprietary driver. This isn't anything new overall though, as this was previously mentioned to be happening <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/nvidia-switching-to-open-kernel-modules-by-default-in-future-driver-update-for-turing/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in May this year</a> but that was a comment in a forum post so this developer post is a bit more official on it.</p>
<p>Just nice to see more open source from NVIDIA. </p>
<p>In case you missed it before as well, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/nvidia-exploring-ways-to-support-an-upstream-kernel-mode-gpu-driver/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NVIDIA are exploring</a> ways to support an upstream kernel mode GPU driver.</p>

      <title>Cyber Knights: Flashpoint adds full gamepad support and Steam Deck improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A little heist on the go perhaps? Cyber Knights: Flashpoint from Trese Brothers is steadily turning into a favourite turn-based tactics game and now with all the controller improvements it should feel a whole lot better on Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>More about it: "Squad tactics heist RPG! Clever stealth, strategic combat, unique 23rd-century cyberpunk. Build your crew of hackers, mercs and malcontents wisely; their stories will become interwoven with your own. Use powerful cyberware, faction connections, and more to outsmart the odds &amp; determine your future."</p>
<p>The game has a Native Linux version, and a Steam Deck Playable rating that should eventually get bumped up to Verified as the Trese Brothers continue putting in effort to make it better on Deck.</p>
<p>In the latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1021210/view/7025135705479590592" rel="noopener" target="_blank">update</a> they noted some controls issues being solved on Steam Deck, and with the new default configuration you "should be very good to go with the Steam Deck". But, they're not using Steam Input on Deck specifically due to issues, but you can turn it back on in their settings. Elsewhere it should use Steam Input for the full controller support now.</p>

      <title>Blender 4.2 is another crazy-big release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From game devs to movies and all sorts, Blender is a truly incredible bit of free and open source tech and it has evolved a lot with Blender 4.2 out now.</p>
<p>One of the biggies from this release is the next generation of their rendering engine, EEVEE. They said it has been completely "rewritten from scratch to allow global illumination, displacement, better SSS, viewport motion blur, and so much more" so it's more feature-filled than ever. Cycles also got a huge upgrade to make renders look better and render even faster.</p>
<p>Need to extend Blender? Add-ons and Themes have been overhauled into a new Extensions system, allowing you to update them from inside Blender which sounds useful. Plus check out the <a href="https://extensions.blender.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new Extensions site</a>.</p>
<p>Another fun one is Blender has become more portable than ever before. Now you can just take your entire config with you, as long as you have a folder named "portable" next to where you run Blender, it will load settings from there first.</p>
<p>For those who want a quick round-up:</p>

<p>And if you've got a little more time for the deep-dive:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="iwpBgtKilvw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/96ad3a25a294e30a116b8bacac77759b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/iwpBgtKilvw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Or just go and read the changes on the <a href="https://www.blender.org/download/releases/4-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Blender website</a>.</p>
<p>If you're a Blender user, let us know what you're up to with it in the comments, and what you think of the 4.2 release.</p>

      <title>No Man&#39;s Sky - Worlds Part I is out now and drastically transforms the planets</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ah hell, here we go again. Hello Games just released another massive free update to No Man's Sky with Worlds Part I out now. No Man's Sky is rated Steam Deck Verified and works great on desktop Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>
<p>This looks like probably one of the best updates yet, which I'm sure I've said before, but it's been true almost every time. Giving planets a really fresh feel some have big floating islands and you might even get a few waterfalls coming down from them which looks amazing. Flying around a planet is even more interesting with their new volumetric clouds with a mixture of wispy cirrus clouds and dark, rain-laden nimbus clouds. There's much more detailed shadows, high definition dynamic water with realistic wave formations and foam generation, lots of strange new creatures across various planets, full wind simulation, more dramatic storms, frozen worlds were given a big overhaul with ice-laden trees and glittering glacial rocks, new sky colours and the list just keeps on going and going.</p>
<p>What I've noted there is but the tip of the iceberg. There's walking buildings, aquatic landing jets, a new mech, more water colour variety, walker battles got more interesting, new base parts, richer atmospheric effects and then lots of random quality of life features.</p>
<p>On top of that there's also a brand new expedition that sees you go on an alien bug hunt. Oh, and you can finally rename your discoveries any time now too.</p>
<p>Main update trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="s7-9Bf47yfs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e816234c32fcbacd5947f730f2ca2b37.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/s7-9Bf47yfs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Hello Games also mentioned how they refined input for touch screen interfaces with the Steam Deck and Switch being mentioned directly, along with fixing various input bugs there. Nice to see!</p>
<p>Check out their deep-dive video on it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="XmU3_6BK-Ro"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4d55434ef33323ac9908e90290175a3c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/XmU3_6BK-Ro" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Clearly, Hello Games are doing some fantastic work and it seems a fair bit of this is coming over from their world-generation for their upcoming game Light No Fire.

      <title>Get a Drawful 2 free with The Jackbox Megapicker for the first 30 days after release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Jackbox Games are soon to release <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2828500/The_Jackbox_Megapicker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Jackbox Megapicker</a>, which is basically a launcher that shows all their games so you won't need to keep switching between packs for all their different games.</p>
<p>As they explained: "The Jackbox Megapicker is your all-in-one solution for organizing, buying, and launching all of your Jackbox games. You no longer have to switch between Party Packs to start playing your favorite games. The Megapicker will give you an overview of the games that you own so you can launch them directly. View games you might be missing, and see news updates and ongoing sales all in one place. Filter your games by genre and create an account to store your preferences and see your game history."</p>
<p>It's releasing on July 29th, and the sweet treat to come with it, is that for 30 days following the release they will be giving away the 3-8 player game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/442070/Drawful_2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Drawful 2</a>. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20762653071721216351gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20762653071721216351gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Usually I would moan about a launcher within a launcher, but in this case, when you think about how many game packs Jackbox Games now have it actually makes a good bit of sense to put it all together somehow.</p>

      <title>Fanatical&#39;s Bundle Bash has new game bundles every day this week</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're in need of a fresh set of games, you may want to hop over to Fanatical's Bundle Bash as they're putting out a new bundle every day this week.</p>
<p>The first was the <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/bundle/summer-mystery-bundle?ref=gol" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Summer Mystery Bundle</a>, allowing you to buy up to 20 mystery keys. While I don't particularly like the gambling aspect to it, generally it does give out some pretty good titles. This year there's some added bonuses too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What makes this year's bundle stand out is that with each purchase, you're automatically entered into our competition for a chance to win a Red Devil AMD Radeon™ RX 7800 XT 16GB GDDR6 PowerColor GPU worth over $500! But the excitement doesn't stop there. We are also including a chance to find AAA Game Packs within the bundle, featuring top-tier titles like Ghost of Tsushima DIRECTOR’S CUT, Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance, Dragon's Dogma 2 Deluxe Edition, Manor Lords, and No Rest for the Wicked. Will fortune favour you?</p>
<cite>Fanatical</cite></blockquote>
<p>The next is the <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/pick-and-mix/build-your-own-rpg-bundle?ref=gol" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Build your own RPG Bundle</a> starting from 3 for £4.99, and 8+ games end up as £1.25 a game so it's pretty good value overall. Especially when you look at just some of the titles you can pick that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mortal Shell (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Deck Verified)</li>
<li>The Ascent: Cyber Edition Bundle (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Deck Verified)</li>
<li>For The King - Deluxe Edition (Native Linux / <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Deck Playable)</li>
<li>ATOM RPG Trudograd (Native Linux / <img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Deck Verified)</li>
</ul>
<p>And then from yesterday there's the new <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/pick-and-mix/build-your-own-empire-bundle?ref=gol" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Build your own Empire Bundle</a> which offers up a similar deal to the above. In it you can get some sweet builders like:</p>
<ul>
<li>APICO (Native Linux / <img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Deck Verified)</li>
<li>URBO (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Deck Verified)</li>
<li>Coffee Shop Tycoon (<img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Deck Playable)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>There will be another bundle release around 4PM BST today too.</em></p>
<p>Oh, and while it's not part of this bundle event, they do also have a bundle for GOG fans with the <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/pick-and-mix/build-your-own-bethesda-bundle-gog-edition?ref=gol" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Build your own Bethesda Bundle - GOG Edition</a>.</p>

      <title>Enlisted from Gaijin and Darkflow returns to Steam and now free to play</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After initially releasing on Steam as Enlisted: Reinforced back in March, it was quickly taken down but now it's back on Steam just as Enlisted. Players initially took issues with the fact that the Steam release was paid-only, while it was free direct from their website.</p>
<p>With the re-release, it still has Native Linux support and Valve gave it a Playable rating on Steam Deck (using the Native version too). While the developer said: "Enlisted also works on Steam Deck! We've adapted the game's interface and controls to ensure that the gaming experience on Steam's proprietary console is as comfortable as on other platforms where Enlisted is already available.".</p>
<p>So it seems they still have some work to do on small text and gamepad controls not being default which is holding it up from being fully Steam Deck Verified.</p>

<p>Enlisted is quite unique when it comes to an online FPS, as you control a squad instead of a single person, with you being able to switch between them. It's pretty interesting but as usual for Gaijin there's a fair amount of in-app purchases just like War Thunder.</p>
<p>Check it out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2051620/Enlisted/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">free on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>TheForceEngine adds initial Dark Forces Remaster support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>TheForceEngine is an open source modern "Jedi Engine" replacement supporting Dark Forces, mods, and in the future Outlaws. A new release version 1.10.000 just rolled out.</p>
<p>With this new version the initial support of Nightdive's Dark Forces Remaster has landed, however a bunch of its HD Assets are not supported <em>yet</em> but will be in future. TheForceEngine is also set up to now automatically detect the Dark Forces Remaster as a game data source.</p>
<p>Some new cheats were added including one hit kill, one hit death, 9 lives, the ability to render everything at full-brightness and a new cheat menu is also in. Plenty of bug fixes too, you can also now disable screen flashes, crouch toggle is now an option and much more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11996793681721210225gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>This release also came with a few Linux fixes too:</p>
<ul>
<li>SDL2 fixes on Linux.</li>
<li>Fixed numerous clang/gcc warnings, Linux issues, 32-bit issues (though no 32-bit support on Windows is planned), and enabled GCC LTO (Link Time Optimizations).</li>
<li>Added workaround for GLEW on Wayland.</li>
</ul>
<p>Coming up in a future release is also a full Level Editor, so it will be interesting to see if a community builds up around that. We could end up seeing some pretty fun stuff made for it. Nice to see another game engine reimplementation keep getting better!</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/luciusDXL/TheForceEngine/releases/tag/v1.10.000" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full release notes</a>.</p>

      <title>Check out The Immortal Lock, an impressive new Quake 1 mod</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need more retro shooting goodness in your life? How about a little more from Quake 1? The Immortal Lock is a brand new pack from modder ComfyByTheFire that's well worth a look.</p>
<p>Before getting into it though, just note they do say you need an up to date install of <a href="https://github.com/Novum/vkQuake" rel="noopener" target="_blank">vkQuake</a> (1.31.0+), which is a Vulkan Quake port based on QuakeSpasm.</p>
<p>Story: "You are Ranger, an operator of the UTJR stationed at a secret, multinational research facility in Finland. You are being deployed to investigate the disappearance of a survey team that went missing beyond the slipgate, cast into the farthest reaches of existence. Yet through the thin veil of reality, you find only a desolate plane of flesh and despair, and a dread voice that beckons your name."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yOZwx5Zn--U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a8fde97f4af8bb076cd3aa64512c3cba.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yOZwx5Zn--U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As for what it includes: prepare for extremely challenging fights. The developer actually suggests you start on Easy mode. There will be plenty of "trick jumping, and a vast amount of large secret areas, but is difficulty scaled to accommodate everyone" and the map is "larger than an entire episode, if played in its entirety, and is best experienced in segments".</p>
<p>Go and <a href="https://www.slipseer.com/index.php?resources/the-immortal-lock.371/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check it out</a> and let me know what you think.</p>

      <title>Try the demo for Pest Apocalypse a horde survival game where you deliver pizza in a van</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>VANpire Survivors. I know, I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/pest-apocalypse-is-a-new-hilarious-survivor-like-game-with-a-death-mobile/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">already did that joke before</a>, but it's a good one. Pest Apocalypse is an upcoming chaotic horde survival game where you drive a vehicle to deliver pizza for hungry survivors.</p>
<p>The developers, Kikimora Games, have just recently put up a demo with Linux support (built with Godot Engine) so this might be a good one for you to give it a spin. Previously, Kikimora Games released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2341410/Wizards_Way_Out/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wizard's Way Out</a>, a small puzzle game about getting out of big trouble.</p>
<p>"Assemble a ragtag band of survivors, turbocharge your death-mobile, and rush straight into the thick of the action with a fearless grin. Your mission? To deliver steaming hot pizza to hungry customers, while fending off hordes of mutated pests!"</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="YySZsiN_E_c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b085fe93c09c8aeb8a1404648f712620.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/YySZsiN_E_c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Hordes of disgusting pests to slaughter!</li>
<li>Personalize your vehicle and build your team of survivors, each with unique skills and abilities!</li>
<li>Use your wits and reflexes to outmaneuver and outrun the enemy!</li>
<li>Deliver scorching hot pizza, or risk the wrath of the chef!</li>
<li>Quick runs( &lt; 15 minutes) for maximum enjoyment!</li>
<li>Sweet 3D/2D pixel art graphics!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems like a lot of fun from my time in the demo, especially chaotic when you're able to get a bit further into it. Driving a vehicle certainly gives the survivor-like genre a different feel. I was already excited to see more from this and it looks like it may deliver.</p>

      <title>Infest is a deckbuilder where every pixel on the battlefield can burn, freeze, melt and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Taking some inspiration from the excellent Noita perhaps, Infest brings the mechanic of destroying all the pixels and puts it into a deckbuilder. Recently the developer announced Early Access for July 31st, and their testing showed it working great on the Steam Deck. It also appears to have Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Here you build up a unique deck and deploy your cards to alter the environment, buff your status and unleash hell as you burn, freeze, corrode, shock and melt all the pixels on the screen during your battle. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LlZwnP1QqAw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2912381052d15dae0a0724db7df2a01c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LlZwnP1QqAw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Customize your deck and upgrade cards along the way. Make sure it is well balanced to handle a variety of environmental effects. Can you melt ice? Can you stop mutant plants? Foresight is key.</p>
<p>Deal damage card by card, when your stack is exhausted the enemies get their chance to attack! They will create defensive barriers, throw damage cards at you, buff themselves and heal others! Anticipating their moves and playing the right card is key.</p>
<p>Choose your path through the alien universe. Each run is different so you can replay many times without getting bored. Besides the playable levels, you'll encounter shops, hospitals, and dozens of different bonus challenges. Picking the right path is key to survival.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pixel by pixel simulated physics.</li>
<li>Roguelite style permadeath.</li>
<li>Dozens of side-rooms, shops, hospitals, mini-challenges.</li>
<li>Dozens of playable cards.</li>

      <title>Amusingly British point &amp; click adventure Heir of the Dog now on Kickstarter (demo available)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tall Story Games are working on another quality British point and click adventure game, with Heir of the Dog now on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hardwidge/heir-of-the-dog-a-pixel-art-point-and-click-comedy-adventure" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> with a demo available. Previously the developer released Lucy Dreaming, which was well received and had Linux support just like Heir of the Dog will.</p>
<p>More about it: "Replete with intricate, witty, and sardonic storytelling, Heir of the Dog, tells the story of bachelor and upper class twit, Cummerbund Bandersnatch. When visiting his uncle's laboratory, Bandersnatch discovers an experimental new formula guaranteeing a ‘good time’ for whoever drinks it. Seduced by the promises listed in his uncle's journal, he drinks the strange elixir and undergoes a monstrous transformation. Life will never be the same again."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Sf4RvyPpPMg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/547c7db1f87decf4251489c21cd5a099.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Sf4RvyPpPMg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They have 28 days to hit £15,000, with £7,557 already pledged at time of writing. So clearly there's quite a bit of interest for the funding to flow in so rapidly. As a Brit myself, I of course was legally obliged to cover this. Kidding of course, but I do love seeing British humour in more games.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hilarious dialogue and narrative.</li>
<li>Atmospheric and nostalgic pixel-art style.</li>
<li>Play as man, beast or dog to experience their extra senses and dirty habits.</li>
<li>Switch between night and day to solve puzzles and discover new abilities.</li>
<li>Choose between classic point &amp; click or character-based controls.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2431920/Heir_of_the_Dog/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Also on <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/heir_of_the_dog_demo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a> but no Linux build there right now.</p>

      <title>Marathon 2 a classic FPS originally from Destiny developer Bungie now on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After the Aleph One developer community released the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/bungies-classic-free-fps-marathon-is-now-on-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">first in the trilogy of Marathon on Steam</a>, originally created by Bungie, they've now put up Classic Marathon 2.</p>
<p>As a reminder: the Marathon series was created by Bungie (Halo / Destiny) originally back in the 90s for Apple computers. Later Bungie opened up the source code of the Marathon 2 engine in 1999 with the game assets being made freeware in 2005. Now all three games are available via <a href="https://alephone.lhowon.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Aleph One</a>, the open source continuation of Bungie's <cite>Marathon.</cite></p>

<p>About Classic Marathon 2:</p>
<blockquote>

      <title>SCAD is Twisted Metal meets Vampire Survivors and I want it now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm a total sucker for over the top action, especially when you're tearing down hordes of enemies in whatever bullet hell / bullet heaven game comes along since Vampire Survivors kicked it all off. The next one I need in my life is SCAD.</p>
<p>More about it: "Adrenaline Fueled Chaos - Take a journey through a dangerous world where humanity is on the verge of extinction. Following a catastrophic event caused by a malicious corporation's experiments, the remnants of civilization survive in fortified junkyard enclaves. Take on missions. Engage in a never-ending battle with hordes of enemies across different environments."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Story mode.</li>

<li>Upgrade your vehicle and weapons to change the course of the world.</li>
<li>Beautiful isometric pixel art.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>What's also interesting here is the developer, NAISU, usually make <em>hentai</em> games. And somehow, an aspiring game dev managed to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieDev/comments/1e3uwdp/comment/ldae1fi/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">convince them</a> to work on something else. I'm glad they did, because this looks <em>nuts</em>.</p>
<p>A first demo should be out in September, with Early Access in October.</p>

      <title>GameCube emulator Dolphin adds RetroAchievements support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another nice win for people who love hitting challenges, as <a href="https://retroachievements.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">RetroAchievements</a> support has now been added to Dolphin for GameCube. Currently not in the Wii side of the emulator, right now the focus is on getting it working well for GameCube emulation.</p>
<p>Showing the true power of open source, they were able to do this thanks to the PlayStation 2 emulator PCSX2, which <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/ps2-emulator-pcsx2-20-is-out-now-and-its-a-huge-upgrade/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">also recently had a major new release</a> that came with RetroAchievements support.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2024/07/15/unlocked-retroachievements-come-dolphin/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a> the Dolphin team mentioned how "One of the things that helped was the PCSX2 implementation of RetroAchievements, which acted as a base for the developers who worked on the Dolphin version of the implementation. As well, their own achievement creation library had to be ported over to work with Dolphin's memory handling.". </p>
<p>Took them a good while to get it going, 18 months to get it all ready and due to how GameCube games work, it sounds like it was a lot of effort to ensure they actually work correctly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9425216871721123948gol1.jpg"/></p>

      <title>Megacopter: Blades of the Goddess is a quality shoot &#39;em up throwback to Desert Strike</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Inspired by the Strike series (Desert/Jungle/Urban Strike) and Choplifter, Megacopter: Blades of the Goddess is a lot of fun if you love fast-paced shoot 'em up action. <em>Note: the developer sent a key.</em></p>
<p>As someone who grew up playing Desert Strike and later games, this one really spoke to me. Even if you don't have any nostalgia for the classics, it's still a well-made shoot 'em up full of twists and turns. Here you're not just flying any old helicopter, but the Megacopter, which appears to be somewhat alive and thirsty for blood.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rtM2r14BoNA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/119fe974539fd7ee2c79ff87ae6d932a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rtM2r14BoNA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Here you go through a series of missions with increasing difficulty, as it sprinkles in various different types of enemies where your focus ends up split between ground and air attacks to counter and dodge. It needs some pretty fancy finger-work on the controls at times too, it can be quite challenging not to get destroyed. Some missions are a straight-up fight, others see you being sent to rescue people. There's even defence missions with enemy waves coming at you and boss fights too — it has a bit of everything.</p>
<p>A bit of a learning curve to the controls too. In a few ways it reminds me of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/06/incredible-top-down-shooter-brigador-gets-a-huge-free-enhancement/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Brigador</a> (also brilliant), with how you aim along a specific line that you move the crosshair inside. So you have to be aware of your position relative to the enemies, while they're firing at you, as you're also trying to line up your shots. It actually becomes pretty chaotic in the best possible way because you firing at both ground and air targets, with a separate button to target each. You'll spend a fair amount of time ducking and dodging in circles.</p>
<p>The story is a bit wild too, some crazy Reptoid people are trying to take over. Obviously it's your job to stop them. A job that perhaps they should have sent an army in for but they have you. Thankfully the Megacopter is powerful, with various different weapons and special ability combinations to unlock and pick your load-out for each mission. The story is just the right amount of ridiculous to make it feel not too far from an absured 80s action movie script. Great soundtrack to get the blood pumping too!</p>
<p>My only real issue is the graphical style. A bunch of it doesn't really fit together like the terrain and trees, when compared with the buildings and enemies all look a bit off and a bit out of place perhaps but once you get past that and sink some time into the game it really doesn't matter. Gameplay is king here, as they say and Megacopter is certainly a lot of fun.</p>
<p>It has full Native Linux and Steam Deck support. In fact, the developer <a href="https://x.com/megacoptergame/status/1810521250516586999" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mentioned</a> earlier this month that nearly 20% of the sales for it at that point were from Linux / Steam Deck players.</p>
<p>Since release the developer has repeatedly improved all aspects of the game from player feedback too, including new ways to control the Megacopter and they continue to push out improvements even now.</p>
<p>Overall, it's a well-built shoot 'em up that you can't go wrong with.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1228360/Megacopter_Blades_of_the_Goddess/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Nexus Mods new cross-platform app adds experimental Cyberpunk 2077 support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>On top of fixing up various issues with Stardew Valley modding, the new Alpha of the cross-platform and open source Nexus Mods app introduces experimental Cyberpunk 2077 support.</p>
<p>For those just joining us, this is for the <em>new</em> Nexus Mods app that will <em>eventually</em> replace things like Vortex with full Linux support so you can mod on desktop Linux and Steam Deck much easier as I reported on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/nexus-mods-want-feedback-from-linux-steam-deck-users-on-their-new-cross-platform-app/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">earlier in July</a> and initially <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/nexus-mods-app-is-an-in-development-replacement-for-vortex-that-will-support-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in November last year</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1595693931721050152gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1595693931721050152gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Nexus Mods app on Linux</em></p>
<p>Version 0.5.3 of the app includes all these fixes on top of experimental Cyberpunk 2077 support:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the "SMAPI is disabled"-diagnostic for multiple SMAPI installations (<a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1674" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1674</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed Loadout disappearing when applying (<a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1737" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1737</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed un-managing a game removing all Loadouts instead of just the ones for the current game (<a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1738" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1738</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed sorting in the Mod Library and the "Completed Downloads"-section (<a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1690" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1690</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed SVGs not loading and rendering properly in the markdown viewer (<a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1661" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1661</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed SVGs throughout the App (<a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1622" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1622</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1681" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1681</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed not disposing services on close correctly (<a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1679" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1679</a>).</li>
<li>Windows: Fixed log file creation failing due to illegal character in path (<a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1728" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1728</a>). Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/ZeeWanderer" rel="noopener" target="_blank">@ZeeWanderer</a>!</li>
<li>Linux: Fixed protocol registration (<a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1691" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1691</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1689" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1689</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1683" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1683</a>).</li>
<li>Linux: Upgraded <a href="https://github.com/erri120/GameFinder" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GameFinder</a> to fix an issue with not being able to find Steam installed as a Flatpak or Snap (<a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1720" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1720</a>).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a few other assorted improvements behind the scenes on this too.</p>
<p>I really cannot tell you how excited I am to see this app expand. Modding support on Linux has traditionally been a bit messy, and with a proper cross-platform Nexus Mods app, things will become so much easier.</p>
<p>Just to note: it <strong>didn't</strong> initially launch for me, I had to remove the configs from the previous version to get this latest to work. The bug was <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/issues/1765" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reported</a> but given it's in Alpha, such breakages are to be expected and they don't plan to support migrations yet. So keep that in mind. If you also tried the previous version, you can find the configs in "/.local/share/NexusMods.App".</p>
<p>For Linux / Steam Deck, download the "NexusMods.App.x86_64.AppImage" from the <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/releases/tag/v0.5.3" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release page</a>.</p>

      <title>Linux kernel 6.10 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Linus Torvalds announced the release of Linux kernel 6.10 and with it, plenty of new hardware support and improvements to existing hardware. You know the drill.</p>
<p>Announcing the release Torvalds <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2024/7/14/250" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So the final week was perhaps not quote as quiet as the preceding ones, which I don't love - but it also wasn't noisy enough to warrant an extra rc. And much of the noise this last week was bcachefs again (with netfs a close second), so it was all pretty compartmentalized.</p>
<p>In fact, about a third of the patch for the last week was filesystem-related (there were also some btrfs latency fixes and other noise), which is unusual, but none of it looks particularly scary.</p>
<p>Another third was drivers, and the rest is "random".</p>
<p>Anyway, this obviously means that the merge window for 6.11 opens up tomorrow. Let's see how that goes, with much of Europe probably making ready for summer vacation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Just some cherry-picked items that made it into Linux kernel 6.10 below.</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Gaming Related:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steam Deck IMU support, plus the kernel now accounts for both versions of the Steam Deck (LCD / OLED).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/proposed-windows-nt-sync-driver-brings-big-wine-proton-performance-improvements/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NTSYNC driver </a>was merged to hopefully improve Wine / Proton game performance, but not enabled yet.</li>
<li>Improvements to Xbox Elite 2 controller back paddle buttons over Bluetooth.</li>
<li>Added support for the Machenike G5 Pro Controller.</li>
<li>Improved support for some ROG Ally buttons.</li>
<li>Added support for the ASUS ROG RAIKIRI PRO.</li>
<li>New support for GameForce Chi retro handheld.</li>
<li>Improved Aya Neo KUN support.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Other picks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Panthor driver for Arm Mali Valhall GPUs landed.</li>
<li>More work on bringing up support for the upcoming Intel Battlemage.</li>
<li>A new mseal() syscall for the Linux kernel that "protects the VMAs of a given virtual memory range against modifications", currently Google Chrome plans to hook into it.</li>
<li>Lots of RISC-V support improvements.</li>
<li>More WiFi 7 hardware support.</li>
<li>Lots of new Arm device support across various small boards like the ArmSom Sige7, Forlinx FET3588-C and others.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's thousands of changes of course that I'm not going to go over, those are just a few bits that jumped out that I thought you might want to know. If I missed anything important and gaming related, be sure to send in a tip.</p>

      <title>Free to play customizable platform fighter Counterpick Labs is out in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's your chance to play a platform fighter that's a bit different, and help shape its development with Counterpick Labs now in Early Access from developer UrbanMotmot.</p>
<p>No set characters or super-heroes here, instead you build your perfect fighter by mixing and matching various weapons, some of which are quite odd. There's over 200 load-out combinations to try, so a little something for everyone.</p>
<p>The gameplay involved you trying to knock your opponents off-stage to secure a win. With the ability to play locally or online (with rollback netcode). It's free to play, with no pay-to-win mechanics involved. It will remain free to play when it's finished too. You can support development by buying their bananas micro-transactions on Steam for some cosmetics.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>

      <title>Check out Quantum Witch, a platformer meets point and click choose your adventure</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer NikkiJay recently revealed Quantum Witch, a rather quirky sounding mix of game genres that blends a platformer with a sort-of choose your adventure style.</p>
<p>The developer mentioned it will have Native Linux support and Steam Deck support, with them working as a solo developer getting it ready to release next June.</p>
<p>More about it: "It's a straightforwardly lovely day in Hus.</p>
<p>It's always a lovely day in Hus. That's not suspicious at all! The bovey is grazing in the field, the faer are roaming around town causing chaos, the shadies are out preaching (they're not a cult!), and a giant stone portal to another dimension has appeared in the woods.</p>
<p>I hope nothing goes hideously wrong and results in an adventure."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rsWw8ZABdVU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/34c0af9c41f552f5b20484436aabb8b7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rsWw8ZABdVU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>A little more about it:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Narrative and choice driven platform adventure. Imagine choose your own adventure meets point and click meets platformer. Yes, you've got it! It's that.</li>
<li>Hand crafted retro resolution pixel art in a cute style that definitely doesn't unexpectedly turn creepy.</li>
<li>Not a cult.</li>
<li>Choices matter. Convince a character to wear something? They'll wear it for the rest of the game. Save a character? They'll be there as part of your story.</li>
<li>Very, very gay.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Heroes of Might and Magic II game engine fheroes2 v1.1.1 released</title>
      <author>fheroes2</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dear players of Heroes of Might and Magic 2 and fheroes2 project supporters. The team is excited to present the new version of the fheroes2 engine - 1.1.1 for Heroes of Might and Magic II after more than a month of hard work.<br/>
This release was mainly focused on polishing the <strong>Editor</strong>, but not only.<br/>
<br/>
The Editor got support for <strong>Rumors</strong>, <strong>Daily Events</strong> and <strong>special Victory and Loss conditions</strong>. These were missing features that are present in the original game. However, as promised we added them as quickly as possible after the new Editor was launched. The team used different design of dialogs in comparison to the original Editor to make it more user-friendly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9997418791721035154gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9997418791721035154gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13645266861721035170gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13645266861721035170gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Besides fixing several issues in the Editor and adding missing parts we also made multiple improvements. First of all, the team redesigned the <strong>hero selection window</strong> in the Editor. No more scrolling through similar icons.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12070103501721035224gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12070103501721035224gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Secondly, we started adding new content to the game. As a start, the team added a missing part of the Sphinx and a new variation of the adventure map Cave object.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1107085551721035247gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1107085551721035247gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>A brand new feature now available in the Editor is the ability to <strong>restrict the construction</strong> of any building in towns and castles. This gives a lot of flexibility for map makers to design maps with unique gameplay conditions.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5423572931721035280gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5423572931721035280gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>The <strong>AI</strong> was updated as well. We reworked all bonuses the AI had in the past and reduced them significantly to have a fair play for AI. This aligns with our goals: we want difficulty level affect only AI behaviour without giving it any perks.<br/>
Additionally, we fixed few places in AI logic.<br/>
<br/>
As usual, the team updated multiple translations, improved various UI elements and closed <strong>over 40 issues</strong> since the previous release.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for your invaluable support, and we hope you will enjoy this release!</p>

      <title>RPG Maker MV / MZ for Linux tool now supports TyranoBuilder, RPG Maker XP / VX / VX Ace</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While it's in need of a better name, the RPG Maker MV / MZ for Linux tool had a new release recently that expanded the support for running games on Linux from TyranoBuilder, and RPG Maker XP / VX / VX Ace.</p>
<p>Initially covered here on GamingOnLinux <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/this-open-source-project-runs-rpg-maker-mv-mz-games-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in early May</a>, it's a collection of scripts and tools bundled together to allow you to run various games natively on Linux. Initially only for games built with RPG Maker MV / MZ, the developer released version 1.0.9 on July 1st adding support for TyranoScript/TyranoBuilder engine V4 and V5, plus now also RPG Maker XP / VX / VX Ace games via the <a href="https://github.com/mkxp-z/mkxp-z" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mkxp-z</a> linux library.</p>
<p>The developer also mentioned how it can now also be used as a compatibility tool in Steam, so you can run games from Steam using it like you would with Proton or Luxtorpeda.</p>
<p>Picking a completely random game, I tested it with the demo of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2455920/Mimic_Logic/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mimic Logic</a> using it as the compatibility tool in Steam and it runs perfectly. Thanks to <a href="https://steamdb.info/tech/Engine/RPGMaker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> having an RPGMaker Engine tag.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2770381201720898467gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2770381201720898467gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5797098391720898467gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5797098391720898467gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Other features the developer listed on the GitHub:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Sharp increase in fps (from 2 to 4 times more compared to Wine, can be viewed by pressing the F2 key).</li>
<li>Updating Pixi 5 libraries for RPG Maker MV games (that's supposed to increase performance).</li>
<li>Downloading and selecting any version of NWJS (using the command line).</li>
<li>Easily installable SDK version of NWJS with one click in the gui, or via cli.</li>
<li>Starting a game with the Japanese locale option.</li>
<li>Launching a game using a command line.</li>
<li>Showing the NWJS, Nodejs, Chromium versions of your downloaded game.</li>
<li>Installing the Text hooker plug-in that copies the game's dialogs automatically to your clipboard.</li>
<li>Can be used as compatibility tool in steam for Windows games.</li>
<li>The Native support of 4 architectures: x86-64, i386, armhf, arm64</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So in future if you see any games you wish to play on Linux that were made with one of the RPG Maker game engines or TyranoBuilder, perhaps this tool might end up as one of the best ways for compatibility and performance.</p>
<p>A total no-fuss experience too. Download the release package from <a href="http://github.com/bakustarver/rpgmakermlinux-cicpoffs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the GitHub</a>, run the included installer, and it adds it to Steam's Compatibility menu for you.</p>

      <title>PS2 Emulator PCSX2 2.0 is out now and it&#39;s a huge upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PCSX2 is a popular open source emulation for the Sony PlayStation 2 (PS2) and PCSX2 version 2.0 is now officially available with a great many changes and improvements.</p>
<p>There's so many changes in fact, that it's pretty difficult to give you a summary of what's new. Quite literally every part of the emulator has been improved.</p>
<p>For starters they've moved away from wxWidgets for the interface to the much more modern and cross-platform Qt. The developers said Qt brings with it a "slick appearance, more efficient UI backend, and provided the perfect opportunity to redo all our menus and widgets" with the addition of themes to personalise it to your liking.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11754074481720895468gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11754074481720895468gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20725618001720895469gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20725618001720895469gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Along with Qt also comes SDL2 now integrated, which gives vast improvements to controller mapping and works across different platforms. Thanks to that PCSX2 now has automatic controller mapping, so you're only a few button clicks away from being set up with your favourite gamepads.</p>
<p>Plugins were removed, but they've now added in Automatic Game Fixes. Using their own database of all the games, they ship pre-configured fixes to ensure games will run smoothly so you shouldn't need to go in and change various settings for different games. However, the UI also now has a section for per-game settings for any personalized changes and tweaks you do wish to make.</p>
<p>The list just keeps going on and on. PCSX2 even has its own Big Picture Mode now too:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8729967531720895879gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8729967531720895879gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's also now support for <a href="https://retroachievements.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">RetroAchievements</a>!</p>
<p>So many other additions like Vulkan API support, an upgraded patches system, various performance improvements, FFMPEG for video capture support, improved game compatibility, sound system improvements and much more.</p>
<p>See their <a href="https://pcsx2.net/blog/2024/pcsx2-2-release/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">lengthy blog post</a> for all the details.</p>

      <title>RPG Maker / Pixel Game Maker devs move to Godot for Action Game Maker</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this is certainly an interesting one. Gotcha Gotcha Games known for the RPG Maker series and Pixel Game Maker have announced Action Game Maker and it's being made with the open source <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>.</p>
<p>Announced on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2987180/ACTION_GAME_MAKER/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new Steam page</a>, they said it's "designed to be the successor to Pixel Game Maker MV", which brought over their visual scripting inspired by the RPG Maker series but for a wider range of 2D action games. Their current code base was making things difficult to expand, with a lot of limitations and so they "decided that it is in the best long-term interests of our users to build a brand new Maker title, created from the ground up with a new framework" and that's where Action Game Maker comes in.</p>
<p>Much like their previous RPG Makers and Pixel Game Maker, it will be a no-code game creation tool that "builds on the node-based visual scripting system" from Pixel Game Maker MV so you don't need to know line-by-line written programming. And since they're building it on Godot, it's going to have a bunch of advanced features for those who want it, as noted on the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Advanced Engine Technology With Godot Engine!</strong></p>
Take advantage of the excellent 2D functionality provided by Godot Engine, the popular open source engine powering ACTION GAME MAKER!
<ul>
<li>UI design based on the existing Godot UI</li>
<li>Support for GDScript is provided for those who want to move beyond visual scripting.</li>
<li>A complete 2D pipeline</li>
<li>Tile Map Editor with auto-tile function</li>
<li>Supports both sprite and 2D bone animation systems</li>
<li>Access to Godot's rich particle and shader systems as well as support for dynamic lighting and shadows, enabling a full suite of graphics features!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps this time we might even see a proper Linux version for more game development to be done on Linux. Or at the very least, properly support Linux builds of game exports from it.</p>

      <title>OBS Studio 30.2 is out now with native NVENC encode for Linux, shared texture support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Video recording and livestreaming tool OBS Studio version 30.2 is officially out now, bringing with it various new features and a nice few Linux improvements too.</p>
<p>For Linux users this release adds in native NVENC encoder support, which includes NVENC AV1! Plus there's also now shared texture support for the NVENC encoder, QuickSync encoder and VA-API encoder. For Linux they're also now enforcing the Qt Fusion style and they've also combined the PipeWire window/display capture into unified "Screen Capture" source to align with other platforms.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10150475231720893427gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10150475231720893427gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>There's also a new Hybrid MP4 output format in Beta that "Combines fault-tolerance of fragmented MP4 with wide compatibility and faster access times of regular MP4", which also supports chapter markers in the file.</p>
<p>Some other new features include Enhanced RTMP/FLV multi-track audio and video, HEVC support to WebRTC output, an upgrade to the theme system, plus various other smaller UI improvements and lots of bug fixes.</p>
<p>One major new feature with Multitrack Video streaming (known as <a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/multiple-encodes?language=en_US" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Enhanced Broadcasting</a> on Twitch) was added in, but that's currently <em>only</em> supported on Windows with other operating systems planned for a future release.</p>

      <title>Open Source implementation of GOG Galaxy&#39;s Communication Service, Comet sees a first release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While it still has plenty of work ahead of it, Comet is a very promising project to bring the full power of GOG Galaxy over to Linux without needing to run their client in Wine. <em>Note: this is a community project, not from GOG themselves.</em></p>
<p>The first tagged release version 0.1.0 is out now bringing with it "all necessary SDK calls", allowing you to blast through GOG games and properly earn 100% of the achievements on Linux too. All without having to actually use GOG Galaxy. The whole point of Comet is to provide a platform-agnostic SDK, so it can be used in launchers like Heroic, Lutris and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15450684871720719014gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Some of what they wish to do in future versions includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Bring native comet support in Lutris and Heroic (have an option to toggle comet for games or globally without any manual effort).</li>
<li>Support official overlay on Mac and Windows. <a href="https://github.com/imLinguin/comet/issues/17" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#17</a></li>
<li>Support overlay on Linux for Windows games.</li>
<li>Create decky loader plugin to display invites and achievements as you unlock them. <a href="https://github.com/imLinguin/comet/issues/18" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#18</a></li>
</ul>

      <title>Cute pet sim Hamster Playground is out now, free and Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hamster Playground has today left Early Access as a finished game, ready for you to jump in and get adopting cute little furry friends. It has Native Linux support and is now Steam Deck Verified too!</p>
<p>If you like your more casual games, this is for you. Giving you a little world where you can take care of, train, and style your very own hamsters. A good one for audiences young and old. Have to admit, they did some pretty great work on the hamster movement in this, they're really cute…and silly. I had a good belly laugh seeing my little one bouncing up and down on a toy for the first time. What an odd game but adorable.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6X7hZQSkhK0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fef6bda1d2bc9c64e1922bc413e6ab95.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6X7hZQSkhK0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The new 1.0 release brings some fresh mini-games, a whole bunch of new customization items for your hamsters and their home, new quests to run through and new rewards.</p>
<p>While the game is free to play, it does have some monetisation. There's various DLC you can buy that add in new items, costumes, more quests and so on. You can get a bit more of everything. They also have Diamonds you can buy from the Steam store to also buy more stuff in-game. Not too fond of the micro-transaction style currency, but the rest is fine.</p>
<p>It's very much like a simple The Sims, but for Hamsters. </p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experience laid-back competition with a single button, yet prepare to break a sweat!</li>
<li>Race AI-driven hamsters in mazes and on drag strips, and other challenging mini-games.</li>
<li>Enjoy multiplayer modes, competing with up to 4 players locally or online.</li>
<li>Develop your hamsters' abilities and skillsets to take on higher-level opponents.</li>
<li>Expand and furnish your hamsters' house to create the mansion they deserve.</li>
<li>Customize your hamsters with over 100 cosmetic items and enjoy detailed graphics and cute animations throughout the game.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check it out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1442670/Hamster_Playground/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">free on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Super reaKtor is the most insane-looking bullet hell I&#39;ve seen in a good while</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Think you have fast reflexes? Super reaKtor looks like it will thoroughly test you with its rather unique take on bullet hell.</p>

You directly control a laser beam with the ability to move it around quickly, resize it and rotate it. With a point of collecting green energy orbs flowing through the level, while avoiding everything else trying to smash you as you try to keep the weak-point ends of your beam safe.</p>

      <title>Drop Duchy combines Tetris-like block-dropping with kingdom building</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have to admit, Drop Duchy is a clever blending of genres. Giving you the block-dropping from the likes of Tetris with you building up a kingdom. You'll need <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> for this one.</p>
<p>Coming from developer Sleepy Mill Studio, founded by a former former lead game designer at Ubisoft Paris, it sounds really interesting. Here it's not just about stacking differently shaped blocks together to fit, it's also about strategy as you need to align certain blocks together to activate them fully to produce more resources and units. So it's a fair bit like the tile gameplay from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/planetiles-is-a-beautiful-blend-of-tetris-and-dorfromantik/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Planetiles</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/relaxing-and-gorgeous-city-builder-dorfromantik-is-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dorfromantik</a> with a more Tetris-like theme.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="dQMy_pAEwEQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3f9a01e56ccfd505af5bf059575d5841.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/dQMy_pAEwEQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The intuitive, puzzle-esque nature of placing pieces makes <em>Drop Duchy</em>’s rewarding complexity welcoming to all. Well-played rounds lead a kingdom’s forces to branching, decision-packed routes in a grand march to storm an enemy fortress. Unlock upgrades and modifiers in the form of cards, gaining new bonus-granting structures, boosts to soldier recruitment &amp; resource gathering, and other perks through deep deck customization. Should forces fall before claiming the fortress as their own, jumping into a new round to experiment with an altered strategy takes a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>New factions and modifiers await the most formidable leaders, keeping <em>Drop Duchy</em>’s gameplay loop of block stacking, deck customization, and decision making fresh in challenge and opportunity. A delightful maquette-inspired aesthetic adds charm to <em>Drop Duchy</em>’s moment-to-moment action, upholding a cheery sense of adventure. Regardless of the battles and scenarios at hand, <em>Drop Duchy</em>’s challenge constantly feels exciting and packed with possibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>An original mix of puzzle gameplay and real-time strategy.</li>
<li>A brand new game experience with each run thanks to procedural generation.</li>
<li>Play with 3 Factions: The Duchy, The Order, The Republic.</li>
<li>Meta progression: 50 challenges designed to help you through your journey.</li>
<li>Build the perfect deck with 80 unique cards.</li>
<li>An elegant and charming art direction to please your eyes.</li>
<li>An engaging and ever-evolving soundtrack to please your ears.</li>

      <title>Customize your slice in Pizza Hero a (currently free) Vampire Survivor-like</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pizza Hero is a new Vampire Survivor-like that you can currently add a free copy of to your Steam account for a limited time. There's no date mentioned yet when it will become a paid game, but it's in their plans, so you may want to quickly add it to your Steam Library to keep it.</p>
<p>Seems it works well enough on Linux desktop / Steam Deck with Proton 9, although you do need to currently force-quit the game as it seems to stay open when you exit. Apart from that, a fun little idea to customize a pizza slice with toppings and spices as your powers while fighting off waves of enemies.</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Current Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>15+ Damage Toppings.</li>
<li>6+ Passive Toppings.</li>
<li>Upgradable overall stats.</li>
<li>Auto rotate/firing controls (with option to focus different enemy types - Tank, Damage and Support).</li>
<li>Endless gameplay.</li>
<li>Survive waves to unlock the next stage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check it out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2202770/Pizza_Hero/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">free (for now) on Steam</a>. It does have some items you can buy in the form of Pizza Tokens, which the developer said is purely to support development.</p>

      <title>Popular multiplayer code editor Zed gets a Linux release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A little break in the gaming news for a moment to mention that Zed, a "high-performance, multiplayer code editor from the creators of Atom and Tree-sitter", now has a Linux version available.</p>
<p>Something many have been wanting, because of how popular it is. Previously only officially available for macOS, the developers are not yet even providing official builds for Windows (but it can be built from source).</p>
<p>Announced via their blog in the "<a href="https://zed.dev/blog/zed-on-linux" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Linux when? Linux now.</a>" post, it included a nice thank you note about how vital the community has been in pushing the rapid development of the Linux build.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/163177061720690828gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/163177061720690828gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>It has some of the fanciest sounding features I've ever read for a code editor. Built like a video game as they said: "Zed’s breakthrough performance starts with our GPUI framework, a new way to build 2D user interfaces. GPUI rasterizes the entire window on the GPU, just like a 3D video game. The result? Fast, reliable, and smooth delivery of pixels on every frame.".</p>
<p>Not just that, it's built for collaboration too with a virtual office system with different channels, shared documents for notes, audio and text-based chat and so on. So, it sounds like an open-source Discord for programmers in a way.</p>
<p>See more on the <a href="https://zed.dev/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official website</a>.</p>

      <title>Session: Skate Sim adds Cloud Saves and now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Skating on the go? Well, that's generally what you do. But now, in video game form! Session: Skate Sim has become Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the developers <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/861650/view/4226147001138858803" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> on Steam that Valve gave it the green Steam Deck Verified tick. And today, they updated the post to note they've now implemented Steam Cloud support too so that you can sync your progress properly across desktop and handhelds too. Always good to see.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1296635471720618087gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1296635471720618087gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

<p>More about it: "Inspired by the golden age of street skating – the 1990s – Session: Skate Sim lets you experience true skateboarding and its culture: no scoring system; just you, your spot and your imagination! There's no need for judges to tell you that your noseslide or varial heelflip are perfect for this spot. And because certain locations are iconic, the developers have added several of them to the game for you to skate in and express your creativity, including Black Hubbas (New York City), Brooklyn banks (New York City), FDR Park (Philadelphia) and many other spots."</p>

      <title>Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers is releasing in August to be your next obsession</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This might perhaps pull a bunch of you away from Balatro, as Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers a card-flipping, risk-taking roguelike deckbuilder is releasing on August 8th. It comes with Native Linux support and a demo is still currently available to try it.</p>
<p>Seems it was quite popular too with the developer noting it was one of the top 25 most-played demos, and it's managed to amass over 120K wishlists. So, it should do quite well at release then.</p>
<p>In Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers, players build powerful decks to take on the greedy upper echelons of capitalist business baddies exploiting the local gamblers. Come launch, players will be able to choose from a collection of over 300 cards, with each round demanding new and improved strategies in order to bag the jackpot. </p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 unique play styles based around card suits.</li>
<li>Unlock new starter decks when you complete runs, for a whole new way to play!</li>
<li>Over 250 unique cards!.</li>
<li>60 characters to defeat.</li>
<li>Unique grimey pixel art aesthetic.</li>
<li>All the degeneracy from a seedy casino but with no risk to your finances, mental health, or your loved ones.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Satisfactory 1.0 is releasing in September</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For fans of sprawling building and automation sims, Satisfactory 1.0 is planned to release on September 10th. Satisfactory works well on desktop Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>, and it's rated Steam Deck Playable by Valve.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/526870/view/4270057097478183701" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> post goes into a little detail on what to expect that include highlights like a flushable toilet. Yes really. But there's more than just some plumbing being done. The developer mentioned an update to the map to have some more resource nodes, changes to recipe costs, research updates, lots and lots of performance optimizations. Going over the details of their tweaks, it certainly looks like progression will be a bit smoother.</p>
<p>Another interesting one is the improvements to dedicated servers that will introduce a new API so "it will be possible to develop external applications that can talk directly to the server". Will be fun to see what people come up with for that.</p>
<p>Plus so much more they will reveal over time.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="febekpSoEbA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6ace6e2aa66c5b7df468e96f163ee5bd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/febekpSoEbA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The price is also due to rise soon from $29.99 to $39.99. Currently it's 50% off during the Steam Summer Sale so you may want to be quick before it jumps up a fair bit.</p>

      <title>Stardew Valley is getting a Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 cross-over mod with Baldur&#39;s Village</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It was only a matter of time wasn't it? 3 fans of both games decided to take matters into their own hands to combine Stardew Valley and Baldur's Gate 3.</p>
<p>There's no clear timeline on a release just yet, but the <em>latest</em> update from one of the people working on it <a href="https://x.com/XunHe1145/status/1809977536342032475" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mentioned</a> the first part may appear "this fall or winter".</p>
<p>The original announcement <a href="https://x.com/XunHe1145/status/1784190551211839734" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mentioned</a> plans for including "a new map and residents from Baldur's Gate 3" which includes the likes of Astarion, Shadowheart, Gale and Halsin. Originally, Astarion was the single character you could date and they said he will have a "unique romance plot" but they've now <a href="https://x.com/XunHe1145/status/1792230292230438960" rel="noopener" target="_blank">added</a> Halsin into that too with more romance options based on voting from their <a href="https://www.patreon.com/xunhe1145" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Patreon</a>. The map size has also doubled since their original plan.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14824536511720613863gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14824536511720613863gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>In the latest update they also mentioned Roland being added as a new character, they're working on the daily schedule of each NPC to "make their relationship more real" and for "some old friends to have activities together", along with ongoing work on "spouse rooms, patios, and special furniture related to the character's experience". We're even going to get some seasonal outfits.</p>
<p>Some other shots they shared:</p>

<p>This would be a good time to remind you of the new <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/nexus-mods-want-feedback-from-linux-steam-deck-users-on-their-new-cross-platform-app/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cross-platform Nexus modding app</a>, which recently had a first Alpha release and Stardew Valley is the initial supported game. So hopefully by the time Baldur's Village releases it will be super-simple to get it working on Linux / Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>AMD releases FidelityFX SDK 1.1.0 with FSR 3.1 and Vulkan support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news for developers and open source, as AMD have now finally put up a new release of the FidelityFX SDK which now has FidelityFX FSR 3.1.</p>
<p>The AMD FidelityFX SDK v1.1 update bringing FSR 3.1 includes quite a lot of fun sounding changes, hopefully something we will see more developers now implementing into their games and game engines.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">FSR 3.1 includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>FSR 3.1 Upscaler reduces ghosting, improves convergence speed and reduces flickering.</li>
<li>Frame pacing for FSR Frame Interpolation has been improved for an even better experience.</li>
<li>FSR3.1 adds the ability to decouple the frame interpolation process from that of upscaling, so it can be used with any upscaler the user desires, or at native resolution.</li>
<li>FSR 3.1 introduces the FSR API, which makes integrations of FSR future proof, so applications using this interface can be updated to upcoming versions of FSR more easily.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus FSR 3.1 also has a new a new API added for "forward compatibility" that includes native DirectX 12 and Vulkan backends. The Vulkan support is also brand new as of this release!</p>
<p>This release also introduces the new FidelityFX Breadcrumbs library to help detect sources of GPU crashes. Also new is Brixelizer, that's a highly-optimized GPU sparse distance field builder that can handle both static and dynamic geometry and features a shader API that allows you to trace rays against the scene from any shader of your choice. Then there's also Brixelizer GI, which is a compute-based real-time dynamic global illumination solution built upon the sparse distance fields built by FidelityFX Brixelizer.</p>
<p>See the full <a href="https://gpuopen.com/learn/amd_fsr_3_1_release/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release blog post</a> for more.</p>

      <title>DXVK 2.4 brings D8VK for Direct3D 8 support, frame rate limiter adjustments, lots of game fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another big release of DXVK, the Vulkan-based implementation of Direct3D for Linux with Wine / Proton, has arrived. Version 2.4 expands the Direct3D support to version 8 now thanks to D8VK. So this means now DXVK as of this version covers Direct3D 8/9/10/11 and VKD3D-Proton continues for Direct3D 12.</p>
<p>Developer Ethan Lee (FNA / Linux ports) also had a nice <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/3738" rel="noopener" target="_blank">code merge</a> for this release with the addition of support for multiple window system backends that the application can choose between at runtime. On top of that, there's now proper ABI versioning for native libraries.</p>
<p>The frame rate limiter was also adjusted for non-native refresh rate emulation as explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In environments where the display mode cannot be changed (e.g. Proton), it is possible that DXVK reports a different refresh rate to the game than what the display is currently running at. This is problematic for games that require to be run at 60 FPS but do not limit their frame rate when using a 60 Hz display mode.</p>
<p>To work around this, the frame rate limiter will now be engaged automatically if a game runs in full-screen mode with vertical synchronization enabled, and if the detected frame rate over a short period of time is higher than the refresh rate of the selected display mode.</p>
<p>In case a game runs at a lower rate than expected and does not provide an in-game option to change refresh rate, this behaviour can be disabled by setting <code class="inline-code">d3d9.maxFrameRate = -1</code> (or the corresponding <code class="inline-code">dxgi</code> option for D3D10+ games). Setting <code class="inline-code">DXVK_FRAME_RATE</code> also overrides this behaviour as usual.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This now also applies to VKD3D-Proton as of <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/commit/80f6c46e43e9f018d34e266ed939c4531a283b05" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this commit</a> or later.</p>

<p>There's more like improved compatibility to third-party mods hooking various DXGI entry points and various other miscellaneous fixes and updates.</p>
<p>For the full detail see the <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v2.4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>If you're curious on how to upgrade, you don't actually need to do anything. Proton and GE-Proton use DXVK directly, and so they both pull in updates in their new releases. However, for those who like to live on the wild side, you can upgrade the DXVK version in Proton yourself. Do it at your own risk.</p>
<p>To do so you can just overwrite the existing DXVK files with the release download of the latest DXVK. You can find your Proton install <em>somewhere</em> like this (depending on your Steam Library drives):</p>
<p>For Proton 9 and Proton Experimental:</p>
<p><code>path-to-your/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Proton x.x/files</code></p>
<p>Proton 8 and below:</p>
<p><code>path-to-your/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Proton x.x/dist</code></p>
<p><em>Where x.x is whatever Proton version installed you wish to give a new DXVK.</em></p>
<p>Inside there you will see "lib" and "lib64", for 32bit and 64bit. Inside each of those, there's a "wine" folder and inside there is a "dxvk" folder and that's where you replace the files with new versions. If you mess anything up, one way to ensure it gets reinstalled cleanly is just to remove the "/dist" folder.</p>

      <title>Relaxing nature-stacking puzzle-building game Preserve launches August 8</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Preserve from developer Bitmap Galaxy is a relaxing puzzle nature-building game that's going to enter Early Access on August 8th. With full Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Taking a rather relaxed approach to building sims with puzzle elements, Preserve certainly looks interesting. The objective is to foster and sustain a thriving and diverse biomes, where each component coexists in a symbiotic harmony. By utilizing strategic thinking and a keen eye for balance, players are granted the power to position a wide array of plants and animals, curating an environment that caters to their preferences and aspirations. Reminds me a bit of Terra Nil in a way.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="e_y3W7biWcE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f3ac33f1df37c835201f40d0a9555fa8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/e_y3W7biWcE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Vertical map expansion - In Preserve, you can expand the map not only horizontally, but you also posses an ability to stack layers of nature, forming a vertical network of interconnected habitats.</li>
<li>Diverse biome habitats - From alpine forests and savannas to carribean reefs, each biome will have its own unique set of plants, animals, and environmental challenges to discover and overcome.</li>
<li>Multiple Game Modes - Besides regular harmony and puzzle game modes, creative mode lets you build the land without limitations and photo mode allows you to capture and share your creations at the end of each session.</li>
<li>Natural Wonders - Nothing can beautify your map more than natural wonders like the snowy Alps, lavender fields or redwood forests, which you can acquire thanks to a unique card upcycle system.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>“We are thrilled to finally release Preserve into Early Access and let fans get their hands on all the new content we’ve been working on” said Peter Janosik, Studio Lead &amp; Programmer at Bitmap Galaxy. “The new Marine Biome adds a whole new dimension to the game, and players will love creating ocean-dwelling habitats. We can’t wait to hear feedback from our community and we have more to reveal throughout Early Access leading up to our 1.0 launch.” </p>

      <title>90s styled Old School Rally hits Early Access on July 19</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Old School Rally is bringing some serious vibes from retro 90s racers like Colin McRae Rally and it's confirmed to hit Early Access on July 19th.</p>
<p>The developer noted that the Steam Deck is "fully supported" through Proton. There's no official verification done from Valve yet, but I did <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/old-school-rally-plans-full-support-for-steam-deck-got-me-feeling-nostalgic/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously highlight</a> their support of it. So it will also work great on desktop Linux!</p>
<p>From what the developer said: "'Old School Rally' features nostalgic visual aesthetics and thrilling racing gameplay loyal to the classic era. With over 55,000 wishlists and a passionate community, "Old School Rally" has taken players' feedback seriously. The Early Access version of 'Old School Rally' includes many important features and improvements requested by the community, such as Ghost, Steering Sensitivity, Stage Optimization, and Wheel Support, along with new cars, new stages, and a brand new "Rally" mode. Of course, as Early Access progresses, planned new game modes, new features, and new content will be patched into the game regularly!"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="62T8hbNBXfo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fdb06debb31eecbe3832d3f42dc0fe46.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/62T8hbNBXfo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2824660/Old_School_Rally/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>. It will be priced at $9.99.</p>
<p>Nice to see a resurgence in these retro-racers that go for fun, rather than realistic visuals. Like we've seen with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/drive-rally-gets-a-new-trailer-to-show-off-new-gameplay-and-features/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#DRIVE Rally</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/parking-garage-rally-circuit-coming-by-dev-of-jellycar-with-linux-steam-deck-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Parking Garage Rally Circuit</a> recently.</p>

      <title>NonSteamLaunchers for installing popular stores on Steam Deck has big improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NonSteamLaunchers is a tool for installing various popular game stores / launchers on Steam Deck and desktop Linux with the latest release being a big improvement.</p>
<p>The developer released version 3.9.1 towards the end of June, which included a big refactor to the code and managed to cut it down quite a lot. As a result, it has also fixed "the EA APP path not found error as well as battles nets and GOG's errors from installing at times".</p>
<p>Not only that, the developer said it's much easier to add launchers now, so anyone can take a look at the code and submit a launcher they think will work.</p>
<p>ProtonTricks compatibility has also seen a big improvement with this release. The uninstall button should now work properly for all launchers and there's a new "Legacy Games" scanner.</p>
<p>It currently supports the Amazon Games Launcher, Battle.net, EA App, Epic Games, GOG Galaxy, Humble Games Collection, IndieGala, Itch.io, Legacy Games, Rockstar Games Launcher, Ubisoft Connect, Glyph, Playstation Plus and also VK Play. On top of that it supports setting up various streaming services like Netflix. This is probably one of the simplest ways to get everything you need up and running.</p>
<p>See more in the <a href="https://github.com/moraroy/NonSteamLaunchers-On-Steam-Deck/releases" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>
<p>You can download it manually and use it as a standalone app on Linux desktop / Steam Deck, and it's also being made into a Decky Loader plugin but it's <a href="https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-plugin-database/pull/527" rel="noopener" target="_blank">not quite</a> finished for that yet. See all on <a href="https://github.com/moraroy/NonSteamLaunchers-On-Steam-Deck" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>Warzone 2100 - the Campaign Choices Update is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The free and open source RTS Warzone 2100 has a big new upgrade out with the Campaign Choices Update. Making it better than ever and a great time to pick it back up. Warzone 2100 was originally a full proprietary commercial release back in 1999, but it was eventually made open source.</p>
<p>Still to this day it's one of the most unique real-time strategy games around, and it's awesome to see it continue to evolve thanks to a dedicated group of coders.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8095360411720512827gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8095360411720512827gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

<li><strong>Addon Campaign: Fractured Kingdom</strong>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>Fix issues, improve situations including: all players loaded but spectator is blocking game start, lagging / infinite ping in the lobby</li>
</ul>
</li>

      <title>Clean up the ocean in the demo for Spilled!</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Spilled! from developer Lente is a sweet casual game about driving your little boat around to clean up the ocean. It has a new demo available with a big graphics upgrade. Tested working great on desktop Linux with Proton 9.</p>
<p>Not only is this cute game about a boat, it's <em>made</em> on a boat too. Solo developer Lente from the Netherlands lives and develops her games on a boat. She grew up on a ship and that has always stayed with her, and she and her mother renovated the boat, making it one of the most original game studio locations!</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6DEt2Yw8GrM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/579f15458375cfb1fce915a805a94b7b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6DEt2Yw8GrM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Short but satisfying - Move through 8 areas, each bigger in size and with more waste. No rush, take as long as you want. Spilled! is a short yet cozy game that you can finish in 1 hour, but you can use the level select to go back to any area if you just want to relax!</li>
<li>Recycle &amp; earn coins - Clean up a whole area to move on to the next! The water gets clearer the more you recycle, revealing underwater life that is different for each area!</li>
<li>Upgrade your boat - Prepare for the next area: tackle bigger oil spills with a bigger collector, hold more oil with an upgraded tank and cover larger distances with upgraded speed!</li>
<li>Find &amp; rescue animals - Each area has 2 different animals to find and rescue, for a total of 16! See which ones you've already saved in the options menu. Or which ones you've missed!</li>
<li>Face new challenges - Each area has a new challenge to overcome! Push plastic to the recycling centre, wash oil off of the land, help retrieve lost items to other boats, put out wildfires, go magnet fishing and more currently in development!</li>
<li>Explore new biomes - While cleaning up the environment, you move through 4 biomes: grass, rock, sand and snow!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240080/Spilled/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a>. The developer said during the successful <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lentegamedev/spilled" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> that it will have full Steam Deck support too. </p>

      <title>Dimhaven Enigmas is a new first-person puzzler from the team behind Quern</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Zadbox Entertainment who created the Myst-like Quern - Undying Thoughts are working on another interesting first-person puzzler with Dimhaven Enigmas. It's confirmed to once again have Native Linux support.</p>
<p>In Dimhaven Enigmas the player takes on the role of Emily Ravenstone on a mission to find her uncle on Dimhaven: an isolated island in an alternate reality in the 1980s. The once lively tourist paradise is now left almost completely abandoned and isolated by the mysterious events of the last few years. Air traffic is almost non-existent, and most of the residents left just before the closure of the airport. Cargo transportation ceased long ago, and barely any news reaches the island - and none leaves it. Or at least so it seems.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cm2BFzqnQnI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/09f80f3ead9d18a9a36101a2770f6c49.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cm2BFzqnQnI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>To tackle annoying pixel hunting and to be a little more inviting for casual adventurers, the game also features interaction indicators and a progressive hint system. This system offers gradually more revealing hints based on the items in your inventory, puzzle progress, found clues and most importantly: a safe way to nose around inside the game without breaking immersion.</p>
<p>The game's soundtrack is composed by Marcell Kerepesi, who scored the whole of Quern’s beautiful OST. Dimhaven’s music and atmosphere is powered by a dynamic system that will always adapt to the player’s progress.</p>
<p>You can check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2458980/Dimhaven_Enigmas/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a> and support it on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zadbox/dimhaven-enigmas" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>.</p>

      <title>Chaotic multiplayer physics-brawler Bare Butt Boxing releases in August</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After being in Early Access since May last year, Tuatara Games are readying up their chaotic brawler Bare Butt Boxing for release on August 1.</p>
<p>Tuatara Games usually work in the field of visual effects for AAA studios like Riot Games (Valorant), Epic Games (Fortnite), Counterplay Games (Godfall), and many more but wanted more and so Bare Butt Boxing is their first self-published game.</p>
<p>Colourful and mischievous aliens land on Earth to host unregulated boxing matches. Launch your opponents or the giant beach ball in portals to earn points based on which game mode is on. Whoever has the most points when the round is over wins! Face up to 3 friends locally, join 6-player online matches, or fight with bots in single player mode.</p>
<p>Punching is not the only key to victory : collect item boxes to use special powers like the powerful vacuum and super frenzy to turn the tides of battle. Keep an eye on stage hazards to avoid falling off the level! The gusting winds on the Mountain top and disappearing platforms at the neon disco Arcade can mess your score badly if you are not careful.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3Sb3wLYwedg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dff5c3959b8bab1914898745617a61c6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3Sb3wLYwedg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“We are truly grateful to all the players that joined us in Early Access. With 1.0 we wanted to wrap up the game with more content and a bigger emphasis on local multiplayer, which has been heavily requested.” said Klemen Lozar, founder of Tuatara Games.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1186660/Bare_Butt_Boxing/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it or buy it on Steam right now</a>. The full game updates on August 1st. It has Native Linux support but no Steam Deck rating currently.</p>

      <title>Bite-sized roguelike tower defense game Bella Wants Blood releases July 24</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Sonderland (previously worked on Landnama, Core Defense) announced their roguelike tower defense game Bella Wants Blood is going to release on July 24 and it's a perfect coffee-break game. <u>Note</u>: the developer sent over a key, thoughts will be up around release.</p>
<p>What they said about it: "We made Bella Wants Blood as an absurd, bite-sized roguelike terror defense game with a ‘Slay the Spire’ style map of branching paths to choose the battles you want to face along with the rewards that come with them. It’s bloody, silly, easy to pick up and play, and brimming with ridiculous atmosphere."</p>
<p>Giving you small levels where you carve out a path, along with different types of strange towers, and then the progress from the likes of Slay the Spire, it's certainly an interesting combo.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="pl3KKcAHPUk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/aafffec8e205c5e1516e0f055d9aeab7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/pl3KKcAHPUk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's now releasing July 24th with Native Linux support for $4.99.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

      <title>Valve fixes up the new Riven from Cyan Worlds videos on Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cyan Worlds Inc recently released the brand new Riven that's a re-imagined, and expanded version of the classic from 1997. It had a bit of trouble with videos on Linux / Steam Deck though.</p>
<p>Writing on X (Twitter), Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais <a href="https://x.com/Plagman2/status/1809637510047576444" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A fix has just been deployed for the missing videos in Riven.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Griffais didn't go into detail on what was changed, and it seems it wasn't through a Proton update. Looking on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1712350/history/?changeid=24262025" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, they've tagged it as using H.264. So it's a back-end change Valve did on their servers, to ensure that the videos get sorted correctly for Linux players using Proton on Linux desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LN1TQm942_U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/263aebe9a1b0d4a989efe9d8d0417f1b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LN1TQm942_U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Riven takes you on a journey through dense jungles, awe-inspiring caverns, and monolithic structures. Explore a world bent to the whims of a man who sees himself as a god and where every corner will immerse you in an otherworldly adventure.</p>
<p><em>Riven</em> rewards careful observation. Challenge <em>Riven’s</em> cunning puzzles, deftly woven throughout its narrative. The environment of <em>Riven</em> will reveal the story of this world as you make meaning from seemingly disparate bits of information and learn everything you need to know about this world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a reminder, to get the re-encoded videos for games in Proton, you need to have the Shader Pre-Cache system turned on in Steam (Settings -&gt; Downloads).

      <title>GE-Proton 9-10 adds ELDEN RING EAC fix, pulls in latest DXVK code for d8vk</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GE-Proton 9-10 was released July 7th updating various internal tech as usual to improve gaming on Linux / Steam Deck so here's what's new.</p>
<p>Firstly, until FromSoftware actually fix up ELDEN RING EAC for players who don't own the DLC, GE-Proton now includes the fix I suggested users try <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/elden-ring-should-now-have-fixed-the-inappropriate-activity-issue/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">in my previous article</a>. Apart from that, it's just updating the various included parts like DXVK and VKD3D-Proton to the very latest code available from Git which includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Updated wine to latest bleeding edge</li>
<li>Updated wine-mono to 9.2.0</li>
<li>Updated dxvk to latest git (which includes d8vk now)</li>
<li>Removed d8vk build options as it's part of dxvk now</li>
<li>Updated proton script so that d8vk is enabled by default as part of dxvk's files</li>
<li>Updated vkd3d-proton to latest git</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>While DXVK hasn't seen a fresh release yet (likely sometime soon), the latest Git code has now pulled in d8vk for supporting Direct3D 8 over Vulkan. Which means DXVK now does Direct3D 8/9/10/11!</p>
<p>See more in the <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton9-10" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release notes</a>. You can install GE-Proton with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/ge-proton-installer-protonup-qt-v292-released/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ProtonUp-Qt</a>.</p>

      <title>Tech-noir musical tactics game All Walls Must Fall is now permanently free</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer inbetweengames announced that their game All Walls Must Fall from 2018 is now permanently free.</p>
<p>More about it: All Walls Must Fall is an isometric tactics game where actions happen to the pulsing beat of the music. You control time travelling secret agents as they jump and loop through a single night in the city of Berlin. Using a pausable real-time system, carefully plan your decisions and use powerful time manipulation abilities to your advantage, as you carry out your mission in the shadows or in plain sight. Levels are procedurally recombined, giving All Walls Must Fall a highly replayable campaign structure, while still offering individually crafted components and set-pieces.</p>
<p>All Walls Must Fall takes inspiration from genre classics like X-Com, Syndicate and REZ, as well more recent indie games like The Banner Saga, Braid, SUPERHOT and Crypt of the Necrodancer.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2Zc77HwYflI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/053eb72de96cee07801e741d18ef23c5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2Zc77HwYflI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

<blockquote>
<p>It's been 6 years since we released All Walls Must Fall, and we've decided that we'd love if everyone who always wanted to play but never quite got around to buying it has the opportunity. So it's now totally free on Steam and itch.io!</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy playing our tech-noir tactics game that we made. We put a lot of our hearts into it, and while we've all moved on to other projects now, that time we made our own little indie game will always be special to us.</p>
<p>Love from Berlin,<br/>
Isaac, David and Rafal<br/>
inbetweengames</p>
</blockquote>

      <title>The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak adds English support plus Steam Deck upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak from Nihon Falcom, PH3 GmbH and NIS America, Inc. hit Steam back in March 2023. However, it was only supported for the Japanese language, now it's been updated in a big way with English language support and Steam Deck improvements too.</p>
<p>For the Steam Deck with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> they mentioned they made changes to the UI to render at a better quality for lower resolutions where "UI text is now much more readable on these devices". So it should be a good experience now too. Nice to see some attention there as always!</p>
<p>There's lots more new in this update including improved shadows, improved reflections, HDR support, Dynamic Steam Cloud support, MSAA, SGSSAA, and transparency MSAA, a modification to the physics system to improve it at high framerates and the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2138610/view/4156338670609987904" rel="noopener" target="_blank">list goes on</a>.</p>

      <title>Comedy adventure 3 Minutes to Midnight set to release in August</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a good bit of silence, 3 Minutes to Midnight is pretty much done now with the developers noting they're reading it for release in August. This follows their Kickstarter success back in 2019.</p>
<p>What is it? A comedy adventure with a sprawling story and colorful cast. Betty Anderson can’t remember who she is, but she has bigger worries—like a doomsday plot threatening to wipe out the human race. Join Betty to crack the conspiracy that starts with a bang and ends at 3 Minutes to Midnight.</p>
<p>The latest update on their <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/scarecrowstudio/3-minutes-to-midnight-a-comedy-graphic-adventure/posts/4138491" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kickstarter notes</a> it will be "released between the 5th and the 16th of August 2024" with a proper set date and new trailer due <em>sometime</em> soon. Language support has also expanded so now it will have support for Spanish, German, English, French, Brazilian Portuguese, and Catalan with others coming post-release.</p>
<p>It also clearly notes the game will have full Native Linux and Steam Deck support at release.</p>
<p>They also put up a sneak-peak video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JPap_Yw5kxw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fac080816129a03e1095e9829c4613d7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JPap_Yw5kxw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The full post goes into a fair bit of detail all the improvements they've managed to put in, along with various things that went wrong like logistical issues with the actors, technical issues and more. Worth a read.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/832500/3_Minutes_to_Midnight__A_Comedy_Graphic_Adventure/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

Here you get to discover new worlds with unique challenges, exploit their novel resources for advanced technological gains, and manage your fleet of interplanetary space platforms. Of course that comes with its own set of perils like asteroids that need to be shot down, or captured for fuel and ammo.</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">The new planets will each be rather different with these being revealed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vulcanus - Blazing volcanic mountains, imposing geological landforms, plains blanketed in ash, and thick yellow sulfuric fog that burns your lungs and etches your eyes.</li>
<li>Fulgora - A lifeless and desolate place. The thin air is freezing cold but bone dry. A distant sun twinkles in the dull purple of the sky. Wispy clouds race by as a gale whips up sand that grates against your armour.</li>
<li>Gleba - A vibrant multi-coloured swampy landscape shrouded in a light mist. The air is thick and humid, carrying the muffled cries of unseen animals from far away.</li>
</ul>
<p>They say a 5th planet yet to be shown "promises some of the most unique gameplay but it remains shrouded in mystery". It's the furthest from the sun so it's going to be dark and cold. <em>Curious.</em></p>
<p>We're also getting elevated rails, so your rail networks can cross over obstacles, cross the oceans and — you get the idea. You'll be able to make much more fancy rail systems. There's also a new quality system for items, entities and equipment, new music, new enemies and defence systems and plenty more to be announced.</p>
<p>And that's all on top of the big 2.0 update that will give us goodies like a new fluid system, smarter worker robots and much more.</p>

      <title>GameCube and Wii emulator Dolphin moves to a more rapid release cycle</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The team behind the free and open source GameCube and Wii emulator Dolphin have announced a big change to their plans, along with a new much more rapid release schedule.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2024/07/02/dolphin-releases-announcement/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> they mentioned how the last actual "release" with 5.0 was back in 2016, and they've just continually added bits to it over time. Now though, they're doing away with that and moving to a "rolling release cycle" as they said:</p>
<p>"However, the purpose of our old stable builds is now no longer relevant to Dolphin Emulator. We no longer need a benchmark to compare against or an anchor to ground us. We have grown beyond them. So in leaving the 5.0 era behind, we are also leaving behind that release scheme and all it offered. In exchange, we're not just giving you a release today, but also a commitment to continuous releases from now on. The long drought of Dolphin releases is no more and will never happen again!"</p>
<p>Now they will have proper fully tagged releases based on the year and month, so the latest brand new release is 2407 that went up 2 days ago. Development builds will simply add a number after for the number of code commits done like 2407-144 and they will continue to roll out multiple releases a year and said they will keep doing progress report blog posts too.</p>
<p>The blog announcement goes over details about why it's not just being called Dolphin 6.0 and to sum up a few paragraphs there — they just didn't feel it was needed due to how development has come along in the last eight years</p>
<p>Also they have a refreshed logo:</p>

      <title>#DRIVE Rally gets a new trailer to show off new gameplay and features</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>#DRIVE Rally is actually looking pretty darn good. A reinvention of classic 90s rally racing with a whole lot of content and features to be excited about.</p>
<p>From a roster of up to 36 legendary rally cars, to the more than 400 kilometers of winding roads and paths that you will be able to drive with keyboard and mouse, gamepads and yes racing wheels are supported too. We'll be able to experience the thrill of rally racing with passionate co-drivers that "react dynamically to your driving, offering both praise and critique while helping you navigate the twists and turns of every stage". Plenty of customization too with a variety of paint jobs, decals, and performance upgrades to make each car truly your own.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bFQKXF8DFl4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6018b1fd3f2d83a6d3f41efadc5d9616.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bFQKXF8DFl4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>#DRIVE All Over the World</strong>: From the sunny landscapes of Dry Crumbs, through the whispering woods of Holzberg, to the chilly wilderness of Revontuli, each track offers unique features and asks drivers to go the distance.</li>
<li><strong>Legendary Cars</strong>: Jump behind the wheel of legendary rally cars, including Das Holzwagen, The Doggo, The Bobond, and many more from the studio’s previous title #DRIVE. New from the ‘90s era are Das Sandsturm and Celestia, just for a start!</li>
<li><strong>Passionate Co-Drivers</strong>: For better or worse, your co-driver is with you to the end! There to help and lend some humourous jabs, they’re your trusty navigator —and your worst critic.</li>
<li><strong>#DRIVE Design</strong>: It’s your way <em>and</em> the highway, baby! From tires to tailpipe, build your car to your liking. Add your special touches with paintwork, decals, and decorations. Take a picture in Photo Mode - it’ll last longer.</li>
<li><strong>#DRIVE Like it’s 1999</strong>: pumped up with 90’s Easter Eggs and references in an adoring homage to the thunderous days of rally racing circa 1990s, this game feels like a finely-tuned arcade experience, with no coins needed.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It will have Native Linux support at release. With a plan for Early Access sometime "this Autumn".</p>

      <title>Castle Come is a &#39;walking fortress roguelike&#39; that sounds simply awesome</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now and then I come across a game and just think - I have to have it. Castle Come is one of those times, a roguelike where you control a walking fortress you build up as you go. Hopefully it will work with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> on Linux / Steam Deck, I will be surprised if it doesn't.</p>
<p>In Castle Come, you scout a strange land full of bandits in search of new parts, defeat enemy fortresses and scavenge the wreckage, recruit crew to man your growing arsenal of weapons and build your way from an agile little fortling into a deadly, hulking, monster machine.</p>
<p>In combat, <em>Castle Come</em> switches to a <em>Tekken</em>-inspired 2.5D fighting view where you can make use of sidesteps, dodges and rams. Take advantage of a stylish time-slowing feature that kicks in whenever you line up a shot from one of your arsenal of weapons - from machine guns and mine launchers, to chicken pens and giant boulders. Take control of every weapon yourself, or leave your crew to fire at will as you juggle active reloads, cooldowns and movement in the search for maximum efficiency on the battlefield. </p>

      <title>Here&#39;s how to fix the ELDEN RING &#39;inappropriate activity&#39; issue on Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A new patch has been rolled out for ELDEN RING, and it's supposed to fix the inappropriate activity detected message from their anti-cheat with a bit of manual effort. Here's what to do. This issue affected Linux desktop, Steam Deck and it seems people on Windows PCs as well.</p>
<p>From their patch notes for version 1.12.3 it notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In the PC Version, the message "Inappropriate activity detected" may appear without cheating.</li>
</ul>
<p>To fix this issue, please verify the integrity of the game's files before restarting the game.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the PC version, unstable framerate may be caused by third party applications that control mouse behavior. Deactivating these third party applications may improve performance.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>For once, it wasn't a Linux system specific issue.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13498587471720086053gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13498587471720086053gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>To note, I do <strong>not</strong> have the DLC yet. And it seems FromSoftware haven't been doing thorough testing for people who do <em>not</em> have the DLC. If you <em>do</em> have the DLC, verifying the files might be enough to fix it as they suggest.</p>
<p>What if you <em>don't</em> have the DLC? Well, thanks to an answer on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1245620#pqU185GyV2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a>, you <em>can</em> fix it yourself. As always, do my fix suggestions <u>at your own risk</u>.</p>
<p>All you have to do is open up the installed folder, go into the "Game" folder and create an empty "DLC.bdt" file.</p>
<p>So in Steam (Desktop mode for Steam Deck) -&gt; Right click on ELDEN RING -&gt; properties -&gt; Installed files -&gt; Browse. Then go into the Game folder. Two ways to do it (tested using KDE Plasma):</p>
<ul>
<li>Right click -&gt; create new -&gt; text file -&gt; name it in the text box "DLC.bdt" (remove the .txt).</li>
<li><u>OR</u> Right click in an empty space -&gt; select Open Terminal Here and type "touch DLC.bdt".</li>
</ul>
<p>And you're done. It will now work.</p>

      <title>The community won the battle, so PvP battler Fishards is now open source</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Back in June the developers of Fishards put out a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/fight-the-devs-of-fishards-if-you-win-it-goes-open-source-lose-and-its-deleted-from-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bit of an ultimatum</a>: fight them in-game and win to make the game open source, or they will nuke the game from orbit.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the community came together, and won. So now Fishards has been made <a href="https://github.com/charlesmaddock/fishards" rel="noopener" target="_blank">open source</a>, and it's still free to play on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1637140/Fishards/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DHhCwnTPqf8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c49fc4a35152bb162d3e71ba1f99d0d6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DHhCwnTPqf8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A good chance for people to learn from a complete and released game.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Playable. Perhaps now someone can put in a few fixes to get it bumped up to Steam Deck Verified, and keep expanding it. The game uses <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, so there's nothing stopping a willing developer having a look to see what they can do.</p>
<p>Always nice to see another game become open source to ensure it can live on forever.</p>

      <title>PSA: If you use Bazzite you need to do a manual fix to get updates</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://bazzite.gg/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bazzite</a>, the popular version of Linux powered by Fedora and Universal Blue that's great for handhelds including the Steam Deck, ASUS ROG Ally, Lenovo Legion Go and others needs a little manual user effort after a bit of human error.</p>
<p>Unless you take action, you will <em>not</em> get any updates going forward. Developer Jorge O. Castro noted in a forum post how they "were rotating our cosign keypairs this morning, which is the method that we use to sign our images" and unfortunately they "made a critical error which has resulted in forcing you to take manual steps to migrate to our newly signed images".</p>
<p>However, this only affects people who installed Bazzite on a device before July 2nd, if you downloaded it <em>after</em> July 3rd, you're all good.</p>
<p>They have a script set up that you can run that will fix the problem, so all you have to do is run this in a terminal app (<a href="https://github.com/ublue-os/config/blob/5c4144d38a2a61e44ca704ffdf2d50bbcb9ff7ed/scripts/fix-key-and-update.sh" rel="noopener" target="_blank">code source</a>):</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">curl -sL https://fix.universal-blue.org/ | sudo bash </code></p>
<p>To ensure it doesn't ever happen again, they've noted some <a href="https://github.com/ublue-os/main/issues/600" rel="noopener" target="_blank">process changes</a> to be implemented.</p>
<p>See all the details in the <a href="https://universal-blue.discourse.group/t/important-announcement-regarding-system-updates-action-needed/2689" rel="noopener" target="_blank">forum post announcement</a>.</p>

      <title>Nexus mods want feedback from Linux / Steam Deck users on their new cross-platform app</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/nexus-mods-app-is-an-in-development-replacement-for-vortex-that-will-support-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I wrote about the brand new Nexus mods app</a> before, as it's quite a promising and <em>exciting</em> development for the future of modding (especially for Linux and Steam Deck). And now, they want your feedback.</p>
<p>This is going to replace their previous apps like Vortex, eventually anyway. Right now, it's only made ready for Stardew Valley, since it's a very popular game for mods and is also cross-platform so it makes it simpler for them to get all the features of the app ready.</p>
<p>Yesterday, July 1st, they announced the Alpha release of this next-generation mod manager and their new Product Manager got in touch to mention they "would be really keen to get feedback from Linux users". So this is your chance to ensure Linux (and Steam Deck) finally become a first-class citizen for game modding.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4821676801719938448gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4821676801719938448gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - me testing out the Nexus Mod app</em></p>
<p>They said they plan to release an app update every 3 weeks going forward, and the next game they plan to add support for will be Cyberpunk 2077.</p>
<p>See more in <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15033" rel="noopener" target="_blank">their news post</a>. Exciting times ahead!</p>
<p>You can grab it from their <a href="https://nexus-mods.github.io/NexusMods.App/users/GettingStarted/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">download page</a>, and the source code is on <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

      <title>Magnificent chunky shooter Selaco gets a &#39;MEGA&#39; update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Selaco is easily one of the biggest highlights of the year, with its mixture of over-the-top action and chunky retro visuals. Altered Orbit Studios also just pushed out a big upgrade for it. <em>ICYMI: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/selaco-is-now-in-early-access-one-of-the-best-shooters-ive-played-in-forever/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">See my initial review for more thoughts</a>.</em></p>
<p>Not only is there a lot of improvements to the game, but the soundtrack is now live too, along with a bunch of bonus content thrown in like unused tracks that didn't make it into the game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1606647811719935736gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1606647811719935736gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the highlights from the update include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added "Resume Game" button in the main menu.</li>
<li>Added level versioning system.</li>
<li>Added "Hard-Boiled!" mutator.</li>
<li>Added "Armor Up" mutator.</li>
<li>Added "Extended Bullet Casings" graphical setting.</li>
<li>New weapon upgrades.</li>
<li>Weapon kit reworks.</li>
<li>Improved navigation in the earlier levels.</li>
<li>Improved general feel of the game.</li>
<li>Improved map screen.</li>
<li>Improved movement options.</li>
<li>Blood is now 0.2% more purple.</li>
<li>+ lots more.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They also mentioned a save issue between Steam Deck / Linux and Windows that should be solved now too. So if you've swapped between Proton and the Native Build (Or a Windows PC and a Steam Deck), it shouldn't lose any saves. For some reason, Valve still have it tagged for Proton.</p>
<p>Improvements to the save system are welcome, especially with it being in Early Access and many updates are expected, it's nice to see they're working to ensure progress isn't lost. And for those of you who love the gore, they made various improvements to the gore system too like applying more speed variations between different chunks of gore and they added sound effects when gibbing corpses (oh my!).</p>
<p>Altered Orbit Studios mentioned they're taking a short vacation now but after that expect work on the Randomizer Mode, more story elements and production for Chapter 2 to continue.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">buy Selaco on Steam</a> priced at $24.99 / €24.50 / £20.99.</p>

      <title>Linux Mint 22 &#39;Wilma&#39; gets a Beta release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Linux Mint 22 'Wilma' has a first Beta release available for testing, built on top of Ubuntu 24.04 it will be supported until 2029. With this being a Beta it's not recommended for everyone, only if you wish to test for issues and help get it primed for the full release that's likely due either late this month or early August.</p>
<p>A pretty big upgrade overall. Thanks to the jump in the Ubuntu package base it's using, with kernel version 6.8 along with Pipewire by default. With the newer kernel, you'll get support for newer hardware too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1687156611719934951gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1687156611719934951gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Linux Mint 22 'Wilma' Beta with the Cinnamon desktop</em></p>

<li>Better language support.</li>
<li>Thunderbird as a .deb package supported by Mint, instead of Ubuntu's Snap.</li>
<li>Big improvements to the Software Manager:
<ul>
<li>Improved multi-threading, a new preferences page and a banner slideshow.</li>

</li>
<li>Various artwork improvements.</li>
<li>HiDPI support improvements were made in the boot sequence, in Plymouth and Slick-Greeter.</li>

<ul>
<li>Less printer added notifications (silenced for 2 hours).</li>
<li>Wayland support: Clutter polkit agent.</li>
<li>Spices: keybindings support.</li>

      <title>Will anything dethrone the Steam Deck? Probably not</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While other vendors continually push out new handheld pc models, sticking similar internals into different shell designs and gradually bumping up RAM or the Processor, the Steam Deck just keeps selling like hot tasty cakes.</p>
<p>There's multiple other devices out there now that are in a few ways more powerful than the Steam Deck, but that hasn't seemed to matter a whole lot to Valve. Especially since the release of the Steam Deck OLED, which was a pretty huge upgrade, it's constantly a global top seller for Valve.</p>
<p>I've been tracking it over time from their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topsellers/global/2024-6-25" rel="noopener" target="_blank">public list</a>, which is done by revenue (not units sold), and of course the price of the Steam Deck compared with games and DLC is a lot higher, but when you think about how many units the likes of ELDEN RING and other top games sell - it's clear Valve are shifting a lot of Steam Deck units still.</p>
<p>Here's the latest data based on the global position:</p>

<p>When compared with other vendors like GPD, AYANEO, ASUS and all the others, Valve of course have the Steam store to back it up. Other vendors don't really have anything like that, so Valve are in a more unique position to stick to one main model. And when Valve discount it, people will continue to flock to it. Other vendors continue to be a <em>gamble</em>, as you buy one model and they're probably just about to move onto their next.</p>
<p>This has so many benefits for players as well though, like good consistent support and <em>constant</em> software upgrades. You only have to look at the new built-in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/steam-game-recording-beta-announced-works-on-linux-and-steam-deck-too/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Game Recording feature</a> to see, and the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/steamos-36-preview-for-steam-deck-brings-numerous-big-new-features/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.6</a> that recently moved from Preview to Beta that again brings in some big additions.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Currently there's <u>15,398</u> games for Steam Deck rated to be Playable or Verified:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verified: 5,047</li>
<li>Playable: 10,351</li>
<li>Unsupported: 4,297</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh yeah, the title, will anything dethrone the Steam Deck? Probably not. <em>Well, not until the Steam Deck 2.</em></p>
