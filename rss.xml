      <title>Hytale arrives in Early Access in January 2026 after being revived</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After being cancelled by Riot Games and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/hytale-has-been-saved-as-hypixel-acquired-it-from-riot-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">revived as an indie game again</a>, Hytale is now set for an Early Access launch in January 2026. Pre-purchasing will open December 13th, with it going live January 13th.</p>
<p>No doubt many are excited about this since it had a lot of followers watching it in previous years, thanks to its blend of a sort-of Minecraft style but more of a proper RPG. So a bit like Minecraft and Skyrim combined you might say.</p>
<p>In a fresh <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-early-access-january-13-2026" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> the developer makes it clear this will be a very real <em>early</em> access, not like a lot of the early access styled stuff we see on Steam where the game is nearly finished. This will be "very much unfinished and will be buggy for a while" and they expect the "first impression will be rough". Still, it's going to be nice to finally see it out, and with the creators actually in full control.</p>
<p>Just over a week ago they also put up a nice long slice of gameplay too:</p>

<p>Are you excited for Hytale?</p>

      <title>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault has another patch for Steam Deck and to improve performance for all</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault from Digital Sun and 11 bit studios should run a whole lot smoother for everyone now, and feel better on Valve's Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Hot on the heels of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/moonlighter-2-the-endless-vault-enters-early-access-and-work-is-ongoing-to-improve-it-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the last big patch</a>, another update has been rolled out that should be a pretty dramatic improvement to the feel of it overall. There's a fair bit more to the patch than just performance upgrades and tweak for Steam Deck but the highlights for you are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Big pass on stuttering. We’ve cleaned up a lot of unused or unnecessary data throughout the game. You should now see way less stuttering, and in many cases, virtually none at all.</li>
<li>Controls, performance, and menus are more Deck-friendly now, ie, Settings and Difficulty selection screen being easier to read and navigate.</li>
<li>Default Steam Deck graphics settings now use FSR3 – Quality instead of Balanced, for a sharper, more stable look right from the start.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Once again - it's great to see such dedicated support for Steam Deck / SteamOS. Always great to see, as a result it should run even better on Desktop Linux with Proton too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DMRITAHclXc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2ed951a1343c544b2277417c9e49c7c2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DMRITAHclXc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it from the Steam page: "Dive deep into Action-RPG with roguelike elements and a tale about new beginnings. With no coin to your name, you and the other townsfolk find yourselves stranded in the distant village of Tresna. Now, it’s up to you to get back on your feet and turn your humble shop into the beating heart of the village’s wealth. Explore dangerous dungeons, gather relics, sell them, and reinvest in your friends’ establishments. Unlock new weapons, armor, shop decorations, and—more importantly—restore hope that things can one day turn around."</p>

      <title>itch.io is hosting a creator day today where they take no fee from developers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>On top of doing their own Black Friday sale, the indie store <a href="http://itch.io" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">itch.io</a> has its Creator Day today as well where they take no cut from developers. A nice chance to support a smaller store that does a fair amount of good for indies, along with supporting indies directly.</p>
<p>There's a whole lot of weird stuff on itch.io though including old demos, old alpha versions of games and more - it can be pretty difficult to find the good. So keeping that in mind I previously <a href="https://itch.io/c/1674813/best-linux-games" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">created a list</a> of some great Linux games you can find on the store. All the games in that special curated list have a Native Linux version too. There's over 160 games in my collection with a whole bunch more that I added in today for you.</p>
<p>Some quick highlights that are actually on a sale of some sort:</p>
<p><a href="https://itch.io/s/167286/black-friday-2025" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Double Fine Productions Bundle</a><br/>
<em>Plenty of classics inside like Full Throttle Remastered</em></p>
<p><a href="https://terrycavanagh.itch.io/dicey-dungeons" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Dicey Dungeons</a> - 50% off<br/>
<em>Fast-paced dungeon crawling where dice rolls control the flow</em></p>
<p><a href="https://devolverdigital.itch.io/terra-nil" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Terra Nil</a> - 50% off<br/>
<em>Transforming a barren, lifeless landscape into a thriving, vibrant ecosystem</em></p>
<p><a href="https://devolverdigital.itch.io/pikuniku" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Pikuniku</a> - 50% off<br/>
<em>A charming puzzle-exploration platformer</em></p>
<p><a href="https://eniko.itch.io/midboss" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">MidBoss</a> - 33% off<br/>
<em>A body-snatching roguelike that's like nothing else</em></p>
<p><a href="https://ellpeck.itch.io/tiny-life" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Tiny Life</a> - 25% off<br/>
<em>The Sims but pixel art basically</em></p>
<p>Loads more in my list that are not on sale but you can help support the developer with the itch.io Creator Day.</p>
<p>Head over to <a href="http://itch.io" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">itch.io</a> for all the deals. It only lasts 24 hours so it ends 8am UTC tomorrow.</p>

      <title>Where Winds Meet devs plan improved Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Where Winds Meet continues to be a big hit on Steam and it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/the-big-new-where-winds-meet-release-works-well-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">works quite well on Desktop Linux</a> but it needs a lot of improvements on Valve's Steam Deck.</p>
<p>On Steam Deck even with various settings dropped down and upscaling, the performance in various parts is just not playable with drops down to 20FPS and at times below. Thankfully, for any fans of this free to play RPG, there's plans from the developer Everstone Studio to get things into better shape.</p>
<p>Writing in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3564740/view/606425106922604161" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> post on Steam dated November 23rd, the developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the next two months, we will gradually roll out several updates, <strong>including Steam Deck compatibility</strong>, optimized multi-timezone display, split outfit customization, PS5 Pro support for PSSR, enhanced audio experience, and more. Our goal is to create a Jianghu that everyone can enjoy, and we welcome any further suggestions you may have.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Emphasis ours</em></p>
<p>Hopefully we won't be waiting too long on that. And, hopefully they actually get it to perform to a reasonable level. Optimising for the lower-end helps players across all hardware! Oh, and if they could actually make the settings available before forcing you into the game that would be good too. That's a sin some developers still haven't stopped.</p>
<p>Currently, the game is rated Steam Deck Unsupported by Valve. No anti-cheat annoyances though, you can jump in just fine - we're tracking various games on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our dedicated Linux / SteamOS anti-cheat page</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway - the deep dive. That's why you're here. The latest video features creators of the new Marrow and Death Wish episodes of Blood: Refreshed Supply, Dustin Twilley and Nick Palsmeier to talk about their experience creating the expansions and more behind the scenes work on the newer edition of the game.</p>

      <title>SIDE EFFECTS is a disturbing pill-popping roulette game out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SIDE EFFECTS from developer Free Lives takes the idea of Buckshot Roulette and puts a brutal pill-popping spin on it. <em>Note: a key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>Playable in solo against the NPC AI, or online for <em>up to</em> 4 players it's all about chugging down pills and often just hoping for the best since you don't exactly know which way the pills will swing for you. Sounds just like real life in some ways when it comes to medical issues. Only here, it's not about hoping the medication cures you - it's each player trying not to die while you're all strapped in.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10035363291764253507gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Based on rounds, with each beginning by giving you a set of tools to pick from and then dropping a bunch of pills on the table for you to take turns ingesting them. You have two different types of health bars in this one to keep an eye on and manage. There's your actual health, and a resistance meter that acts like armour with zero resistance meaning potentially certain death as it will drop one of your hearts.</p>
<p>While a lot of it is down to chance on the pills you take, there is a certain amount of strategy to it with the various tools you get. There's a sweet that let's you skip a turn, a hammer to smash a pill so no one can take it, a tool to detect what a pill will do and more. You even get an injection that will swap the effects of a pill, if you're feeling real lucky. You can even mess with other players using pliers now and then to pull out their teeth, dropping their resistance down - especially useful if you wish to focus on taking someone out. Bit gruesome though. </p>
<p>As the rounds go on, new pill types are introduced with different effects and so you have more and more that will potentially end your life.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yYk0ra-5qVg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dae2382c792678908f2d3ead8d62d920.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yYk0ra-5qVg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The online mode is the same just with more players available via matchmaking or joining via lobby codes. So it's nice to see both options available, especially if you don't always have people available to play with. And in my case, only one key was supplied so I had to test it out playing against randoms. Thankfully, the online mode does appear to work quite well to be able to. It's missing a bunch of options though like how it has <em>no</em> chat of any sort - so half the time you're waiting for the lobby to fill as players keep popping in and out.</p>
<p>SIDE EFFECTS can get pretty intense, especially when you're running low on health and other players have items that you know they're going to be saving for you. But I can't help the feeling like it's just missing something, it feels a bit too slow at times while you're waiting for your turn. This is one where I feel it's pretty much <em>essential</em> that you play it with people you know to get the full enjoyment out of it. </p>
<p>It's as disturbing as it is interesting as an experimental game of risk and works just fine with Proton 10 on Linux.</p>
<p>At £4.29 it's an interesting cheap choice to add to your list of games to play with friends.</p>

      <title>According to Epic CEO Tim Sweeney - game stores don&#39;t need an AI label as it will be everywhere</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the increasing amount of games using AI, Epic Game's Tim Sweeney believes the AI messages on stores like Steam make no sense.</p>
<p>Currently, if a game that's released on Steam uses generative AI in some way, it needs to be disclosed. Developers have to go through a content survey on their games to detail things like mature content and AI use. From Valve's own <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/contentsurvey" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">public rules</a> on it as a reminder first:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If your game used AI services during development or incorporates AI services as a part of the product, this section will require you to describe that implementation in detail:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pre-Generated:</strong> Any kind of content (art/code/sound/etc) created with the help of AI tools during development. Under the Steam Distribution Agreement, you promise Valve that your game will not include illegal or infringing content, and that your game will be consistent with your marketing materials. In our prerelease review, we will evaluate the output of AI generated content in your game the same way we evaluate all non-AI content - including a check that your game meets those promises.</li>
<li><strong>Live-Generated:</strong> Any kind of content created with the help of AI tools while the game is running. In addition to following the same rules as Pre-Generated AI content, this comes with an additional requirement - in the Content Survey, you'll need to tell us what kind of guardrails you're putting on your AI to ensure it's not generating illegal content.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You've probably seen the notices buried at the bottom of Steam store pages, like this one for Stellaris from Paradox Interactive:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="The developers describe how their game uses AI Generated Content like this:  We employ generative AI technologies during the creation of some assets. Typically this involves the ideation of content and visual reference material. These elements represent a minor component of the overall development. AI has been used to generate voices for an AI antagonist and a player advisor. " src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6433609421764249514gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Which you can make much bigger and clearer so you don't miss them with a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/the-useful-ai-warning-for-steam-script-has-been-turned-into-a-proper-browser-extension/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">browser plugin covered here on GamingOnLinux recently</a>.</p>
<p>Jumping into the discussion now is Epic Game's CEO Tim Sweeney, <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1993687499621728312" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posting</a> a reply to someone on X (Twitter):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="Initial Post: Steam and all digital marketplaces need to drop the “Made with AI” label.  It doesn’t matter any more., reply from Tim Sweeney: Agreed. The AI tag is relevant to art exhibits for authorship disclosure, and to digital content licensing marketplaces where buyers need to understand the rights situation. It makes no sense for game stores, where AI will be involved in nearly all future production." src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14909659391764249647gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>It's no surprise that Sweeney is in favour of it, with games like Fortnite previously using AI like being able to <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/this-will-be-a-day-long-remembered-speak-with-darth-vader-in-fortnite" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">chat with Darth Vader</a>.</p>
<p>The situation with generative AI is evolving constantly, but even Sweeney here notes there are rights issues. To be more specific: a lot of the generative AI models used everywhere are trained on material without the permission of the original author of various works. There's been many lawsuits on it to the point that I don't think I need to rehash any of that here - they're all reported on constantly in depth elsewhere.</p>
<p>Even if it does end up everywhere, it's still a good thing to know <em>how</em> it's being used - isn't it? It's a discussion that swings wildly between camps. AI slop makers and people in favour of AI generation will naturally not want these types of notices and will fight against them, while the other side no doubt value seeing the notice to make more informed purchasing decisions.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure - generative AI is complicating everything and companies are repeatedly enshittifying their products with generative AI, and it's going to continue on for some time.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on the AI disclosures? Leave a comment.</p>

      <title>Cleared Hot is everything you could want in a modern twin-stick helicopter shooter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cleared Hot just entered Early Access from developer Not Knowing Corporation and MicroProse Software, and it's simply pure joy to blast through it. <em>Note: a key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>The game is not yet finished, so any true review will have to wait until later. But clearly they're onto something great here. Especially great for me, since I grew up playing the likes of Desert Strike, Jungle Strike and others in the series. This definitely feels like a much more modernised version, bringing twin-stick helicopter action to everyone who loves a good action game like this. With the addition of the physics system, there's some pretty funny things you can do in it too.</p>
<p>I was already impressed by the demo they previously released, and now thanks to the Early Access release there's just a whole lot more of it to play. Right now there's the desert area, but they have plans to expand the game's campaign into multiple other biomes including a jungle, artic and urban environments will will be interesting to see how the gameplay changes and evolves across each.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8vVEHjc-vBk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a4d7b185992666fb334e4fecb1016372.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8vVEHjc-vBk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The physics system is the true highlight though, and one I hope they keep expanding as the game progresses during development. Being able to hook all sorts of random objects big and small, and throw them around to watch the chaos is just pure joy. Things get pretty messy in Cleared Hot, and it's the absurdity that the physics system brings that really makes it quite special and different to a few other attempts to modernise the classic helicopter combat games.</p>
<p>However, the physics system is a bit of a tease. Only certain types of objects can be picked up, I hope they adjust that to have more available. That, and the destruction system is great too, seeing towers and buildings crumble as you fire is great - but it needs more of that too as some don't at all.</p>
<p>Minor gripes aside, the atmosphere is fantastic. The audio is great, the voice over is fun and it all comes together quite nicely to really get you in the mood for flying.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Physics-Driven Mayhem</strong> - Everything moves, flies, and explodes with glorious realism - or at least plausible deniability.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Upgradeable Helicopters</strong> - Customize and upgrade your chopper to match your playstyle, from stealthy strikes to full-metal overkill.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Rope &amp; Magnet Gameplay</strong> - Pick up (almost) anything - vehicles, enemies, barrels, even your dignity - and weaponize the environment.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Tactical Squad Support</strong> - Deploy your troops, capture objectives, and provide covering fire - just try not to “accidentally” drop them.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Day &amp; Night Missions</strong> - Adapt to shifting light conditions using night vision or thermal optics to keep the advantage.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Creative Destruction</strong> - Physics means freedom - clear obstacles, sling debris, and improvise your way through every mission.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify">A few things are currently missing from it like cloud saves but they're working on it. That, and they have plans soonish to get it bumped up to Steam Deck Verified too as it's currently only listed as Playable, which is mainly due to some small text sizing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Unfortunately, there is one issue on Linux with Valve's official Proton. Some little video clips will <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-some-games-on-linux-steamos-steam-deck-have-broken-videos-and-what-you-can-do/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">give you a test screen instead of the video</a> which is the same issue I saw recently with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/sektori-is-absolutely-one-of-the-best-modern-twin-stick-shooters/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sektori</a>. A common codec issue that the developer will need to solve, but until then you can <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-ge-proton-on-steam-deck-steamos-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">use GE-Proton</a> to get the game working fully. I've given feedback to the developer on this. Apart from that, all fine with Proton.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">It only arrived on November 20th and already has an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam. Awesome.</p>

      <title>Valve release small Proton Experimental update for ARC Raiders, Uno and Far Cry 4</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Following on from a bigger <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/proton-experimental-for-steamos-linux-gets-fixes-for-marvel-rivals-blazblue-centralfiction-and-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton Experimental update for Linux / SteamOS last week</a>, a smaller bug-fix update has rolled out for the Windows compatibility tool. This is just to clear up a few pesky issues people have encountered.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's the changes for the November 26th update:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Xalia not interacting correctly with dialogs produced by ARC Raiders.</li>
<li>Fixed Proton Experimental regression that caused games like Uno and Far Cry 4 to not start.</li>
<li>Fixed voice line playback in Rigid Force Alpha.</li>
</ul>
<p>Source: <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Note: Xalia is what Valve use for adding gamepad support to desktop applications like launchers and dialog boxes that may pop up from games.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1159836361764242944gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1159836361764242944gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - ARC Raiders</em></p>
<p>How to get it: the update will show up in your Steam Downloads for Proton Experimental if you have it installed already. Otherwise, it will automatically download if you go to play a game that Valve has set for Proton Experimental by default. Or, you can manually search for Proton Experimental in your Steam Library to install it and try it on some games. See all the details on the different Proton versions in <a class="gol239" href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the GamingOnLinux Guide</a>. </p>
<p>ICYMI: Valve also recently release the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/proton-10-0-3-released-bringing-lots-of-improvements-for-gaming-on-linux-steamos-steam-machine/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">huge Proton 10 update</a>.</p>

      <title>The excellent Yet Another Zombie Survivors is finally Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Yet Another Zombie Survivors is one of the best suvivor-likes for its mixture of great action and fun features, and it's finally Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>It worked well for a while, and especially well on Desktop Linux with Proton, but needed various tweaks for the smaller handheld screen so this latest update will be great for other handhelds too. Valve have bumped it up from Playable since the latest update with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/proton-10-0-3-released-bringing-lots-of-improvements-for-gaming-on-linux-steamos-steam-machine/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently released Proton 10</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19740723511764239973gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The most recent update notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>To improve readability on smaller screens, the size of many texts and pop-ups has been increased.</li>
<li>HUD Scale (50%-150%) setting was added to the "Interface" tab in the Options menu.</li>
<li>Added some additional safeguards against potential save corruption (no amount of it is enough).</li>
<li>"Bricklayer" enemy projectiles slowed down by 15% &amp; improved indicator visibility.</li>
<li>Added new VFX particles to the game when "Blood and gore" setting is turned off.</li>
<li>The game now launches with a 60 FPS cap before it fully loads the limit set by the user.</li>
<li>Fix for "Reserve Bench" item not working correctly when equipped with "Gold Medal".</li>
<li>Mechanic: Trusty Spanner: Melee range increased slightly.</li>
<li>"Privacy Mode" setting moved to the user interface tab in the Options.</li>
<li>Fix for gameplay time displaying wrongly on the Save Slot UI.</li>
<li>Display &amp; control improvements for Run History interfaces.</li>
<li>Other interface-related improvements and tweaks.</li>
<li>Fixes for some other minor errors.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Death Stranding 2 looks set for a PC release - hopefully sometime soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>FINALLY. We can see that Death Stranding 2 is coming to PC thanks to a leak from a ratings board. The wait may be almost over, and just in time as I've gotten the partner to give the first game a download to join me in loving it.</p>
<p>The data comes from the ESRB, in a now-deleted post that we can see thanks to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251126052558/https://www.esrb.org/ratings/41057/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Wayback Machine</a>. Whenever it arrives, it will be a day-1 purchase from me to play on my Fedora KDE install. Perhaps we might even be graced with a release date during The Game Awards, which wouldn't be a surprise since Hideo Kojima has been there a few times in previous years.</p>
<p>Sony games often come to PC a good while (a year or more) after the PlayStation release (apart from Helldivers 2), but we're not even close to a year since Death Stranding 2 originally released so perhaps they are speeding this one up a bit.</p>
<p>Exciting times!</p>
<p>Here's the original PS5 trailer if you want to see it again or for the first time:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EQdOSTt7YpY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dc347ca4c3d8ded5ce85cd67c9931ced.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EQdOSTt7YpY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With such a huge game, the biggest issue will be how Proton will run it. However, Valve have made such massive improvements since the original released - so hopefully we won't run into any trouble. GamingOnLinux will let you know either way shortly after release.</p>

      <title>s&amp;box from Rust developer Facepunch is now open source</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>s&amp;box from Rust developer Facepunch is a modern game engine built on Valve's Source 2 and the latest .NET, and now it is open source! Quite a big surprise and it's using a proper permissive license too (MIT).</p>
<p>Facepunch say s&amp;box is a "spiritual successor to Garry’s Mod and a love letter to Source 2". So it's a mixture of a game engine, and a platform to launch and play games. A bit of an all in one solution, a little like Roblox too in that way.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://sbox.game/news/update-25-11-26" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on the official site they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Obviously this isn't the Source 2 code, that's up to Valve to open source if they want. For us Source 2 is providing lower level systems, all our high level systems are C# like the entire editor, networking, scene system, UI, and way more..</p>
<p>What this means is you can view, modify, copy any of our code to help improve s&amp;box with pull requests, or maintain your own fork for your standalone games, or even just take the code for your own engine.</p>
<p>It might seem odd from a business perspective to make an engine and give it away for free with no royalties and to give all the code away under open source. But we're a bunch of nerds that love what we're creating, we want everyone to use it in whatever way they want, we want to provide opportunities.</p>
<p>Open source is great for the game dev ecosystem, engines like Godot are awesome, we should have more of it because everyone wins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with basically all of that. Open source is awesome and it's nice to see another major developer get on board.</p>
<p>They also recently <a href="https://sbox.game/metrics/finance" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">opened up</a> their finances to the public to see, which is a really interesting step as well. Allowing anyone to go look at how much s&amp;box pulls in, and how much is being paid out to creators. Love seeing things like that too.</p>
<p>Pretty amazing to see them do all this. It doesn't mean s&amp;box will get Native Linux support though, as even if someone submitted code for it - they don't have to accept it. But what it does mean is anyone can fork it and turn it into something else, learn from it and even improve how it runs in Proton as developers can see exactly what it's doing.</p>
<p>You can find the open source code on <a href="https://github.com/Facepunch/sbox-public" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>Sektori is absolutely one of the best modern twin-stick shooters</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sektori blasted onto Steam recently and I've been absolutely loving it, this is easily one of the best modern twin-stick shooters and fantastic to play. <em>Note: a key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>If you've ever played and enjoyed anything like Geometry Wars, this is an absolute must-buy. This is what you want in a modern take on the genre that just feels incredible to play and smash through all the enemies. It will fry your brain just as much as your eyes, as the action truly gets intense. </p>
<p>The campaign mode is especially incredible with the way the battlefield changes as you go through. You start off with a small space, that gradually morphs into different shaped arenas as you progress through it. The floor lights up giving you a warning on where it will change, and then it all smashes into play with the new shape. No level loading interruptions, it's all action and no filler here. One you have to experience to get the full feel for it, especially with the thumping techno music that give it a thrilling atmosphere for the challenge.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5512223331764177344gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5512223331764177344gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4761958371764177342gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4761958371764177342gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>With an in-battle upgrade system the way it all just keeps the game continuously flowing is incredible. As you destroy enemies you'll see big flashy upgrade tokens to collect which you can spend across boosts like speed, score, shields, your blaster and so on. But here's the interesting bit, the upgrades are in a list where collecting more changes what you will be upgrading - so you can choose to upgrade speed which is at the bottom or collect more tokens to upgrade your blaster which is at the top. All while you're flying around shooting, blasting through enemies and dashing to get away from them. It's true chaos of the best sort. </p>
<p>You also evolve your ship during battle through special evolver tokens, which you pick from a stack that you have unlocked to give you more powerful bonuses like giving you drones to help, repelling enemy bullets, fire bullets behind you and lots more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yGWsLyZ0KPU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/287583a4d8056118c21081d304cda8ce.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yGWsLyZ0KPU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The style of it too is seriously slick. With bright neon colours surrounding you, and simple but effective 3D geometric shapes for the enemies - it looks spectacular with the way enemies drop down onto the battlefield too. Everything about it is just so wonderfully designed.</p>
<p>From the press release: “Sektori is an evolution of the classic twin-stick shooter, offering a mix of randomization with deliberate strategy as you decide when to cash in your points for power-ups,” said developer Kimmo Lahtinen. “It’s classic arcade action with a smidge of roguelike DNA with the ability to spec your ship differently in each run. It’s easy to have fun right out of the gate, but there’s infinite room for improvement as you aim to tackle higher difficulties, climb the leaderboards, or just beat your own personal best attempts! But most importantly, I wanted to focus on game feel, with kaleidoscopic colors and pulsating techno beats that lock you into a hypnotic flow state.”</p>
<p>On Linux there is <em>one</em> specific issue with Proton. The backing video behind the menu and battlefield is broken on Valve's official Proton. For it to work properly, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-ge-proton-on-steam-deck-steamos-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">you'll need GE-Proton</a>. Other than that, no issues at all and it took me a while to even notice that was actually an issue until it suddenly clicked that I was sometimes seeing the <a href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9489981491764176915gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Proton test image behind</a> the scenes. Goes to show how <em>intense</em> the action is that I didn't even notice it initially. But for the full experience, you <em>definitely</em> want GE-Proton until perhaps they can use a different video codec for it.</p>
<p>If you're a fan of twin-stick shooters this is an <strong>essential</strong> pick. Absolutely brilliant.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma going all-in on Wayland and will drop the X11 session completely</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It was only a matter of time but it's nearly upon us - KDE Plasma with version 6.8 will be entirely dropping the X11 session to go full Wayland.</p>
<p>For a lot of users it won't make much of a difference, according to the <a href="https://blogs.kde.org/2025/11/26/going-all-in-on-a-wayland-future/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> announcement as the "vast majority of our users are already using the Wayland session". With this change they said it "opens up new opportunities for features, optimizations, and speed of development". Not surprising, since developing for and maintaining the Plasma desktop across two very different protocols can't be easy. At least they'll end up with more focused development. </p>
<p>So with this move support for all X11 applications will be "fully entrusted to Xwayland".</p>
<p>In the FAQ they mentioned the current Plasma X11 session will be supported still into early 2027, no exact timing as of yet though. If you really need X11, they're suggesting sticking to a long term support (LTS) distribution that ships older Plasma. If you are using X11 and sticking with it a while, the good news is that KDE applications will continue to run on X11. They're only dropping support specifically for the Plasma desktop itself.</p>
<p>There's still some <a href="https://community.kde.org/Plasma/Wayland_Known_Significant_Issues" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">significant issues</a> they need to address though, which they're gradually working through to ensure Plasma on Wayland is truly good for everyone.</p>
<p><em>We're finally properly close to the year of Wayland on the desktop.</em></p>

      <title>Slimbook launch the KDE Slimbook VII with AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 / Radeon 880M</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In the market for a new powerful laptop ready for the holiday season? Perhaps give a look to the new KDE Slimbook VII.</p>
<p>From the press email sent to GamingOnLinux: "Slimbook and KDE are celebrating their 8th anniversary with the launch of the new KDE Slimbook VII, the seventh generation resulting from a long-standing collaboration between specialized hardware and free software".</p>
<p>Some highlights of the machine include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- squire --></p>
<ul>
<li>Designed for KDE Plasma users, with optimized power and performance for the Linux ecosystem.</li>
<li>Features an AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 and integrated AMD Radeon 880M graphics.</li>
<li>16″ WQXGA display (2560x1600) at 165 Hz for a smooth, precise, and comfortable visual experience.</li>
<li>Premium aluminum chassis in a sophisticated slate-blue color combining robustness and elegance.</li>
<li>High expandability: up to 128 GB DDR5 RAM and 8 TB NVMe 4.0 storage.</li>
<li>Cooling system with dual fans and dedicated keys to switch between power modes.</li>
<li>USB‑C with 100 W Power Delivery, Wi‑Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.2, HDMI, USB-A ports… everything a demanding user needs.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5728966481764160129gol1.png"/></p>
<p>The base model has 16GB RAM and a 500GB NVMe storage drive. For ports you get 2x USB-C USB3.2 Gen1 with PD3.0 charging and 4K@60Hz video output, and 3x USB-A 3.2 Gen1.</p>
<p>Priced at €1,098.99 but it's €70 off for Black Friday bringing it down to €1,029. The pricing actually seems <em>reasonable</em> for the specifications, at least to me scanning around a little bit and seeing pricing from other vendors.</p>
<p>You can find it on the <a href="https://kde.slimbook.es/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Slimbook website</a>.</p>

      <title>Fedora proposal put forward to improve &#34;production stability and incident management&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a string of annoying incidents after updates causing stability problems on Fedora, there's a new proposal put forward to help improve things.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/proposal-a-sig-to-improve-production-stability-and-incident-management/174907" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">new proposal</a> suggests forming a Special Interest Group (SIG) focused on developing a "recommended stream of work to improve our stability and robustness, and to improve our communication with users when problems arise that compromise that stability and robustness".</p>
<p>In the proposal several major update issues are noted that have come up lately including a recent Mesa update that broke launching games from Steam. I only <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/hello-from-fedora-kde/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">switched to Fedora KDE a few days ago</a>, and was bitten by the Mesa update, and so I was forced into the terminal to downgrade my Mesa version just to get gaming with friends that evening - something that ideally just <em>shouldn't</em> happen.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/is-most-recent-mesa-push-to-stable-mesa-25-2-7-2-fc43-reasonable/173585/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">chatter</a> on the Fedora Discourse forum around the Mesa update got a little <a href="https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/is-most-recent-mesa-push-to-stable-mesa-25-2-7-2-fc43-reasonable/173585/21" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">spicy</a>, with the maintainer who actually pushed out this particular Mesa update noting they "don’t consider closed source steam a reliable indicator of issues, it has no debug symbols" which was pretty <em>unhelpful</em>. And later <a href="https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/is-most-recent-mesa-push-to-stable-mesa-25-2-7-2-fc43-reasonable/173585/51" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">saying</a> "Not my problem anymore, I have quit as rpmfusion admin".</p>
<p>Seems like the proposal is a good idea, at least to get the ball rolling on things. Their update process currently doesn't seem to work particularly well at times. This isn't about playing a blame game as issues happen of course, but so many issues <em>could</em> be avoided with better processes in place. A system cannot be (as the Fedora websites advertises) "Trusted, powerful and easy" and "Reliable" if updates repeatedly break major parts of the system.</p>
<p>Hopefully some good improvements can come out of this.</p>

      <title>The action RPG &#39;Soulframe&#39; from the devs of Warframe gets a Steam page and early access for founders</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's not officially out yet, but you can now jump in early to Soulframe, the in-development action RPG from the developers of the popular Warframe. A Steam page is also now live that you can follow it on, for whenever it actually releases properly. Considering it's from the Warframe developers, I expect it to be another big one.</p>
<p>Not heard of it? An open world fantasy RPG adventure with themes influenced by nature and restoration. With a hand-crafted world you will explore an "ancient, broken land and inherit the courage, spirit, and grace of Ancestors to mend earthly flesh and heal its land from Ode’n reign".</p>
<p>Announced on the <a href="https://forums.soulframe.com/topic/6643-soulframe-preludes-12-wylds/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">official forum</a>, founder packs for it are also now live so you can purchase it to get into it early. Until now, you had to sign up for a chance to be invited via email, so you can skip all that if you really want to get in on it during development. It's not cheap though, as getting all three of the characters appears to be £84.99 with them £24.99 individually and you get an assortment of extras with them too. <em>At release much like Warframe, it will be free to play.</em></p>
<p>There's also a new trailer to go along with it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3OTXsgACvIA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5643bf5fbf16e08087239c6a65eb0b18.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3OTXsgACvIA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:  "Warframe would not still be going strong 12 years later without those who supported us at its early foundations," said Geoff Crookes, Creative Director. "Soulframe Founders is us planting some of our biggest roots yet for the future. We've now reached the phase of development where we can welcome people in to help turn those roots into a solid foundation and build something we've all been waiting and hoping for from the ground up. We promise to continue serving this new community for as long as they allow us to, and to install the themes of redemption and hope throughout every aspect of Soulframe. Thank you for joining us."</p>

      <title>Heck yeah - the next HELLDIVERS 2 Warbond finally brings a minigun</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>HELLDIVERS 2 is still one of the best online co-op action games around, and we're finally going to be able to get a minigun to really tear through enemies.</p>
<p>Not only that, there's going to be a chainsaw too and it looks amazing. Not enough for you? Well there's also a new drone sidekick with a flamethrower, which will probably cause all sorts of friendly-fire chaos I imagine. On top of that there's a new primary weapon that's a combo between an assault rifle and grenade launcher too.</p>
<p>This will come with the premium (paid) Python Commandos Premium Warbond which arrives on December 2nd, which is perfect timing as I've just started getting back into the game after a long time away from it. And, with their new focus on improving the core stability of the game - it's all coming together now.</p>
<p>Probably one of the best sounding warbonds they've added to the game since release. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QQPp9ZCgrP8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f47d903f39e2d4b84d9671672e70ce4f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QQPp9ZCgrP8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>HELLDIVERS 2 continues working quite nicely on Linux with Proton, although annoyingly with my two monitors the mouse does like to wander off onto my second screen at times.</p>
<p>Even with the nProtect GameGuard anti-cheat, it works fine and has done with it since release. That and more noted on our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated anti-cheat page</a> for Linux / SteamOS.</p>

      <title>Embracer Group selling off Arc Games and Cryptic Studios</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Embracer Group have announced they're once again shrinking, after previously going on a crazy spending spree and then having to make lots of cuts. This time they've announced they're selling off Arc Games and Cryptic Studios which will both go to Project Golden Arc, Inc., with financing from XD Inc.</p>
<p>From the press release: "This transaction supports our key priorities by strengthening our focus on strategic assets and core IPs in Embracer while improving profitability and free cash flow. The deal also allows online multiplayer game Fellowship, developed by a talented external team in Stockholm, to find a great home within Coffee Stain Group. I would like to thank the teams at Arc and Cryptic for their hard work over the past four years and wish them all the best as we are confident they will thrive and develop in the years ahead,” says Phil Rogers, CEO of Embracer.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19558700191764153458gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19558700191764153458gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Fellowship</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Embracer will keep some of the rights including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The publishing rights for the Remnant franchise which will go to the Embracer-owned THQ Nordic.</li>
<li>The rights to Fellowship will move to Coffee Stain <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/embracer-to-spin-off-coffee-stain-rebrand-as-fellowship-entertainment-and-release-76-games-in-the-next-year/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">which is being spun off from Embracer</a>. Developer Chief Rebel will continue on with it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The deal isn't done yet, and no date was mentioned on when they expect it to all finish, Embracer simply said "Closing of the transaction is expected to take place as soon as customary conditions are fulfilled".</p>

	<ul>
<li>We will continue to monitor fish capacity and player feedback on this issue</li>
</ul>
</li>

      <title>Cold Fear, I Am Alive and more arrive in the GOG Preservation Program along with a Black Friday sale</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For those that prefer the DRM-free store <a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>, they've expanded again with new enhanced releases of Cold Fear and I Am Alive along with a Black Friday sale. You can check out the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-play-games-from-gog-and-epic-games-on-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux Guide to get GOG games on Linux / SteamOS</a>.</p>
<p>About restoring <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/cold_fear" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Cold Fear</a>, the GOG team said: "Originally published by Ubisoft and now re-released by Atari with our very own restoration efforts, Cold Fear represents the kind of behind-the-scenes cooperation that helps ensure cult titles don’t quietly fade away when technology moves on. If a game is part of our shared gaming heritage, it deserves more than to be left broken on modern hardware". They also mentioned how it has new support for "robust controller support for popular pads, unified button layouts, and full support for wireless play, hotplugging, D-Pads, triggers, and vibration, all based on an updated scheme inspired by the original PlayStation 2 controls" along with various other enhancements to fix up glitches, crashes and so on.</p>

<p>They also revamped <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/i_am_alive" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">I Am Alive</a> a little for their store that also had a whole bunch of improvements.</p>

      <title>TRX an open-source reimplementation of Tomb Raider 1 and Tomb Raider 2 version 1.0 released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With lots of enhancements for the classics Tomb Raider 1 and Tomb Raider 2, the TRX project version 1.0 is out now with an LUA scripting engine for modders.</p>
<p>So what exactly is TRX? It aims to enhance the classic Tomb Raiders games through decompilation and the implementation of open-source alternatives to proprietary components. TRX is a single engine capable of running TR1, TR2, and custom levels respecting each of the distinct, classic engines' mechanics.</p>
<p>Version 1.0 was released November 23rd bringing the two games together under one roof, and with a new LUA scripting engine that could be really fun for modders to do all sorts with the game. There's absolutely tons more that was added into this release like improved rendering, support for triangular geometry, support for additive blending in textures, a new easter egg command for TR1, support for TR2 weapons in TR1 and so much more.</p>
<p>You can see their release video on it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vVU9vbUXTXc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c2976a2866c6d26873ab3bbb1a721d02.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vVU9vbUXTXc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can see everything in the <a href="https://github.com/LostArtefacts/TRX/releases/tag/trx-1.0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release notes</a> for all that's new in the 1.0 update.</p>
<p>Tomb Raider I-III Remastered is a thing of course, but projects like this being open source can keep the classics running basically forever and on more platforms. You need the original data files from the games to work with TRX which you can grab from <a class="gol298" href="https://gog.com/en/game/tomb_raider_123" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> or <a class="gol644" href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=Core%20Design" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Voivod: The Nuclear Warrior shows off a new prototype trailer of the heavy metal platformer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Chaosmonger Studio continue working on Voivod: The Nuclear Warrior a retro-styled heavy metal platformer in partnership with the band Voivod.</p>
<p>Following on from the successful Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign, they say it has now moved onto "full production" with the new trailer showcasing the game's evolving world: a desolate, post-apocalyptic landscape where mechanical ruins meet cosmic horror, brought to life through hand-crafted pixel art and an original soundtrack shaped by Voivod's unmistakable sound.</p>
<p>From the PR: "Our goal is to make a game that feels like stepping inside a Voivod album cover," says Nicola Piovesan, the game’s director and founder of Chaosmonger Studio. "This new trailer captures the atmosphere and energy that define the band’s universe. It’s both a tribute and a continuation of their legacy."</p>
<p>See the new prototype trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="K_Ey26szgM4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b0193d02d23624e9b5876bbf80a44180.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/K_Ey26szgM4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More from the PR: "The result is a unique creative synthesis: a metal-infused interactive experience where music, art, and storytelling merge into a single audiovisual vision. Combining classic run-and-gun gameplay with exploration and atmosphere, Voivod: The Nuclear Warrior invites players to embody the Voivod himself — a mutant warrior guided by his disembodied mind, Nothingface — on a journey through twisted dimensions inspired by the band’s albums and mythos."</p>
<p>It's due out sometime next year.</p>

      <title>God game Reus 2 adds full Steam Deck / SteamOS support in the latest update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Reus 2 from Abbey Games recently had a big upgrade, and now it's Steam Deck Verified / SteamOS Compatible with full support from the developer.</p>
<p>What is it? It's all about shaping worlds as one of 6 powerful giants each with their own unique abilities. Your choices will determine the fate of the planet and its inhabitants. And as you progress, you'll unlock more new skills for your giants too. Humanity does its own thing though, and may even turn against you.</p>
<p>In the latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1875060/view/815840666002128939" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> that pushed it up to Steam Deck Verified the developer noted:</p>
<blockquote><strong>GAMEPAD &amp; STEAM DECK</strong>
<ul>
<li>This update adds official support for gamepads and the Steam Deck.</li>
<li>The game automatically detects when its played on Deck or a gamepad is connected and switches to the appropriate control scheme.</li>
<li>Many changes to UI composition when UI Scale is at 130%, which is selected by default for Steam Deck.</li>
<li>On UI Scale 130%, the player can increase small font sizes, enabled by default.</li>
<li>Option to disable gamepad detection completely. For when you want to keep playing the PC-control scheme on Steam Deck</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That's some nice attention to the little details there, especially nice to see such direct support for our favourite handheld.</p>

      <title>Chaotic climbing game ChimpUP! looks hilarious</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ChimpUP! is an upcoming chaotic multiplayer climbing game about monkeys trying to collect bananas, where each player has independent grapple hooks for arms. Looks like it could be another funny multiplayer game to add to your list.</p>
<p>It's a fast-paced game with each round only being about 30 seconds. Every map has its own unique weird gimmick you need to master, and it's all about being first to launch immediately into the next map. You each have wobbly arms you can use however you like - whatever gets you there first. That includes sabotaging friends, as you're able to grab them too.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>4-player competitive co-op racing.</li>
<li>Dual independent grapple hook controls.</li>
<li>30-second average map completion for fast-paced action.</li>
<li>Score-based competition across multiple maps per session.</li>

      <title>xorg-server 21.1.21 freshly released to fix some annoying regressions</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For those of you still rocking xorg rather than Wayland, there's a new release out that should hopefully fix up some <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/-/issues/1848" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">issues</a> you may have been seeing. There was a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/new-security-advisory-released-for-x-org-x-server-and-xwayland-issues/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">security advisory back in October</a> for more issues that were fixed, and a small bug-fix after that - so this release follows on from those.</p>
<p>What's changed in this release? From the release <a href="https://lists.x.org/archives/xorg-announce/2025-November/003643.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The changes being reverted here are part of a series of changes previously backported in the stable branch, yet these are not actual fixes to address bugs found in the stable branch, while those changes introduced regressions with reverse PRIME with the NVIDIA closed-source driver, issues with 10-bit output with the  AMDGPU driver and reduced performance with the AMDGPU driver.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Olivier Fourdan (6):<br/>
       Revert "glamor: reject configs using unsupported rgbBits size"<br/>
       Revert "glamor_egl: add support of GlxVendorLibrary option"<br/>
       Revert "xorg: initialize glamor provider"<br/>
       Revert "glamor: Lift the GLX EGL backend from Xwayland"<br/>
       Revert "glamor: add glvnd_vendor private"<br/>
       xserver 21.1.21</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your distribution (if it still packages xorg) should hopefully pull in the update sometime soon.</p>

      <title>SteamVR 2.14 brings fixes for a Linux memory leak, a Steam Link freeze for AMD GPUs and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest stable release of SteamVR is out now! SteamVR 2.14 is a maintenance release focused on fixing up bugs and nuisance issues. <em>Nice to see the Linux fix make it in here, as no doubt that was quite annoying.</em></p>
<p>Mainly, this is promoting the previous Beta build to stable for all SteamVR users. No doubt plenty more ongoing behind the scenes so that SteamVR is ready for the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-reveal-the-new-steam-frame-steam-controller-and-steam-machine-with-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">upcoming Steam Frame device from Valve</a>. I am very excited to get my hands on it eventually to cut the cord with VR but the Valve Index has served me well until now.</p>
<p>Here's all that's changed:</p>
<blockquote><strong>SteamVR:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Improve startup speed when no HMD is present.</li>
<li>Fix an issue that could cause "Port 27062 in use" (can also manifest as error 309) when no HMD is present.</li>
<li>Fix an issue that could result in error 302 or error 101, especially in unusual startup configurations.</li>
<li>Changed Binding UI to allow saving bindings that don't bind all required actions (with confirmation).</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where HMD simulation would persist after an app using controller simulation ended.</li>
<li>Fixed some scenarios where the wrong render model would be displayed when multiple devices were simulating.</li>
<li>Fix a crash that could occur if the roomview processing was delayed.</li>
<li>Updated dashboard binding for HP Motion Controller to fix screenshots, smooth scrolling, and take advantage of Quick Recenter.</li>
<li>The prompt to setup SteamVR for app containers and web applications now covers cases where SteamVR is installed outside of its normal location.</li>
<li>Fixed chaperone showing when using Steam Link or wired headsets that draw their own boundaries.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Steam Link:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fix Steam Link freeze for users with AMD video cards ("Error 250").</li>
<li>Minor judder improvements.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Linux:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fix a shared memory leak that happened each time an app disconnected from SteamVR.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Schrodinger&#39;s Cat Burglar is an adorable looking puzzle game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Schrodinger's Cat Burglar is a puzzle game with a cat that can be in two places at once, and that will no doubt confuse my brain. Not only does it look wonderful, but the developer added a Native Linux version of the game back in October to help improve it on Steam Deck too. They said that the newer Native build runs a lot smoother.</p>
<p>The game actually sounds great. The central quantum mechanic having you split into two cats at the press of a button, with each being controlled to solve puzzles. Seems like it gets a little confusing though as the developer notes the "quantum superstate obeys Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle - when nobody is looking, Mittens could be in either location. If she’s observed however, things get theoretical…".</p>
<p>Check out the official trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UFxRHPU_bY0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4e17dcf5424a28589b7e1075c16905b5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UFxRHPU_bY0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brain-Teasering Puzzles</strong> - A host of cat-splitting puzzles, sending items and energy across theoretical spacetime and back again in time for breakfast!</li>
<li><strong>Full Customisation </strong>- Play dress-up and choose custom hats, cat breeds, accessories and of course - level of cat chonkiness.</li>
<li><strong>Play With a Friend</strong> - Have a friend join at any time in drop-in/out local coop, also compatible with Steam Remote Play Together.</li>
<li><strong>Unravel The Secrets of The Lab</strong> - What is this shady facility researching? What are the pest-control robots protecting? And who is this mysterious Shadow Cat…?</li>
<li><strong>Expanded Gameplay</strong> - Hidden areas, sneaky mouse-bots and tricky quantum shards for the more advanced puzzle fans out there – or if you just want to knock coffee off desks, you can do that too…</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A demo is available that you can try on Steam right now. Love the look of it.</p>

      <title>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault enters Early Access and work is ongoing to improve it on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While it's not quite Verified for Steam Deck just yet, Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault should be a reasonably good experience. It's rated Playable by Valve, with a note that some text is a bit too small. The developer has confirmed they plan to solve that as soon as possible too.</p>
<p>So what is it? From the Steam page: "Dive deep into Action-RPG with roguelike elements and a tale about new beginnings. With no coin to your name, you and the other townsfolk find yourselves stranded in the distant village of Tresna. Now, it’s up to you to get back on your feet and turn your humble shop into the beating heart of the village’s wealth. Explore dangerous dungeons, gather relics, sell them, and reinvest in your friends’ establishments. Unlock new weapons, armor, shop decorations, and—more importantly—restore hope that things can one day turn around."</p>
<p>It launched into Early Access on November 19th, and they've already put in work to ensure it continues to get better on Steam Deck too. The first <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2350790/view/628943104979764390" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">hotfix</a> has released that notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Performance</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>First round of performance improvements</strong>. We’ve made changes under the hood as an initial move to reduce hitches, stuttering, and improve overall smoothness.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steam Deck</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Optimized default settings</strong>. Steam Deck now uses a configuration tuned for more stable performance from the moment you launch, so you can focus on looting and selling instead of tweaking options.</li>
<li><strong>Steam Deck → PC graphics note</strong>. If you play on Steam Deck and then jump back to PC, your graphics settings may be set to Low automatically. You can raise them again from the settings menu on your PC. We know this is inconvenient and will work to solve it as soon as we can.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Balance</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Easier Easy Mode</strong>. Easy mode is now a bit more forgiving: enemies deal less damage and have less health.</li>
<li><strong>Herald adjustments</strong>. The Herald boss fight has been tuned to feel fairer while still offering a solid challenge.</li>
<li><strong>Earlier shop unlocks</strong>. The first Endless Vault challenge requirement has been reduced from 10,000 coins to 7,000, so players can unlock new content and upgrades sooner.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ultrawide support</strong>. Fixed compatibility issues with 3440x1440, enabling proper ultrawide support.</li>
<li><strong>Added cursor lock</strong> to improve the experience when playing in full screen, windowed and borderless modes.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Try the demo for Kinsfolk, a casual emotional adventure about fatherhood</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Made in the spirit of the likes of Journey, Firewatch, What Remains of Edith Finch - Kinsfolk is a casual adventure about fatherhood. As the main character you embark on a journey to discover the meaning of family. Seems like a nice one if you're into slower-paced experiences.</p>
<p>Writing in a Steam <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2876610/announcements/detail/622187705533466252" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> the developer noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I really enjoy using Linux (for my dev work) and Steam Deck for gaming. Since starting Kinsfolk 2 years ago I always wanted to support them properly. I am super happy to announce that the current Kinsfolk demo now runs natively on Linux, and has been optimized for Steam Deck!</p>

<p>The developer explained it on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1jndtmc/kinsfolk_vinko_kodzoman_a_wholesome_tale_of_a/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Reddit</a> a bit better a few months ago: "In Kinsfolk there are no failure states, your only goal is to relax, explore the world and feel. I put a lot of emphasis on the voice, scenery and the music in the game so the player can get lost in the story. Throughout the world you will discover story pieces - vignettes - some of which you will be able to relive. This part was in big part inspired by What Remains of Edith Finch. While reliving these short stories in the past the game mechanics might change and you will have to figure out what to do while learning about the past."</p>

      <title>The huge fan-made TimeSplitters Rewind is out now in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's splitting time? TimeSplitters Rewind has released for free and it should work just fine on Linux / SteamOS thanks to Proton. They said: "Sorry it's taken us so long. We've only been making the largest free content video game ever", that's a little…cheeky to say given some of the many other free games out there but okay.</p>
<p>Quite a weird one because as a fan game it's part remake and part successor to the classics. They consider it "Early Access" since it's not finished but there's a lot of content there already.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Early Access Features</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>28 Maps.</li>
<li>Online and Offline Story Mode.</li>
<li>51 Arcade Leagues.</li>
<li>32 Challenges.</li>
<li>96 Characters.</li>
<li>41 Weapons.</li>
<li>20 Arcade Game Modes.</li>
<li>New Game Mode - Team Elimination.</li>
<li>Updated Game Mode - Last Stand.</li>
<li>Online and Offline Arcade w/Bots.</li>
<li>10 Players Online.</li>
</ul>

<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZzWSrgQ3eMI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/46a3b1f8ed9236c78672052481a2af27.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZzWSrgQ3eMI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I've given it a test today and with Proton 10 it appears to work quite well. Just download it from their Indie DB page, extract the zip into your downloads and then add "TimeSplittersRewind.exe" as a Non-Steam game. Once added, simply go into the Properties for it and then to Compatibility, tick the box and select Proton 10 from the drop-down. Practically the same steps as <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-battle-net-on-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck-for-world-of-warcraft-and-starcraft/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Option 2 in our Battle.net for Linux / SteamOS guide</a> (seems like we need a more generic guide…<em>soon</em>).</p>
<p>On the website they note "Free? Yes - all for free. No hidden costs, no microtransactions". Not a surprise, since it's entirely based on using someone else's IP. Embracer Group currently hold the rights to it, so it will be interesting to see if they pull out the lawyer card and end up getting it eventually taken down. <em>Using existing IP is always a big risk.</em></p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Set in the underbelly of a consumer goods conglomerate mega dungeon, Vision Quench is now being published by Palword's Pocketpair Publishing. From WizMUD, this is their first game on Steam and it's going to release sometime in 2026.</p>
<p>More about it: "The last remnant of a vanished bargain lies yet unclaimed atop the Green Tower, where the Sweepstakes Code endures as both a promise and a curse. To redeem it, you and your 3 companions, drawn together by the distant memory of a memory, must fight your way up the tower through a sprawling labyrinth of hidden designs, metaphysical phenomena, and all manner of foul creatures."</p>

<p>It's not clear if it will have a Native Linux version or if you'll need Proton for it. There's Linux system requirements on Steam, but they don't make it clear right now as it's not fully filled.</p>

      <title>Igalia detail their open source work for Valve&#39;s Steam Frame and Steam Machine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the great things about Valve's hardware is that it's not locked down, and they put a lot of money into open source for SteamOS (Linux). With <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-reveal-the-new-steam-frame-steam-controller-and-steam-machine-with-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the upcoming new Steam Machine and Steam Frame</a>, the open source never stops.</p>
<p>And here we have Igalia, one of the Free Software consultancies that Valve works with, writing up a post detailing some of the work that goes into it all. In this case, it's especially interesting for the Steam Frame. Igalia have people working on FEX, as just one example, which is a fast usermode x86 and x86-64 emulator for Arm64 Linux. Basically, it allows running x86 applications on ARM64 Linux devices - this is part of how the Steam Frame will actually run games. From the post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you love video games, like I do, working on FEX with Valve is a dream come true,” said <a href="https://igalia.com/team/pmatos" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Paulo Matos</a>, an engineer with Igalia’s <a href="https://www.igalia.com/technology/compilers" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Compilers Team</a>. Even so, the challenges can be daunting, because making sure the translation is working often requires manual QA rather than automated testing. “You have to start a game, sometimes the error shows up in the colors or sound, or how the game behaves when you break down the door in the second level. Just debugging this can take a while,” said Matos. “For optimization work I did early last year, I used a game called <em>Psychonauts</em> to test it. I must have played the first 3 to 4 minutes of the game many, many times for debugging. Looking at my history, Steam tells me I played it for 29 hours, but it was always the first few minutes, nothing else.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I imagine there's a lot of driver development, and Proton / Wine development, that has people repeat sections over and over like this. Can't imagine how boring that actually ends up. But, probably exciting when they finally nail it and get it all working nicely.</p>
<p>The post from Igalia also confirms the Steam Frame will use the open source <a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/drivers/freedreno.html#turnip" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Mesa3D Turnip</a> graphics driver, which needed a fair amount of work to be ready for the device by the sounds of it, with lots missing to get it up to scratch. More from the post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We implemented many Vulkan extensions and reviewed numerous others,” said <a href="https://www.igalia.com/team/dpiliaiev" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Danylo Piliaiev</a>, an engineer on the <a href="https://www.igalia.com/technology/graphics" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Graphics Team</a>. “Over the years, we ensured that D3D11, D3D12, and OpenGL games rendered correctly through DXVK, vkd3d-proton, and Zink, investigating many rendering issues along the way. We achieved higher correctness than the proprietary driver and, in many cases, Mesa3D Turnip is faster as well.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since it's all open source, everyone benefits - not just Valve. And, some of the work sounds quite exciting for the future of gaming on Linux. More from the post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Looking ahead, Igalia’s work for Valve will continue to deliver benefits to the wider Linux Gaming ecosystem. For example, the Steam Frame, as a battery-powered VR headset, needs to deliver high performance within a limited power budget. A way to address this is to create a more efficient task scheduler, which is something <a href="https://www.igalia.com/team/changwoo" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Changwoo Min</a> of Igalia’s <a href="https://www.igalia.com/technology/kernel" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Kernel Team</a> has been working on. As he says, “I have been developing a customized CPU scheduler for gaming, named <a href="https://lpc.events/event/18/contributions/1713/attachments/1425/3058/scx_lavd-lpc-mc-24.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">LAVD: Latency-criticality Aware Virtual Deadline scheduler</a>.”</p>

      <title>Blending classic survival games with automation - ORMOD: Directive sounds interesting</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ORMOD: Directive is a very interesting recent announcement that blends classic action survival gameplay mechanics with automation. A little unusual bit it sounds like it might work quite well and it's set to release on Steam sometime in early 2026.</p>
<p>From the press email: "ORMOD: Directive introduces a post-apocalyptic sandbox where no two worlds are the same. Every playthrough generates a unique and fully customizable world, including the placement of towns, buildings, roads, and key landmarks. Players define their own survival strategy across a landscape built from the ground up for replayability, creativity, and challenge.</p>
<p>Blending classic survival gameplay with automation, base-building, and realistic combat simulation, the game offers a world that continues to evolve even when players are not online. Every decision affects survival, whether through diplomacy, stealth, or brute force, and every item in the world exists physically, stays where it is left, and can be picked up, stolen, or repurposed."</p>
<p>Since it will have anti-cheat as you can run servers for it, I was concerned about the anti-cheat situation for Linux / SteamOS <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">since so many games have it disabled</a> and lock Linux away and this one will have their own "In-House Client-Based Anti-Cheat" as listed on Steam. Speaking to their PR team to get word, I asked about it being enabled for Linux / SteamOS and they replied to note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey Liam! The developer has confirmed a strong "Yes!" for this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="RxqX6yzkkGE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/94c6e663484318252753ec14823280bc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/RxqX6yzkkGE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

      <title>WinBoat adds support for Podman, UWP, app filtering and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>WinBoat is a popular way to run Windows apps on Linux in a containerized environment that sorts all the configuration for you and a new update sounds great. </p>
<p>An interesting alternative to using the likes of Wine / Proton, to have Windows directly on your device inside Linux with containers. It's all quite clever, especially useful for things that won't run well or at all with Wine. Luckily, I have no need for it but I can see the appeal, far less annoying than dual-booting just for a few select things.</p>
<p>Release v0.9.0 arrived November 23rd with a number of big new features, plus some security improvements and bug fixes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1271730021763991918gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1271730021763991918gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here's everything that's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Features:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>🐳 Podman is now supported</strong>, you can pick it during installation, however USB passthrough on Podman is not supported yet</li>
<li>UWP app support has been added, now you can see and start all your UWP apps</li>
<li>A Custom App can now be created from an existing one if you'd like to modify it</li>
<li>Apps can now be filtered</li>
<li>Apps can now be launched via the context menu</li>
<li>You can now adjust the Application Scaling in Configuration</li>
<li>New WinBoat installations will now reserve the port range <code class="inline-code">47270 - 47370</code> on Docker for all used services, this is to avoid common ports and port conflicts in the future. In the meantime Podman does not support port ranges in compose files, so we're allocating random ports</li>
<li>You can now add new or replace any existing FreeRDP arguments in Configuration</li>
<li>A <code class="inline-code">wm-class</code> prefix has been added for folks who wanna style WinBoat FreeRDP windows in their WM</li>
<li>Windows will now auto-synchronize the clock on new installations</li>
<li>The default install path has been set to <code class="inline-code">~/winboat</code>, of course you can still change it to whatever you prefer</li>
<li>You can now disable animations within WinBoat if you're sensitive to motion or your compositor doesn't play nicely with Electron</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you're using a Custom ISO for installation, that ISO will get auto-unmounted afterwards so the next time you start WinBoat with that ISO deleted, it will work properly</li>
<li>Fixed the CPU usage spiking when RDP monitoring is enabled</li>
<li>Corrected a few typos</li>
</ul>
<h3>Misc:</h3>
<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">dockur/windows</code> version upgraded to 5.14</li>
<li>All WinBoat ports are now bound by default to <code class="inline-code">127.0.0.1</code></li>
<li>Improved the security of the Guest Server (thanks <a class="notranslate user-mention" href="https://github.com/mrsheepsheep" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">@mrsheepsheep</a> and <a class="notranslate user-mention" href="https://github.com/matt0x00" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">@matt0x00</a>)</li>

      <title>Palworld update &#39;Home Sweet Home&#39; arrives December 17 with an ULTRAKILL collab</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Home Sweet Home huh? The name of the next Palworld update that's been confirmed to arrive on December 17th.</p>
<p>The update includes a collaboration with the popular FPS ULTRAKILL, as well as new features for customizing bases. Although they haven't said exactly what will be included just yet, we'll have to wait for the actual release notes around December 17th. Looks to be a very combat-focused update though going by the update trailer you can view below, which is not surprising given the picked game for collaboration there. And we get a teaser of something rather big right at the end.</p>
<p>Check it out:</p>

      <title>Grab a free copy of Warhammer: Vermintide 2 for a limited time</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Warhammer: Vermintide 2 is currently on a time-limited deal where you can grab a copy and keep it, so act fast if you want a free game. Earlier this year it also <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/warhammer-vermintide-2-gets-an-easy-anti-cheat-upgrade-finally-works-properly-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">had an update</a> to improve the anti-cheat on Linux too, so hopefully now you won't have too much trouble running it on Linux systems with Proton.</p>
<p>More about it: "Warhammer: Vermintide 2 is a 4-player co-op action game set in the Warhammer Fantasy Battles world. Sequel to the critically acclaimed Vermintide, Vermintide 2 is the latest installment in a franchise best known for its intense and bloody first-person melee combat."</p>
<p>It also only just this week added a new free DLC with Warhammer: Vermintide 2 - Return to the Reik, which adds in one of Vermintide 1’s most popular levels.</p>

      <title>The Nightdive Studios enhanced Quake II re-release is now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the latest minor update, the newer Quake II re-release that saw Nightdive Studios jump in to improve it is now Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/quake-ii-remastered-shadow-dropped-playable-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Back in August 2023</a> the re-release update came with lots of enhancements to the classic including the expansions, Quake 64, big multiplayer improvements and various gameplay improvements. It was quite the overhaul for the classic shooter. Valve's original rating was Steam Deck Playable but that was from their test in 2022.</p>
<p>A small update was pushed to the game with no patch notes on what they changed, they simply said "Quake II is now Steam Deck Verified and Handheld Optimized on Xbox ROG Ally devices" and with that - it's now Steam Deck Verified. So now you're truly good to go across Desktop Linux, Steam Deck and other SteamOS machines and it should work without much of a fuss at all.</p>
<p>Nice to see a classic live on.</p>

      <title>The multiverse is a mess so you and friends will get cleaning in S.K.R.U.B. Squad</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I do love how many more casual co-op games we're seeing lately, and it looks like S.K.R.U.B. Squad may be one to add to your list. You've done some power washing in the likes of PowerWash Simulator but what about cleaning up the whole multiverse? A messy job, but someone has to do it.</p>
<p>A recent announcement from developer Devon Wiersma they note: "Whenever there's a mess that needs cleaning, muck that needs wiping, or trash that needs grinding, the SKRUB Squad is there! Made up of a team of interplanetary slime folk who just really REALLY like cleaning, they travel the cosmos looking for the nastiest worlds to make squeaky clean. As their newly-created slimeling recruit, you'll join them to lend a hand to buff the multiverse back to perfection!"</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Clean up solo or with up to four friends!</li>
<li>A variety of levels to explore, from moody space ships to exotic cityscapes!</li>
<li>Diverse character customization options to make your slimeling shine!</li>
<li>Various tools and powers to clean with!</li>
<li>Fancy powers to change up how you clean!</li>

      <title>Play dice against the guardian of the underworld in Dice of Kalma</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dice of Kalma challenges players to descend into the Underworld and face the Finnish god of death, Kalma, in a high-stakes game of luck and skill. Originally released on November 14th, the developer recently added Native Linux and macOS support to the game. Since release it has also gained a Positive rating on Steam.</p>
<p>In an email to GamingOnLinux the developer said: "This rapid update ensures that the complete, strategic dice-rolling experience is accessible to nearly all PC gamers" and that it "completes the vision for a broad, multi-platform launch".</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>

<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>ROLL THE DICE</strong> - Select and reroll unwanted dice to chase ever more valuable hands. Strategically pace your rerolls or go all in chasing the ultimate hand to play!</p>
<p><strong>BUILD A DECK OF SKULLS</strong> - Choose skulls to add to your deck and find new opportunities to increase your score. Experiment, find synergies, and try different playstyles. Construct a deck of skulls to turn even the worst hand of dice around, or pick skulls that reward risky play and pushing your luck.</p>
<p><strong>PLAY HANDS</strong> - Activate as many skulls as possible with every hand and use your rerolls to gain every advantage you can. Upgrade chosen hands to increase their value and complement your deck of skulls to meet increasingly difficult challenges.</p>
<p><strong>FAIL AND TRY AGAIN</strong> - If you run out of hands, it is game over for you. Don’t worry, though. Persistence is rewarded, and the guardian of the Underworld seems to grow fond of you coming back to challenge him for just one more round.</p>

      <title>NodalBastion is a delightful mixture of tower defense and incremental progression</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Taking inspiration from incremental games with a long progress tree to unlock, NodalBastion is a tower defense game that just keeps on going. <em>It's a bit too heavy on the screen effects by default though.</em></p>
<p>A demo is available on Steam which has a Linux version, and if you like tower defense games you might like to try this one too. You may find you end up putting a fair amount of time into the demo to unlock all it has to offer. It does things a bit differently too, which is why I liked it. Starting off with just a single square core, you have to keep expanding with linked nodes to defend that initial core. Placing more nodes is on a timer, and you're given a random assortment of nodes each time you place a new one in a little time-line list. So it's all about making the best of what you're given, based on what you've unlocked from previous runs.</p>
<p>Did you fail? No problem, go back to the menu, unlock a bunch more and have another run.</p>
<p>Clever idea. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="RvNbA0LwtOo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/966be9baff0f1b48eae7710c6d777380.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/RvNbA0LwtOo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The AI wars are over. You are the last intelligence — defending the final core against ever-evolving humanity.</p>
<p>Deploy nodes, expand your network, and neutralize endless hostile intrusions.</p>
<p>Harvest data and install upgrades to adapt with every iteration.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build your bastion and collect resources - </strong>Shape your network and fortify the core against humanity’s assault. Collect data to expand faster, energize skills, and unlock upgrades.</li>
<li><strong>Adapt and upgrade - </strong>Optimize your systems, evolve your code — and download more RAM.</li>
<li><strong>Unleash powerful skills </strong>- Execute powerful skills to shift the flow of battle — unleash energy pulses, fire devastating lasers, deploy repair and stasis fields, launch explosive mines, release swarms of autonomous drones, and more.</li>
<li><strong>Survive boss battles </strong>- Face humanity’s elite in relentless showdowns. Neutralize their tactics and prove machine superiority.</li>
<li><strong>Visual Protocols </strong>- Your network, your rules. Switch post-processing effects on or off for optimal clarity — customize scanlines, chromatic aberration, vignette, and more.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The full game is currently set for a March 2026 release date.</p>

      <title>Dune: Awakening gets a limited time free trial and the biggest discount yet</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dune: Awakening from Funcom is trying to pull in some fresh players, with a new free trial available and the biggest discount on Steam so far. Thankfully even with the BattlEye anti-cheat, it is enabled and working on Linux / SteamOS systems, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">unlike many other games</a>.</p>
<p>Available now until November 27th, you can jump in completely free. It does work well on Linux desktop with Proton, but is a little rough on the Steam Deck. It's actually <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/dune-awakening-is-now-steam-deck-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Deck Verified</a> according to Valve, but in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/dune-awakening-is-out-now-and-works-well-on-linux-desktop-but-rough-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my original testing</a> and a recent re-test it still likes to dip below 30FPS. At least if you have a more powerful Linux machine, you'll be good to go.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12804349741763727425gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>For the discount, it's also 25% off, which is the historical low for it on Steam. During the trial you only get 10 hours though, which is quite a limit for this type of MMO so you only get a small taster of the game overall.</p>
<p>Sadly, Dune: Awakening has been struggling, with the player numbers dwindling down. As you can see on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1172710/charts/#3m" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, it has been quite a drop and only continues to fall. However, they appear to be making some changes that should hopefully make various parts of the game feel a lot better like the ability to carry vehicles across maps and coming soon:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Base Reconstruction Tool</strong> lets you safely store your entire base and all its contents, so you can take a break from the game without losing any of your progress. </li>
<li><strong>Character Server Transfers</strong> will allow you to move your character to another World entirely. Combined with the Base Reconstruction Tool, you'll be able to bring everything with you when you move. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Back in August they also added an auto-run keybind, which made exploration a lot nicer too.</p>
<p>One of the biggest issues appears to be the end-game, which they're hoping to solve early next year. They said the goal for the next chapter is specifically to "enrich the endgame experience" with a new system that provides "repeatable PVE activities, expanding the character progression with specializations, crafting the next chapter in the main storyline, and much, much more".</p>
<p>So perhaps we might see it have quite the comeback at some point over the next few months.</p>

      <title>ARC Raiders is now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve recently published a Steam Deck Verified rating for the smash-hit extraction shooter ARC Raiders. I decided to see if it deserved the rating.</p>
<p>With close to 100 hours on my Linux desktop <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/arc-raiders-has-seriously-exciting-gameplay-that-has-firmly-hooked-me-in/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">where it has been working beautifully</a>, I feel like I have a decent enough grasp on how it should feel by now. It's also one of the few bigger games like this that actually has the anti-cheat enabled for Linux / SteamOS which is going to be <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/anti-cheat-will-still-be-one-of-the-biggest-problems-for-the-new-steam-machine/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a big problem for the Steam Machine</a>, so it's quite an important one. There's many that simply disable Linux support as <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">noted on our anti-cheat page</a>.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, it actually does feel <em>okay</em> and with the defaults so far testing on Steam Deck across each map it has remained above 30FPS apart from some rare momentary drops below FPS where it shoots right back above. 30FPS is supposed to be the performance floor for being Steam Deck Verified from what I understand. So it hits it, but it looks a bit on the rough side.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2850592141763725393gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2850592141763725393gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6342345121763725392gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6342345121763725392gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><em>Those are some funny looking trees.</em></p>
<p>You're not going to see much battery life either, with the Steam Deck LCD seeing less than an hour in it. The textures popping in and appearing as you're running through looks a bit terrible too on the default graphics settings.</p>
<p>You'll definitely want to do some graphics tweaks to make it feel better. I would put Textures on Medium and View distance up to High at a minimum, which gives you a better looking game and a better chance at survival. Plus with some upscaling like TSR, you can still keep performance to a reasonable level.</p>
<p>If this is your only way to play, then it's going to be <em>somewhat</em> doable, but you're at quite a heavy disadvantage on Steam Deck with it. Especially in the PvP elements of the game. It's certainly not going to be a recommendation from me on Steam Deck, but it's doable at least. As a way to run with some free loadouts to grab a little loot in bed? Not amazing, but not completely terrible either.</p>
<p>The biggest issue though? It crashes and quits to your library a fair bit. Realistically, at least testing with the Steam Deck LCD, it's not stable enough to be Steam Deck Verified in my opinion.</p>
<p>As long as it keeps working, it will probably be pretty good on the upcoming Steam Machine. But for now, I'll continue playing on my Fedora KDE desktop.</p>

      <title>SteamOS 3.7.18 Beta available with a few nuisance bugs being squashed</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SteamOS 3.7.18 Beta "Old Enough to Vote" was released by Valve today, bringing in a few more fixes for some annoying sounding issues. In case you live under a rock we're also getting some new SteamOS systems with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-reveal-the-new-steam-frame-steam-controller-and-steam-machine-with-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Frame and Steam Machine</a> you should go and read up on.</p>
<p>As it's a Beta you'll need to change your system updates channel to test it, or just wait for Valve to roll it out for the next stable SteamOS Linux release. You can change it via Settings &gt; System &gt; System Update Channel. The most recent stable update is <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/steamos-3-7-17-released-with-fixes-for-baldurs-gate-3-os-updates-and-discover/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.7.17 from early November</a>.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">What's changed? See below:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the performance overlay sometimes showing zero for CPU power draw.</li>
<li>Fixed audio not always switching to/from 3.5mm headphones correctly when inserted or removed.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression where certain in-game overlay UI elements could cause a frame time drop upon appearing.</li>
<li>Fixed the frame limiter interacting badly with VRR after an extended period.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Forza Horizon 4 and Forza Horizon 5 would only display a blank window.</li>
</ul>

<p>On top of that we also only just recently finally saw the release of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/proton-10-0-3-released-bringing-lots-of-improvements-for-gaming-on-linux-steamos-steam-machine/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 10</a>, to bring even better game compatibility to SteamOS machines and Linux desktop systems.</p>

      <title>Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 gets more Steam Deck improvements in Hotfix 35 with their native version</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Larian have updated Baldur's Gate 3 with Hotfix #35, which includes more improvements to their Native Linux build supported on the Steam Deck with SteamOS.</p>
<p>Did you miss it getting a Native version? See the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/baldurs-gate-3-gets-a-native-linux-version-to-improve-it-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previous GamingOnLinux article</a> for the info. They're still specifically calling it "Steam Deck Native", but it's just a Native Linux version with tweaks for the Steam Deck included. It will be interesting to see how this sort of language evolves, especially <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-reveal-the-new-steam-frame-steam-controller-and-steam-machine-with-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">with the new upcoming Steam Machine</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19033325001763666180gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>From their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/568143233911096621" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a> here's all the goodies:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3><strong>FIXES</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Crashes and Performance</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a freeze on PS5 that could occur when pressing L2.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash on Xbox on the host's end when a client leaves a multiplayer session.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash on Xbox on the client's end when suspending the game while loading into a multiplayer session.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash on Steam Deck Native Build and Mac that was sometimes caused when saving the game after crafting.</li>
<li>Fixed a potential crash on Mac on the host's end during cross-play.</li>
<li>Fixed some potential crashes on Steam Deck during cross-play.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Steam Deck</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Bumped the default Upscaling Type from FSR 1 to FSR 2.2 to improve sharpness on Steam Deck Native.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug causing external controllers to stop working on Steam Deck Native when you use the 'Switch to Desktop' or 'Return to Gaming Mode' functions.</li>
<li>Improved loading times in some instances on the Steam Deck Native build.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash on startup when the EN locale is missing on Steam Deck.</li>
<li>Improved VRAM consumption on Nvidia GPUs.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Bit odd them listing "Improved VRAM consumption on Nvidia GPUs" under the Steam Deck heading but okay. Hopefully that will help those of you choosing to run the Native Linux version on Desktop Linux with an NVIDIA GPU.</p>

      <title>Vampire Survivors gets turned officially into a crazy deck-builder with Vampire Crawlers from poncle</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is the kind of chaos I love to see, and very fitting from Vampire Survivor developer poncle, with the casual deck-builder Vampire Crawlers. With a full name that is a bit of a mouthful. Are you ready? Deep breath…Vampire Crawlers: The Turbo Wildcard from Vampire Survivors. Wow, what a name huh?</p>
<p>From the Steam page: "From the somehow triple-BAFTA‑winning creators of Vampire Survivors, Vampire Crawlers: the turbo wildcard from Vampire Survivors turns the snowballing thrill of Vampire Survivors into a turbo turn‑based, card‑driven BLOBBER with rogue-lite elements. Build busted decks, explore familiar dungeons from a new perspective, and unleash world‑ending combos. Either take your time and be tactical, or play turns as fast as you humanly can: the outcome is always accurate!".</p>
<p>You can see their official video on it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JbDVqLlLarY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0d60280fe4f68620da08c557b2adb4f8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JbDVqLlLarY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Snowballing, turn‑based carnage</strong>: Play cards in ascending mana order to land combos; each step multiplies the next card’s effect. Use Wilds to extend the stack and keep going to 10, 20, 30… Can you reach infinite?</li>
<li><strong>Pick your pace</strong>: Either take your time and be tactical, or play turns as fast as you humanly can: the outcome is always accurate!</li>
<li><strong>Deck-Building</strong>: Accumulate experience and level up to gain new cards, headbutt chests for customization gems and power‑ups; chase weapon evolutions and summon survivors to trigger cascade of effects and break the game.</li>
<li><strong>Dungeon Crawling</strong>: Explore dungeons packed with something seldom seen in Vampire Survivors: functioning walls. And then all sorts of unique treasures and interactions. Find the shovel to dig into the next floor, that will most likely take place in the clouds!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And right onto the wishlist it goes! Fun to see Vampire Survivors as a thing expand. Now we have an entirely new game with a similar theme in a different genre, and we also have the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/warhammer-survivors-announced-as-a-licensed-vampire-survivors-game/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">licensed Warhammer Survivors game</a> coming too.</p>

      <title>Zork I, Zork II and Zork III are now officially open source</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Microsoft announced today that they're preserving a bit of history here - with Zork I, Zork II, and Zork III now officially and clearly open source. The source has been around for a while but now it's all proper.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://opensource.microsoft.com/blog/2025/11/20/preserving-code-that-shaped-generations-zork-i-ii-and-iii-go-open-source" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today, we’re preserving a cornerstone of gaming history that is near and dear to our hearts. Together, Microsoft’s Open Source Programs Office (OSPO), Team Xbox, and Activision are making <em>Zork I</em>, <em>Zork II</em>, and <em>Zork III</em> available under the MIT License. Our goal is simple: to place historically important code in the hands of students, teachers, and developers so they can study it, learn from it, and, perhaps most importantly, play it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They didn't put up their own repositories though, instead they decided to collaborate with Jason Scott of the Internet Archive, to officially send in pull requests to add the MIT license to each of the existing repositories. That's quite a nice way to do it. Those existing classic source repositories are now considered the canonical home for the Zork source code.</p>
<p>Microsoft said they chose the MIT license for its "simplicity and openness because it makes the code easy to study, teach, and build upon". </p>

      <title>Bioflux - Horde is a survival game where the infected numbers look insane</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Coming across it by pure chance recently, Bioflux - Horde is an upcoming survival game with enemy numbers that actually look like true hordes of infected.</p>
<p>I've played tons of action and survival games before, but I don't remember another that throws actual hordes of enemies running at you like this. The <em>closest</em> I can think if is probably World War Z for the sheer numbers but they're a different genre of game overall. Safe to say this is going onto my watch-list to keep a close eye on. Could end up being a good one to blast around in!</p>
<p>Have a look at their early trailer below:</p>

<p>In true indie dev style, I couldn't find a website or any real info about the developer to share - just the new Steam page that managed to capture my interest to highlight for you today.</p>
<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Open Quarantine Zone</strong> - Explore eight square kilometers of forest, suburbs and the ruins of Eisenstadt. Weather and the day night cycle constantly change visibility and atmosphere.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic Horde System</strong> - Face thousands of infected. Some wander through the landscape while others wait in the ruins. They react to movement, light and sound and they do not forget easily.</p>
<p><strong>Survival Under Pressure</strong> - Hunger, thirst and exhaustion shape every decision. Manage your resources or die trying.</p>
<p><strong>Building and Defense</strong> - Build and reinforce shelters in key locations. Power, lighting and defenses decide whether you survive the night or join the horde.</p>
<p><strong>Crafting and Exploration</strong> - Scavenge, loot and craft tools, weapons and equipment. Search hidden bunkers and old quarantine facilities buried in the wilderness.</p>
<p><strong>Open Storyline</strong> - Discover the truth behind the fall of Eisenstadt piece by piece. Follow traces, recordings and forgotten places that reveal what really happened inside the zone.</p>

      <title>Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster has launched from Nightdive and it&#39;s Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nightdive Studios today released Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster, and Valve have rated it Steam Deck Verified now too. Valve's rating came in earlier today, with their testing being done on Proton 10.</p>
<p>More about it: "Get ready for the good, the bad, and the even worse. One black day, ex-Marshall James Anderson’s quiet life with his wife and daughter was shattered by a fancy-dressed land baron intent on plowing down his farm to make way for a railroad. Now Anderson's driven by revenge, which he'll exact in a spray of gunfire. As the ex-Marshall, you'll face a horde of ornery, gun-slinging outlaws and have to shoot your way through a twisted plot fueled by greed. Arm yourself with the iron best suited for the job, as well as your wits, to settle the score."</p>
<p>Check out the release trailer:</p>

      <title>Clive Barker&#39;s Hellraiser: Revival gets a first gameplay trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We have our first brutal glimpse into the world of Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival, the upcoming horror-action game from Saber Interactive. It's due out sometime in 2026, we don't know exactly when that will be.</p>
<p>More about it: "Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival introduces a totally new Hellraiser story starring Aidan, who must unlock the dark powers of the mysterious Genesis Configuration puzzle box to save his girlfriend from the terrifying horrors of Hell. Discover a realm of terrors as you take on dark cultist worshippers, sex-crazed deviants, and infernal monstrosities, harnessing unique abilities and an arsenal of jaw-dropping weapons that can be instruments of both misery and delight. You’ll have many ways to defend yourself – but can you save yourself from an eternity of torment?"</p>
<p>Check it out below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="853GzhgIYVs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8c455659ceebef9489bb34760e773713.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/853GzhgIYVs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A Terrifying New Story in the Hellraiser Universe: Discover a chilling new story in the iconic horror franchise as you unwittingly kickstart Pinhead’s (voiced by Doug Bradley) ritual to unleash the ultimate torment on the world.</li>
<li>Unleash the Power of the Box: Harness the unique abilities of the Genesis Configuration in combination with an arsenal of earthly weapons to inflict bone-breaking, flesh-searing pain (or pleasure?) upon your enemies.</li>
<li>Battle for Survival Against Hell’s Armies: Take on Hell's wretches, deviants, cultists, and its most infernal priests in an unholy war for your immortal soul.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Looks like we may be in for quite the treat, if you like horror-action games that is. Might be a little too scary for me, then again - can anything beat the terror of Alien: Isolation - still the scariest game I've ever played. Nothing has topped it so far for me. Anyway, no doubt it will work well in Proton for Linux / SteamOS and the Steam Machine.</p>

      <title>Need a new local co-op game? Puzzle platformer Tentacle Tango looks great and challenging</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Starving for more local co-op games to play with a partner? Tentacle Tango could be what you need and it looks really fun. It's out today with Native Linux support.</p>
<p>What's it about? It's a chaotic co-op platformer where two inseparable octopuses — Ten and Tango — swing, jump, flop, and fumble their way through dangerous and hilarious worlds. Whether played solo or in co-op, every terrain demands teamwork, timing, and a healthy tolerance for accidental tentacle mishaps. It may look cute, but the developer assures us it will put friendships to the test, along with your reflexes.</p>
<p>Check out the release trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1-uTeYFwVRw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0de9cb9d545dfc9f155f905cc563701d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1-uTeYFwVRw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Not into local co-op? Good news there, as they've confirmed online play is also coming in the next few weeks too.</p>
<p>Some highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Two Octos. Sixteen Arms. Zero Personal Space</strong> - Bound together, you and your partner must synchronize your movements to overcome every challenge. Use momentum, timing, and teamwork to swing across gaps, avoid traps, and defeat enemies. In Tentacle Tango, even the smallest misstep can send you both tumbling, adding to the game's deceptively tough nature.</li>
<li><strong>Diverse Worlds to Explore</strong> - Each world brings new, progressively challenging obstacles—from crumbling platforms to intricate puzzles that require perfect coordination. The difficulty ramps up with every level, demanding quick reflexes and flawless teamwork.</li>
<li><strong>Solo or Local Co-op</strong> - Play solo, controlling both characters, or team up with a friend in co-op mode. Whether you're flying solo or partnering up, success hinges on perfect synchronization and timing.</li>
<li><strong>Leaderboards and Achievements</strong> - Climb the leaderboards by setting the best times, and compete with friends or globally to prove you’re the ultimate tandem team. Achievements await those who master the tango of teamwork.</li>
<li><strong>Cute, Yet Challenging</strong> - Don’t be deceived by the cute art and charming animals. Tentacle Tango may look like a lighthearted adventure, but underneath is a tough, skill-based challenge that tests your patience and precision. Success requires sharp timing and flawless coordination. Ready to test your teamwork? Tentacle Tango will put your cooperative skills to the test—because it truly takes two to tango!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Valve put up a new Steam Linux Runtime 4.0 with a move towards 64-bit</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>To ensure games run well on Linux either via Native Linux builds or Windows games with Proton, part of the magic is in the Steam Linux Runtime. A new version of it, the Steam Linux Runtime 4.0 was recently put up with some pretty big changes.</p>
<p>What's the point of it? It ensures Steam and games run through Steam on Linux work properly across all the many different Linux distributions. Another secret Valve sauce for Linux. Well, <em>not</em> secret at all but you get my meaning I'm sure.</p>
<p>Steam Linux Runtime 4.0 brings with it a major bump to the version of Debian as the base of the packages to Debian 13.2. Some of the other highlights from the initial <a href="https://gitlab.steamos.cloud/steamrt/steamrt/-/wikis/steamrt4-release-notes" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Some libraries like libFLAC and OpenSSL are new major versions with a new SONAME. These libraries are not ABI-compatible with their equivalents in sniper, and making use of them might also require code changes due to API compatibility breaks.</li>
<li>"Classic" SDL 2 has been replaced by sdl2-compat, but porting games to use SDL 3 directly is recommended.</li>
<li>Many larger and/or older libraries have been removed completely. Some might be added back in at a later date if we find that they are necessary. For example:
	<ul>
<li>AT-SPI</li>
<li>FLTK</li>
<li>GLUT</li>
<li>GTK</li>
<li>ICU</li>
<li>libproxy</li>
<li>libsoup</li>
<li>ncurses</li>
<li>Qt</li>
<li>SDL 2 versions of SDL_image, etc. (SDL 3 versions are still available)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Most libraries that were previously available for both x86_64 and i386 are now only available for x86_64. In general, we only have i386 libraries if they are expected to be needed for Proton or for the steam-runtime-tools diagnostic tools.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And a follow-up update:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Platform libraries</h3>
<ul>
<li>Update packages from Debian 13.2 point release:
	<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">cups_2.4.10-3+deb13u2</code> (<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/1109471" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Debian#1109471</a>)</li>

</blockquote>
<p>You as a gamer and Linux user don't need to do anything, it's all used automatically depending on what Valve set.</p>
<p>They've also confirmed the Steam Linux Runtime 5 is also under development, currently in the prototype stage.</p>

      <title>The cross-platform Nexus Mods app v0.21.1 makes mod collection installation smoother</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Nexus Mods app team have rolled out another early release for their in-progress successor to Vortex, with v0.21.1 bringing more improvements. It's free, open source and most importantly - has a Native Linux version available.</p>
<p>With this release they said the focus has been on "making mod collection installation smoother, improving Health Checks and logs, and squashing several key bugs for a more reliable experience". While in the background work continues on technical features needed to support Bethesda games like Skyrim and Fallout 4.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6910706071763574417gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6910706071763574417gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>From the changelog:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Features:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collection Conflict Rules:</strong> Mod collection <strong>conflict resolution rules</strong> (which files win when multiple mods include the same file) are now correctly applied the very <strong>first time</strong> you install a collection. This ensures your collection starts up correctly from the beginning.</li>
<li><strong>Better File Checks:</strong> The "Missing Game Files" Health Check now includes a <strong>list of the actual affected files</strong>. This makes it much easier to pinpoint exactly which files need attention.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h3>Bug Fixes and Stability:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fixed Collection Installation:</strong> Fixed a bug that occurred when installing collections that use <strong>Fomod installers with predefined choices</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Resolved 'File In Use' Error:</strong> Fixed a "File in use" exception that could appear when <strong>unmanaging a game</strong> and then trying to <strong>delete the associated mods</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Logging:</strong> Added more <strong>debug information</strong> to the logs, specifically for cases where <strong>backup limit exceptions</strong> are triggered. This will help our team diagnose and fix these issues.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h3>Behind-the-Scenes Improvements:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Refactoring and Optimizations:</strong> we did some general refactoring and optimization related to project structure, hashing and GameIds.</li>
<li><strong>UI State System:</strong> Implemented a system to <strong>save and restore user interface (UI) state</strong>. While not actively used yet, this sets the stage for features where views can remember your preferred layouts and configurations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Considering we're about to see more hardware arriving with SteamOS Linux like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-reveal-the-new-steam-frame-steam-controller-and-steam-machine-with-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the new Steam Machine and Steam Frame</a>, getting a properly good cross-platform mod manager like this is going to be essential. So it's pleasing to watch it continue to mature towards being the go-to.</p>

      <title>AMD FSR Redstone arrives December 10 with a teaser</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AMD have gone and done it. They've put up a teaser for an announcement of AMD FSR Redstone arriving on December 10. Marketing - you gotta love it right? A 26 second video that tells us nothing at all, only that FSR Redstone is "premiering on December 10th".</p>
<p>Officially, only Radeon RX 9000 will be supported, so a lot of GPU owners are going to miss out unless they upgrade. Well, FSR4 can be made to work on earlier models (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/steam-deck-plugin-adds-amd-fsr4-support-to-improve-visuals/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">even the Steam Deck</a>), but it's not completely clear exactly what Redstone will hook into so it may just be out of reach for older generations.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6IWzvKxkKVc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c59bfe641070fdabfd325e71376012d6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6IWzvKxkKVc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>According to AMD's own information, FSR Redstone key highlights include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FSR "Redstone" is a suite of ML-powered gaming technologies, delivering smoother performance and sharper visuals on the latest on AMD RDNA™ 4 GPUs – coming soon.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FSR Upscaling:</strong> (Formerly AMD FidelityFX™ Super Resolution) Reconstructs crisp, high-quality visuals from low-resolution frames. </li>
<li><strong>FSR Frame Generation:</strong> Predicts and inserts new frames between rendered ones, delivering smoother and higher frame rate gaming.</li>
<li><strong>FSR Ray Regeneration:</strong> Infers and restores full-quality ray-traced detail from sparse samples, delivering sharp, noise-free visuals with reduced rendering cost. </li>
<li><strong>FSR Radiance Caching:</strong> Dynamically learns and then predicts how light propagates through a scene, delivering efficient real-time global illumination. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I do wonder how long it will be before Proton supports it. We only just had <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/vkd3d-proton-3-0-brings-fsr4-support-shader-backend-rewrite-lots-of-bug-fixes-and-performance-upgrades/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VKD3D-Proton 3.0 released which finally has FSR4 support</a> - so it may be a little while. As always, GamingOnLinux will let you know when we know without any clickbait on it.</p>

      <title>A great showcase of open source - Blender 5.0 is out with completely overhauled colour management</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another release is here for the incredible open source project Blender. The 5.0 release brings huge changes like completely overhauled colour management.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bringing with it a refreshed colour management pipeline that natively supports wide-gamut and HDR colour spaces. This also comes with improvements to their Vulkan support, and is supported on both Linux and Windows. With these improvements you get new display and views including support for:</p>
<ul>
<li>ACES 1.3 and 2.0 views as an alternative to AgX and Filmic and for compatibility with ACES pipelines (both standard and HDR).</li>
<li>Rec.2100-PQ and Rec.2100-HLG displays. May be used for color grading for <a href="https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/pipeline_io/#images-movies" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">HDR video export</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/142758" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">AgX HDR</a> view.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Tons more new like much faster material compilation, a new fully realistic skeleton asset from the community, lots of big new rendering features like the Compositor in Blender 5.0 gaining a new asset shelf filled with built-in effects. There's also massive improvements to the Video Sequencer with "unprecedented integration" across different areas of the app, the UV Sync feature has been completely overhauled and enabled by default, there's lots of improvements for XR / VR and the list goes on forever.</p>
<p>On Linux there's also now support for the cursor-shape protocol under Wayland.</p>
<p>Check out their official overview video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4wEqD-jK0DU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a9f936c55ffe5841034904337c42eb85.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4wEqD-jK0DU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking as someone who doesn't work with modelling and the like, this is far from my comfort zone. But, as an open source project it really does showcase how amazing the open source community can be - building something as incredible and feature-filled as this.</p>

      <title>Surviving each day is a fierce battle in the upcoming Primal Survival</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Primal Survival is an upcoming prehistoric game about surviving as Homo habilis or Homo erectus, and it really sounds interesting with the dangerous world.</p>
<p>At the dawn of human history, fire has just been discovered and you're taking steps into a wider world. That's the basics of Primal Survival, it's all about sending you back in time some 2.5–3 million years, where hunting for the basics like food and water is as dangerous as anything else.</p>
<p>Check out the announcement trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="61mqauOptAw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6b3e79da9d68158781681a7d1b4cbcfa.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/61mqauOptAw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some things to expect from it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Paleo-Atmosphere: No zombies, no magic. Just a world populated by scientifically grounded megafauna like Mammoths, Smilodons, and Platybelodons.</li>
<li>Archaic Struggle: There is no modern tech. You rely on stone, bone, and wood. It is about surviving nature exactly as early humans did.</li>
<li>Visuals: We are using Unreal Engine 5.5 (Nanite + Lumen) to create a gritty, dark, and dangerous environment.</li>
<li>Co-op: You can form a tribe with friends to build shelter and stand a chance against the ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- squire --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking over email about Linux support the developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- squire -->Linux gaming is important to us, and we know your community values proper support.<br/>
We’re actively working to ensure the game runs well on Linux through Proton, and we’re paying attention to Linux-specific issues throughout development. Supporting Linux players is definitely part of our plans as we move toward the next phases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But why another survival game? What's different about it? They said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- squire -->We wanted to move away from fantasy tropes and create a grounded, scientifically based prehistoric experience. Unlike many survival games where you quickly become powerful, our core philosophy is simple: <strong>You are not the hunter. You are the prey.</strong></p>

      <title>I have finished Dispatch and now I&#39;m at a loss so I&#39;m going to play it again</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Last night I finished my first run in the new episodic superhero adventure Dispatch from AdHoc Studio, and now I don't know what to do with myself.</p>
<p>So I think I'll treat myself to playing through it again, because there's a good amount of choices that really clearly affect big parts of the overall story, and I can think of numerous times where I would like to do something differently. I even managed to hook in the partner to play it through, and it sounds like they're going to be doing the same with an additional play-through.</p>
<p>It's easily one of the absolute best game of the year by far, and I'm pleased to see it has been a huge success for AdHoc Studio! Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dispatch-is-on-course-to-beat-its-three-year-sales-target-in-three-months-heres-how" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GI.Biz</a>, the developer noted how they expected to hit a specific target within three years that they're now on track to do in only three months.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19589840331763555836gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The game is split into two parts — there's anime-styled cut scenes that allow you to pick between watching like a mini-movie or with quick-time events, and then there's the hero management. The management side of it was great fun too, surprisingly challenging as well with you needing to match up the right hero from your team of reformed villains to each call.</p>
<p>Making it an episodic format like a TV show was a clever move too, with excitement building up for each new episode as they came out in blocks of two. That could have just as easily worked against them, but thankfully it has paid off. Seeing everyone talk about it as the episodes rolled in, seeing the hype — it's an experience that's nice not to miss. And thanks to Valve, no one on Linux / SteamOS has to miss out with Proton running Windows games so nicely.</p>
<p>I'll admit the brief bit of nudity was a surprise in one episode, especially where it opens with a rather spicy scene. Caught me out good that did. Good job I wasn't playing it around anyone else - hah. Definitely not a game to play around younger people.</p>
<p>Dispatch made me <em>really</em> feel something too. You'll know the scenes if you've played it. When a certain speedy character says "keep up" and runs off and bad stuff happens. Then the next episode, in a past memory they say "keep up" again and then it jumps back to now and someone is in hospital. The entire mood of the episode is completely different to everything else. The rain on the map in the management section too, the carefully muted audio - gosh, I felt the sadness in me too. The writing and the voice acting is just, <em>fantastic</em>. It all made me really truly care about the characters that I just had to write something more on the game because it's <em>so</em> good.</p>
<p>That's why I feel like I'm at such a loss. It really truly sucked me in, and I feel a sense of nothing without it right now because it's done and finished.</p>
<p>If you've been sitting on the fence about it just jump off already, it's brilliant. I need more. I really hope for a second season, or just more games that mix things together so nicely like this did. Just more <em>please</em>. I'm starving for it. It's safe to say I'll be jumping right into whatever AdHoc Studio make next if it's anything near this quality level.</p>
<p>The game works perfectly on Desktop Linux and Steam Deck with Proton. Not a single issue encountered. It is one of the most perfect for Steam Deck games I've played.</p>

      <title>Megabonk from vedinad has withdrawn from The Game Awards 2025</title>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Game Awards is never without some kind of controversy, but this is a little different. Developer vedinad has withdrawn Megabonk from The Game Awards 2025.</p>

However, this is <em>not</em> their first game, just their first under the name of vedinad.</p>

<p>While I applaud their honesty, and their attempt to address it like this, it does shine a light on the <em>Debut</em> category as a whole that feels like Megabonk could have been kept in. Since, other games in the category are from studios that have plenty of veterans. Like how Dispatch from AdHoc Studio was formed by former devs of the likes of Telltale Games and Ubisoft, same again with Sandfall Interactive who has veterans from Ubisoft and other studios.</p>
<p>What would TGA be without a little drama huh? Like how in 2023, Dave the Diver was nominated in the "Best Independent Game" category, despite it very much not being an indie game in any way. The developer, Mintrocket, is owned by the huge Nexon group.</p>

      <title>Steamworks SDK adds support for Linux Arm and Android, and it seems we know the first Android game on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As we get closer to the launch of the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-reveal-the-new-steam-frame-steam-controller-and-steam-machine-with-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new Steam Machine and Steam Frame</a>, Valve put out a new Steamworks SDK that brings in libraries for linuxarm64 and android.</p>
<p>This is of course work more specifically for the Steam Frame, since it's using an ARM64 processor and it will support running Android APKs to hopefully get developers from other VR kits to work with it. And, as confirmed previously by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/818672/valve-android-apps-steam-frame" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The Verge</a>, Steam itself is getting Android games to go with it.</p>
<p>Steamworks SDK 1.63 <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/627817201164877826" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added libs for linuxarm64 and androidarm64.</li>
<li>ISteamMusicRemote has been removed.</li>
</ul>
<strong>ISteamController</strong>
<ul>
<li>Added controller action origins for Lenovo Legion Go.</li>
<li>Added controller action origins for generic controller.</li>
</ul>
<strong>ISteamInput</strong>
<ul>
<li>Added input action origins for Lenovo Legion Go.</li>
<li>Added input action origins for generic controller.</li>
</ul>
<strong>ISteamRemotePlay</strong>
<ul>
<li>Added keypad scancode values.</li>
</ul>
<strong>ISteamUser</strong>
<ul>
<li>GetMarketEligibility may now return new k_EMarketNotAllowedReason_TradeCooldown status code in MarketEligibilityResponse_t.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And it seems we may know what the first Android game being added to Steam is, with Walkabout Mini Golf. As noted on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1408230/history/?changeid=32325165" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> (thanks to <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1990961231180542086" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Brad Lynch</a> on X), Android has been added to the "oslist" (operating system list) with the details noting the "WalkaboutMiniGolf.apk" executable file it will launch.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19690952121763552816gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Fun times ahead. The industry is going to look quite different by the end of 2026.</p>
<p>Imagine if Valve actually fully rolled out running Android stuff on SteamOS as a whole via the compatibility layer Proton, and not just for the Steam Frame. That would be <em>very</em> interesting, and perhaps already in their plans.</p>

      <title>JSAUX are teasing Steam Machine front panels with built-in screens</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>JSAUX are teasing that they're going to be making <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-reveal-the-new-steam-frame-steam-controller-and-steam-machine-with-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Machine</a> accessories, with the first being a new front panel for the Steam Machine with a screen. Some company was obviously going to do this, especially since Valve actually teased it was possible and showed off a prototype with a few YouTubers.</p>
<p>Writing on X / Twitter on November 17, JSAUX <a href="https://x.com/jsauxofficial/status/1990418613380186120" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">teased</a> a few different ideas including an E-Ink display, LCD or Dot-Matrix. Asking people to vote in the comments.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/993021921763551983gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>In a later <a href="https://x.com/jsauxofficial/status/1990812744216363357" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, they teased a mock-up image noting something was coming in 2026.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18005856441763552020gol1.webp" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18005856441763552020gol1.webp"/></a></p>
<p>Just like we had lots and lots of accessories for the Steam Deck, this could be another fun boost for accessory companies like JSAUX. Having more set hardware like this makes it easy for them, and fun for all of us to see what they can come up with. And no doubt I'll be testing a good few of them over the next year or two.</p>
<p>I wonder what else companies will come up with to empty our wallets for the Steam Machine and Steam Frame next year?</p>

      <title>Unity games are coming to Fortnite as Epic continue attempting to build a metaverse thing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Epic Games are still trying to build some kind of metaverse inside Fortnite, and now they're pulling in Unity to expand Fortnite even more.</p>
<p>I know - Fortnite doesn't work at all on Linux / SteamOS, it's listed on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our dedicated anti-cheat page</a> as broken, but it's still big industry news to be aware of. Plus, with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-reveal-the-new-steam-frame-steam-controller-and-steam-machine-with-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">upcoming Steam Machine and Steam Frame</a>, who knows, maybe we'll actually pull in a few more millions of people that Epic can't ignore. Anti-cheat is <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/anti-cheat-will-still-be-one-of-the-biggest-problems-for-the-new-steam-machine/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">going to remain quite a blocker</a> though until we see more people move to Linux / SteamOS for gaming.</p>
<p>Anyway, the news. That's why you're here, not my rambling. In a <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/unity-and-epic-games-together-advance-the-open-interoperable-future-for-video-gaming" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> Epic Games announced they're teaming up with Unity to "bring Unity games into Fortnite, creating more opportunity and value for players and developers" giving developers the "ability to publish Unity games into Fortnite". </p>
<p>I do find this very interesting actually. Because while the Epic Games Store might not be a goldmine for third-party developers, Fortnite clearly has a lot of eyes on it all the time. Epic are probably one of the few that could make this whole metaverse thing actually work, since Fortnite is already very popular. And now more different games inside it from a different game engine? The industry is getting <em>weird</em>.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“We’re excited to partner with Epic Games to create more opportunities for game developers around the world,” said Matt Bromberg, President and CEO, Unity. “Choice and open systems create growth for everyone in the gaming ecosystem.”</p>
<p>“Just like the early days of the web, we believe that companies need to work together in order to build the open metaverse in a way that’s interoperable and fair,” said Tim Sweeney, Founder and CEO of Epic Games. “Working alongside Unity we’re helping developers build fun games, reach bigger audiences, and find success.”</p>

      <title>Hello from Fedora KDE</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I recently did a bit of a major <em>woops</em>, and so I decided perhaps it is once again time to Linux distro hop and have settled on Fedora KDE.</p>
<p>You see even though I have been using computers since I was tiny in the days of the Amiga, and I've been using Linux for…21 years now (oh god, I feel old writing that), I'm still a bit of a complete <em>moron</em> at times. Why you might ask? Because I just like to ignore clear problems and "yolo" my way through things apparently.</p>
<p>I had an issue that annoyed me — my main Kubuntu 25.04 partition was getting filled up, and it caused a serious problem recently where I couldn't actually boot into it. Linux doesn't particularly handle a main drive being filled gracefully (still?!), so I thought - okay, I'll actually remove a bunch of games I'm not playing from the other partition and merge them into one big partition for my main drive. That would solve <em>everything</em>. I still had <em>three</em> other drives to fill with games that I keep telling myself I will get around to actually playing.</p>
<p>So, off to download an Ubuntu ISO I went. Burned it to a USB drive, loaded it up and started up gparted. This is where the <em>problems</em> began. The gparted app froze up on me. I (stupidly), thought nothing of it. Forced it closed, started it up again and it got stuck again but this time while scanning my drives for an eternity (okay, a few minutes but it didn't budge). I googled around, found I could launch gparted just on the specific drive I needed it for — it worked! <em>Or, so I thought…</em></p>
<p>It was going to take an hour or so to resize the drive, so off I went to do some overdue housework. I came back a few times to inspect, all going well but eventually — it froze. Oh no. Oh dear. I left it a while again but it had very clearly frozen up, the app was doing <em>nothing</em> it was just totally stuck. In hindsight, if gparted on a live ISO is being weird, don't use it. Nevermind, lessons learned that will no doubt be ignored again in future.</p>
<p>The only reasonable thing to do at this point where you need your system back quick is to go totally <em>nuclear</em> right? Annihilate the partitions from orbit, and pick a new distribution while you're at it. And that's exactly what I did. So, hello from Fedora KDE - things are a bit different, but also very much the same. The new home that powers basically everything GamingOnLinux.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6909728911763550435gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6909728911763550435gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><em>Feels just like /home</em></p>
<p>Luckily for me, I don't keep anything actually important on my main drive. It's spread across multiple other drives and the cloud, so nothing was actually lost. Apart from my ability to remember how to properly set up accessing the GamingOnLinux server from within the Dolphin file manager. But, this time when I had it all re-done, I actually noted down the exact steps. Hooray for less confusion for when I no doubt break something again. I'm really good at breaking things, as a few contributors and readers will know. There was the time I completely broke an install trying to compile OBS Studio from source, yes really. No I still don't know how I did it.</p>
<p>Fedora's newer installer is quite nice too, looks streamlined and somewhat inviting and works well! Got me back up and running in no time at all.</p>
<p>I'm glad the Fedora crew decided to promote their KDE edition to full status. KDE Plasma is simply my love, I couldn't be without it nowadays. No hate to the GNOME crew, but your desktop and the design decisions around it just doesn't jive with me. I like all the options KDE Plasma gives me. That, and KDE Plasma is the Desktop Mode on Steam Deck and soon the Steam Frame and Steam Machine too - so it's nice to have everything match.</p>
<p><em>Anyway, back to work. Carry on.</em></p>

      <title>Playnite may get a Linux version during 2026 as the creator plans a move to Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Creator of the popular free and open source video game library manager Playnite has a positive update on a Linux version, with plans for it during 2026.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/popular-game-launcher-playnite-will-get-linux-support-but-its-still-a-while-away/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Back in February</a>, GamingOnLinux covered the latest update from the creator on their plans for it, where they noted "To sum this up, Linux version is definitely something I plan to work on in future, it's just going to happen later than originally planned.".</p>
<p>Seems this may come just a <em>bit</em> sooner than expected, as per the latest update from the developer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"2025 update 2</p>
<p>I'm planning to move to Linux in 2026 after P11 is done, and since Playnite is my personal blocker for the move, I will try to make some Linux version in 2026. Definitely not fully featured version on parity with Windows version of P11, and probably desktop mode only, but something daily drivable with Linux specific features (Wine/Proton integration for example).</p>
<p>If that goes well, I'll start looking into P11 Avalonia porting proper say I mentioned in previous update."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hopefully their Linux move and work on Playnite for Linux go well. See more about Playnite on their <a href="https://playnite.link/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

      <title>The Game Awards 2025 nominees revealed</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Game Awards returns for another popularity contest, and they've revealed the nominees for the 2025 event that we've listed here for you.</p>
<p>Voting is open but their website is still seemingly struggling to cope with the demand. They also make it quite annoying to actually go through all of the categories to see what's in there. So here's all of the categories and those nominated below for your easy reading.</p>
<p>Once again as well, the event is it a time that's pretty <em>terrible</em> for the UK and Europe, starting 12:30am UTC on 12th December 2025 (4:30pm PST, 11th December). It will be livestreamed across most major streaming services, including Amazon Prime Video this year.</p>
<p><strong>Game of the Year</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li>
<li>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</li>
<li>Donkey Kong Bananza</li>

      <title>Hytale has been saved as Hypixel acquired it from Riot Games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For anyone interested in the ongoing saga of Hytale, the good news is that the game has been saved, with Hytale Studios acquiring it from Riot Games.</p>
<p>What is it? Hytale blends the freedom of a sandbox with the momentum of an RPG: explore a procedurally generated world full of dungeons, secrets, and a variety of creatures, then shape it block by block. Riot purchased the studio back in 2020, and then in June 2025 announced the cancellation of it. Now, it's back!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10113050721763467693gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>As detailed in a <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-is-saved" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> they explained how they've managed to rehire "more than 30" developers who were previously working on the game, with them hoping to bring back even more and all while being "fully independent and personally committed to funding Hytale for the next 10 years".</p>
<p>The too long / didn't read from the blog post (they included this themselves):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Early access date:</strong> To be announced in the coming days</li>
<li><strong>Platform:</strong> Windows at launch, Linux / Mac will be attempted, other platforms much later</li>
<li><strong>Pricing:</strong> Details to be announced in the coming days</li>
<li><strong>Early access state:</strong> Expect bugs, rough edges, unbalanced content, and frequent updates that break things</li>
<li><strong>Early access duration:</strong> Expected to last at least a few years; no rush to "1.0"</li>
<li><strong>Launch content:</strong> Exploration Mode, Creative Mode, and Modding</li>
<li><strong>Not at launch:</strong> Minigames and Adventure Mode (both come later; dedicated team for minigames)</li>
<li><strong>Ownership:</strong> We own 100% of Hytale (repurchased from Riot Games)</li>
<li><strong>Funding:</strong> 10-year personal funding commitment; no investors or publishers</li>
<li><strong>Game build:</strong> Using the previous engine from the trailer, enabling faster development and immediate playability</li>
<li><strong>Modding:</strong> Available at launch. Run your own servers and create custom content.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Pretty fun to see they will even attempt a Linux version too. Although, we do have Wine / Proton if they're unable to do it.</p>
<p>Nice to see some good news from the games industry.</p>

      <title>The big new RPG Where Winds Meet release works well on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Where Winds Meet is a new free to play game on Steam that's doing some big numbers right now, and thankfully it seems to work great on Linux with Proton. Tested with Proton 10, so far I haven't encountered any issues.</p>
<p>What is it? Set during the turbulent era of tenth-century China with a Wuxia theme, it's an open-world action-adventure RPG. It's not directly an MMO though. It sort-of blends the worlds of solo and online play together. You can play it entirely alone, or team up with up with friends to play together. But, it does have some MMO features in it too like guilds and group activities. When starting the game, you choose initially how you want to play it. It's a curious mixture.</p>
<p>Proving to be popular too with it hitting an all-time peak of 193,860 players online on November 16th following the launch on November 14th.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10977799781763465123gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10977799781763465123gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15655938401763465855gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15655938401763465855gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Surprisingly, it doesn't appear to have anti-cheat. There's nothing listed on the Steam page, and it works out of the box with Proton 10. So for now it's <em>not</em> listed on our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated anti-cheat page</a> but that could change with the popularity of it, so we'll be keeping a close eye on this one. Hopefully for players interested it will just continue working.</p>
<p>Performance at 2560x1440 on my Ryzen 5800x + Radeon 6800 XT on the defaults seems mostly great. Some blips down to 50FPS during the intense intro scene, but other than that it has been smooth. This is with most settings on Ultra, only Ambient Occlusion and Tessellation are on High.</p>
<p>It does commit two annoying sins: a forced intro with no ability to change settings. And, you cannot change settings on the main menu, only once you login with your character. Both quite hostile user experiences.</p>
<p>As it's free to play, there are in-game purchases which the developer and publisher has promised "no pay-to-win mechanics to ensure a fair gameplay environment".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="e8S4yoXNMPU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/95d2db3f9bd41d30aaafc61dbf857b19.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/e8S4yoXNMPU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where Winds Meet boasts a vast, intricately crafted open world filled with life, featuring over 20 distinct regions to explore. The game harmoniously integrates history with the imaginative essence of the Wuxia world. With more than 10,000 unique NPCs, each with their own personalities and responses, players can shape their interactions, turning characters into trusted allies or sworn enemies based on their choices.</p>
<p>The game offers players the opportunity to master over 40 unique Martial Mystic Arts and an arsenal of weapons, including Spears, Swords, Dual Blades, Glaive, Umbrella, and Fans, and unlock distinctive martial arts skills, including Acupuncture Hitting, Lion's Roar, Merciful Picking, and Tai Chi.</p>
<p>Choose to embark on a journey as a lone swordsman or team up with up to 4 others on your adventure, as players can immerse themselves in over 150 hours of rich, narratively driven exploration and adventure. Those looking to test their newly established skills on the battlefield can take part in PVP battles against other players.</p>
<p>Craft your own legend and weave your own destiny as Where Winds Meet lets players pick the job role that best suits them. Players can pick from the role of a doctor, merchant, assassin or bounty hunter. Decide the path you take, whether that’s good or evil, the choices to stay true to your original aspiration or throw it all away, all in the name of freedom and unbound adventure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Something that does concern me a bit is the apparent use of generative AI. Specifically, it seems they may be using some kind of AI chatbox for some (not all) NPCs, which is not listed on the Steam page. There's plenty of reports out there on it - just search for "AI" on their <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereWindsMeet/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Reddit</a> and you'll see loads. Hopefully Valve will get them to update the store page to clearly note any generative AI use for players to get a clear picture.</p>

      <title>Earth 2140 remake on OpenRA engine OpenE2140 gets a first release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>OpenE2140 is bringing back Earth 2140, the classic RTS with it being powered by the OpenRA engine and a first release is out now. Showing just how great the OpenRA engine is, hopefully we'll see more revivals like this for other retro strategy games.</p>
<p>It's classed as an "early access alpha release" as it's not complete. There's no AI in it yet, so the focus is currently on multiplayer. Writing about it the developers said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We understand that this might be a bit disappointing for some people — Earth 2140 was mainly a single-player game after all. However, making AI work with the specifics of Earth 2140 (mainly base building) is going to take some time. We’ve focused on adding as many gameplay features as possible before making this public release, because that’s what’s actually most important: without units and buildings, you can’t really play an RTS like Earth 2140.</p>
<p>We think your ability to play multiplayer games with others may actually be interesting, because only the old DOS version of Earth 2140 had multiplayer — and even that was hard to get working (all Windows versions came without multiplayer and never received it after release).</p>

      <title>Steam Deck gets display-off low power downloads in a new stable update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have released the big upgrade for Steam Deck that brings display-off low power downloads for everyone now, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/steam-deck-gets-a-new-low-power-screen-off-downloads-mode/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">after a short time in Beta</a>. I'm actually surprised the Beta was so short for such a big feature, I would have thought it would need a fair amount more testing time, but Valve do like to roll out things pretty rapidly sometimes.</p>
<p>What this means: when you go to put your Steam Deck to sleep and you have active downloads, it will now ask what you want to do between continue downloading with the screen off or going right to sleep. By default it's turned on for when you're plugged in, and turned off for when on battery power. You can tweak the behaviour in the power settings menu.</p>

      <title>Mesa 25.3.0 released with lots of Linux graphics driver improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just as the weekend arrived, Mesa 25.3.0 was released as the latest new-feature upgrade for open source Linux graphics drivers.</p>
<p>Curiously, it was <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/tags/mesa-25.3.0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">tagged</a> and put out on the 14th but as of yet there's been <em>no</em> release announcement to the mailing list, and <em>no</em> news post to notify of the new release on the official Mesa website either. I <em>was</em> waiting on the actual announcements before posting either Friday or Saturday, but it seems to be coming in quite late. So anyway, here we are.<br/>
<em>Minor update 22:59 UTC: a while after publishing the <a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/relnotes/25.3.0.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Mesa news post</a> went live.</em></p>
<p>As usual, you may want to stick with the previous latest bug fix release with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/linux-open-source-graphics-drivers-mesa-25-2-7-released/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mesa 25.2.7</a> until the first point release for Mesa 25.3 is out while they deal with any issues that appear. The release calendar is not up to date yet either, but we can usually expect the Mesa 25.3.1 release in around 2 weeks.</p>
<p>Whenever they actually publish the announcements, we can see from <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/blob/523eea18c546b67ce0ed8425f5eb469808fa7523/docs/relnotes/25.3.0.rst" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitLab</a> this will be in the release notes:</p>

      <title>VKD3D-Proton 3.0 brings FSR4 support, shader backend rewrite, lots of bug fixes and performance upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>VKD3D-Proton is one of the secret ingredients for Proton to make so many Windows games work well on Linux / SteamOS with a new 3.0 release out now.</p>
<p>You don't need to actually do anything to upgrade, as Valve pull in VKD3D-Proton changes for Proton versions themselves that you'll see in future Proton release updates. However, if you wish to try it out in the current version of Proton <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-update-dxvk-and-vkd3d-proton-in-proton-and-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">we have a GamingOnLinux guide</a> to tell you what to do.</p>
<p>In VKD3D-Proton 3.0 there's a a major DXBC shader backend rewrite that brings improvements to the D3D12 mode in various games, resulting in some games that were previously broken being fixed. Nice! They noted that "Some recently released DXBC based games also only work on the new path" and that DXVK shares the same backend, so it has been tested quite heavily.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/497785671763397391gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Mafia: Definitive Edition</em></p>
<p>There's also the exciting FSR4 support added in which will even work on older AMD GPUs, although the default build of VKD3D-Proton only exposes the feature for RDNA4+ since the "quite hacky emulation path" for older GPUs comes with a "significant performance cost (and some cost to theoretical correctness)". You have to build from source to get the emulation path, as the plan is to "be able to ship FSR4 in a more proper way in Proton".</p>
<p>Various additions to D3D12 feature support, a whole bunch of performance improvements, along with lots and lots of game fixes too.</p>
<details class="spoiler_container"><summary class="spoiler_header">Full changelog, click me</summary>
<div class="spoiler-content">
<div class="markdown-body my-3" data-pjax="true" data-test-selector="body-content" data-view-component="true">
<p>A new major release, yay!<br/>
A few milestones have been reached over the last year, warranting a new major bump.<br/>
It's been quite a while since the last release due to new things coming up constantly.<br/>
These tags are mostly arbitrary anyway, and tend to be done when islands of calm and stability emerge.</p>
<h3>Major items</h3>
<h4>DXBC shader backend rewrite</h4>
<p><a class="notranslate user-mention" href="https://github.com/doitsujin" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">@doitsujin</a> rewrote the entire DXBC backend, replacing our legacy vkd3d-shader path.<br/>
DXVK and vkd3d-proton now share the same DXBC frontend which gives us clean,<br/>
"readable" (as readable as DXBC can be) and lean IR to work with.<br/>
dxil-spirv standalone project now supports DXBC as well as a result.</p>
<p>Lots of games which used to be completely broken before due to bugs and missing features<br/>
in the legacy vkd3d-shader backend are now fixed. E.g. Red Dead Redemption 2 runs just fine now in D3D12 mode.<br/>
Some recently released DXBC based games also only work on the new path.<br/>
The amount of regressions found the last months in DXBC games has been very minor,<br/>
but it's possible there are still bugs in this area.<br/>
However, given that DXVK uses it now as well, it's been battle tested quite extensively already.</p>
<h4>FSR4 support</h4>
<p>We added support for AGS WMMA intrinsics through <code class="inline-code">VK_KHR_cooperative_matrix</code> and <code class="inline-code">VK_KHR_shader_float8</code>,<br/>
which is enough to support FSR4.<br/>
Note that these shaders are tightly coded for AMD GPUs with some implementation defined behavior<br/>
(particularly around matrix layouts), and they will not necessarily work on other GPU vendors.</p>
<p>There is also a quite hacky emulation path of this which relies on int8 and float16 cooperative matrix support,<br/>
which can run on older GPUs at significant performance cost (and some cost to theoretical correctness).</p>
<p>Note that the default "official" build of vkd3d-proton only exposes this feature when the native<br/>
<code class="inline-code">VK_KHR_shader_float8</code> is properly supported, i.e. RDNA4+ only.<br/>
The emulation path is available when building from source with the appropriate build flags.<br/>
The decision to not include this emulation path by default is over my pay grade.<br/>
The aim is to be able to ship FSR4 in a more proper way in Proton.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>We've more or less caught up on the things we can feasibly implement,<br/>
so there isn't much exciting stuff happening on the feature front.</p>
<ul>
<li>Implemented experimental support for D3D12 work graphs. No real-world content ships this yet.<br/>
	This implementation is far from complete,<br/>
	but it works on "any" GPU since we emulate the feature with normal compute shaders.<br/>
	Funnily enough, the performance of this emulation can massively outperform native driver implementations of the feature<br/>
	in many scenarios we've tested (at the cost of some extra VRAM usage).<br/>
	See <code class="inline-code">docs/</code> for more details on implementation and some performance numbers.</li>
<li>Expose <code class="inline-code">AdvancedTextureOpsSupported</code> by default from SM 6.7 if <code class="inline-code">VK_KHR_maintenance8</code> is supported.</li>
<li>Expose the recently added sparse TIER_4.</li>
<li>Bump exposed D3D12SDKVersion to latest 618.</li>
<li>Experimentally expose support for opacity micromaps.<br/>
	There are some details which aren't quite compatible with the D3D12 API, but some basic demo content is working fine.</li>
<li>Add support for AMD_anti_lag when exposed. The current implementation does not take frame-gen into account.</li>
<li>Implement support for tight alignment from recent AgilitySDK.</li>
<li>Add support for shared resource path on upstream Wine.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<ul>
<li>Overhaul the texture copy batching situation.<br/>
	The new batching logic should be able to improve performance in many more cases than before.
	<ul>
<li>Implemented support for <code class="inline-code">VK_KHR_unified_image_layouts</code>.<br/>
		Image copy batching in particular can take advantage of this to avoid a lot of unnecessary barriers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Removed manual clear workaround on newer (6.15.9+) kernels on AMD, where an old kernel regression was finally fixed.<br/>
	Kernels older than 6.10 are also not affected by this workaround.</li>
<li>Use push descriptor path on Qualcomm GPUs over BDA for speed.</li>
<li>Improve handling of GDeflate when decompression extension is not available.<br/>
	We now ship our own fallback shader in GLSL instead of the more awkward HLSL shader that dstorage ships.</li>
<li>Bump DGC scratch size on NVIDIA. Should avoid some massive perf drops in Halo Infinite on NVIDIA.</li>
<li>Add performance optimization for The Last of Us Part 1 to prefer 2D tiling on 3D images.<br/>
	Requires <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/38084" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">an update to Mesa</a> as well to get the proper effect.</li>
<li>Handle depth/stencil &lt;-&gt; color image copies better when <code class="inline-code">VK_KHR_maintenance8</code> is supported.</li>
<li>Make use of <code class="inline-code">VK_EXT_zero_initialize_device_memory</code> to avoid manual clears on allocation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Emit render pass barriers as expected on tiled GPUs. Fixes misc rendering bugs reported on e.g. Turnip.
	<ul>
<li>For performance reasons, we deliberately skirt the spec a bit on desktop GPUs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed a bunch of minor correctness problems exposed by new Vulkan-ValidationLayers.</li>
<li>Adjust how <code class="inline-code">PointSamplingAddressesNeverRoundUp</code> is reported to match recent driver behaviors.</li>
<li>Fix overflow bugs in massive (&gt; 4GiB) sparse resource handling.</li>
<li>Fix reporting of some esoteric format properties to better match native drivers.</li>
<li>Fix handling of NULL acceleration structure descriptors.</li>
<li>Fix some texturing bugs in Helldivers II on NVIDIA.</li>
<li>Fix some bugs with memory type handling on very old NVIDIA GPUs.</li>
<li>Fix bug when pixel shader includes root signature.</li>
<li>Make ClearUAV barrier insertion the default now.<br/>
	Too many games screw this up, and D3D12 drivers seem to do it by default.</li>
<li>Fix shared fences when initial value is not 0. Fixes some Star Citizen issues.</li>
<li>Fix rare deadlock scenario in Ninja Gaiden 4.<br/>
	Fixes some long-standing issues with how we deal with fence rewinds.</li>
<li>Fix some long-standing issues with how we deal with placed MSAA resources and alignment.</li>
<li>Make sure we don't clear memory of imported resources.<br/>
	This doesn't fix any known games, but you never know :V</li>
<li>Improve correctness for many odd GS/HS/DS corner cases with primitive types and API validation.</li>
<li>Fixes crashes when index buffer SizeInBytes = 0, but VA was invalid.<br/>
	Seen in some Saber Interactive games.</li>
<li>Fixes some potential deadlocks in VR interop APIs when multiple threads attempt to acquire Vulkan queue.</li>
<li>Fixes 16-bit aligned structured buffer strides. Not observed in any real content, but you never know!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Workarounds</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add FF VII rebirth sync bugs workarounds. Fixes some rare GPU hangs.</li>
<li>Add misc AMD workarounds for Monster Hunter Wilds caused by bugged hardware around sparse SMEM.
	<ul>
<li>A proper hardware workaround in RADV is still pending.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Workaround some Starfield bugs around <code class="inline-code">NonUniformResourceIndex</code> use.</li>
<li>Add performance workarounds for extremely large tessellation factors used in misc new Koei Tecmo games.</li>
<li>Add Wreckfest 2 workarounds for illegal texture placement aliasing. Fixes some broken textures.</li>
<li>Add barrier in Satisfactory that game missed. Fixes some corrupt rendering especially on AMD.</li>
<li>Ignore NOT_CLEARED flags on allocation in all games now. Native drivers seem to always clear regardless of the flag,<br/>
	and e.g. Street Fighter 6 relies on NOT_CLEARED memory to actually be cleared :(</li>
<li>Workaround some issues with RGB9E5 and alpha write masks observed in Ninja Gaiden 4.</li>
<li>Add missing barrier in Death Stranding (the older build, not Director's Cut).</li>
<li>Add missing barrier in Wuthering Waves.</li>
<li>Workaround bugged uninitialized loop variable in Dune MMO.</li>
<li>Disable UAV compression in Spider-Man Remastered. Fixes some weird RT issues on RDNA2.</li>
<li>Add Root CBV robustness workaround for Gray Zone Warfare.</li>
<li>Disables color compression in Rise of the Tomb Raider. Fixes some glitches due to game bug on AMD.</li>
<li>Workaround some bugs in Port Royal benchmark.</li>
<li>Workaround Mafia: Definitive Edition hanging GPU when using FSR on startup due to use-after-free.
	<ul>
<li>The workaround applies to all uses of FSR. Plausibly workaround a hang in MGS: Delta as well, but not confirmed it was this bug.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Workaround Control RT path occasionally observing NaNs due to bad normalize() patterns.</li>
<li>Workaround Final Fantasy Tactics Ivalice Chronicles illegally using dynamically indexed root constants.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Misc</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added a lot more debug instrumentation as usual.
	<ul>
<li>Not user facing, so omitting details.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make it a bit easier to use vkd3d-proton in Linux-native projects.</li>
<li>Remove <code class="inline-code">DXVK_FRAME_RATE</code> to align with DXVK's removal. Only <code class="inline-code">VKD3D_FRAME_RATE</code> remains (at least for now).</li>
</ul>

      <title>Forestrike is a martial arts roguelite like no other where you see the future</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Using the power of Foresight, in the 2D martial arts roguelite Forestrike you can see how each fight will go down, and it's really damn good. <em>Note: a key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>A beat 'em up fighting game like no other that's for sure, and one of this year's absolute gems. There's no sense in button-bashing here, and that's firmly not the point of it. While you can just jump directly into every single battle, the game is built around your Foresight technique. This is where you enter a special state, where you can test out all your moves, and see what each enemy is going to do. You can do this as many times as you like in each fight. You're supposed to use the ability to explore every possible way to defeat the enemies, and find the perfect solution to each battle.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12849105041763396459gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Nice narrative to go along with it too. Set in a country that was once firmly ruled by a great Emperor, but now an evil Admiral has spread their influence far and wide to pretty much take over. Reaching even as far as your one of your old masters that betrays you. It's up to you, Yu, to try and rescue the Emperor from the Admiral's influence — one fight at a time.</p>
<p>The fighting system is the clear star of the show here, but the narrative elements do wonderfully break things up so that everything doesn't feel so samey which I find a lot of beat 'em ups end up like. Good to have a bit of a break to let your mind rest between a lot of crazy fights.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that just because you <em>know</em> what's going to happen with Foresight, it <em>doesn't</em> make the game easy though. It's still a thorough challenge to not only pick the right moves to deal with each individual enemy with their different behaviours coming at you, but getting all your own timings right can still lead to a few bloody noses on your end.</p>
<p>I've played tons of fighting games, beat 'em ups and all sorts in between and can't remember a time where they've truly tried to punch through the genre to make something as different as this is. Forestrike is just so incredibly inventive. Fighting games rely on you having a specific amount of health, giving you a limited amount of attempts - but here it just feels so <em>different</em>. You <em>still</em> have your health limit and you <em>need</em> to watch it closely, but the experimentation you can do endlessly on every single fight is quite amazing.</p>
<p><em>That said, I suppose Shogun Showdown is probably one of the closest to it in terms of some of the ideas. However, that's turn-based, this is real-time and they're still very different overall.</em></p>
<p>You could do 10 different attempts in Foresight, and still manage to screw it up when you decide it's time for the real thing. Some of the fights even early on can be pretty brutal, and that challenge might actually put a few players off. It's definitely one for people who appreciate the technical side of the challenge. That experimentation is key though, I've seen so many fights in it go completely differently by changing up one specific thing with either what ability I use, or timing something differently and the results can be hilariously unexpected sometimes.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZCbJLFTjgbo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cf49edfe6292afc4b95157c2ec949f58.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZCbJLFTjgbo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Another fun addition is the fight re-cap you get, so you can study how the fight went down after beating it. And here, you can grab a special code to share with others, so they can then try the exact same fight you had. Very cool! Absolutely love features like that.</p>
<p>Add to that the rogue-lite side of it, with you picking from random upgrades for your fighter as you go through - each run can be quite different. There's some interesting abilities there like healing up if you manage to get an enemy to hit another enemy that defeats them, poking them in the eyes to stun them and turn them around once per fight and more. You also pick what fights you engage in using a node-based map system of progressing through the game, with each fight having their own different set of enemies and rewards for you.</p>
<p>It did bug me that some of the nodes on the map had you fight <em>without</em> the Foresight ability, which really is the key highlight of the entire game. While yes, it can give you a nice reward, the map is not exactly big and you don't get many movement choices. If they added just one more lane to the node map, this probably would have been a lot better. Just, a few more options for the progression and it would have been perfection there.</p>
<p>The map you progress through also has shops to visit where you can give up certain techniques you've picked, to form a better one. And you can also buy health along with various trinkets to help your run. So there's additional ways here that your run can be different each time too.</p>
<p>The way you build up your fighter through it feels like it leans a little more into deck-builders, or day I say it, survivor-likes. Eventually once you progress through it, you also get to do a run with a few different masters backing you. Each of them come with their own special moves for you.</p>
<p>With all parts together, it's quite brilliant. Loved it. A really fresh feeling spin on beat 'em styled fighting games, with great presentation and it really will give your brain a right-hook to the pleasure centre. Probably one of my favourite releases of 2025.</p>
<p>Worked without issues on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 25.04) with Proton 10. Valve also rated it Steam Deck Playable, as it may have some small text.</p>

      <title>Below the Crown is an curious brew of chess and dungeon crawling out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Out now in Early Access, from the minds that gave us the excellent Duskers, Below the Crown is a mixture of chess-like pieces and moves in a dungeon crawler. <em>Note: a key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>It's a "dungeon crawler for everyone" they say, that is only somewhat <em>loosely</em> related to chess and you don't need to be some sort of grand master to play through this one. You start off by picking a deck that gives you a few chess-like pieces in the form of cards, and move through different randomly generated dungeons using your wizard who can summon your pieces. Your wizard can be a king, bishop, knight and others - with each giving you a different set of cards to summon and some have special abilities.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/664598831763389957gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Starting off in each room with only your main piece, the rooms are all small self-contained puzzles to smash through. Make a move, summon a piece if you have any left to bring into play and keep moving around the board. The idea is to beat each room by either: getting a checkmate, getting the AI enemy king to withdraw by being the last piece left, or getting your king to a door. It's not just standard chess pieces though, as they've introduced some new pieces to keep things fresh and you get an assortment of spells to throw the game in your favour too. It's not just plain square board layouts either, there's a few different shapes that present their own unique challenges to think on as well.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it is true that you don't need to really understand chess to play this at all. Everything is <em>very</em> clearly presented. And with the amount of pieces each side controls, there's no information overload here. Just a few pieces at a time, with each having a clear set movement pattern you can see by hovering your mouse over them anytime. There's even a turn assist feature, for the game to suggest moves if there's something good for you to do, so it's quite accessible too.</p>
<p>It's all a bit <em>strange</em>. From the retro visuals to the strange psychological questions you have to answer that "may or may not impact runs". Just what exactly is going on here? They've somehow given a chess-like a bit of an unnerving atmosphere.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="acKftQNAsfI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1bee3c2d4c3321bdf66589b171ff1db5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/acKftQNAsfI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While it's turn-based, it's certainly <em>not</em> chilled. Part of the difficulty here is that if you take too too many turns, the board will start self-destructing with tiles getting a turn timer so you need to ensure your pieces aren't there. Reducing the size of the board forces both sides closer together, and really does make your brain sweat a bit.</p>
<p>The presentation is supremely slick too. I <em>love</em> the way the game moves between boards, and the overall feel of it is perfect for the type of game it is.</p>
<p>“Below the Crown wouldn’t be what it is today without the incredible minds on the Misfits Attic team," said Tim Keenan, Founder, Misfits Attic. “Our diverse experiences on films and games have enabled us to give Below the Crown its own distinct, mysterious identity. We hope chess enthusiasts and beginners alike enjoy digging into this dynamic world of strategy, magic, and retro vibes in Early Access!"</p>
<p>A full formal opinion will be saved for when it's released properly, which the developer estimates will be in about 5 months while they add a bit more of everything into the game. So far though, it is a <em>lot</em> of fun to play through as a weird blend of game genres and mechanics that ends up as a bit of a brain-tickling puzzle to get through.</p>
<p>There are a couple of resolution related bugs I've encountered. If the game resolution does not match your desktop, some UI will go off the screen, and if you alt+tab the mouse position is messed up making it basically unplayable. It was supposed to have been solved before, but it's still a problem. You'll need to ensure you match the game resolution up to your desktop for now. This is likely a problem with it specifically with Proton and they <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/below-the-crown-from-the-developer-of-duskers-arrives-november-with-a-demo-live-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">did say previously</a> a Native Linux version is planned.</p>
<p>Misfits Attic have once again crafted something unique, that I really need more hours in the day to play. Deliciously engrossing to try and beat everything in it. It's proven once again that I'm terrible at anything resembling chess, but the challenge of it is so clever it makes me want to dive in again and again. This definitely deserves a whole lot more players.</p>

      <title>Colossal Order and Paradox Interactive split with Cities: Skylines going to a new developer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Colossal Order and Paradox Interactive have ended their partnership on Cities: Skylines, with it moving onto a new developer.</p>
<p>The announcement posted on the <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/an-update-on-cities-skylines-ii.1873154/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Paradox forum</a> notes they've "mutually decided to pursue independent paths "with the decision being made "thoughtfully and in the interest of both teams - ensuring the strongest possible future for the Cities: Skylines franchise". So now further development of the Cities franchise will move to Iceflake Studios, who Paradox acquired back in 2020. Iceflake will be taking over all existing and future development of Cities: Skylines II so that players "will be able to look forward to new updates and content drops for many years".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7836167891763385039gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Iceflake Studios will take the helm from the start of 2026, with a couple bits left to add in from Colossal Order.</p>
<p>Statements from the post:</p>
<p>“For over fifteen years, the Cities Series and our partnership with Paradox have been a defining part of our journey at Colossal Order. When we set out to create Cities in Motion, we never imagined it would grow to become a cherished franchise with a passionate, loyal community of millions of players around the world. We want to thank everyone at Paradox for their trust and collaboration, and of course the community for the incredible support that has made Cities what it is today. We’re confident that the franchise will continue to thrive under Paradox's leadership. As we move forward, we’re excited to channel our experience, creativity, and passion into new projects that align with our long-term vision.” Mariina Hallikainen, CEO of Colossal Order</p>
<p>“Our partnership with Colossal Order is one of the longest-running relationships we've enjoyed here at Paradox. Four games, dozens of expansions, and a community of millions of Cities players; it's remarkable how much we've achieved together. We have deep respect for the Colossal Order team and we look forward to seeing where they go from here. On our end, we’re eager to continue working for the passionate Cities: Skylines community and make sure to provide them with more content and new experiences.” Mattias Lilja, Deputy CEO of Paradox Interactive</p>
<p>“Taking the reins on a genre-leading franchise like Cities is an immense honor and a great responsibility. There's a huge, loyal community out there and I want to say to every member of that community that we will humbly carry this legacy with respect, together with all of you. Iceflake has the capacity and capability to get started. We have a decade worth of experience from making city building and management games. We see a strong foundation and so much potential waiting to be unleashed and I can't wait to show you what we have planned for the next chapter of this incredible game.” Lasse Liljedahl, Studio Manager of Iceflake Studios</p>

      <title>The Many Sins of House Ocampo is one to watch for point and click mystery adventure fans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Many Sins of House Ocampo is a new announcement from the developers of If On A Winter's Night Four Travelers and it looks great. Could be a really good one for fans of point and click mystery adventure games.</p>
<p>In The Many Sins of House Ocampo you play as Lucía, a young woman in 1977 Buenos Aires who discovers she's the last living descendant of the Ocampos, an Argentinian settler family rumoured to be beset by a terrible curse. Reliving the last moments of her ancestors via letters, tapes, documents and diaries, and using an interactive clue board to trace the fate of each family member, Lucía will not stop until figuring out the truth of the Ocampo curse, as well as her own origins.</p>
<p>Very much like Dead Idle's previous game If On A Winter's Night Four Travelers, The Many Sins of House Ocampo features stunning pixel art and animations, dark and mature themes, and an exquisite soundtrack that oscillates between Argentinian folk, dark ambient, and classical piano. What's not to love about all of that? Sounds and looks wild.</p>

      <title>Timing is everything in the fast-paced arcade racer Wild Horse Racing - try the demo now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you love arcade-styled retro racing games, Wild Horse Racing looks like it could be good fun and there's a demo available with Linux support.</p>
<p>Don't let the name put you off at all, this is not some cutesy horse game. Here it's quite a challenge where timing is everything. You have to master control patterns from easy to godlike difficulty, leap over big jumps, and race through vibrant tracks while managing your horse. Some fun game mechanics included with each track having its own control pattern, and nailing the timing gives you a speed boost. </p>
<p>The horse hoof upgrade system sounds interesting to spice things up a little too, like picking and upgrading your tyres in a car racing game. As here mud and gravel build up during races to slow you to, so you have to manage that. </p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>

      <title>Cozy 3D food puzzler UMAMI has launched on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need a new chill puzzle game? UMAMI from indie studio Mimmox has arrived with Linux support. Across 15 hand-painted levels, you’ll tinker, toy, and rotate wooden blocks, attaching them to a board to create meals including towers of fluffy pancakes, gravity-defying burgers, freshly prepared onigiri, and even seasonal sweets for holidays such as Halloween and Christmas. </p>

      <title>If you love Portal and first-person puzzlers - ChromaGun 2: Dye Hard launches February 12, 2026</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ChromaGun 2: Dye Hard is a very interesting looking first-person puzzler that's now set to arrive February 12, 2026 that's all about mixing colours. It's a pretty clever system, and I did enjoy the first game but it had a number of rough edges.</p>
<p>More about it: you have to navigate various puzzle rooms and corridors using your ChromaGun, allowing you to shoot and mix primary colours together. When doing so you manipulate the environment around you, activate doors, take down drones and much more. They said with this sequel you'll see smarter puzzles, advanced colour physics, new hazardous environmental elements, and a "gripping new narrative".</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uzvSdydE6G8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4ace9c1c379dfef2391d8cc0cd3045a8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uzvSdydE6G8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release: </p>
<p>“We’ve taken everything the fans loved about the original - the witty dialogue, the fiendishly clever puzzles, and the saturated aesthetic - and dialed it up to 11,” said Benjamin Lochmann, Founder and CEO of Pixel Maniacs. “Dye Hard is bigger, bolder, and requires a level of color coordination and spatial reasoning that will test even the most seasoned puzzle enthusiasts. The team is eager to watch the most insane full game speedruns from the community!”</p>
<p>“ChromaGun 2: Dye Hard expands the creative spectrum of our portfolio with a bold, brainy experience that stands apart from anything else we’ve launched.” states Michael Yum, CEO of PM Studios. “We’re proud to offer a retail edition for a game this inventive - it’s something every fan of clever design should want to have as part of their physical collection.”</p>

      <title>Assetto Corsa Rally has arrived in Early Access - should work well on Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We're finally getting another proper modern rally racing sim with Assetto Corsa Rally out now in Early Access. Thankfully, it won't be in Early Access forever, as they think it will only take around 18 months to finish it all up.</p>
<p>And, surprisingly, even though it's using Unreal Engine 5 most of the early reports on it have been quite positive. It even has a Very Positive rating on Steam. Over email the developers noted how "Supernova Games Studios has extensively customized and optimized Unreal Engine 5 to meet the specific performance and visual fidelity needs of racing simulation".</p>
<p>Something that I think is especially interesting though is the LaserScan tech, which they say is a first for the rally sim genre. Allowing "ultra-precise reproduction of real-world terrain, surface irregularities, and surrounding environments". Not only that but each vehicle was also recreated with laser scans and official CAD data too.</p>
<p>For Linux / SteamOS fans, going by <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/3917090?device=any" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> the early reports there are nice and positive too with multiple reports on it working great out of the box with Proton.</p>

      <title>Deep Rock Galactic set for new biomes, missions and enemies in Season 6</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After bringing in another team to help, Deep Rock Galactic is getting Season 6 sometime early next year with a bumper addition of new content. They also recently delayed the spin-off Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core until Q2 2026, as it needs a bit more time in the oven.</p>
<p>Not played it before? Another you <em>need</em> to stick on your list. A 1-4 player online co-op game about space dwarves that go mining. The world is destructible, it's chaotic and a lot of good fun with all the different types of aliens that come crawling.</p>
<p>So far for it they've confirmed we're getting the Ossuary Depths biome that will come with new creatures to face. Down there you will find Ossiran Scrab, which will appear in large clusters. Plus the Ossiran Pit Jaw, which is a more deadlier version of the Scrab that will attempt to ambush you from below.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9203950041763137842gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9203950041763137842gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13025126461763137845gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13025126461763137845gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>A new mission type too with Heavy Excavation that sees you go hunting for amber. Sounds like another multi-stage event mission with you finding them first, then preparing a dig site to wait for a new supply pod fitted with thrusters to send it back up.</p>
<p>There's even going to be a new season event, a new performance pass (like a battle pass full of cosmetics).</p>

      <title>Brill co-op climbing game PEAK gets a major fix for gamepads</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PEAK remains a favourite this year, easily one of the best casual co-op games and the latest bug-fix update is important for gamepad players. Turns out, they've been a bit broken all along on the sensitivity so it's nice to see that solved with the latest update.</p>
<p>In the patch notes they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Okay, so this is pretty embarrassing. Turns out, gamepad sensitivity has been dependent on user framerate since we originally launched the game. (Remember how this was a game jam...?) That's fixed now, but because of that, If you play on gamepad, there's a good chance your look sensitivity will have changed when you next open the game and you'll need to tweak it a bit.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2534379191763135583gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>There's a bunch of other changes as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>BALANCE/GAMEPLAY CHANGES</h3>
<ul>
<li>The death timer now still ticks down even when carried by another scout if you have enough spores to become a zombie. Good luck...</li>
<li>We're buffing the Scout Cannon!
	<ul>
<li>Scout Cannons can launch zombies now.</li>
<li>Scout Cannon weight reduced 6 -&gt; 4</li>
<li>Scout Cannon forced ragdoll time reduced 2-&gt; 1</li>
<li>Made the Scout Cannon slightly easier to jump out of.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You will now be able to walk in the Caldera lava if you are invincible.</li>
<li>Removed the ability to fly if you have the wind walking ability from a Shroomberry and one balloon. You now need at least three balloons.</li>
<li>Lava will no longer cook items that are being held in your hands. (This was getting a little too crazy now that several more items blow up when cooked)</li>
</ul>
<h3>MAJOR FIXES</h3>
<ul>
<li>Okay, so this is pretty embarrassing. Turns out, gamepad sensitivity has been dependent on user framerate since we originally launched the game. (Remember how this was a game jam...?) That's fixed now, but because of that, If you play on gamepad, there's a good chance your look sensitivity will have changed when you next open the game and you'll need to tweak it a bit.</li>
<li>Removed the prompts to swap your spectate target if your character is unconscious but not fully dead.</li>
<li>Fixed visual issues relating to using the Book of Bones with the Third Eye accessory equipped.</li>
<li>Fixed visual issues on the player ghost when the Third Eye accessory is equipped.</li>
<li>The Checkpoint Flag now respawns scouts slightly above the ground to reduce clipping/physics issues upon respawning.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where zombie footsteps would play from the wrong position.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue caused by the cooking update where dynamite would create two explosions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>MINOR FIXES</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where scouts in a ragdoll state would bounce off mushrooms way too high.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the campfires would no longer burn players.</li>
<li>Fixed shroomberries spawning on the wrong side of the vine.</li>
<li>Fixed players not being able to grab a piton while hanging from a vine.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where holding the Ancient Idol while having thorns stuck on you could cause erratic stuff to happen to your status bar.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where a spawn point could spawn a zombie more than once if an old one died, resulting in some comedic infinite spawns if the spawned zombie ragdolled off a cliff.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where a frisbee that landed in the water would still be considered "in flight" for purposes of the Ultimate Badge.</li>
<li>The Emote wheel can no longer be accessed as a ghost.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where you would take increased fall damage if your wind walking from a Shroomberry expired while in midair.</li>
<li>Dynamite explosions slightly more optimized.</li>
<li>Added a failsafe to ropes being destroyed while they were being climbed (in rare situations).</li>
</ul>
<br/>
OTHER THINGS
<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">PlayerHandler.OnCharacterRegistered</code> event re-instated (modders will know what this means)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They've made some nice updates to the game since release, including adding multiple new biomes to fail in. The latest adding a zombie mechanic, which really makes the game feel more challenging in certain situations.</p>
<p>I think the game mechanic of having your health and stamina bar merged into one is quite interesting, seeing all the status effects bring it down - it's a clever system. If you've not played it, you're missing out.</p>

      <title>Heroes of Might and Magic 2 project fheroes2 version 1.1.12 has been released</title>
      <author>fheroes2</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dear fans of the fheroes2 project! Today we are excited to announce a new version of the <strong>fheroes2</strong> game engine - <a href="https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2/releases/tag/1.1.12" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">1.1.12</a>! This release brings a huge number of updates and stands as one of the biggest releases in recent years.</p>
<p>First of all, we have added an initial implementation of the <strong>Random Map Generator</strong> to the Editor. For now, this feature is marked as in development, as many parts are still unfinished and require further work before it becomes a fully realized part of the project. We plan to refine and expand this feature in future releases.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15263400351763130587gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Another major highlight of this release is the introduction of basic iOS support. While this version still requires refinement before reaching a fully stable state, this marks a big step forward. We will continue sharing progress updates as development continues.</p>
<p>The team has also made numerous <strong>UI improvements</strong>. We updated the icons for Mass Dispel spell and Resolution option, added new buttons in the File Options dialog, moved the Turn Order bar above the battlefield on high resolutions, and enabled playback for multiple videos - restoring missing campaign animations. You can now switch between towns in the Mage Guild using arrows, delete maps from lists, and have a much larger text limit for all resurrection maps, many-many more changes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11034115371763130695gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11034115371763130695gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19629090031763130695gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19629090031763130695gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14325058951763130694gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14325058951763130694gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>This update also includes major improvements to the <strong>AI</strong>. AI heroes can now predict the start of a new week for weekly objects such as Monster Dwellings, Windmills, and Magic Gardens, allowing for smarter task management on the Adventure Map. They also make better pre-battle unit arrangements, improving their chances of success. Additionally, we have introduced new conditions for hero hiring to make the late game more engaging.</p>

<p>It will show up in your Steam Downloads as an update for Proton 10 Beta if you had it installed. Otherwise, it will automatically download if you go to play a game that Valve has set for Proton 10 by default. Or, you can manually search for Proton 10 in your Steam Library to install it and try it on some games.</p>
