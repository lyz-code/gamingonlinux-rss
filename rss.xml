      <title>REMATCH finally adds cross-play in the latest update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>REMATCH continues to be my favourite sporty game because it doesn't feel like a sport, more like a strategy game and now it finally has cross-play.</p>
<p>After repeated delays due to issues players kept reporting during tests, even after the original delays where the features was skipped for the original release - it's here, right now! This means you can team up with and play with other across all supported platforms now. However, they will not be adding cross-progression at this time.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11711363331757086042gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11711363331757086042gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Reporting nuisance players is also now a lot easier, with a built-in reporting system. You no longer have to capture their details and message them outside the game. Something that, let's face it, should have really been in the game from the beginning. <em>It's a competitive game, it's a basic feature.</em></p>
<p>Lots of bug fixes also made it into the patch, along with some tweaks to various gameplay mechanics, new accessibility options, optimizations to improve performance, improvements to keyboard / mouse controls and much more. You can find everything in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2138720/view/534359891812287191" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes</a> they originally posted at the end of August.</p>
<p>Hopefully with cross-play they will be able to pull some more players back in, as it dropped off quite a lot but still sees a peak of over 9,000 concurrent players on Steam most days.</p>
<p>REMATCH works great on Linux with Proton and is surprisingly good on Steam Deck too. Even with the Easy Anti-Cheat with is enabled for Linux.

      <title>Mewgenics from the dev of The Binding of Isaac gets a long gameplay video and will be Steam Deck supported at release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mewgenics looks to be very interesting from the creators of The Binding of Isaac, Super Meat Boy and The End is Nigh. Just recently, they put up a 50 minute gameplay video giving us the best look yet at the upcoming game. And, it also has a release date now so it will be out February 10th, 2026.</p>
<p>What is it? An endless cat breeding RPG. You level up a team and venture far from home collecting unique items, defeating bosses, gaining mutations and then return home to breed and further your bloodline. Sounds pretty wild.</p>
<p>There's a ridiculous amount of info to take in from the gameplay reveal, and it's only part one with more to come. This first video focuses on the start of the game but there's a lot more to it. And, going by comments on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1n6u1vw/comment/nc39ygn/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Reddit</a> from developer Edmund McMillen, they plan to have it fully Steam Deck supported at release with testers already playing it on Deck.</p>
<p>Check out the full video below:</p>

<p>Features (from Steam):</p>

      <title>Take down technofascist cyberpunk CEOs with roguelike match-3 tactical combat in Torment Hexus</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I love how indie developers keep coming up with the coolest sounding ideas. Torment Hexus is a recent discover and I can't wait to take down technofascist CEOs.</p>
<p>From the developer: "Torment Hexus is a match-3 tactical combat roguelike. In the cyberpunk future, power rests in the hands of the corporate CEOs. They'll take any action that they think will increase their wealth, no matter the cost. Iggy is an ex-military warmage, cast loose after combat injuries left them relying on shoddy prosthetic eyes to see. Driven by pain and poverty, rage and frustration, they've decided to wage a one-person war against the corporate behemoths. But will their violence and subterfuge be enough to see them to the top of the tower?"</p>
<p>TMA Games's founder, Chris Weisiger, is no stranger to mashing genres together. Their previous game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1482750/Waves_of_Steel/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Waves of Steel</a> had you do kickflips with warships which is a really odd sounding but neat idea.</p>
<p>Check out the announcement trailer for Torment Hexus below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5ss05Yz-baA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/94d2094ec19c398bb2f85b2e9ee18192.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5ss05Yz-baA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Match elemental tokens using your ex-military wristcomp, to charge up your spells.</li>
<li>Cast devastating battle magic to wreak havoc on the robots, humans, and bizarre bio-cybernetic creations guarding the CEO's tower.</li>
<li>Loot powerful relics from your enemies' remains, gaining power from remnants of the past world. Draw the latent energies from a scrap of fern, inject raw fire mana into your veins, hasten your spells' tempo with a bloody stopwatch.</li>
<li>Navigate nuanced scenarios as you encounter the corporation's less-violent denizens. Sabotage evil experiments, convince the laborers to unionize, con the guards in a card game, and trade for equipment in an illicit black market.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Dune: Awakening gets a free weekend for September 11, a first ever discount and early DLC release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dune: Awakening from Funcom is getting a free weekend soon and it's getting a first ever discount, so a good time to see what all the fuss is about. You can see my original <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/dune-awakening-is-out-now-and-works-well-on-linux-desktop-but-rough-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">thoughts at release in the previous GamingOnLinux article</a>.</p>
<p>I still think it's one of the best modern MMOs, and I have a lot of hours in this one. Thankfully, even with BattlEye anti-cheat, it works great on Linux platforms like SteamOS. It's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/dune-awakening-is-now-steam-deck-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">also Steam Deck Verified</a>, but I wouldn't exactly recommend it on Steam Deck.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17973510071757072312gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The free weekend will run through September 11th - 15th and at the same time there will be a 20% discount until September 22nd. For the free weekend they've announced zero restrictions, so you'll be able to go as far as you like until the time runs out or you buy it. And since it's an MMO, if you buy it later, you just carry on wherever you left it.</p>
<p>On top of that they've also just announced that the Chapter 2 update and Lost Harvest DLC will now arrive September 9th, a day earlier than expected.</p>

      <title>Checkmage! is a casual, free-form chess RPG with sandbox deck-building elements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A unique blend of genres I have for you here on GamingOnLinux today. Checkmage! blurs the lines between an RPG, chess and deck-building. There's a demo available that was just updated and it will have Native Linux support at release too.</p>
<p>The developer explains it as such: "The game is a casual, free-form chess RPG with sandbox deck-building elements. Whatever that's supposed to mean! You battle fellow students by placing pieces and casting spells on a magical floating chess board, and by moving one piece on the board per turn. The goal is to checkmate or capture the enemy king in a variety of peculiar situations.</p>
<p>It takes place in a universe where wizardry and spell-casting is so blasé, even the most scholarly of wizard students turn to distractions—such as Checkmage!—to entertain themselves."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CjFCnG6vkEk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/69d9ee53dee4574a9e0184fe19b97005.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CjFCnG6vkEk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>20+ thoughtfully-designed characters with unique personalities, battle strategies, expressive dialogue and backgrounds. You can rematch them and see their strategies and loadouts improve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>100+ unique pieces, tiles, and spells to collect and experiment with. Mixing and matching different cards in your deck provides endlessly creative ways to play with surprisingly deep and emergent interactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>6 detailed, hand-crafted locations to explore. Characters you'll meet in one location show up in other places and change their dialog as you progress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A black wind blows through your body... Enter a creepy dungeon for an optional gauntlet mode where you fight randomly generated opponents.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The game should release sometime in 2026, whenever it's ready.</p>

      <title>With over 150,000 wishlists Easy Delivery Co. is now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The mysterious upcoming retro-styled delivery sim Easy Delivery Co. is now Steam Deck Verified, and it's clearly popular with over 150,000 Steam wishlists. Previously covered <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/easy-delivery-co-is-a-strange-and-spooky-delivery-driving-sim-with-a-demo-worth-checking-out/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here on GamingOnLinux back in May</a>, I love the old PlayStation style to it and the vibes it gives off is quite interesting.</p>
<p>There's still a demo available and it's due to launch at some point in "Q3" which is up until the end of September - hopefully we'll get a clearer idea of when soon. Just today ahead of the upcoming release, Valve gave it the Steam Deck Verified green tick of approval using the latest Proton 10 Beta.</p>
<p>Check out the original reveal trailer below:</p>

      <title>Cronos: The New Dawn releases today - Steam Deck Verified with Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is the latest survival horror game from Bloober Team developers of the SILENT HILL 2 remake. It's now Steam Deck Verified too!</p>
<p>Not just that, but the developer even added Native Linux support to it which was a surprise to see, although Valve's verification for Steam Deck has set it to use the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/proton-10-0-2d-beta-released-with-a-few-small-fixes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 10 Beta</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5025661431757063668gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is a brutal third-person survival horror where you fight for the future by salvaging the past. Burn monsters before they merge. Extract souls from the living. Adapt or die.</p>
<p>Set in a grim world where Eastern European brutalism meets retro-futurist technology, Cronos: The New Dawn lets you experience a gripping story that straddles the line between past and future.</p>
<p>In the past, you will witness a world in the throes of The Change, a cataclysmic event that forever altered humanity. Meanwhile, in the ravaged wastelands of the future, every moment is a fight for survival against dangerous abominations that will test both your reflexes and your tactical thinking.</p>
<p>You are a Traveler working for the enigmatic Collective, tasked with scouring the wastelands of the future in search of time rifts that will transport you to 1980s-era Poland.</p>

      <title>The Lenovo Legion Go 2 launches in October - it&#39;s heavier and very pricey</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve, please save us from these prices with a Steam Deck 2. The Lenovo Legion Go 2 arrives officially in October but it's a bit shocking.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Why? Not only does it have a huge price attached but it's a whole lot heavier too, and the original wasn't exactly light either. Here's the pricing that they should launch at:</p>
<ul>
<li>AMD Z2 / 16GB RAM / 1TB SSD - $1,099.99</li>
<li>AMD Z2 / 32GB RAM / 1TB SSD - $1,199.99</li>
<li>AMD Z2 Extreme / 32GB RAM / 1TB SSD - $1,349.99</li>
<li>AMD Z2 Extreme / 32GB RAM / 2TB SSD - $1,479.99</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just hitting levels of silliness now, handhelds are moving in totally the wrong direction when it comes to the cost. And the weight too it's gone from 1.88 pounds to 2.02 pounds. Part of the point wasn't just that they're portable, but accessible and this is just pricing a lot of people out of it completely. The Z2 chips aren't even a whole lot faster than the previous gen, so you're not actually getting that much extra performance.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1005257111757061421gol1.jpg"/><br/>

<p>And despite some rumours being spread by other sites due to a render (not a real photo) that was shared that looked like SteamOS, it will <em>not</em> have a SteamOS version. It will be shipping with Windows 11 as expected. So for Linux <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/bazzite-adds-support-for-ayaneo-3-and-the-aokzoe-a1x-with-work-towards-msi-claw-a8-and-legion-go-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">you'll need something like Bazzite</a> which has added initial support for it.</p>

</table>
<p>Lenovo at least do have the cheaper Legion Go S for those who want it (with a SteamOS version too), and there's also the Steam Deck (which continues being a top seller constantly) - so this is very much a top-end enthusiast device which will no doubt limit the market for it.</p>
<p>I'm sort of expecting that when Valve eventually reveal the Steam Deck 2, they can do a nice big reset on the market with a price that isn't out of reach for the masses and force others to be a bit more competitive again.</p>

      <title>GeForce NOW&#39;s Blackwell RTX upgrade arrives September 10 and more games arrive soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

      <title>Hollow Knight: Silksong is out now with Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a long time for fans waiting on it, Hollow Knight: Silksong is now officially out and it arrives with Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified. They sure kept us waiting huh?</p>
<p>Check out the latest trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6XGeJwsUP9c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cb608bc050d35de02b488a43c81c81b3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6XGeJwsUP9c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From what I understand, no review codes were sent out at all, as Team Cherry felt it would be unfair to everyone else who previously backed them. That, and they're still quite a small team. So, everyone jumping in will be playing it for the first time. Something to keep in mind if you suddenly see any reviews pop up real quick over the next day or so - there's no way they would have had ample time to check it properly. Same for me. I've no doubt some reviewers will now be doing an immense crunch on it though, same for people writing any guides.</p>
<p>Impressively though, the first boss to beat with Silksong was actually <em>the internet</em>. Pretty much to the second that Silksong released, the Steam store itself went down hard. I don't think I've ever seen an indie game like this manage to get so much traffic that Steam kept giving errors like this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/390868931756994755gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>As I write this, nearly 40 minutes after release, the Steam store is still all over the place. I'm currently playing shopping cart roulette trying to buy it. It even managed to take down consoles stores due to the traffic too. Incredible huh? What an achievement.</p>
<p>Looking at <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1030300/charts/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> (which was also struggling to cope) the player count absolutely skyrocketed up to 100,374, although that was expected of course. Not that you need to know about a single-player game concurrent player count, but I still find it interesting to see on the subject of my own excitement for the developer.</p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Discover the fallen insect kingdom of Pharloom! Explore mossy grottos, gilded cities and misted moors as you ascend to the shining citadel at the top of the world.</li>
<li>Engage in lethal acrobatic action! Wield a huge suite of deadly moves as you dance between foes in swift, beautiful combat.</li>
<li>Craft powerful tools! Master an ever-expanding arsenal of weapons, traps, and mechanisms to vanquish your enemies and explore new heights.</li>
<li>Solve shocking quests! Hunt down rare beasts and solve ancient mysteries to grant the wishes of the downtrodden and restore the kingdom’s hope.</li>
<li>Face over 200 ferocious foes! Beasts and hunters, monsters and knights. Defeat them all with bravery and skill!</li>
<li>Vanquish over 40 legendary bosses! Battle fabled heroes and fallen kings in epic combat to decide the kingdom's fate.</li>
<li>Challenge Steel Soul mode! Once you conquer the kingdom, test your skills in a new mode that presents a more formidable challenge.</li>
<li>Experience a stunning orchestral score! Hollow Knight’s award-winning composer, Christopher Larkin, brings melancholy melodies, symphonic strings and heart-thumping, soul strumming boss themes to the adventure.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Will you be jumping in? Be sure to leave a comment and let us know, and what you think of it when you've had chance to play some of it. Always keen to hear from readers.</p>

      <title>Game Settings is a mystery adventure about a journalist being sent a strange console</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A mystery adventure where you're a journalist who has received a strange package, which turns out to be a console and a game. Game Settings sounds quite unique.</p>
<p>This console and game together give you "No combat, no score, no objectives, only movement, and a menu full of cryptic settings you’re meant to adjust." - so the game is all about adjusting the settings of the game. But, what exactly are you configuring here? The developer said that the "more the mystery unfolds the more you wonder who’s really in control". Have to admit, it has me very curious this one.</p>
<p>At release it will have full Native Linux support, just like the previous games from Lozange Lab. Check out the reveal trailer for Game Settings below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bgm5-pCAeSw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b713ea684898c9e7185b6a9946699d6f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bgm5-pCAeSw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>No release date has been announcement for it yet other than sometime in 2026, with a demo available in Q4 2025.</p>
<p>More details from the developer:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3><strong>A mysterious package</strong></h3>
<p>You are Alex, a journalist for a tech website, stuck in a monotonous endless routine. Until one day everything changes: a mysterious package appears at your door. Inside: a custom console and a game cartridge. No label. No instructions. Just a gaming experience that feels unfinished... or deliberately incomplete.</p>
<h3><strong>Cryptic settings</strong></h3>
<p>There’s no combat. No score. No objectives. Only exploration, enigmatic conversations, and a menu full of cryptic settings you’re meant to adjust.</p>
<p>Each area you explore reacts to the changes you make in the console settings. But what do these parameters really control? And who designed this game in the first place?</p>
<h3><strong>A strangely abandoned experiment</strong></h3>
<p>What begins as curiosity slowly unravels into something a lot deeper. An abandoned system, a forgotten experiment, and surely a message left behind… or perhaps still to be written.</p>
<p>Uncover the history of the console and its mysterious creators. What was this system meant to do… and why was it abandoned?</p>

      <title>3rd person action mech-builder &#39;Granvir&#39; gets a release date and you can win a Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Granvir is a great looking 3rd person action roguelite mech-builder with co-op multiplayer, with a release date announced and a Steam Deck competition.</p>
<p>The developer has now set September 23rd for it to be released, and you can also try out the mini demo version in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/granvir-zero-front-is-a-fresh-3rd-person-customizable-mech-combat-prologue-out-on-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Granvir: Zero Front</a>. The game will have Native Linux support at release too, so for fans of direct Linux support it's one for you to stick onto your wishlist.</p>
<p>More about it: "Granvir is an action roguelite featuring mech building. Players battle through a route of their choice reaching extraction and completing side objectives at the cost of valuable resources. Between battles, players can swap out parts for upgrades found on the battlefield and manage their campaign by taking on loans to afford ammunition, aiding the locals for support in battle and more."</p>

<p>Along with putting up a release date, the developer is also giving away one 512GB Steam Deck LCD with a full copy of the game to play too. They're using Gleam for the competition, with multiple chances to increase your odds of winning.

      <title>Linux Mint 22.2 &#34;Zara&#34; is officially out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Linux Mint 22.2 "Zara" has been officially released today, bringing with it plenty of enhancements across the board to the popular Linux distro.</p>
<p>Arriving with Linux kernel 6.14, being built on top of Ubuntu 24.04 ("Noble"). As a long-term support release you'll be able to easily use it until 2029, with new Mint versions using the same base packages to make upgrades even easier until then.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13923798061756983066gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13923798061756983066gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Linux Mint 22.2</em></p>
<p>Not much has changed from the Beta <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/linux-mint-22-2-beta-available-for-the-next-long-term-supported-release/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reported previously on GamingOnLinux</a>, apart from ensuring it's as stable as possible. As a reminder of some new bits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sticky notes supported with Wayland.</li>
<li>Revamped login screen styling to look better.</li>
<li>Hypnotix video player has two new viewing modes and performance improvements. It will also prevent your system sleeping while playing videos.</li>
<li>A brand new XApp called Fingwit dedicated to fingerprint authentication.</li>
<li>LibAdwaita was patched to work with themes. Also forked into <a href="https://github.com/xapp-project/libadapta" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">LibAdapta</a> for adding new features.</li>
<li>XDG Desktop Portal XApp now supports accent colours.</li>
<li>Various other improvements to XApps:
	<ul>
<li>In Xviewer, the EDID-based color correction is now configurable and disabled by default. This feature was counter-intuitive and conflicted with the color management handled at hardware and desktop level.</li>
<li>A new thumbnailer was written for cover art in .aiff audio files: xapp-aiff-thumbnailer.</li>
<li>An <a href="https://apps.apple.com/mu/app/warpinator/id1609289992" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">iOS version</a> of Warpinator is available.</li>
<li>In the WebApp Manager, the webapp description field is now editable.</li>
<li>When renaming multiple files and using enumerations, it is now possible to use leading zeros, define the starting number of the enumeration and its increment step.</li>
<li>The last renaming operation is also remembered and pre-selected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A few tweaks to the colouring in the default Linux Mint theme.</li>
<li>The Software Manager welcome screen was improved, and the app explains the different between Flatpak and system packages.</li>
</ul>

      <title>EVERYBODY&#39;S GOLF HOT SHOTS rated Steam Deck Playable with the anti-cheat enabled for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>EVERYBODY'S GOLF HOT SHOTS arrives on Steam today from Bandai Namco Entertainment, and Valve just rated it Steam Deck Playable even with Easy Anti-Cheat.</p>
<p>This means the developer or publisher have actually enabled Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC) to allow Linux platform players in, so you should be good to go on any other SteamOS / Linux system to play it, as EAC doesn't block normal Desktop Linux PCs <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/blue-protocol-star-resonance-to-be-playable-on-steam-deck-but-probably-not-desktop-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">like we see from games using Anti-Cheat Expert (ACE)</a>.</p>
<p>For their Steam Deck rating, Valve note it has some small text and a manual configuration of the graphics are required to get it to perform well. Additionally, it does not default to external controllers, so you need to swap them over in the Quick Access menu. Valve's checks were done using <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/proton-10-0-2d-beta-released-with-a-few-small-fixes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the latest Proton 10 Beta</a>.</p>
<p>We've updated <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat compatibility page</a> to note the new status.</p>
<p>Check out the overview trailer below:</p>

      <title>The new cross-platform Nexus Mods app begins work to support Skyrim Special Edition</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While it's incredibly early, the Nexus Mods app team have confirmed work has begun to support Skyrim, the most requested game for it.</p>
<p>This is the in-development app that will eventually replace Vortex that currently supports Stardew Valley and Cyberpunk 2077 with work ongoing for Baldur's Gate 3 and Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord. Now, they've announced with app version 0.16.3 that work has begun on Skyrim.</p>
<p>Right now it will detect Skyrim Special Edition, but no other features have been added just yet as they build the foundations needed for it. So it will will appear but you can't yet do anything with it. But still, nice that they're announcing it's finally coming to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19347952661756981091gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19347952661756981091gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Other stuff added in this release:</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Select All for Batch Actions</h2>
<p>You can now quickly select every item in the current view with <code>Ctrl + A</code>, alongside the existing <code>Ctrl + Click</code> and <code>Shift + Click</code> options. This makes batch installing, updating, or deleting mods faster and more convenient.</p>
<h2>Toast Notifications</h2>
<p>When you take actions within the app, you will start to see a subtle little "toast" message at the bottom of the screen to confirm what has just happened. Toast will fade out automatically after a few seconds to avoid cluttering the screen.</p>
<h2>More Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added a "Delete" option to the menu in the Library.</li>
<li>Updated the "Apply" button to show a progress indicator rather than simply pulsing.</li>
<li>Added a new dialog to better explain the benefits of downloading a collection with a Premium membership.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technical Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improved detection of WINE games on Linux.</li>
<li>Made some progress towards better support for Linux-native games from GOG.com.</li>
<li>Added support for pausing and resuming jobs (e.g. downloads) on the backend. This isn't available in the UI yet.</li>
<li>Switched to a new query engine on the backend, which will increase app performance and unlock future feature work.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Implemented a fix to avoid further "Missing Archive" errors. Unfortunately, this fix isn't retrospective, but if the affected mods are re-downloaded, it should no longer appear.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where an unintended dialog popped up for free users each time they updated a mod.</li>
<li>Fixed an exception when installing SMAPI if <code class="inline-code">Stardew Valley.deps.json</code> could not be located.</li>
<li>Fixed an "Object Disposed" error on the Loadouts page.</li>
<li>Fixed an exception in the Library caused by the background mod update check.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<p>The following are issues that we are already aware of in this build and will address in a future release:</p>
<h3>Stardew Valley (GOG via Heroic on Linux)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Native version cannot be managed by the app.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cyberpunk 2077</h3>
<ul>
<li>Epic Games version cannot be managed due to metadata issues in v2.3.</li>
</ul>
<h3>General</h3>
<ul>
<li>Once a collection created by the user is removed from the app, it can no longer be edited, even if it was exported to the website.</li>
<li>The game version is not checked when adding a collection, meaning you can install outdated mods without being warned.</li>
<li>The table header sorting and active tab states are not saved and are reset each time the view is loaded.</li>
<li>Some toast messages incorrectly appear more than once.</li>
</ul>

<p>I continue to be very excited for this since it's open source and cross-platform, so eventually we'll finally have a proper true mod launcher for lots of gaming on Linux.</p>
<p>ICYMI: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/nexus-mods-announce-age-verification-for-uk-users/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nexus Mods recently announced age verification</a> will be needed for UK users for adult themed mods. Much like how Valve with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/steam-uk-users-will-now-need-a-credit-card-to-access-mature-content-due-to-the-online-safety-act/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam are also now requiring age verification too</a>.</p>

      <title>Selaco is getting some big upgrades with Chapter 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Selaco is easily one of the most promising retro-infused shooters around, and it's going to get a lot better with the Chapter 2 update.</p>
<p>In a new lengthy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1592280/view/517471393211744689" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">developer post</a> on Steam, their team go over some details of some planned improvements to come across the whole game. While it has an overall Very Positive rating on Steam, they've been carefully listening to feedback and will be addressing some common pain-points in the game.</p>
<p>One of the big issues being navigation, it's surprisingly easy to get a little lost and end up going in circles. So they'll be adding in an icon on the map for your next goal, along with tweaking some green lighting that was a bit confusing on showing where to go.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1661738761756978164gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1661738761756978164gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Another adjustment is being made to Weapon Kits, something you can easily miss as an unlockable. Those you miss during a level will now appear in the Weapon Upgrade Station, which you can buy if needed. Nice. However, there's still some you will absolutely have to hunt around for.</p>
<p>They're also going to be adding in an Incursion Mode closer to the full release, which is a complete separate campaign giving you "Deathmatch-style levels, with heavy inspiration from Rainbow Six’ Terrorist Hunt, Gears of War’s Horde Mode, and Unreal Tournament" - which sounds like a whole lot of fun. I love the combat systems especially in Selaco, so I'm really keen to see this.</p>
<p>Enemy AI is also getting a nice buff. Enemies will be smarter with better pathfinding, understanding safe spaces better to actually take cover and more tweaks to how they detect you.</p>
<p>There's a lot more they plan to improve including performance, hit feedback, audio design, updates coming to improve the lighting in Chapter 1 and so on.</p>

      <title>Konami Collector&#39;s Series: Castlevania &amp; Contra enters the GOG Preservation Program</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>More classics are being kept alive for modern platforms, with GOG putting <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/konami_collectors_series_castlevania_contra" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Konami Collector's Series: Castlevania &amp; Contra</a> into their Preservation Program.</p>
<p>This pack contains five games including Castlevania, Castlevania II: Simon's Quest, Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse, Contra and Super C. All of them now have the GOG promise of it being "the best version of this game you can buy on any PC platform".</p>

<p>Nice to see. The last time I spotted more titles being added to the GOG Preservation Program was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/gog-preservation-program-adds-heroes-of-might-and-magic-titles-and-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back near the end of July</a> with the likes of Heroes of Might and Magic and more games. This time since it's only one game, they didn't do a big announcement but they did post it official to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gog/comments/1n7e7em/konami_collectors_series_castlevania_contra_joins/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Reddit</a> that I saw.</p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/konami_collectors_series_castlevania_contra" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the GOG store</a>.</p>
<p>You should be able to run such classic retro games with Wine / Proton.

      <title>New Valve trademark for &#39;Steam Frame&#39;, looks like we&#39;re getting new hardware</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have a new trademark filed for Steam Frame, with it appearing to be multiple new types of hardware that's on the way.</p>
<p>Split across two different filings. The <a href="https://uspto.report/TM/99370857" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">first</a> being noted as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><small>Mark For:</small> STEAM FRAME™ trademark registration is intended to cover the categories of computer hardware; computer networking hardware; computer peripherals; computer hardware and computer software for the reproduction, processing, and streaming of audio, video, data, text, and multimedia content.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the <a href="https://uspto.report/TM/99370861" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">second</a> for:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><small>Mark For:</small> STEAM FRAME™ trademark registration is intended to cover the categories of computer game consoles for recreational game playing; video game consoles; video game accessories, namely, controllers for video games.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sounds like it will cover a main system and then accessories to come with it like controllers. We've known for a long time that Valve are working on a new VR kit, which is code named Deckard. But, we've also <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/leaks-again-hint-at-valve-doing-a-proper-steam-machine-console/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">seen recent leaks for a new Steam Machine console</a> too.</p>
<p>With the Steam Frame naming, I would expect this to be the new VR kit to succeed to Valve Index. Thinking about glasses, you wear a frame with lenses on your face - so the name is a little clever if so, at least in my opinion, I think it's a cool name if it is indeed the new VR kit from Valve.</p>
<p>It's worth noting though, that filing a trademark doesn't necessarily mean that's the exact name that will be used. Valve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/valve-filed-a-computer-game-software-trademark-for-neon-prime/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously filed a trademark for Neon Prime</a>, which they ended up not using and going with Deadlock instead.</p>
<p>Going by what @SadlyItsBradley <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1963491451049771216" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">said</a> on X, it very much appears to be VR related, with Valve renaming VR Overlays to be called Frames - so it's all starting to line up.</p>
<p>Would you buy a new VR kit from Valve? I'm looking forward to it, especially if it has a standalone mode and is a bit more compact than the ageing Valve Index.</p>

      <title>Blue Protocol: Star Resonance to be playable on Steam Deck but probably not Desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Launching sometime in October, the cross-platform anime RPG Blue Protocol: Star Resonance will work on Steam Deck but probably not Desktop Linux.</p>
<p>As for why — because it's going to be using Anti-Cheat Expert (ACE). Other games that use this <em>usually</em> either work only on Steam Deck with SteamOS or don't work at all, it's one of the most problematic anti-cheat systems for playing games on Linux platforms. Wuthering Waves appears to be the outlier here, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/wuthering-waves-now-steam-deck-playable-and-works-on-desktop-linux-with-one-tweak/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">since that can work on Desktop Linux too</a> with a tweak.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The developer responded to my email to simply note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ACE supports the latest version of the Steam Deck system (Steam OS 3.7.8). For older versions, players are suggested to update the system to the latest version.<br/>
And the game currently doesn't support Linux or Mac.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Yes, yes, I know - Steam Deck <strong>is</strong> Linux too, but Anti-Cheat Expert (ACE) often targets the hardware directly.</em></p>

<p>I'm still hoping eventually this anti-cheat situation gets less annoying for Linux gamers across Desktop / Steam Deck and other SteamOS devices. Especially if the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/leaks-again-hint-at-valve-doing-a-proper-steam-machine-console/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">leaks about a new Steam Machine</a> come true.</p>
<p>Be sure to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">keep an eye on our anti-cheat page</a> for any change in the status. </p>

      <title>Aquatic tower defense Operation Octo moves release to September 10 due to Hollow Knight: Silksong</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Operation Octo from developer Klub Kofta Studio recently shifted the release date to September 10th, to give Hollow Knight: Silksong a little space. This is at least the third time the release date for it has moved, after originally being due in August and then September 5th and now the 10th. Considering that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/hollow-knight-silksong-releases-september-4/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Silksong releases September 4th</a>, it makes sense.</p>
<p>What is it? More info from the dev: "Give an arm to Dr. Odin, an octopus scientist, on his brave journey to stop the evil skeleton army that threatens the marine ecosystem. Strategically place various sea creature turrets as your line of defense, before frantically having to run around and dodge the oncoming onslaught of skeletons. With short, satisfying missions, it's perfect for short-term play or long binge sessions".</p>
<p>The most recent trailer for it is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_hPRy48kSWg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1c650f7a123c349089642cd0ef94415f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_hPRy48kSWg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Unlock Turrets: Your arsenal is filled with mechanized sea lives! Those cool inventions (such as Pistol Shrimp, Navy Seal, and Death Ray) will handle the fight. You’ll discover new turret types, one after another – but it’s up to you to determine how best to utilize each of ‘em!</li>
<li>Skeleton Enemies: Did you know that most humans who ever lived are dead? Tons of skeletons end up in the ocean and are terrorizing local ecosystems. Fight sword-swinging pirates, poison-wielding chemists, and even skeletal dragons. Those skeletons are sure to shake up your play style at every turn!</li>
<li>Unique Biomes: As you adventure the seven seas, you’ll add more creatures to your turret collection and face new and exciting dangers. Adapting to changing environments is key to survival: don’t misstep into a toxic brine pool or forget your light in the darkness of the deep sea.</li>
<li>Turret Upgrades: Skeletons will sometimes drop a variety of Elixirs, which you can use to boost turrets into different forms! Will you turn a turret into a frosty ice machine, a powerful mutant, or a shadowy stealth weapon?</li>
<li>Boss Fights: Special levels featuring larger-than-life boss enemies with formidable abilities!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>At release their plan is to have full Native Linux and Steam Deck support out of the box. It will be cheap too at only $5.99 with a 20% launch discount. They've also announced "extensive post-launch support, including free content and a custom level editor".</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox Interactive just announced the Shadows of The Shroud expansion for Stellaris is now set for release on September 22nd.</p>
<p>It will be included in the Season 09 Expansion Pass so you won't need an extra purchase if you have that. For everyone else, it will cost $19.99 / £16.75 / €19.99. This expansion was developed with Paradox collaborating with Abrakam. Featuring a comprehensive remaster of the Psionic Ascension Path, a revamped End of Cycle, new Origins, Civics, Events, and more.</p>
<p>They've also been pushing out some big updates to the game recently too, with a couple of updates through August focused on really making the game smoother and more stable. So with this new expansion and major update, I'm seriously looking forward to jumping back in.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>

<p>It will release alongside the free 4.1 ‘Lyra’ update for all players. See more in the <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/stellaris-dev-diary-391-shadows-of-the-shroud.1857155/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement post</a>. I've yet to see any patch notes for the 4.1 update so check back around release day for more info.</p>
<p>At this point, I should remind you that Paradox are using generative AI for some bits in Stellaris, which I'm not too pleased about as per their notice on Steam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We employ generative AI technologies during the creation of some assets. Typically this involves the ideation of content and visual reference material. These elements represent a minor component of the overall development.</p>

      <title>Twinkleby from Might &amp; Delight to launch September 23 with Linux / Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One for fans of cosy casual games. Twinkleby from Shelter developer Might &amp; Delight is set to launch September 23 with full Linux and Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>More about it: in the star-sprinkled universe of Twinkleby, players will furnish dollhouses and decorate lush gardens on floating islands using their ever-growing collection of antiques. Decoration isn't just for yourself though, as your creative choices will attract a delightful cast of neighbours who settle into your cosy designs. Supply them with food and activities, make them happy, or if you change your mind — evict everyone and throw their furniture into space! I'm not sure why you would want to do that but it's an option.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Ah2G2BiG5q8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9a9985423fa8306201738fe4d8c781a5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Ah2G2BiG5q8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Aim for the stars – Follow the Twinkleby star chart to unlock new islands and collect map fragments to discover hidden ones.</li>
<li>A smorgasbord of decoration – Grow your item collection and freely swap designs by tossing items over the island's edge, which are safely returned to your inventory.</li>
<li>Decorate for your Neighbours – Attract both common and rare Neighbours, where the rare ones are drawn to your islands by how you decorate. If you tire of their company, simply send them on their way.</li>
<li>Kindness is king – Make your Neighbours happy and they’ll reward you with gifts, from paintings and treasure keys to map fragments that leads to hidden islands and entire houses.</li>
<li>The soundtrack of your islands – Tailor ambience through weather, seasons, and backdrops, creating a unique soundscape for each island.</li>
<li>Collect falling stars – Collect shooting stars known as Stellars and spend them at Molligan’s Antiques on new decorations. Earn more by delighting your Neighbours and uncovering secret ways to bring more stars tumbling from the sky.</li>
<li>Keep a look-out for gifts from the skies – Claim chests that tumble past your islands and unlock new treasures for your collection.</li>
<li>Take pretty pictures of your creations – Be sure to memorize your dazzling decorations in photo mode to capture all your delightful designs.</li>
<li>Parallel islands – When you have delved deep into the Twinkleby universe, you will be able to play on new clean-slate versions of the islands you've discovered. Find new creative ways to decorate with all the items you've gathered!</li>
<li>Sit back and relax – Enjoy stress-free, escapist gameplay without fail states or game overs.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Pixeljam have launched a new Kickstarter to get Dino Run 2 ready for Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dino Run 2 is finally actually happening, with the latest Kickstarter aiming to get enough funds to make it ready for Early Access. They've tried funding it a few times before, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/long-awaited-prehistoric-multiplayer-platformer-dino-run-2-is-heading-back-to-kickstarter-with-a-new-demo/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">which I covered in the previous article</a> for a little background on what's been happening.</p>
<p>What is it? A "hyper-evolved" (whatever that means…) pixel-art platformer with single-player and online multiplayer. Players race against extinction in detailed prehistoric biomes. You get to choose from a roster of specialised dinos, and customise their look with a deep library of cosmetic mods while escaping the unstoppable doom wall.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pixeljam/the-dino-run-2-early-access-campaign" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign</a> has a goal of $10,000 which was surpassed in only a few hours, so they should hopefully have no problems getting the game ready now. Backers of it will get access to the multiplayer sandbox version which is already live.</p>
<p>They also finally have a new trailer too:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fast, skill-based running in a side-scrolling world full of hazards, secrets, and shortcuts.</li>
<li>Playable dinos with unique strengths and movement tech.</li>
<li>Cosmetic customization across skins, hats, and flair, with no pay-to-win mechanics.</li>
<li>Online multiplayer for cooperative builds and competitive races.</li>
<li>Sandbox creation tools that let players build, share, and run through custom spaces.</li>

      <title>Dying Light: The Beast specifications look really reasonable and there&#39;s a new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Techland appear to be learning lessons from other developers, with the announced specifications for Dying Light: The Beast being surprisingly light.</p>
<p>Seems like if their specifications listed actually match up to reality, that getting 60FPS at 1440p is going to be reasonably easy for a lot of gamers which is good news. Going by the absolute minimum listed, we might even see 30FPS on handhelds like the Steam Deck for this one given the lower resolution.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2986451071756897757gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2986451071756897757gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2483492031756897809gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2483492031756897809gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>They also just released a new trailer to showcase the journey of the protagonist Kyle Crane which you can view below:</p>

<p>Are you going to be picking it up at release? Hopefully it works well with Valve's Proton.</p>

      <title>The Crew Unlimited will revive The Crew from Ubisoft with a custom server emulator</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Doing what Ubisoft don't want to do, the community is reviving the classic racing game The Crew with The Crew Unlimited (TCU) project that's releasing soon. Their team have a fresh website with an announcement that the custom server emulator will be releasing September 15th.</p>
<p>The Crew is part of what spurred on the whole Stop Killing Games movement, which <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/stop-killing-games-consumer-movement-hits-some-major-milestones/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">went onto reach some impressive milestones</a>. It also seemingly made Ubisoft take at least a bit of notice, as they <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/the-crew-2-and-the-crew-motorfest-are-getting-offline-modes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced offline modes were planned for The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorsport</a>.</p>
<p>Sadly, the main trouble with this will be how it's only going to be usable for those who actually still have a copy of The Crew, since it's been shut down officially by Ubisoft and so you can no longer buy it. Great news for those who do have it though, a nice win for preservation - unless Ubisoft attempt to shut it down which wouldn't be surprising if they do.</p>
<p>From what the community developers explained their server emulator will offer both offline and online support, along with having its own launcher.</p>
<p>You can see their latest video on it below:</p>

<p>From the bundle page:</p>
<blockquote>

We, as a games community, will bring together our incredible games from across the world, for a charity bundle with proceeds that go directly to Palestine aid and relief. </p>
<p>We are partnering with UNRWA USA, who will receive the funds and grant them to UNRWA (UN agency) in support of direct humanitarian aid in Palestine. Together, the game dev community and UNRWA USA will raise awareness on the situation in Gaza, spotlight our communities, and the devs participating in this charity drive.</p>

      <title>Monsters are Coming! Rock &amp; Road is easily going to be my next complete obsession</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Monsters are Coming! Rock &amp; Road has just planted itself right at the top of my wishlist for the excellent combination of survivor-likes with tower defense. Seriously, this is one you do not want to miss, and there's a demo available to play on Steam right now.</p>
<p>A glorious mixture of survivor-like bullet heaven gameplay popularised by Vampire Survivors, with you protecting a constantly moving town hall so it has a tower defense game mixed into it. As you progress through your run and level up, you get to place down more towers to expand this always moving structure.</p>
<p>You're not just running around taking out monsters helping your tower though, you're also gathering resources as quickly as you can and removing roadblocks in the way of your little town. There's a lot of moving parts to this one to ensure your focus is firmly suckered in by it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13001846741756817901gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13001846741756817901gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11528548631756817899gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11528548631756817899gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Really challenging with enemies coming from all directions, especially with various types of loot you can go and grab, so you're constantly weighing up which direction to run to take down a few enemies and gather loot and resources, while then making a mad dash back to protect your town.</p>
<p>It's properly unique and clever and it's wrapped up in a neat dark style that really does look fantastic. The rocking tunes are pretty sweet too, although a bit repetitive and that's about the only downside of note to this one.</p>
<p>Do have a look at the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-ybLlFCrduk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ee55766be09f2f04a8837515e0d16f86.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-ybLlFCrduk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Easily one of the best demos I've played this year and I think you're going to love this mixture. The game works to perfection on Linux with Proton 9.0-4.</p>

      <title>Duskers developers reveal Below the Crown a love letter to chess, roguelikes, and dungeon crawlers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Below the Crown has now been officially revealed from Misfits Attic, developers of the award-winning Duskers. It's a thoroughly unique blend of games inspired by chess, roguelikes, and dungeon crawlers.</p>
<p>“We like to think of Below the Crown as either a gateway drug into chess or a fun alternative that scratches the same strategic itch without the heaviness,” said Tim Keenan, Founder, Misfits Attic. “It offers a massively single-player experience with tons of community interaction and a satisfying gameplay loop, all wrapped in a cool ‘80s retro tech aesthetic with Duskers vibes."</p>
<p>In Below the Crown you progress through dungeons, capturing enemy parties with superior strategy and a spell card or two. Answer strange, glitchy psychological questions between battles to uncover what’s really going on here. Check out the announcement trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Q8gf18lJ_lc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9674cf6b8cfe0288ed8bd92890c8d491.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Q8gf18lJ_lc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the Steam page:</p>

<p><strong>Chess meets Awesome</strong> - No memorizing openings, long drawn-out endgames, or stalemates. Start with 1 piece instead of 16. Cast new pieces with exciting abilities onto the board. No analysis paralysis – enemy movement stays basic until you encounter the dungeon’s bosses… Collect Undo Tokens if you need ’em, or more gold if you don’t!</p>
<p><strong>You are not Alone</strong> - Post your epic victories as challenges to the community! Watch replays from top players to further improve your skills as you take on Daily Challenges. Dive into the custom board editor to create &amp; download new rooms to spice up your dungeons in this massively single-player experience.</p>
<p><strong>This is a Test</strong> - Answer simple questions based on your psychological state and relationships to your pieces as you progress through the depths of the Dungeon. Please answer openly and honestly. Your answers will not be used against you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it looks awesome, combining lots of mechanics I love in my strategy games. It will arrive in Early Access sometime in Q4 2025 and a demo is arriving in Steam Next Fest in October. It will need Proton to run on Linux.</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s the top 50 most played games on Steam Deck for August 2025 - with Hollow Knight the champion</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's the latest data from Valve on what the most played games on Steam Deck were for August 2025, and perhaps unsurprisingly Hollow Knight is top.</p>
<p>With the announcement of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/hollow-knight-silksong-releases-september-4/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hollow Knight: Silksong releasing September 4th</a>, getting <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/hollow-knight-silksong-is-now-steam-deck-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Deck Verified</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/hollow-knight-silksong-price-and-release-time-confirmed/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">low price announcement</a> - it's expected the original was going to shoot up the list rather quickly. Players likely refamiliarising themselves with it, along with renewed interest from new players jumping in to see what all the Silksong fuss is about. Looking over Steam charts, Hollow Knight (the original) is currently the 26th top seller globally.</p>

<p>I've been pulled back into Overwatch 2 lately, which does run <em>surprisingly</em> well on Steam Deck due to family being quite into it so that's been taking some hours away from me.

      <title>Blackjack Roulette puts a literal spin on a classic card game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Giving Blackjack and Roulette a little Balatro treatment? Perhaps just a little, with it putting a literal spin on the classics here. A blend of two casino classics with a rogue-like (rogue-lite?) flavour, which might just be enough to get me to put many hours into this one. <em>Could be a real sleeper hit to watch this one.</em></p>
<p>More info from the developer: "Get as close to 21 without going over and see how you compare against a roulette wheel of hands to beat. If you keep winning, the wheel keeps spinning! After each round, the wheel gets bigger, and so does the Buy-In cost. If you can’t afford the Buy-In at the start of a round, it’s Game Over.</p>
<p>Luckily, this casino will gladly sell you insurance. Insurance Policies offer various upgrades and abilities to help, but they’ll cost you. One policy lets you win on ties (for a small fee, of course). Another lets you overcharge your hand over 21 without busting, but will auto-play your next 5 hands automatically. Press your luck and take out the Pit Bosses in Blackjack Roulette."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="tBCsXOeXHcU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bf96e3fb9f6c396c3a11092d9d4c7cac.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/tBCsXOeXHcU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Blackjack with a roulette “spin” and unique Insurance Policies that make each run different.</li>
<li>Every hand you defeat gets added to your pocket and are used the next time you lose your hand. And the end of a round, your cash out is based on your Buy-In and your Pocket Size.</li>
<li>60+ unique "Insurance Policies", each with different abilities, all based on real world insurance policies (yes, even Ketchup Insurance).</li>
<li>Unlock Challenge Modes that offer new, and usually harder, ways to play.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Sword Hero is an impressive looking upcoming open-world fantasy RPG</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While it has a rather boring name, Sword Hero looks anything but boring in the new trailer and the combat demo you can try out right now. I think the developer is really cooking with this one, everything about it looks and feels really interesting. That is, if you don't mind the retro style to it. </p>
<p>More about it: Sword Hero is an open-world fantasy RPG inspired by classics like Gothic and Kenshi, designed for players who love freedom, danger, and immersion. Instead of guiding you along a safe, linear path, Sword Hero throws you into a world that doesn’t bend to your will—you must adapt, survive, and carve your own story. Be a mercenary, a faction loyalist, an outlaw, or simply prey for the beasts that stalk the land. Every scar, prosthetic, or choice you make leaves its mark on both you and the island itself.</p>
<p>Check out the latest trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1wU3T21HapI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bc8e825474415159f24a1067d0a4b871.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1wU3T21HapI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They recently put up a combat arena demo on Steam, which gives you a small glimpse into some of the gameplay systems (it works fine with Proton on Linux) and I'm now really quite excited by this one.</p>
<p>You can try the demo on Steam right now and at some point it will have a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/itspossible/sword-hero" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> too.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Seamless Open World: Explore a vast open world, offering freedom from the start with organic obstacles - No invisible walls here.</li>
<li>Dynamic Systems: Day-night cycle, NPC routines, Crime, and Faction skirmishes.</li>
<li>Body Parts Damage: Dismember enemies during combat for visceral battles - Exploit their weak points or even get special items by targeting specific bodyparts.</li>
<li>Housing: Purchase Businesses and Houses - Rent them out or furnish them as your own.</li>
<li>Colossal Creatures: Confront massive foes in epic battles.</li>
<li>Persistent World: Simulated Wounds, infections, decapitation, burning vegetation - Corpses that don't disappear, but rather nature takes its course.</li>
<li>Character Progression: Stats visibly change your character - Get more muscular as your Strength grows, receive permanent scars, replace your limbs with powerful Prostethics, get magical Tatoos and more.</li>
<li>Non-Level Scaling Enemies: Every enemy including Monsters are organic parts of the ecosystem - A Wolf at the beginning of the game won't magically become a bullet-sponge by the end.</li>
<li>Living World: Immerse yourself in a dynamic world where NPCs shape the landscape even when you're not looking.</li>
<li>Join a Faction: Factions provide precious gear and resources you wouldn't otherwise be able to obtain - Become respected and you will rise through their ranks.</li>
<li>An epic Story that spans across 6 Chapters, with some heavily branching choices.</li>
</ul>

      <title>WinBoat is a new Linux app to run Windows apps with &#34;seamless integration&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sometimes, you really do just need to run a Windows app on Linux and perhaps WinBoat might make this easier with its promise of "seamless integration".</p>
<p>We have Wine / Proton of course and they can run a lot, but not everything is possible. WinBoat is different. Instead of running compatibility layers, it runs a real copy of Windows using Docker and KVM under the hood. The developer explains it should run basically everything unless "it requires strong GPU acceleration or kernel-level anticheat". It uses FreeRDP for showing the apps on your Linux desktop, enabling you to interact with them like you would with any other Linux app.</p>
<p>All of this with a good-looking and easy to use interface too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14993009941756809102gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14993009941756809102gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4950030381756809103gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4950030381756809103gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - WinBoat, from their GitHub</em></p>
<p>The biggest issue it has is requiring you to go through and manually install multiple extras, apart from that I absolutely love the idea of this for a few specific apps that just don't work on Linux directly. It's still a work in progress and quite early with it classed as a "beta" so keep that in mind when testing it.</p>
<p>App Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Elegant Interface: Sleek and intuitive interface that seamlessly integrates Windows into your Linux desktop environment, making it feel like a native experience.</li>
<li>Automated Installs: Simple installation process through our interface - pick your preferences &amp; specs and let us handle the rest.</li>
<li>Run Any App: If it runs on Windows, it can run on WinBoat. Enjoy the full range of Windows applications as native OS-level windows in your Linux environment.</li>
<li>Full Windows Desktop: Access the complete Windows desktop experience when you need it, or run individual apps seamlessly integrated into your Linux workflow.</li>
<li>Filesystem Integration: Your home directory is mounted in Windows, allowing easy file sharing between the two systems without any hassle.</li>
<li>And many more: Smartcard passthrough, resource monitoring, and more features being added regularly.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Crusader Kings III celebrates 5 years with some interesting stats</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Crusader Kings III has now been out for 5 years and Paradox have done a mini-celebration, showing off some fresh stats from players. There sure are a lot of divorces going on and even more deaths.</p>
<p>“Five years have gone by so fast,” says Crusader Kings III Game Director Alexander Oltner. “We launched Crusader Kings III at the height of the Covid pandemic, so the last stages of development added an extra layer of pressure on the team. That the game has been such a success is testimony to both the hard work of my colleagues and the passion of the community at large.”</p>
<p>Here's the stats they released:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/371490771756808088gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/371490771756808088gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's interesting to note that this is one of the last few games from Paradox to have Native Linux support, which they're no longer doing. We had Victoria 3 after it and they acquired Across the Obelisk (which already had Linux support) but that's it now, their games following and upcoming are Windows-only so you'll need Proton. Their most recent releases all have mixed to negative reviews too, so I'm hoping that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/paradox-announced-the-updated-expanded-and-remastered-surviving-mars-relaunched/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Surviving Mars: Relaunched</a> won't be a disappointment. </p>

      <title>Steam Survey for August 2025 is out and here&#39;s the Linux / SteamOS details</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have now released the Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey results for August 2025, showing the overall Linux share has dropped. Sadly, that 3% people were hoping for is another month away, but we'll hit it eventually going by the trends overall (especially if we see a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/leaks-again-hint-at-valve-doing-a-proper-steam-machine-console/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">proper SteamOS Steam Machine again</a>). Be sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/steam-survey-for-july-2025-shows-linux-approaching-3/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">last month's data for comparison</a>.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The overall operating system share:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 95.59% +0.36%</li>
<li>Linux 2.64% -0.25%</li>
<li>macOS 1.77% -0.11%</li>
</ul>
<p>The Linux share from our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated Steam Tracker page</a> over time:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13749731881756807196gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13749731881756807196gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>And the Linux distribution share over time (still working on adding older data here):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20761868351756807197gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20761868351756807197gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Be sure to check the interactive charts on our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Tracker</a>.</p>
<p>See below for the breakdown of the popular Linux distributions on Steam for August 2025, with Valve's own SteamOS continuing its slow downwards trend. Which is interesting considering overall the Linux numbers gradually trending upwards showing there's plenty of users flowing into Desktop Linux and systems like Bazzite on other handhelds.</p>
<p>Worth noting that Bazzite this month doesn't have the version number listed, which it did in previous months which is why it says it gained the whole 2.21% for August, but it's actually down from 3.20% <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/steam-survey-for-july-2025-shows-linux-approaching-3/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">last month</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 27.65% -0.66%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 10.98% +0.16%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 22.1 64 bit 8.21% +0.38%</li>
<li>Freedesktop SDK 24.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 6.29% -0.25%</li>
<li>CachyOS 64 bit 4.69% +0.48%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS 64 bit 2.83% -1.61%</li>

<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 2.35% -0.11%</li>
<li>EndeavourOS Linux 64 bit 2.40% +0.07%</li>
<li>Fedora Linux 42 (Workstation Edition) 64 bit 2.18% -0.03%</li>
<li>Bazzite (FROM Fedora Atomic) 64 bit 2.21% +2.21%</li>
<li>Fedora Linux 42 (KDE Plasma Desktop Edition) 64 bit 1.93% +0.14%</li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 1.97% -0.17%</li>

      <title>LEGO The Lord of the Rings gets updated and it&#39;s now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The classic LEGO The Lord of the Rings adventure from Traveller's Tales has been upgraded, and it's now Steam Deck Verified too.</p>
<p>Much like we recently saw for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/lego-batman-2-dc-super-heroes-gets-steam-deck-verified-and-cloud-saves/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes</a>, which was also updated to get Steam Deck Verified, they didn't say exactly what they fixed up for the update that's just been released. The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/214510/announcements/detail/498331094794371712" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> simply said: "This update was to get the title Steam Deck verified" - and that's it.</p>
<p>Going by <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/214510" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> reports from players, the game previously needed a few little manual adjustments, so it seems the developer has worked around it. When Valve went and checked it over again to bump it up to the Verified rating they set it to use <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/proton-10-0-2d-beta-released-with-a-few-small-fixes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the latest Proton 10 Beta</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9522133381756737849gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Seems like they're going back over multiple LEGO games to get them all Verified, so hopefully more to come, although lots already do work just fine there's a few others like LEGO Worlds that have issues still.</p>

      <title>ScummVM gets support for the survival horror Penumbra Overture from the Amnesia developers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Penumbra Overture was the first survival horror game from Frictional Games released all the way back in 2007, and now ScummVM is getting support for it. Long before the release of Soma and the Amnesia series, this is where Frictional Games started off.</p>
<p>ScummVM is an open source project that allows you to play many classic retro games on modern systems, often with a bunch of enhancements. The news is doubly interesting in this case, as Penumbra Overture was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2010/05/lugaruhd-and-penumbra-overture-open-source/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">open sourced all the way back in 2010</a>. On August 29th, the ScummVM team put up a short <a href="https://www.scummvm.org/news/20250829" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> noting that with the next stable release, Penumbra Overture will have "full support".</p>
<p>You can test it right now with the daily build, or wait for the next big ScummVM release.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13254894041756730850gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13254894041756730850gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Penumbra Overture on Linux</em></p>
<p>From the looks of the ScummVM source code on GitHub, they are using a fork of the open source HPL1 game engine from Frictional. Hopefully at some point later we'll also see support for the later games Penumbra: Black Plague and Penumbra: Requiem.</p>
<p>The ScummVM team also recently <a href="https://www.scummvm.org/news/20250822/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> support for World Builder-based games.</p>

      <title>ChimeraOS dev announced Kazeta, a new Linux OS aimed at recreating a classic console experience</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developer of ChimeraOS has announced Kazeta, a new Linux OS that aims to provide more of a classic gaming console like experience.</p>
<p>We have a Linux distribution for basically everything nowadays right? So why make another one as a passion project? Answering that, developer Alesh Slovak said in an email it's addressing these points they've been thinking on lately:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- I noticed a lot of non-technical people using ChimeraOS/SteamOS getting lost in Steam’s complex menu structure and struggling with basic things like launching and closing games.<br/>
- I became disenchanted with digital storefronts and have come back around to appreciating physical media: game cartridges, CDs, DVDs<br/>
- I have gotten more and more into collecting old physical games and systems and found them to be a much more pleasant experience than what modern gaming offers<br/>
- I have become more and more concerned with preserving my digital game collection for play in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so with that in mind the basic idea is that you grab DRM free games (from stores like <a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>), and pop them onto SD Cards to turn them into cartridges that Kazeta will detect.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6440147271756724562gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>More from the developer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To play a game cartridge on Kazeta, you simply insert the cartridge and turn on the system. When you are done playing, you press the power button to turn it off. That’s it. There are no accounts, no online requirements, no cloud, no nothing.</p>
<p>The cherry on top is that the cartridges are treated as read-only and save data is captured separately, keeping your games untouched and preserved forever.</p>
<p>If you boot a Kazeta system with no cartridge inserted, it will boot into a retro-style bios menu where you can manage your game saves, just like the gaming consoles from the latter half of the ‘90s.</p>
<p>Kazeta is definitely not for everyone. It requires a bit of work to get started, but I have been using it quite a bit the last few months and it has brought me a lot of joy. I hope it can bring joy to others as well.</p>

<p>While the games did work with Proton, or you could have just run Aleph One directly, it's nice to see the Steam releases of the classics directly supported on Linux like this. Open source games are where Native Linux build should (in theory) thrive compared to running Windows games in Proton, since anyone can help make them better.</p>

      <title>Wine 10.14 brings updates for vkd3d and Mono plus more fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Windows compatibility layer Wine, which is what Valve's Proton is built from, has development version 10.14 out now. Nice to see it back to a more regular schedule after the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/wine-10-13-released-with-improvements-for-wow64-bcrypt-and-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">delay on Wine 10.13</a>.</p>
<p>The highlights from Wine 10.14 are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Bundled vkd3d upgraded to version 1.17.</li>
<li>Mono engine updated to version 10.2.0.</li>
<li>Support for ping on IPv6.</li>
<li>Gitlab CI now running on Debian Trixie.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Wine's own vkd3d version 1.17 noted these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Initial HLSL support for thread group shared memory.</li>
<li>Several features have been implemented for the experimental Metal Shading Language target.</li>
<li>Miscellaneous bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And for Wine Mono the 10.2.0 changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Mono's handling of arrays with no defined size in native wrappers now treats them as having a size of 1, matching .NET Framework. This fixes a crash in some winforms applications when used with accessibility tools.</li>
<li>Fixed an assertion failure when using the undocumented "VtblGap" runtime feature. Terraria's multiplayer server encounters this.</li>
<li>Modified FNA's <code class="inline-code">Texture2D</code> class to be xml-serializable. This is used (but not really) by Meridian: New World. It attempts to serialize a class containing a null <code class="inline-code">Texture2D</code> field, but just having the field is enough to cause an error.</li>
<li>Implemented some <code class="inline-code">Microsoft.DirectX.DirectInput.Device</code> methods used by the Sega Rally launcher.</li>
<li>Technical
	<ul>
<li>Some warning fixes in WpfGfx to support newer llvm-mingw.</li>
<li>mono-basic has been merged into Framework Mono.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Upstream updates
	<ul>
<li>SDL to 3.2.20</li>
<li>FNA to 25.08, plus a few additional commits with fixes for Galactic Arms Race on NVidia GPUs and Ring Runner.</li>
<li>llvm-mingw to 20250709</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's some fixes noted for Phantasy Star Online: Blue Burst, GreedFall, Mafia III: Definitive Edition, MDK, Death to Spies, Roblox Studio, Fritz Chess Coach, Le Mans Ultimate and various other fixes for expected Windows app behaviour.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15940290151756723367gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - GreedFall</em></p>
<p>We also just recently had the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/dxvk-2-7-1-brings-performance-improvements-for-some-direct3d-9-games-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release of DXVK 2.7.1</a> too which you can use with Wine for better performance in many games. If you're not just using Proton directly that is.</p>

      <title>DXVK 2.7.1 brings performance improvements for some Direct3D 9 games on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>DXVK is a Vulkan-based translation layer for Direct3D 8/9/10/11 to run Windows games on Linux with Wine / Proton.<em> It can also be directly used by developers for Linux ports too.</em></p>
<p>This is part of what allows Valve's Proton to run Windows games so nicely on SteamOS / Steam Deck. The latest release, version 2.7.1, is out now. You don't need to do anything for Proton as Valve update it themselves. However, you can update it yourself if you wish - <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-update-dxvk-and-vkd3d-proton-in-proton-and-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">see how in the GamingOnLinux guide</a>.</p>
<p>From the full <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v2.7.1" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><u><strong>Bug fixes and Improvements</strong></u></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a regression that would cause MSAA resolves to look like MSAA was not working in a number of D3D9 games.</li>
<li>Improved performance in some D3D9 games by avoiding unnecessary render pass barriers, such as <strong>Dead Space 2</strong> (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/5112" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#5112</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed the way tessellation factors are interpreted for line tessellation. This fixes particle rendering in <strong>DCS World</strong> and potentially other issues. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/4327" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4327</a>)</li>
<li>Added the <code class="inline-code">d3d9.modeCountCompatibility</code> configuration option to work around buffer overflows in older games that do not expect monitors to support more than ~16 different display modes. This fixes a crash in <strong>AquaNox 2</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Alone in the Dark</strong>: Worked around a crash on start. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/5158" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#5158</a>)</li>

	Note that this change may cause a noticeable performance regression on AMD systems due to less efficient code paths in the game.</li>
<li><strong>Dungeon Siege 2</strong>: Fixed a regression that would cause character models to not show in the menu. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/5175" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#5175</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Everybody's Gone to the Rapture</strong>: Worked around poor CPU-bound performance. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/5168" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#5168</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Fallout New Vegas</strong>: Added vendor override to work around an issue with the FNV Reloaded mod using an unimplemented NVAPI function on Nvidia GPUs. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/5136" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#5136</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Guilty Gear</strong>: Added 60 FPS cap to work around the game speeding up at higher frame rates.

      <title>Parkour meets Vampire Survivors in Midnight Horde</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Indie dev Carry Castle recently announced Midnight Horde, a game that blends the popular mechanics of Vampire Survivors with parkour moves.</p>
<p>Probably one of the most unique takes on the genre I've ever seen as you dodge, climb, and weave through swarms of twisted creatures as they soar across the walls of gothic ruins. An interesting upgrade system too with your own castle to build and upgrade as you go. It has some really nice ideas so I can't wait to see more from this one and runs just fine with Proton on Linux.</p>
<p>A demo has been released along with a new trailer.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JNByueuE73g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8282e7cb9529a8b151b16734d9d7e44a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JNByueuE73g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“Midnight Horde is my personal challenge to make the most objectively fun and flow state focused game I can make as a solo developer. It blends everything I love: gothic vibes, roguelite progression, and fast, skill-based movement, into an experience that’s both intense and expressive.” - Per Fornander, the Developer at Carry Castle</p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Parkour System</strong>: Dash, climb, and outwit the swarms across haunted rooftops while delivering mayhem to the waves of monstrosities.</li>
<li><strong>Castle Building</strong>: Strengthen your fortress between runs, unlocking upgrades and defences to tip the balance.</li>
<li><strong>Roguelite Progression</strong>: Each night is different: experiment with builds, explore, and adapt to survive.</li>
<li><strong>Gothic Atmosphere</strong>: A dark, hand-crafted world inspired by classic gothic scenes, dripping with atmosphere.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>No exact release date yet other than sometime in 2026.</p>

      <title>The Linux version of the original Splitgate has been removed</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With Splitgate <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/the-original-splitgate-will-live-on-with-player-hosted-matches/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">moving over to player hosted matches</a> with the main servers being shut, the developers have now removed the Native Linux version too.</p>
<p>Going by <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/677620/history/?changeid=30854943" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, it appears this happened a few days ago. So now if you wish to continue playing the classic Splitgate, you'll have to use the Windows version with Proton. Since Valve's verification for Steam Deck was done on the Native Linux version that no longer exists, you will need to manually change it over to Proton in the compatibility settings otherwise it won't launch anymore on Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2909845051756721349gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p><em>Looks like the anti-cheat was removed as well.</em></p>
<p>It's a shame whenever this happens, but in this case it's a free to play online game that is no longer supported. So, running it with Proton is likely the better option compared with an old Linux version. At least Valve can maintain compatibility with Proton in the case were future Linux updates might just leave the Native version broken.</p>

      <title>Basalt: The Cursed Vein is an upcoming freaking looking roguelite match-3</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Enjoy the idea of match 3 games but don't like the grind? The developers of Basalt: The Cursed Vein don't either and so they're doing something different. With a gritty atmosphere and roguelite mechanics, it looks a bit on the spooky side.</p>
<p>Here you mine for ores and rare materials to rebuild a town unlocking new bombs, tools and upgrades as you go that let you push deeper where monsters await you. The roguelite side of it introduces a fresh game each time with different enemy types, bomb effects, and available upgrades. Personally, I think it looks great!</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-OEli70mPdc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/498846979d2b9f049f5e4522bcc95abf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-OEli70mPdc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“I’ve always loved match-3, but not the free-to-play grind,” says designer Jack Kristoffersen. “Basalt turns it into a strategic roguelite loop where every dig feels rewarding.”</p>
<p>“I wanted the pixel art to feel as rough as the town you’re rebuilding,” says artist Simon Nyhus. “It’s dark and gritty, the kind of place where every shadow hides something, and every character knows more than they’re telling you.”</p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Roguelite Match-3 Loop - </strong>Mine ores, rare minerals, and lost artifacts to rebuild a ruined mining town. Each upgrade unlocks new tools, bombs, and perks that let you dig deeper into the shafts for even more valuable resources. Still, every trip uses a limited number of moves that are persistent across the levels, so efficiency is key.</li>
<li><strong>Synergy-Driven Progression - </strong>Collect upgrades, lab-made bombs, and forgeable items that interact in unexpected ways. Build devastating combos that wipe the board, disable enemies, or chain resource extraction, turning every run into a unique strategic puzzle with different optimal builds.</li>
<li><strong>Randomized Runs - </strong>Enemy types, bomb effects, forge recipes, and available upgrades change each run. Even the extraordinary powers of the mine itself vary, forcing you to adapt your tactics and experiment with new playstyles every time.</li>
<li><strong>Gritty Pixel Art Atmosphere - </strong>Explore a dark, cold mining settlement rendered in moody, detailed pixel art. Between runs, meet eccentric and slightly unsettling townsfolk whose shady deals, odd requests, and tragic backstories add mystery to your journey.</li>
<li><strong>Monsters in the Deep</strong> - Battle strange and dangerous creatures as you descend, from horrifying shape-shifting spiders to blind, mineral-hungry tentacles that grow in length.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Vampire Survivors latest Beta adds online play and more new content</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vampire Survivors is finally getting the promised online mode, with a Beta now available to try that also includes some new content.</p>
<p>There's quite a few differences to playing it online instead of in local co-op including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Batch level up</strong> - Depending on the player count you will only see level up after all players have leveled up. So on 4 players the level up screen will only show every 4 levels.</li>
<li><strong>DLC </strong>- You will only be able to use DLC online if every player owns that DLC. We're retro-fitting Online into an originally single player game written in JS by a solo dev, so there are a lot of technical issues we have to move around or worry about later, one of which is the way that DLC expansions are handled.</li>
<li><strong>Free Roam</strong> - In online you are not restricted to the same screen, you can all freely move around the stage independently. (Note: You will be pulled into a boss room if any player walks into it)</li>
<li><strong>Spectator mode</strong> - When you die in multiplayer you can use the mouse to jump to players who are still alive. You also respawn where they are if you are spectating them.</li>
<li><strong>Achievements </strong>- You will have the choice at the end of the run to carry over any achievements earned in that run back into your own save file.</li>
<li><strong>Speed up</strong> - Disabled in online.</li>
<li><strong>Pause menu</strong> - To help flow, when you pause, you do not pause for everyone else, you just get a small window of invincibility</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For the PC release, it will be a free update but they're not giving an exact date on when it will leave Beta, other than sometime this "Autumn". Save data will carry over as well, so you should hopefully not have any problems when it does leave Beta. There's no matchmaking for online mode, it's purely based on room codes or invites. Currently no cross-play either.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7689504721756486511gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7689504721756486511gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Plus some new content was also added as a Preview of the new update in the same opt-in Beta:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>15 new achievements to unlock:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 new stages</li>
<li>2 new characters</li>
<li>2 new weapons and their evolutions</li>
<li>1 old passive weapon</li>
<li>3 new darkanas</li>
<li>3 new relics to get:
	<ul>
<li>1 new power-up</li>
<li>1 new character transformation</li>
<li>1 new game mode: PARTY MODE</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That's only a small slice of what's to come, as the new content will be added to the Beta in batches. Two more parts are due to be added but they aren't saying what just yet.</p>

      <title>Steam UK users will now need a credit card to access mature content due to the Online Safety Act</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 29/08/25 - 16:59 UTC</strong>: since there's reports of it still working even with a Debit Card and not just a Credit Card (they're different in the UK), I've asked Valve if they have any comments on this. Since in the UK, even a preteen can get a Debit Card.</p>
<p><strong>Update #2 - 19:33 UTC</strong> - Valve press replied to GamingOnLinux to confirm allowing Debit Cards for verification was a bug, which has now been solved.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Valve recently put up a new support page, detailing the steps they've taken to comply with the UK Online Safety Act.</p>
<p>The UK Online Safety Act has a rather broad scope, and has been the cause of many changes not just for UK citizens but people worldwide as more and more websites realise they're in scope of the act and have to make changes. It covers all sorts of thing from porn to community forums and more. And yes, that even includes video games too (which many developers likely aren't even aware of). If a video game has user to user communication (voice / text chat) and it's available in the UK, the developer will need to comply with it.</p>
<p>The likes of Reddit, Bluesky, Discord, Xbox and more have already rolled out verification systems.</p>
<p>To comply with it, Valve will now be requiring users from the UK to have a valid credit card stored on their account. Valve will do a direct check (that costs £0 to users) using their own internal payment processing system "which is independently certified under the PCI-DSS standard".</p>
<p>If you don't do this you won't be able to access "Steam store pages for mature content games as well as their associated community hubs".</p>
<p>In the UK, you have to be at least 18 to have a credit card, so this way does make a lot of sense - as you'll already be age verified if you have a credit card in your name. Valve additionally say that "Having the credit card stored as a payment method acts as an additional deterrent against circumventing age verification by sharing a single Steam user account among multiple persons".</p>
<p>Valve feel this way "preserves the maximum degree of user privacy" as the data they will process during this is no different to simply making a purchase on Steam. It's also only required if you've specifically opted into seeing mature content on Steam.</p>

      <title>Roguelike third-person mech-action shooter RIG Riot to be Steam Deck optimised</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm a ridiculous sucker for mech-action games and RIG Riot just landed on my radar. A roguelike third-person mech-action shooter with some fun looking combat.</p>
<p>The developer has posted an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/3180340/announcements/detail/499456994710651236" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam to note how they plan to ensure it works well on Steam Deck, with current testing showing it will run at 60FPS after only a few tweaks of the settings and they plan to continue optimising it.</p>
<p>More about it: "RIG Riot is a roguelike third-person mech-action shooter. Travel through increasingly difficult stages and collect weapons and mods with powerful effects. Discover unique synergies that suit your playstyle, and travel the megastructure in search of rare permanent parts to perfect your RIG."</p>
<p>Check out the latest trailer which shows off some action along with mech customization:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FUIGASjxiYk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a26f841a289971abe4d2e98c4c55d5aa.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FUIGASjxiYk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights from the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Exciting Combat</strong></p>
<p>Combat can feel quite different depending on the style of RIG you build. Do you prefer a light and mobile mech that bombards their foes from range with a trusty sniper? How about a well-rounded powerhouse who focuses on bringing the pain with missile bombardments and automatic rifles? Or maybe you prefer a tanky build that barrels through all opposition with laser blades and shotguns? Put together your build and then prepare for fast-paced combat against a wide array of enemies.</p>
<p><strong>Deep Customization</strong></p>
<p>In RIG Riot, every loss is an opportunity. Dive into the garage and check out the exciting new parts you've earned. Every part in RIG Riot is made out of a combination of components from the various full sets available in the game. On top of that, rare parts can be found with their own powerful effects. There are an incredible amount of parts to find- which will you use?</p>
<p><strong>Powerful Synergies</strong></p>
<p>Finds the best ways to make your unique RIG shine as you travel through increasingly difficult stages. Search for rare weapons and mods with effects that compliment your build to see just how far you can go.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right to the top of my wishlist this one goes.</p>

      <title>Monster-catching, dungeon-crawling RPG Siralim Ultimate gets a big 2.0 update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Despite the developer being done with it, they've expanded it again. Siralim Ultimate 2.0 is out now as the "biggest update ever". Even before this update the game was massive, and easily one of the biggest monster-catching games ever made. Now it's truly huge.</p>
<p>What exactly is it? Tough to pin down properly to a genre, because it blends quite a lot. There's monster catching, dungeon crawling and more with over 1,200 different creatures. The developer says to think of it like "Pokemon meets Diablo, or more accurately, Dragon Warrior Monsters meets Path of Exile". If you can appreciate the very retro style, there's a huge amount of depth to it.</p>
<p>In the new update they've translated it into 14 languages, there's various new game modes to play through from an Ironman Mode to a Calm Mode and more. You'll also find hundreds of new creatures, traits, spell gems, cards, and achievements.</p>

      <title>Popular sci-fi roguelike deckbuilder Cobalt Core added Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rated Overwhelmingly Positive from users on Steam, the sci-fi roguelike deckbuilder Cobalt Core just added official Linux support. It is already rated Steam Deck Verified using Proton but now it has a Linux version.</p>
<p>Not just popular with users on Steam, multiple critic reviews really enjoyed it back when it originally released with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/deckbuilder-fans-owe-themselves-some-time-with-the-brilliant-cobalt-core/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">PC Gamer</a> noting it "might be the year's best deckbuilding game". It plays quite differently to the vast number of other deckbuilders, with its inventive single-axis spin on tactics games. You control a ship, where you need to position yourself along a horizontal axis to manually dodge missiles, line up your cannons and fire.</p>
<p>Check out the original trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OE8_dfMhlfo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/54c4d5dbed87c6791dfa5531f1e2e583.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OE8_dfMhlfo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights (from Steam):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Give orders to your crew by playing cards: Will you <strong>raise shields</strong> to protect your ship, <strong>dodge</strong> incoming missiles and cannon fire to avoid damage outright, or <strong>strike</strong> preemptively to disable your enemy’s weapons? Outmaneuver your foes to stay just ahead of impending calamity, and reach the Cobalt Core!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fresh new spin on tactics –</strong> dodge attacks and target weak points in this unique single-axis take on tactics combat. Outwit the enemy in a high stakes game of cat and mouse!</li>
<li><strong>Customize your deck –</strong> hundreds of cards and split upgrade paths means no two runs will be the same. Find that perfect combo that brings your deck from powerful to overpowered.</li>
<li><strong>Get to know your crew –</strong> each character comes with a completely unique playstyle and their own personal story. Bring 3 along, mix and match their decks, and see how these little goobers get along with each other.</li>
<li><strong>Tons of replayability –</strong> hundreds of different character+ship combinations before you even hit “start run”. Crank up the difficulty and really test your skills!</li>
<li><strong>Daily Challenges –</strong> Keep runs fresh with all sorts of modifiers. Can you win with just 1 character, or with your ship scrambling itself every fight? Play at your own pace, or get competitive on the leaderboards!</li>
<li><strong>Get in the groove –</strong> featuring 90+ minutes of catchy and electrifying original music by <em>Minecraft</em> composer Aaron Cherof!</li>
<li><strong>Forward momentum –</strong> untangle a narrative and unlock more playstyles as you go. Is there any escape from this time loop?</li>
</ul>

<p>The Linux version was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2179850/view/526478592467534257" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> on August 27th, and it's live on Steam. They haven't yet ticked all the boxes to actually show it on the Steam page but it's there.</p>

<p><strong>The Secrets of TARASET Station</strong></p>
<p>Something terrible has happened here... But what is this place? And how did you get here?</p>
<p><strong>An unsettling Shadow</strong></p>

      <title>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is out now and Steam Deck Unsupported but SteamOS Compatible</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater from KONAMI is a remake of the 2004 game METAL GEAR SOLID 3: SNAKE EATER. It's out now but it's Steam Deck Unsupported.</p>
<p>Valve checked it out and put up a notice that it just can't perform well enough on Steam Deck, not even by their sometimes strange standards. Not exactly surprising though, this is a full next-gen remake with a big visual bump and a lot of newer AAA games have really struggled on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>It is at least noted to be SteamOS Compatible though, and so it will run with Proton on Linux systems that are a bit more powerful from other handhelds to Desktop Linux. And, early reports on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/2417610?device=pc" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> paint a reasonably positive picture for Desktop Linux.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SRQM7bf6DOg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/06997e7267aad344434240d118fae845.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SRQM7bf6DOg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I'm not really up to date enough on Metal Gear Solid to go jumping into this one, so I won't be looking at it directly. </p>
<p>Are you playing it? What do you think so far?</p>

      <title>Gears of War: Reloaded is out now and works well on Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gears of War: Reloaded has been officially released so now we can experience the beginning on Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck. <em>Note: personal purchase.</em></p>
<p>Surprisingly, it does work rather nicely out of the box on the Steam Deck and seems like it does actually deserve the Steam Deck Verified rating. Naturally, on a more powerful Linux desktop, it's even better. It also uses Easy Anti-Cheat, which is thankfully enabled for Linux platforms as noted <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on our anti-cheat page</a>.</p>
<p>With this new edition powered by Unreal Engine you get all post-launch content for the original including a bonus campaign act, multiplayer maps, characters and cosmetics. The controls have also been updated to be a bit more modern feeling. It adds in 4K assets, remastered textures, lighting, shadows and reflections. Along with ultrawide support, HDR, a benchmark mod, VRR, mouse and keyboard support, AMD FSR 3.1 and DLSS3.5 Super Resolution.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="VzJDY6V6C4s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b8bd562bb1c443f766ac30de600c2c67.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/VzJDY6V6C4s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some nice accessibility settings included in this release too including multiple screen narration options, flash reduction, changing between tapping and holding for button tap challenges and more.</p>
<p>An issue I did encounter on Steam Deck is trying to link my Microsoft account, which is required for cross-platform online play. It just repeatedly failed to contact the servers when entering the code on my PC or phone. You can still play online with other PC players without it though. However, doing a full proper restart of the Steam Deck did <em>eventually</em> allow the linking connection to succeed.</p>
<p>The same issue with account linking I saw on my Linux Desktop too, it just always gave an error about the connection. I tried many times, through many reloads and it just refused. However, adding this Steam launch option for it did enable it to actually work eventually on Desktop Linux:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">SteamDeck=1 %command%</code></p>
<p>Here's the results when running the built-in benchmark mode on a Steam Deck LCD (SteamOS Beta - Proton 9.0-4), with the default graphics settings where it does actually look pretty good:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17668094701756389804gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17668094701756389804gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18683846781756389805gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18683846781756389805gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>

<p>And for my Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 25.04 - Proton 9.0-4) running Ryzen 5800x and Radeon 6800 XT at 2560x1440 here's what performance you might expect:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9757177021756390704gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9757177021756390704gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13710145201756390706gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13710145201756390706gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7377975691756390706gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7377975691756390706gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>One important thing I will touch on here though are the reports about split-screen co-op from negative reviews and forum posts. It was actually originally advertised as having it on PC, but it does <em>not</em>. 15 days ago they removed the tags from Steam (thanks <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2523720/history/?changeid=30573436" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>) without a word, and a previous trailer on Steam noted it that has since been edited to remove it. Not a good look overall and not surprising players aren't happy about that.</p>
<p>Now we just need the sequels to get remasters so we can play through them all properly on PC. For now, we'll have to settle for the prequel in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/gears-of-war-e-day-announced-and-its-coming-to-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gears of War: E-Day</a> that will arrive eventually (no date yet).</p>
<p>Overall, if you're after an action-packed experience this is a great game to pick up. I hadn't played it since the original edition of the game on Xbox 360 so this was a nice upgrade!</p>

      <title>Quartet is a fresh retro-styled RPG out now with Linux and Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Four years after their successful crowdfunding, Quartet from developer Something Classic Games is out now with Linux support and now Steam Deck Verified. Valve checked it over on the Native Linux version to give it the Deck Verified / SteamOS Compatible rating.</p>
<p>A game for those of you who love the JRPG styled classics from the team that gave us Shadows of Adam back in 2017. Here's some more about it: "A series of train robberies leads to evidence of a government conspiracy. A mysterious deck of cards gives a young girl a vision of another world. A fleet of deadly airships burns a path across the Imperial frontier. The world’s unlikeliest hero manifests tremendous magical power. These stories intertwine in the world of Quartet. Before it is all over, the eight heroes will uncover how a secret, centuries-old conflict literally reshaped the world. Then they will have their own decision to make about the destiny of magic."</p>
<p>Check out the release trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="x1dtKybfyaE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/11eab8d9a90be8c736e1ab75e5a3c790.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/x1dtKybfyaE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Combat is fast-paced, turn-based, and full to the brim with TONS of special abilities to use. Each character and enemy turn are shown in the turn queue on the right, allowing the player to plan devastating and timely tactical strikes.</li>
<li>Players can unleash multiple elemental and physical abilities to exploit enemy weaknesses.</li>
<li>AP automatically regenerates after a hero's turn. So don't be stingy—spam those spells!</li>
<li>In Quartet, you control 4 characters on the front line, with the other 4 ready to jump into the action at any time. Ready to bring out your heavy-hitter or an emergency healer? Swap in seamlessly from the reserve party! Swapped-in characters take their turn immediately, with no penalty.</li>
<li>While characters are in the reserves, they also regenerate their ability points (AP) more rapidly, making swapping a crucial element of combat.</li>
<li>From the steampunk-inspired streets of Leornin to the forests on the barbarian frontier; from the cursed marshes of Tyche to the underworld warehouses of Seren, Quartet offers lots to explore.</li>
<li>Exploration is absolutely worth your while. With eight party members to equip, you need lots of gear, and a lot of it comes out of a treasure chest.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: currently at time of writing the GOG store only has the Windows version.</p>

      <title>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is Steam Deck Verified but requires internet even for single-player</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have now rated Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds as Steam Deck Verified ahead of release, but we also now know you need to always be online to play it.</p>
<p>Yep, even for single-player racing you'll need an internet connection which is not just for Steam Deck - all platforms and it's also shipping with Denuvo Anti-tamper. The Steam Deck rating came in early this morning, with Valve testing it against the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/proton-10-0-2d-beta-released-with-a-few-small-fixes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 10 Beta</a>. Since it's Verified for Steam Deck it's also SteamOS Compatible, and will work on other Linux systems.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21247495941756385576gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Forcing internet connections doesn't exactly make it very portable. A shame to see more games doing this.</p>
<p>Check out the original trailer below:</p>

      <title>eXtremeRate reveal new Steam Deck back shells with interchangeable back buttons</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>eXtremeRate emailed out an exciting new Steam Deck accessory. It's a new back shell design, with back buttons you can easily swap.</p>
<p>They're up for pre-order priced at either $29.99 or $31.99 depending on the colour you go for. The idea of buttons you can easily swap sounds good, as you might want different sizes on each of them depending on how you're going to use them, and how long your fingers are. And, the colours just look really cool too.</p>
<p>Colours include black, frosted white, clear, clear slate and clear atomic purple.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7156138951756381732gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Must admit, even though nowadays I don't really do any mods on either of my Steam Decks, this actually has me tempted. The colours look awesome, and I do love the button customization to make them just a little bit more comfortable for my tiny hands.</p>
<p>Check out their video on it below:</p>

<p>The only thing they haven't made clear is the release date. They say it's up for pre-order in the email to GamingOnLinux, their website says pre-order but they also say ready to ship with no dates listed. So — sometime soon.</p>

      <title>Blending classic Disney style animation with horror, Bye Sweet Carole releases in October</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oh yes, gimme! Bye Sweet Carole looks absolutely incredible with the way it uses a very classic Disney-style animation with horror game vibes. They've just announced that it's going to launch on October 9th!</p>
<p>From developer Little Sewing Machine, it was founded by acclaimed artist and director Chris Darril, creator of the Remothered series. What actually is it? Set in the early 1900s it's a chilling narrative-horror game inspired by classic animation movies. You follow the last known whereabouts of Carole Simmons to uncover the dark truth behind the Bunny Hall orphanage.</p>
<p>Check out the release date trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xakn5BBK77U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/69e4f87da45423d09959f0067720a3fa.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xakn5BBK77U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Embark on a horrific journey through a dark tale set in the austere Bunny Hall and the mesmerizing world of Corolla.</li>
<li>Immerse yourself in a hand-drawn universe brought to life using cinematographic techniques inspired by the greatest animated movies.</li>
<li>Shape-shift into a rabbit and harness your various forms to conquer the deadly challenges that await you.</li>
<li>Encounter a vibrant cast of characters, from your loyal friend Mr. Baesie to the malevolent owl Velenia and the terrifying Mr. Kyn.</li>
<li>A unique journey born from the union of 2 diametrically opposed genres: a traditional animated fairy tale, in the most typical tradition of the princesses from the world of cinematic animation, and a survival horror with old school platform elements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I really hope this one is as good to play as it looks. Anyone else seriously excited by this one?</p>

      <title>Demonschool has been delayed until November due to Hollow Knight: Silksong</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Hollow Knight: Silksong released date has pushed the developers and publisher of Demonschool to adjust their plans, with a big delay until November. Demonschool was originally due to launch September 3rd, but they've sent word that it's now going to be November 19th.</p>
<p>What is it? Demonschool is a new-style tactics RPG where motion equals action. Defeat big weirdos in between the human and demon worlds as Faye and her misfit companions, while navigating university life on a mysterious island.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14920454391756380278gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Here's the full statement from Brian Kwek of the publisher Ysbryd Games:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Demonschool was set to launch on Sept. 3, but after much anguished consideration on our part, we’ve made the decision to move the game’s release to Wednesday, Nov. 19, 2025.</p>
<p>With 11 years under our belt as an indie publisher, we at Ysbryd Games are reasonably qualified to say that any point of 2025, on balance, has been or will be as brutal as market conditions can get when it comes to releasing a game. Crueler still, that we should find out with such short notice that Hollow Knight: Silksong will launch just one day after our planned release for Demonschool.</p>
<p>We have to remind ourselves that gaining visibility for Demonschool is our main goal. Thus, the Ysbryd team strongly believes we would not be doing our game any favors by wading into waters we can clearly see are blood red. If the September period is going to be Silksong's moment, then we need to be elsewhere on the calendar to give Demonschool its own moment to be seen and talked about meaningfully.</p>
<p>We don’t take this decision lightly. Demonschool’s release has been delayed before, and we want to be clear: there are no more delays after this point. We’ve already distributed Steam keys to press as part of a healthy review program, and had every intention to proudly release on Sept 3. We hope fans who anticipated the game will forgive us for one final delay. </p>
<p>Between now and November, Necrosoft Games and ourselves will continue to pour our time into enhancing and polishing up the game experience. For example, there will be more endings and minigames that the developers originally planned to patch in post-release, rather than leave them on the cutting floor; now it’ll all be part of the game’s release in November.</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience and enthusiasm for Demonschool. We truly hope you continue to support Necrosoft Games’ labor of love by showing up for Faye and her madcap band of collegiate demon hunters on November 19th!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can't argue with any developer choosing to delay due to Silksong, it's going to be a huge release that sucks away time from a lot of gamers. </p>

      <title>The impressive app store Bazaar has arrived on Flathub</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's many ways to install apps on Linux and Bazaar might be one of the slickest, with a focus on Flatpak and Flathub. First highlighted here on GamingOnLinux back in July <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/bazzite-gets-a-new-app-store-newly-supported-devices-improved-wifi-and-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">when it was added to Bazzite</a>. Since then, the developers have continued expanding it and now it's looking really good.</p>
<p>Even easier to install now too, as it's directly available on <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/io.github.kolunmi.Bazaar" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16859298371756379450gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16859298371756379450gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>While it's primarily designed for GNOME desktops, I've been running it on KDE Plasma and it all looks rather good. Fits in quite nicely still. Especially if your main source of apps is Flatpak, this is a really sleek alternative to the bigger few like GNOME Software and KDE Discover.</p>
<p>The code is up on <a href="https://github.com/kolunmi/bazaar" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>The popular Linux distro CachyOS has a big upgrade and some fun stuff for gamers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>CachyOS is a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/steam-survey-for-july-2025-shows-linux-approaching-3/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">popular choice for Linux gamers</a> based on Arch Linux (like SteamOS is too), and the <a href="https://cachyos.org/blog/2508-august-release/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">August update</a> brings some big new features.</p>
<p>One interesting thing for gamers is their Proton-CachyOS, their own version of Valve's Proton to run Windows games on Linux that has various extras applied to it. With the latest CachyOS update they expanded the options available for it. Taken from the release notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Proton-CachyOS</strong> received several new features: a <strong>DLSS version upgrader</strong> and an option to <strong>force the latest preset</strong>. <strong>XeSS</strong> now has a similar version-upgrade feature. We’ve also made improvements for <strong>PhysX</strong>, and the required <strong>NVIDIA libraries</strong> are now bundled. On <strong>RDNA3</strong> GPUs, you can easily enable <strong>FSR 4</strong> with <code class="inline-code">PROTON_FSR4_RDNA3_UPGRADE</code>; this downloads the FSR4 library and sets the necessary variables automatically. <strong>NTSync</strong> can now be used with Proton-CachyOS by setting <code class="inline-code">PROTON_USE_NTSYNC</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They've also introduced a new packages website, so you can check out what packages they're currently shipping. They've also updated the GRUB boot loader to automatically enable snapshots with the Btrfs file system, NVIDIA support was tweaked to enable S0ix sleep to provide low-power standby and their fork of arch-update with Cachy-Update is now available to give you a system tray indicator for available updates from official repositories and the AUR.</p>

<p>Little Kitty, Big City is a thoroughly wholesome adventure game from Double Dagger Studio with fantastic reviews and now it's even bigger. The game is Steam Deck Verified and has a Platinum rating on ProtonDB, so no matter the Linux system you're on - you're good to go.</p>

      <title>Fantastic co-op game PEAK gets Steam Deck Verified with the latest updates</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PEAK is <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/co-op-climbing-game-peak-is-a-truly-great-time-with-friends/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my current favourite online co-op game</a> to play with a good little crew, and now it fits a lot better on Steam Deck too thanks to updates.</p>
<p>What is it? PEAK is a co-op game about climbing. You and friends live through a plane crash and end up stranded. So now you have to climb your way through various different biomes, each with their own hazards, as you collect items from luggage spread all over the place. It's incredibly funny with the right people.</p>
<p>The problem is - the controller support has been a little on the funky side, at times just not quite working correctly. However, earlier this month a big new update launched for it adding a new biome and new items. This and some following patches improved the controller support and text on Steam Deck too. So now, Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/proton-10-0-2d-beta-released-with-a-few-small-fixes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the latest Proton 10 Beta</a>.</p>

      <title>No Man&#39;s Sky Voyagers free update released with modular Corvette ships you build yourself</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hello Games launched another huge free update for the open world space survival game No Man's Sky, with a big new Corvette ship class you piece together.</p>
<p>Corvettes are a modular customizable multi-crew ship, so you can finally get up and walk around along with being able to bring you friends with you. These Corvettes can be outfitted with lots of different rooms and cockpits to make it a proper home away from home, along with a special mission radar for multi-crew missions. And, you can even get out and float around in space if that's your thing.</p>
<p>There's also a graphics upgrade for translucent surfaces like glass, NVIDIA DLSS4 support was added, there's new localised character lighting and so much more. With the Corvettes you can even park up somewhere up high in the atmosphere, and skydive out of it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qHZLz1MW0aE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cd79438401f6e1f5cdab17f6b46e36b6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qHZLz1MW0aE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Simply incredible, I can't believe how much they're still adding to No Man's Sky all these years later. The amount of different features it has for players going solo or in groups is now pretty amazing.</p>
<p>There's also a "Deep Dive" video below narrated by Sean Murray, who just casually drops in a little info about their next game Light No Fire and how the tech is being developed for both games.</p>

      <title>Brutal survival game Vintage Story gets another huge update, plus work on an Adventure Mode announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vintage Story has some of the most interesting game mechanics I've seen in a survival game, but it's a little brutal - so I'm keen for this new Adventure Mode.</p>
<p>After the news a few months ago about the game Hytale being cancelled, the developers of Vintage Story <a href="https://www.vintagestory.at/blog.html/news/hytale-fans-you-are-very-welcome-here-r412/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted how</a> they were inviting developers to come work for them. This led to <a href="https://www.vintagestory.at/blog.html/news/vintage-story-adventure-mode-r413/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">another post</a> in July talking about how they now plan to make an Adventure Mode for Vintage Story, although they haven't settled on a name yet.</p>
<p>For the latest big update to Vintage Story it adds in lots of new ocean content including 33 new fish, coral reefs and large waves. They've also improved clouds, added a bunch of new blocks, you can now tame and ride Elk, healing items now gradually heal instead of being instant, a player revive system for multiplayer was added, various story adjustments, you can now name your sailboat and attach shields and <a href="https://www.vintagestory.at/blog.html/news/v1210-story-chapter-2-redux-stable-r420/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">lots more</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wsyy8pziGLI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c0f2f5e19007effe97e40de6ee29b4cd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wsyy8pziGLI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They've also disabled purchasing on their <a href="https://tyronx.itch.io/vintage-story" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">itch.io page</a>, so now you have to get it direct (it's not on Steam or other stores). They claim that itch.io haven't paid them "for over 3 months". In their Discord, the Vintage Story developers expanded on this and said itch are "withholding a six figure sum of our revenue share".</p>

      <title>Helldivers 2 will send you deep underground in the next major update on September 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As if the Halo ODST crossover for Helldivers 2 wasn't enough, now we're actually going underground too on Terminid Hive Worlds. Now I'm really excited and will absolutely have to get some hours back into this, which was a struggle before since Dune: Awakening practically took over my life for a while.</p>
<p>These Hive Worlds have been terraformed by the Terminids, with vast cave networks we'll need to dive into. And, since you're underground, no Super Destroyer to help you. This is all about the Gloom, the thick fog that covers the Hive Worlds which has also mutated the Terminids so there will be some new threats too.</p>
<p>Some new types of missions will come with the update too like escorting a mobile oil rig, which sounds just a little like Deep Rock Galactic. There will also be another new Premium Warbond with a bunch of new gear to unlock.</p>

      <title>iRacing announce they&#39;re developing an official INDYCAR game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>iRacing just announced a partnership with INDYCAR to develop an official game that will release sometime in 2026.</p>
<p>And just like iRacing did for the recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/iracing-arcade-announced-and-its-basically-circuit-superstars-2-with-licensed-cars-and-tracks/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement of iRacing Arcade in the trailer</a>, they seem to be keeping the Steam Deck as a firm target with the logo clearly displayed in their main press image.</p>
<p>We don't exactly know a whole lot about this one right now as it has only just been announced. They have said it will include a robust, multilevel career mode, licensed drivers from the NTT INDYCAR SERIES and INDY NXT by Firestone, and online multiplayer. One little fun tidbit though is that it's being made with an enhanced version of the Orontes engine, which iRacing acquired <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/orontes-games-creator-of-drag-gets-acquired-by-iracing/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">when they bought Orontes Games</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1039515801756289363gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.iracing.com/iracing-studios-to-produce-standalone-indycar-video-game-in-2026/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>:</p>
<p>“INDYCAR fans have long been clamoring for a standalone title for consoles, and we’re excited to give them what they’re looking for in 2026,” said Tony Gardner, president, iRacing.com Motorsport Simulations. “iRacing Studios’ standalone INDYCAR title will offer all the excitement of the NTT INDYCAR SERIES and an immersive experience that fans of all ages can enjoy. We are already very excited about how the game is coming together.”</p>
<p>“The most competitive and challenging racing on the planet deserves a dedicated and widely available gaming experience,” said INDYCAR President J. Douglas Boles. “iRacing Studios is the ideal partner for us, trusted and known to our core fans and ready to share our sport with a wider and highly engaged audience.”</p>

      <title>Bazzite adds support for Ayaneo 3 and the AOKZOE A1X with work towards MSI Claw A8 and Legion Go 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bazzite, the next generation of Linux gaming, has released a new build with lots of upgrades and support for more PC gaming handhelds.</p>
<p>Newly supported in this release are the Ayaneo 3 and the AOKZOE A1X. For the Ayaneo 3, all that's missing is support for extra modules as they're waiting to get them so support should improve in future. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6138665991756288009gol1.png"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Ayaneo 3</em></p>
<p>The fun doesn't stop there though for this Linux system as Bazzite also has preliminary support for the MSI Claw A8 and the Lenovo Legion Go 2. On top of that all MSI Claw handhelds got an update to "improve controller after resume functionality and dual booting with Windows".</p>
<p>Even more with OLED devices like the OneXPlayer F1 Pro/EVA-1, Zotac Zone, and Ayaneo 3 receiving a patch to fix the screen turning off while adjusting the brightness. The Asus Z13 (2025) model is also now fully supported.</p>
<p>So much more on top of improved device support. The Handheld Daemon tool gained the ability to work with external controllers, they've improved Bazzite boot speed, along with some general performance improvements for gaming for all users.</p>
<p>See all in their <a href="https://universal-blue.discourse.group/t/back-to-school-update-ayaneo-3-aokzoe-a1x-framework-desktop-performance-boot-time-improvements-bazaar-update/10520" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update post</a> and the <a href="https://bazzite.gg/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">official site</a>.</p>

      <title>The new Framework Laptop 16 brings AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series and modular GPU upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Framework just revealed the new Framework Laptop 16, which brings CPU and GPU upgrades to their popular modular laptop. This is probably one of the most exciting laptop hardware companies around, especially now with modular GPU upgrades possible.</p>
<p>Pre-orders are open now with you being able to configure the new Framework Laptop 16 with the Ryzen AI 7 350 or <br/>
Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 along with the new option for the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 or AMD Radeon RX 7700S. Pricing starts at £1,499 for the DIY edition and £1,799 for the pre-built version.</p>
<p>From their <a href="https://frame.work/gb/en/blog/introducing-the-new-framework-laptop-16-with-nvidia" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve spent the last two years working with the teams at AMD, NVIDIA, and Compal to not only make a new NVIDIA-powered Graphics Module, but also make it fully backwards compatible with the original Framework Laptop 16. That means any current owner can pick up the new module and get the latest generation of graphics!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They're really beginning to show other hardware vendors how it's done. Enabling you to keep updating your existing hardware, instead of forcing you to buy an entirely new machine.</p>
<p>For the refresh they've also revamped the thermal system, along with upgrading the display to support NVIDIA G-SYNC. The AMD GPU was also refreshed with an updated thermal system. There's more too they also announced a new compact 240W USB-C adapter supporting the USB-PD 3.1 spec.</p>
<p>For the original Framework Laptop 16 they're reducing the price and keeping the Ryzen 7 versions in production as a lower cost option.</p>

      <title>Atari acquires the rights to five classic Ubisoft titles</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Atari are continuing to acquire more IP and now they've managed to pull a bunch of games away from Ubisoft. They only just <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/atari-set-to-acquire-82-of-thunderful-group-ab-as-thunderful-announce-theyre-restructuring/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently acquired most of Thunderful Group AB</a>.</p>
<p>In the press release it's noticed Atari have acquired all intellectual property rights for Cold Fear (2005), I Am Alive (2012), Child of Eden (2011), Grow Home (2015), and Grow Up (2016). Atari plans to re-release the titles under their own publishing label and they're looking at "updated formats, new content, and extended distribution channels".</p>
<p>“Millions of players have experienced these worlds over the years, and this will open the door for long time players to revisit those memories while inviting new audiences to discover them for the first time,” said Deborah Papiernik, Vice President of New Business. “Atari has a rich gaming legacy and deep appreciation for these classic titles, we’re excited to see how they’ll evolve and connect with players in fresh, meaningful ways.”</p>
<p>“Ubisoft and Atari both have a legacy of crafting worlds that players can fall in love with — games that resonate with generations of players not just for how they played, but for how they made us feel,” said Wade Rosen, Chairman and CEO of Atari. “We’re excited to reintroduce these titles while also exploring ways to expand and evolve these franchises.”</p>

      <title>Match Shot Chimera blends together a shoot &#39;em up with clever match-3 mechanics</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Match-3 and blow everything up in Match Shot Chimera, a unique fusion of two rather different genres of games into something fun. There's a demo now available which has Native Linux support, and the developer recently confirmed that it will be releasing September 9th.</p>
<p>Some more info about it: "Match Shot Chimera is a match-3 shoot 'em up with roguelite elements. Match-3 to deal big damage and collect XP for leveling up your chimera's abilities, all while dodging a wild array of enemies and bullets! Unlock persistent upgrades and unlock new characters to try different play-styles and get further on your next run."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7wZxwnAUW-g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/26e25be27444646e0c145e5e2304088a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7wZxwnAUW-g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Vertical shoot 'em up gameplay</strong> - Dodge through a bullet hell while powering up your weapons to bring down massive and bizarre match-block filled bosses.</p>
<p><strong>Match-3 to make enemies go boom </strong>- Enemies drop colored puzzle blocks. Match-3 to blow things up and get XP.</p>
<p><strong>Varied Upgrades</strong> - From exploding shot, new bullet patterns, and healing puzzle matches to shooting fatter, slower bullets, there are plenty of different upgrades to make your chimera's next build unique.</p>
<p><strong>Different weapons for every block color</strong> - Hold different blocks to shoot beam weapons, exploding bomb shot, homing missiles, and more. Switch at will to change weapons, match colors, and use your powers.Varied</p>
<p><strong>Multiple characters - </strong>Choose from multiple chimeras with different powers, stats and weapons. Focus-fire, drop shields, launch drones, and more!</p>
<p><strong>Randomized Levels - </strong>Varied levels are generated from hand-crafted blocks full of hand-tested randomizations. Each level has a different style, and is populated with a different pool of enemies, mini-bosses and bosses.</p>
<p><strong>Play again and again</strong> - Tough shoot 'em up gameplay and bullet dodging will demand skill and quick thinking.  But dying is just the beginning of another run where you can try again with different builds and strategies.</p>
<p><strong>Persistent Upgrades </strong>- Collect ichor during runs and save up to upgrade your abilities, unlock new characters and change the structure of the levels themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Controller support</strong> - Fluid controls support just about any joypad you can plug in, or keyboards! Mice, too, if you're into that.</p>
<p><strong>Original Soundtrack</strong> - A sweet suite of squelchy crunching beats, custom-made to blast to.</p>

      <title>Moonlight Pulse is a metroidvania set inside an immense interstellar organism now with a Linux version</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Set inside an immense interstellar organism, Moonlight Pulse looks like a fun metroidvania and recently it gained a Native Linux version. It was originally released back in April 2024, and now has an overall Very Positive rating on Steam.</p>
<p>More about it: "Team up, learn new abilities and explore a surreal world in this seamless 2D platforming adventure set within the body of a colossal spacefaring turtle. Traverse flowing veins, sparking neurons, and gastric hazards as the world itself breathes around you. Join the heroic Curative Agents, who fight to protect this strange sanctuary from a swarm of ever-hungry interstellar parasites."</p>
<p>Check out the original release trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="x3wgSRdHqq4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3b6db46b2cc60027eff1c84a233192d9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/x3wgSRdHqq4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A Team of Heroes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Strategically <strong>switch between characters in an instant</strong> to make use of their <strong>unique combat and movement abilities</strong>.</li>
<li>Unlock new powers as you take a starring role in each character's ongoing story.</li>
<li>Nobody gets left behind! The game ends when any character falls, but <strong>characters can rescue each other when they’re in danger</strong>!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A Living World</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Journey through the lungs, stomach and heart of Aorasque, an immense interstellar organism.</li>

<p>For this one the developers recommend you play with a controller. Valve actually rated it Steam Deck Verified back in April 2025, although that was using Proton since it was before the Native Linux build existed.</p>

      <title>Half-Life: Cross Product Multiplayer gets a Steam release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Half-Life: Cross Product Multiplayer is a free mod for Half-Life that's basically a big overhaul of HLDM (Half-Life Deathmatch) and now it's now on Steam. They regularly upgrade it with new maps, game modes and more. It even has Native Linux support too.</p>
<p>The Steam release arrived with an updated "Season 9" which brings a lot of upgrades, including controller support with Steam Input and also Steam Workshop support now too. They're planning a "Season 10" update for later this year with "new maps, new modes, and new surprises". They're also working on their own single-player campaign to eventually release.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5083113131756124553gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>As for why you may want to play it? They explained in the release announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you've ever wished HLDM had more variety and Quality-of-Life, or you enjoyed arena games and mods of the era like Unreal Tournament, Quake 3, and Adrenaline Gamer, this is for you. Some highlights include but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Adaptive gamemode system </strong>with CTF support across almost every map.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Social &amp; competitive gamemodes such as Snipers, Arcade, SWAT, GOAT, CTF, Domination, One In the Chamber, and more to come in Season 10.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gameplay enhancements </strong>- shield regeneration, soundtrack, and modern viewbobbing - some major, some subtle things, all from the internal developments made to the campaign.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Refined classic maps </strong>such as Crossfire &amp; Datacore - with in-universe lore adaptations, quality enhancements, details, smoother lighting, and more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Steam Workshop support </strong>for maps &amp; other addons like sounds, music, and playermodels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Aura SDK Toolkit </strong>(Harbinger, Spectra, Tessera, Helix, Sapien) for creators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Open-source community-driven codebase </strong>(Aura)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Seasonal updates </strong>- we're currently in Season 9, and Season 10 is in the works.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Native Linux support</strong></li>
</ul>

      <title>KDE Plasma 6.5 gains an OEM ready system setup tool and KDE Linux is progressing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The next release of KDE Plasma is due in October and the developers have been working non-stop on some great new features for the popular desktop.</p>
<p>In the most recent <a href="https://blogs.kde.org/2025/08/23/this-week-in-plasma-kde-initial-system-setup/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">This Week in Plasma post</a>, developer Nate Graham mentioned the new "KISS" tool which stands for KDE Initial System Setup. Something I'm really surprised they didn't have before. It's a way for users to set up their account properly on a computer with KDE Plasma installed, but the install was not done by them (like buying from system builders).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7495854081756123384gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7495854081756123384gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9878793011756123386gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9878793011756123386gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Hopefully with features like this actually in, we're making progress towards more systems shipping with Plasma.</p>
<p>You might also notice in the first shot above, at the bottom it says "KDE Linux". That's because the KDE team are also working on an Arch-based "next-generation operating system showcasing KDE's software". It's nowhere near ready though, but the <a href="https://kde.org/linux/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">placeholder website</a> is live. It's also a bit more like SteamOS and Bazzite, with it having an immutable base where main upgrades replace the system and you install other apps via things like Flatpak.</p>
<p>I'm keen to see what they come up with when it's actually properly ready.</p>

      <title>Retro x86-based machine emulator 86Box v5.0 brings a new integrated machine manager</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>86Box is a low level x86 emulator that runs older operating systems and software, with a big new release out to make managing multiple systems easier.</p>
<p>Version 5.0 brings a new integrated machine manager, which they said is one of the most requested additions of all time for the project. While there are third-party apps to manage it, now for most people this should get the job done. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20883128251756122862gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20883128251756122862gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>There's a number of other enhancements in this release like mouse input and display output are now much smoother, they completely reworked the OpenGL Core rendering system with multiple shaders and support for configuring shaders through the user interface, there's support for a few more retro machines, support was added for emulating more proprietary CD-ROM drives plus various UI enhancements throughout.</p>

      <title>Bottles devs give more info on their funding from NLnet</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently the Bottles team announced they've been <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/bottles-app-for-running-windows-apps-games-on-linux-gets-ngi-zero-commons-funding/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">granted funding by NLnet NGI Zero Commons</a> and now they've given more detail on what it means.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://usebottles.com/posts/2025-08-16-bottles-and-nlnet/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">new post</a> they clarify they haven't actually received anything yet as it now goes through a planning stage to define what budget they will be given and how it will be spent. Additionally, this funding is for Bottles Next, their total rework of the app and not for maintenance on the current Bottles app.</p>
<p>With that in mind the developers mention it "doesn't mean Bottles is financially secure", as the current existing Bottles app is still funded purely by donations. And, once Bottles Next is available, it will too "live on donations from the community" as while the funding they will eventually get from NLnet "is a huge support" it's finite.</p>
<p>Since the news of the funding broke they said they've "seen donations decline, especially recurring ones" which is a shame and note that "The funds don’t cover servers, maintenance, or running costs. And without direct support, the risk is that Bottles will be overshadowed before Next is ready".</p>
<p>They also said they're working on a fresh update on the progress of Bottles Next and how development is going.</p>

      <title>Open source evolution sim Thrive adds planet customization</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Open source evolution sim Thrive version 0.8.3 brings in some more customization in how you play, along with new additions to the gameplay. Just like playing the early stages of the classic game Spore, except with a lot more science behind it.</p>
<p>Now when you start a game you can actually tweak even more of it with planet customization, some of which can drastically change your play-through. Control things like world size, temperature, oceanic coverage, geological activity, climate instability and more options are planned to be added.</p>
<p>They've also added a set of achievements, various refinements to balancing and the Multicellular Stage prototype has seen some love too. On top of that they've added a new hydrogenosome organelle, a microbe movement ripple effect and more.</p>

<p>Thrive is free and open source, but you can buy it from stores to support the development. It has Native Linux support and Valve rated it Steam Deck Playable / SteamOS Compatible.</p>

      <title>Tomb Raider I and Tomb Raider II open source re-implementations updated with new graphics options</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The TRX project that brings an open-source reimplementation of Tomb Raider 1 and Tomb Raider 2 has big new releases out now. It's split into two with TR1X for Tomb Raider I and TR2X for Tomb Raider 2 but they share a lot of the changes.</p>
<p>Amazing project to preserve more classic games and give them a fresh life, even with official modern ports it's nice to see open source still. You will need to official classic games for the data files to play with TRX which you can grab from <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/tomb_raider_123" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=Core%20Design" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>The update for Tomb Raider 2 is especially big on graphics rendering changes bringing options for round shadows, skyboxes, brightness, anisotropy and vertical sync along with other general visual improvements. There's also upgrades to photo mode, along with additions to gameplay mechanics like an option to allow Lara to jump up or back when hanging from a ledge.</p>
<p>You can see their overview videos on each update below:</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 10-13 released with video fixes for various games and new options</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The community compatibility layer GE-Proton for Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck version 10-13 brings fixes for videos on various games with some new options.</p>
<p>Be sure to see <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my explainer on the different Proton versions</a> and my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-ge-proton-on-steam-deck-steamos-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">guide to install GE-Proton</a> to get started with it. Usually, you don't need GE-Proton unless it has some specific fix not available in Valve's official Proton.</p>
<p>All that's new in this release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>intro video playback fixed in Resident Evil 7</li>
<li>intro video playback fixed in Resident Evil 8<font color="#e0e0e0"><strong> (Editor Note: <em>they mean </em></strong></font><em><strong>Resident Evil Village)</strong></em></li>
<li>Upside down cinema video playback fixed in Sky: Children of the Light</li>
<li>Upside down video playback fixed in Akiba's Trip: Undead &amp; Undressed</li>
<li>Two new environment variable options added:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code class="inline-code">PROTON_MEDIA_USE_GST=1</code> will tell proton to use the winegstreamer backend instead of the default winedmo backend (the winedmo backend was introduced in Proton 10 and is the current preferred video playback method). This can be useful for games with videos that may have worked in Proton 9 but regressed in Proton 10.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code class="inline-code">PROTON_GST_VIDEO_ORIENTATION=<orientation></orientation></code> can be any of the following: <code class="inline-code">vertical-flip</code>, <code class="inline-code">horizontal-flip</code>, <code class="inline-code">rotate-180</code>, <code class="inline-code">automatic</code>. This is useful if some games have videos that are upside down or otherwise not oriented correctly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Example usage: <code class="inline-code">PROTON_GST_VIDEO_ORIENTATION=vertical-flip</code>. If you set PROTON_GST_VIDEO_ORIENTATION it will also automatically force the winegstreamer backend to be used, as manual orientation is not possible with winedmo.</p>
<ul>
<li>protonfix added to restore sound in One Piece Pirate Warriors</li>
<li>protonfix added to fix 40k Dawn of War Definitive Edition multiplayer</li>
<li>protonfix added for GOG version of 40k Dawn of War Definitive Edition</li>
<li>wine-wayland em-10 patches updated and rebased</li>
<li>wine updated to latest bleeding edge</li>
<li>dxvk updated to latest git</li>
<li>vkd3d-proton updated to latest git</li>
<li>upstream proton fixes imported</li>
</ul>

      <title>CARGO blends off-roading with an action-focused Mad Max like delivery sim</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>CARGO is not your usual delivery sim. Blending together off-roading co-op madness in a post-apocalyptic world.</p>
<p>They really, badly, need to come up with a better name though. The full name of the game is "CARGO: Co-Op Delivery Simulator in Post Apocalyptic World" and uh — that's a ridiculous mouthful. There's already various games named some form of Cargo, so back to the drawing board with the naming.</p>
<p>Aside from that, love the idea of this. Mixing together elements of SnowRunner, Mad Max / Twisted Metal and more into something that really could be a lot of fun. Their initial announcement trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NC77q9xiJBM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6c15c68882c64d7e406b032dba315efb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NC77q9xiJBM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview.</strong> CARGO is a post-apocalyptic off-road autosim about moving critical supplies between survivors. Play solo or form <strong>4-player co-op</strong> convoys. Roles can be split (driver/defense/scout/utility); players can share seats (incl. mounted turrets) or bring separate vehicles into the same session.</li>
<li><strong>Driving &amp; Terrain.</strong> Physics-driven handling with meaningful setup impact: vehicle weight, tires, traction, suspension, engine, differentials. Biomes include cracked highways, deep mud, radiation zones, and sand-choked dunes.</li>
<li><strong>Encounters (PvE).</strong> Hostile raiders attempt to disable the rig and steal cargo. Choose when to evade, reroute, or fight; delivery failure is tied to cargo loss.</li>
<li><strong>Vehicles.</strong> Customization and restoration define cars for combat, capacity, speed, or traversal. Swap tires/engines, add armor and defensive/offensive tools, expand trunk capacity. Progression unlocks new options; some upgrades are vehicle-specific. Derelict vehicles can be discovered and rebuilt piece by piece.</li>
<li><strong>Meta Progression.</strong> Start from a small garage and expand base facilities to unlock trading, new delivery types, restoration options, and eventually settlement-scale operations.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Jump Space (formerly Jump Ship) arrives September 19 for co-op PvE spaceship fun</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Jump Space (formerly Jump Ship) actually looks incredible if you're in the market for a new co-op game and it arrives September 19th. It already works well on Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck from previous demos, and the developers said they will be working on improving Steam Deck performance with Proton.</p>
<p>Check out their two brand new videos:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="skSL_3-3Hb8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/00a481a51a54c05035f98671a204fc46.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/skSL_3-3Hb8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Jump across the universe</strong> - Select from a variety of hand crafted missions with random elements. No two runs will be exactly the same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Seamlessly go on and off ship</strong> - Once you’ve jumped with your ship, you can switch seamlessly between operating your ship, space walking and on-foot planetary exploration, it just works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Upgrade, maintain, repair</strong> - Manage your ship as you scavenge for parts to upgrade or repair it, and adapt it to fit your needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fly with a crew, or go solo</strong> - Jump Space is best enjoyed with friends, but solo adventurers are welcome too.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Manage Your Jump Ship</strong></p>
<p>Upgrade and customise your ship as you face off against the challenges of space exploration, and scavenge resources to ensure your survival. Reinforce your defences, adjust your energy output for speed or bolster your ship’s attack capabilities - the choice is yours.</p>
<p><strong>Immerse Yourself in Space</strong></p>
<p>Experience fluid gameplay as you switch from steering your ship out of an asteroid field to jetpacking towards an enemy vessel to sabotage its core. Seamlessly transition between exploration, combat and traversal.</p>
<p><strong>Improvise and Adapt; Together</strong></p>
<p>Go on missions with your friends and take on roles, from piloting to engineering and field exploration. Work together to overcome enemy attacks, extinguish fires on the command deck or adjust your ship’s power grid on the fly. There are no set classes in Jump Space, improvise and decide how you want to engage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And now onto the bit that annoys me. Scroll down on Steam to see an AI notice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The developers describe how their game uses AI Generated Content like this:</p>
<p>Pre-generated voice cloning/Text-To-Speech where it makes sense creatively.<br/>
Placeholders will be replaced by real voice acting as development continues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At least in this case, they do plan to put in real voice acting later.</p>

      <title>Let&#39;s Build a Dungeon sounds like such a fun idea as it hits 140,000 Steam wishlists</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm too stupid to make a game, but a game about managing a game studio building an MMORPG? Oh yeah, Let's Build a Dungeon sounds like my jam.</p>
<p>Seriously, Let's Build a Dungeon actually has such a fun sounding idea to it. Because it's not a management game like you would expect. Built by Springloaded, who also made the cute Let's Build a Zoo. You get to build up  a full game in what they say is a "true-to-life and ridiculous simulation of the games industry". Manage staff and development schedules, build up the actual world itself and eventually…you even get to play your own game.</p>
<p>All of that while you sit back sipping a cola without the worry of a publisher suddenly running out on you.</p>
<p>Check out their brand new overview trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="w9x1hGEJ-hw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/45fc193bc2bfc1af95a8e11bf1e55ad0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/w9x1hGEJ-hw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Design and build your very own MMO world, fit to be filled by hordes of virtual players</li>
<li>Manage the day-to-day running of your game studio, from hiring and firing to keeping your investors happy</li>
<li>Attract new virtual players to your MMO masterpiece by expanding your world, designing new quests and monitoring player journeys</li>
<li>Progress through the campaign to develop new items, environments and mechanics that bring your ideas to life</li>
<li>Playtest your RPG at any time to see the world through the eyes of a player</li>
<li>Mix-and-match quest styles for endless replayability</li>
<li>Customise using thousands of items, or design your own</li>
<li>Negotiate tough conversations with shareholders, staff, players and publishers to make meaningful choices that will impact the direction of your studio.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Deep Dish Dungeon looks like a great co-op dungeon crawler</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Deep Dish Dungeon is a recent announcement from publisher Raw Fury, a dungeon crawler with an emphasis on exploration and player ingenuity. Playable solo or in online co-op, the trailer sold me pretty quickly with the overall theme of it.</p>
<p>Developed by Behold Studios who also made Chroma Squad, Knights of Pen and Paper and more games. As the name alludes, cooking a good hearty meal is a big part of the gameplay here. From Steam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deep Dish Dungeon is a dungeon crawler and exploration game that rewards curiosity and resourcefulness. In an atmospheric environment, explore corridors, rooms and passageways solo or with up to three friends, and gather resources to improve your camping site. Craft tools and cook nourishing meals to bolster strength throughout the journey, and unravel the enigma that lies within the shadows.</p>
<p>Forage and scavenge as you traverse through the dungeon's bountiful depths. Between your journeys, return to camp and plan your next steps by the fire. Use the resources you find to craft new tools and cook a hearty meal. Remember that food is progress: over time, unlock recipes that have different effects on your stats.</p>

      <title>Hollow Knight: Silksong is now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/hollow-knight-silksong-releases-september-4/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hollow Knight: Silksong now finally having a release date</a>, Valve have managed to test it early and given it a Steam Deck Verified rating. It's also rated as SteamOS Compatible, since anything that runs on Steam Deck should run on other SteamOS systems unless they have silly <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat</a> (which this of course does not).</p>
<p>Interestingly, Valve's rating is actually using the Native Linux version of the game and not Proton. As you can see in the details on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1030300/info/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>. Nice to see another exciting release actually having full Linux support.</p>
