      <title>Selaco hits 70,000 copies sold with a big update live and sale now on</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Altered Orbit Studios have done well with Selaco. They just announced some stats, along with a brand new update and a sale live now. <em>See also: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/selaco-is-now-in-early-access-one-of-the-best-shooters-ive-played-in-forever/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my original thoughts on the Early Access release</a>.</em></p>
<p>From the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1592280/view/4286950670137685546" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> they've now hit 70,000 sales with an overall Very Positive rating on Steam from 2,500 players. Pretty great for their first game! To celebrate it's 20% off until September 6 at 6PM UTC, plus their "most significant patch to date" is up now.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9783730131725043697gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The main update highlights include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Lots of Quality of Life improvements, including backpack reloading, 'Last Weapon' button and more.</li>
<li>Added Smart Ammo Pickups.</li>
<li>Adjustable difficulty during a campaign.</li>
<li>Improvements to immersion.</li>
<li>Reworked Mutator menu with 3 new mutators.</li>
<li>AI Improvements.</li>
<li>Stagger Rework.</li>
<li>Weapon and enemy balance changes.</li>
<li>Further improved level design.</li>
<li>Vastly improved soundscape with more ambient noises, reworked sound effects, and more.</li>
<li>Rain reworks.</li>
<li>Fan Art Kit.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Reading through it properly, they really have done quite a lot! To the point that it probably already feels like a much better game (I haven't had time to re-test yet). Really looking forward to jumping back in with the vast array of improvements, seems like a lot of things people have been asking for.</p>
<p>What's coming next sounds equally as exciting with the randomizer mode that has "gotten a little out of hand and has become a much bigger project than originally intended". Plus, more story content to come too which will be great to see it continue.</p>
<p>Selaco has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Dungeon Divers is a dungeon-themed take on Minesweeper that gets complicated</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What do you get when you cross Minesweeper with a sort-of dungeon crawler? Well Dungeon Divers is pretty much the answer to that. <em>Note: key provided to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4218320-GamingOnLinux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our Steam Curator</a>.</em></p>
<p>A turn based roguelike puzzle game inspired by Minesweeper is not something I expect to come across recently but here it is. More: "As the newest dungeon diver, you are tasked with clearing out derelict dungeons to make it safe for adventurers. Armed with your wits and some trusty items clear out all of the deadly traps as you travel to the dungeon core and defuse it entirely."</p>
<p>You have to hand it to smaller indie devs, they always find a way to take something and make it their own. And Dungeon Divers definitely comes across quite unique. This is far away from being the first to take Minesweeper and mash it into something, with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/08/minesweeper-but-its-a-rogue-lite-with-tons-of-features-demoncrawl-is-out-for-linux-pc/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DemonCrawl</a> being one I got hooked on a while ago. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JRvvHif2o7Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f064c10fdb3b84e03b7e7a4bc537d97a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JRvvHif2o7Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Test Your Wits: </strong>With nearly a dozen different types of rooms to disarm each with their own conditions, quirks, and logic to solve what starts off as a simple task will become increasingly complex and difficult to decipher. Choose carefully as you only have a finite number of tries before your mission is deemed a failure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Arsenal At Your Disposal:</strong> As you progress through the dungeon you're clearing, objects of power may be uncovered to assist in your journey. Some simply help you survive mistakes, other may grant you the ability to uncover vital clues for your efforts, and some grant you extra riches. Choose wisely as you can only carry so many artifacts at once.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Every Dungeon Is Different:</strong> No two dungeons share the same layout. Procedural generation means that every delve is different providing countless hours of entertainment as you clear level after level. A host of challenge dungeons provide unique opportunities for interesting and complex puzzles.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If you like the sound of a logic puzzler that blends dungeon-crawling (sort of) with Minesweeper then check it out.</p>

      <title>Mechabellum, my favourite auto-battling strategy game launches September 26</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ah, auto battlers, at one point they seemed like they would be all the rage, but most quickly moved on. Mechabellum thankfully, feels a bit different, and quickly became a real favourite and it's set to leave Early Access on September 26. <em>Disclosure: my key was originally sent by TriplePoint PR.</em></p>
<p>I think what really makes Mechabellum good is the actual action. I mean sure, you're not directing units manually like an RTS, but the explosive destruction when the battle gets going is just pure joy to watch. Unless the destruction is happening to you that is. Just look at these shots I took just today (click them to see bigger):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/452625471725029725gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/452625471725029725gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3210448621725029727gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3210448621725029727gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>From the email that went out the full release will bring in new unit techs, specialists, and a seasonal system with rewards, with more content planned for the future. </p>
<p class="plain-list-title">1.0 Release Update:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch of Season 1, including earnable rewards such as skins</li>
<li>Introduction of new unit techs and specialists</li>
<li>Balancing adjustments, optimization improvements, and bug fixes</li>
<li>Enhanced tutorial designed for new players</li>
<li>In-game reward for early access players</li>
<li>Regular content updates planned for the future</li>
</ul>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lZIe7nWoB_w"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d6d5d8988ecbe8f5f38bebfe05861d51.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lZIe7nWoB_w" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's a strategy game for people who love an RTS but don't have a lot of time, so it's a nice sort-of in-between game that for me fits the bill quite nicely. You get to pick a fun load-out of units each round, and watch them all clash in the middle while you sit back and watch the fireworks and decide what you're going to tweak for the next round.</p>
<p>The game works perfectly on Linux with Proton 9. Love it. </p>
<p>It will be $14.99 / £14.99 / €14.99 at release. Well worth picking up right now though.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/669330/Mechabellum/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check it out on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Deadlock surpassed 100,000 concurrent players, Valve adds wall jumping</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve's latest game Deadlock continues rising up the most-played games ranking on Steam, despite it being invite-only and the developers continue expanding it. As a reminder, Linux players need <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> and you <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/deadlock-from-valve-may-need-this-quick-fix-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">may also need a quick fix to stop it crashing</a>.</p>
<p>In the last 24 hours it hit a peak player count of 106,447 putting it higher than Rust, Call of Duty, Stardew Valley, War Thunder and other usually very popular games. Clearly, Valve's idea for it is working and it seems a lot of people are fully coming around to enjoying and appreciating the design.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3362342751725015732gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3362342751725015732gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Source: <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1422450/charts/#1w" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a></em></p>
<p>As long as the player numbers keep up, it seems like Valve may well be onto truly the next big thing here. Still, the biggest test of course is when it's fully opened up but it's incredibly promising to see.</p>
<p>The design keeps changing too, only in the last update the developers added in wall jumping. So that's in addition to dashing, double-jumping, mantling over things and sliding too. Valve also added in some ropes to certain builds too so you can quickly climb up, and you can shoot while hanging on the ropes too.</p>
<div class="ckeditor-html5-video" data-responsive="true" style="text-align: center;">
<video autoplay="autoplay" controls="controls" loop="loop" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/dldoublejump.mp4" style="height:auto; max-width:100%"></video>
</div>
<p>One thing that I really struggled with early on while learning Deadlock, and to some extend I <em>still</em> struggle a bit with now, is to <em>not</em> treat it like a shooter. Yes, it has guns (and finger-guns), but it's a MOBA like Dota 2 more than it is a hero shooter. Your guns aren't even particularly good and deal pretty low damage, a lot of the time they're just to get health down a bit for your abilities, or to finish someone off.</p>
<p>You can follow <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422450/Deadlock/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Deadlock on Steam</a>. You'll have to find an invite from someone to access it.</p>
<p>Have you been playing Deadlock? Be sure to let me know what you think to Valve's latest in-development game in the comments.</p>

      <title>Valve tweak Steam pages again, giving developers some more options while dealing with the mess</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently, Valve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/steam-store-pages-are-about-to-get-a-lot-cleaner-valve-puts-an-end-to-game-advert-spam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">put some new rules in place</a> for Steam pages, because they were getting a bit messy with some publishers using them like pure advertising boards for other games. Now though, Valve have announced more changes.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/4578559379959234050" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest update</a> Valve has now given developers the ability to adjust the highlight reel of games that appear after the description. So developers directly can pick the "set of games to draw from, as well as the sort order for those games, and set one or more of the included games to force to the front of the list".</p>
<p>For example, on the Starfield page when you scroll down, before the reviews section is this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11465312871725014537gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Developers can change the list to include various associated developers, publishers, and franchises. To use it though, developers do need to set up a developer homepage, publisher page or franchise page before the above section will actually display on store pages.</p>
<p>They can then set the sort order and <em>force</em> it to feature certain games.</p>
<p>Additionally, the DLC section has been updated so that developers can feature a specific DLC at the top. Like this example for Europa Universalis IV:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19239752541725014725gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>While some developers and publishers still won't be happy they can't put multiple big Steam banner images for other games at the top of the page, this is a nice compromise. Gives developers more official options to show exactly what they want, without spamming store pages making it a mess for us normies.</p>

      <title>Bazzite Linux gets keyboard-less installation (good for handhelds) and smaller updates</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bazzite, the Fedora-based version of Linux that's designed for the "next generation of Linux gaming" has a fresh release out with some great improvements, especially for gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck OLED, Lenovo Legion Go, ASUS ROG Ally and others.</p>
<p><em>Also related: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/emudeck-team-announce-linux-powered-emudeck-machines/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bazzite is what's going to be used on the new EmuDeck Machines</a>.</em></p>
<p>Some of the biggest changes in Bazzite 3.7 include the option of keyboard-less installations, as it will give you a default username and password just so you can easily get it installed on handhelds. With a note that you should change your password as soon as possible once done. Additionally the installer has fixes for the Steam Deck OLED model.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2106990251725013121gol1.png"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Lenovo Legion Go</em></p>
<p>Updates will also be smaller and faster now, they've updated to the NVIDIA 560 driver series, AMD Polaris is supported again as it will use an older Gamescope when detected, a new Linux kernel scheduler was added they say should "improve the speediness of navigating the user interface in Steam Gaming Mode and improve performance in minor ways in-game" plus there's various fixes for: Lenovo Legion Go, Ayaneo, ROG Ally and Ally X, support for the Minisforum V3 was added and much more.</p>
<p>See their <a href="https://universal-blue.discourse.group/t/bazzite-3-7-0-update-released/3726" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release post</a>, with all the changes on <a href="https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite/releases/tag/v3.7.0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

      <title>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 will get Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Saber Interactive have confirmed that Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 will get full Steam Deck support, although not soon. The game is due to release September 9th.</p>
<p>In the most recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/4595447878567687876" rel="noopener" target="_blank">community update</a> they have an FAQ at the end that notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Will the game be playable on Steam Deck?</p>
<p>We are working on official Steam Deck support, but it's not ready yet. We’re currently targeting the end of the year for full Steam Deck support.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is great, because they also confirmed it will have Easy Anti-Cheat, so without their support with enabling it (as EAC is supported on Linux) it wouldn't work. This also means hopefully they will do plenty of performance tuning for the Steam Deck, which means it would run well on Desktop Linux too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5tqDxvpzsKM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6f2892fcffc6e1cab0b000a8b51f5d41.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5tqDxvpzsKM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Hopefully at least at launch the anti-cheat will be enabled, even if they haven't done the rest that's needed for full Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Additionally they confirmed there's no DRM (Denuvo or otherwise), it will have full PC and console cross-play, it will have DLSS2 / FSR2 at launch with later versions planned post-launch, </p>

      <title>KDE Plasma 6.2 adding a pop-up for donations, plus they want to make a next-generation KDE OS</title>
      <author>nwildner</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-workspace/-/merge_requests/4490" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent change</a> was proposed last month to implement an on-by-default KDED (KDE Daemon) module that will gently ask you to donate to KDE as a pop-up on your notification system inside the KDE Plasma desktop, planned for version 6.2.</p>
<p>As per the merge request cited above and <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2024/08/28/asking-for-donations-in-plasma/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this blog post</a> from developer Nate Graham regarding the situation, we can find the following rationale behind this implementation: KDE usually ask through various social media posts, official channels and yearly fundraisers and blog posts which Graham noted you "may get the impression that we’re always begging for cash". However, if you're not a follower of those and just an average KDE (Plasma) user, you might never know that KDE (The Foundation) has these donations requests constantly being asked, or never know it could be in need of funding.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4600060731724954281gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4600060731724954281gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - The donation request in KDE Plasma, although the button has now been <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-workspace/-/merge_requests/4490#note_1011086" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changed</a> to a less pushy "Donate" instead of "Donate Now".</em></p>
<p>With that in mind and the fact that other organizations already do this on a yearly basis (Thunderbird and Wikimedia for example), KDE decided to implement a KDED module that will ask for donations only <strong>once a year</strong> in Plasma 6.2+. While it may look <em>intrusive</em>, this is completely configurable for those which are packaging KDE so, it's up to each Linux distribution or users to disable it using the normal means of disabling KDED modules.</p>
<p>Something else to keep in mind is that they want to keep expanding too, they want to offer full-time employment to more people and hire more. On top of that, and quite exciting sounding, is that Graham noted in the blog post they eventually want to "fund the creation of a next-generation KDE OS we can offer directly to institutions looking to switch to Linux, and a hardware certification program to go along with it". Including (jokingly) they want to "take over the world" and get more distributions to use KDE Plasma by default.</p>
<p><strong>Editor's opinion:</strong> I think it is fair for KDE to expose that they need funding and asking that from inside the UI would not hurt for a software that delivered so much for free (as in freedom and as in "<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gratis" rel="noopener" target="_blank">gratis</a>"). It is not cluttered, and does not seem to break anyone's workflow.</p>

      <title>The Elder Scrolls Online now Steam Deck Playable, to be fully Verified in &#34;a future update&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Really great to see bigger developers actually start to properly take note of the Steam Deck <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/black-myth-wukong-shows-very-clearly-valve-are-selling-a-lot-of-steam-decks/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">since it's selling so well</a>. Now we have The Elder Scrolls Online from ZeniMax Online Studios and Bethesda Softworks getting improvements.</p>
<p>The thing is, the game has actually been playable as far back as June 2022. However, you did need to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/how-to-play-the-elder-scrolls-online-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">some adjustments to get it to work</a> that I detailed but it seems this is no longer required. Thanks to this, Valve have now bumped it up to a Steam Deck Playable rating while using <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/proton-9-0-2-brings-better-controller-support-in-launchers-more-playable-games-lots-of-bug-fixes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-2</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15468591781724948189gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>In their own <a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/66641" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> on this update the developers noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are thrilled to announce that <em>The Elder Scrolls Online </em>now has “Playable” status on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Deck</a>. This means that Steam <em>ESO</em> players can now venture into Tamriel’s Second Era using the portable PC gaming device. Never miss a Daily Login Reward again! </p>
<p>If you play on Steam and have a Steam Deck, simply find the game in your Library to begin the download. Note that while the game is now officially “Playable,” it won’t have full “Verified” status until a future update, meaning you might encounter some unexpected UI issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Going by their wording towards the end above, they plan to improve it further to get it Steam Deck Verified in future.</p>
<p>You can play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/306130/The_Elder_Scrolls_Online/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ESO from Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>EmuDeck team announce Linux-powered EmuDeck Machines</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The team behind EmuDeck, a project that started off to provide easy emulation on Steam Deck / SteamOS have announced their own hardware with the Bazzite Linux powered EmuDeck Machines. <em>They're basically Steam Machines tailored more towards retro enthusiasts.</em></p>
<p>With a case that's very <em>obviously</em> inspired by the SEGA Dreamcast, the idea is to provide a great out of the box experience for modern emulation. Not just that though, since it's powered by Linux (specifically Bazzite), they have a platform for running other more modern games too. And a lot, thanks to Valve's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20284749081724945544gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - EmuDeck Machines, Credit: EmuDeck team</em></p>
<p>As you can see on the front there's four USB ports, plus a power and reset switch. There's one USB-C port on the back, HDMI and it also has 2.5Gbps Ethernet too. Naturally EmuDeck comes pre-installed, so you'll get really easy access to emulation.</p>
<p>Shipping in two different versions with a low-powered and a much more capable unit.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>EM1:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Intel N97</li>
<li>16GB RAM</li>
<li>512GB SSD</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>EM2:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ryzen 8600G Overclocked</li>
<li>16GB RAM</li>
<li>512GB SSD</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You can also get them bundled with the Nova Lite Controller.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12541200251725011330gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Specs and expected performanced, Credit: EmuDeck team</em></p>
<p>Pricing starts around £277 for the EM1 and £512 for the EM2, although these are "Early Bird" prices so they will be higher at about £302 for the EM1 and £588 for the EM2 normally.</p>
<p>They're currently crowdfunding the effort on IndieGoGo. It's using a Flexible Goal, so they'll receive whatever funds are pledged rather than needing to hit a specific goal. This means they can produce as many as people pledge for.</p>
<p>On top of that, they're also planning a Docking Station, which you can use to bump up the power that will house an AMD Radeon 7600 Desktop card. They say the Dock will begin development once the campaign is finished.</p>
<p>Going by their timeline they provided the manufacturing would begin November with shipping planned for December 2024. While rather exciting and really fun to see more proper Linux-based hardware, it's worth noting this is still in the concept stage, and they have yet to prove themselves on hardware so it's on the pretty <em>risky</em> side.</p>

      <title>Stylish tactics-RPG &#39;Demonschool&#39; delayed until Q1 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Necrosoft Games and Ysbryd Games have announced their stylish tactics RPG with hints of Persona, Shin Megami Tensei, and Italian horror cinema Demonschool has been delayed. Originally due out in September, they're no longer giving an exact date other than sometime in Q1 2025 (January - March).</p>
<p>More about it: "Demonschool is a new-style tactics RPG where motion equals action. Defeat big weirdos in between the human and demon worlds as Faye and her misfit companions, while navigating university life on a mysterious island."</p>
<p>You can check out some gameplay below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6ei2Icsqcac"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/49d9228963f541b873df7dee8dbe1da4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6ei2Icsqcac" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking about the delay here's what Necrosoft Games said over email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You never want to delay a game, but Demonschool means a lot to us. We've really put everything we have into this project, and as we got closer to release we realized that meeting the Sept. 13th deadline would necessarily mean a game with less content than we originally envisioned.</p>
<p>After discussing with Ysbryd, we realized we have a couple of paths forward. We could:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ship the game in the state it’ll be in on Sept. 13. We’re proud of the game as it stands, but we want to make this world feel even livelier.</li>
<li>Ship the game in early 2025, which would allow us to manifest our bigger dreams into reality.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>We believe the second option would be better for everyone for everyone who has followed our work so far. So we are delaying the game to make sure it's as chock full of Things To Do as we had hoped. Realistically, the player would never have known. It still would've been a finished product. But we would have known that the game could have been more, and that's the game we want to share. Ysbryd gave us the flexibility to do this, which is very unusual for a publisher these days, and we’re thankful for the opportunity to do this right. Since we’ll be taking extra time, we plan to create short dev diaries up until launch to offer more insight into the work we have ahead. We hope you look forward to these deeper dives into our process. </p>
<p>We're sorry for those who are eagerly awaiting the game, but are very hopeful that all the extra content will be worth the wait. 2024 has been a very trying year for the team, so we appreciate your understanding.”</p>

      <title>Valve fixed resolution overrides for non-Steam games on Steam Deck plus more general Steam fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another Beta release is out now for the Steam Client on both Desktop and Steam Deck. Here's the latest and what you need to know.</p>
<p>Since again this is a Steam Client update (not a SteamOS update) most of it applies to both Desktop and Steam Deck. Except the Steam Deck does have one specific nice bug-fix (<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/4590944278932981257?snr=2___" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed game resolution overrides failing to apply for non-steam games.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This will be nice for those of you docking your Steam Deck while playing various non-Steam games from other launchers, emulators and more.</p>
<p>The rest of the changes (<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/4622469476327358756?snr=2___" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed screenshots copied to the clipboard displaying with swapped red and blue channels on windows.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Big Picture Mode</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a rare bug that could cause the login page to continuously fail with "error 11" until the client was restarted.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>macOS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed copy to clipboard not working for screenshots and recordings.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added Output Icons to all Mode/Behavior dropdown menus. These indicate if the mode (by default) generates OS Mouse output, XInput (controller) Output, Steam Input API Action Output, or is a remapping tool/Overlay Menu (Touch, Radial, Hotbar).</li>
<li>Steam Input API Analog Actions that can have multiple modes i.e. "Camera | Camera as FlickStick" are now labelled as "... (via FlickStick)"</li>
<li>Steam Input API Analog Actions can now optionally be used "... (via Gyro To Mouse)" (default is still "As Mouse" or "As Joystick Mouse" depending on source).</li>
<li>Fix rare issue where Gyro Processing occurred before controller type is established.</li>
<li>Fix for Track Pad as Button Behavior not displaying any glyphs.</li>
<li>Fix "Gyro Calibration" Button appearing twice on Gyro config screen if there is a mode shift applied to the Gyro.</li>
</ul>

<p>I only discovered this as it advertises Linux support on Steam, but there <em>doesn't</em> actually seem to be a Linux version. So it's not clear what happened there. Looking on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2199330/config/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, there doesn't seem to actually be anything for Linux. So most likely you'll need to force it to run through <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> where it will likely run well anyway. <strong>Update</strong>: the developer <a href="https://x.com/hooded_traveler/status/1829130881212031480" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed</a> no actual Linux version so you do need Proton.</p>

      <title>Wine&#39;s Direct3D to Vulkan translation library vkd3d 1.13 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Wine team have just release vkd3d version 1.13, an update for their own Direct3D to Vulkan translation library.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The noted highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic loop unrolling support in the HLSL compiler.</li>
<li>Effects compiler support for several version 4.0+ state objects.</li>
<li>Miscellaneous bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's just the main standout changes, there's lots of smaller changes too as they build it up. This will be bundled with the next release of Wine which will be Wine 9.17 which should be due out around the 6th of September.</p>
<p>All that's new can be seen in the <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/vkd3d/-/releases/vkd3d-1.13" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release post</a>.</p>
<p>Not to be confused with Valve's <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VKD3D-Proton</a> which was forked off from it a long time ago now. As explained before on this: Valve want things ready a lot faster, and with dedicated support for all the latest games in Proton. Valve are a lot more aggressive on getting all the newest possible stuff inside VKD3D-Proton. Meanwhile Wine directly has a much wider software target, including various applications (not just games).</p>

      <title>Frontline Crisis is a tough but engaging mix of tower defense and top-down shooting with a big mech</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer BCQT released Frontline Crisis earlier in August, and like a lot of smaller games it seems to have flown under the radar but if you love tower defense and top down shooting you need to play this. <em>Note: key provided by the developer.</em></p>
<p>Made by one-person it's really impressive. You go through various levels, each being a small confined battlefield where you walk around in your big spider-mech. This mech does everything from mining to building to shooting. It's equal parts a tower defense game as it is a top-down shooter and it's pretty darn tough too. There's not often a lot of time to think and you'll be constantly on the move.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16849514431724866333gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>While your mech is powerful with its own weapons, the idea here is to get a few buildings down to face off against incoming waves of aliens. The problem is, your mech has to stay in place to mine resources, then move to a position where you can build which also keeps you still and defend everything you've built from the incoming onslaught.</p>
<p>You don't get a lot of space, which is what keeps you on your toes. You're not only limited by the screen space, since the maps are tiny, but by what "operators" you have picked. Each operator has a certain amount of space on the ground to allow you to build on, and during the pre-level setup you do a sort-of Tetris game of slotting them on the ground. And then after putting down the operators, you pick exactly what buildings will go where. So it's all about having a good pre-game plan here.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6354048421724866292gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>You can upgrade your operators too, enabling you to unlock more squares to build on. Not only that you can also give them abilities like increasing the HP of buildings on their squares, the ability to rebuild, insure buildings to get credits back when destroyed and more.</p>
<p>It's <em>constantly</em> engaging your full attention. Do you go and grab some resources from your mining buildings? Or do you stand and fight while powering up a offensive tower you've placed down to speed up its fire rate? Maybe you want to hop over to a power-up building to dump some resources into it to power up your mech? You can't protect everything and can only do one thing at a time. It makes it pretty darn frantic really, and the design of it is just really clever.</p>
<p>With the different types of enemies you have to deal with, along with some insane boss battles, there's so much action going on it's a total delight. The bosses also aren't just big enemies walking slowly towards you. Each are properly formidable with different behaviours and attack patterns.</p>
<p>Naturally in a game like this as you progress through the levels you will get new items, towers and more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="L9CaDOAe1l8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/093ff6169df3f64d83343fb37ff7df1a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/L9CaDOAe1l8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Not only are you an actual moving character on the battlefield, but you'll also be in charge in some missions of protecting certain buildings. If either are destroyed, you failed and when there's lots of aliens coming across the screen at you, it's really challenging. </p>
<p>It's made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> and performs well with Proton 9. The only technical issue I saw was entering your name, as it minimized the game and required some alt-tabbing to realise it pulled up an extra external text-box to enter my name in. Bit weird, but otherwise great fun. Some of the text also needs another pass over it but mostly okay, some bits just need explaining better.</p>
<p>To top it all off, you can even play it in local co-op if you want. This will keep you entertained for many hours. Quite a surprise and definitely deserves a lot more attention.</p>

      <title>Clearly inspired by Advance Wars the turn-based infantry battler &#39;Warside&#39; gets a new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you loved the classic Advance Wars and other more modern turn-based tactical battlers, you're probably going to love Warside. Currently in development by UK (London) based LAVABIRD, it's looking extremely promising.</p>
<p>Not only will it have a full single-player mode with more than thirty missions, it will also have local and online co-op missions. Plus the ability to take on friends and foes alike in local and online PvP.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_riZUqJGz-4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8c942fdb2a422285e50f07dce7c34cf0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_riZUqJGz-4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Nice to see Steam Deck noted directly in a trailer too, pretty cool, we don't see that often! They did previously confirm on their successful Kickstarter it would have Linux support so it's not surprising. It's also made with the free and open source <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> which is great.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Intuitive turn-based gameplay with a familiar feel for fans of the classics.</li>
<li>12 playable Commanders, each with unique passive skills and Battle Powers.</li>
<li>Control 25+ unit types. Simultaneously battle over land, air, and sea with ground forces, aircraft, and naval units.</li>

      <title>Argonaut Games announced a return with a remaster of Croc Legend of the Gobbos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>That's quite a blast from the past. How do you feel about a little nostalgia? Argonaut Games announced a return with a remaster of Croc Legend of the Gobbos. Argonaut Games might be familiar for other games like perhaps Starglider, Star Fox and Alien Resurrection.</p>
<p>After releasing their last game in 2004, Argonaut are now making a big comeback. Not only with Croc Legend of the Gobbos but as a "boutique" publisher as well noting a planned slate of classic Argonaut IP and exciting original titles for both current and retro-gaming platforms.</p>
<p>See the Croc Legend of the Gobbos teaser below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1lxQ4m_g21I"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f0ab4b2e23fa3eb9b60396bfe21e8837.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1lxQ4m_g21I" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>Gary Sheinwald, Co-CEO of Argonaut Games, expressed his excitement about the future: “I worked closely with Jez on the design and production of Starglider, Argonaut’s first big hit back in 1986, so to take up the mantle of relaunching Argonaut Games nearly four decades later brings me full circle, and we have further exciting announcements in the pipeline in the coming months.”</p>
<p>“We wanted to honor the original game's legacy while introducing it to a new audience,” said Mike Arkin, Argonaut Games Co-CEO. “The HD remaster allows us to do just that. It’s been a labor of love for our team, and we can’t wait to share it with players on all the current consoles and PC later this year.”</p>
<p>The remaster will also include a special "Crocipedia" that will house an "extensive and meticulously curated digital museum containing long-lost development assets such as game design documents, concept art, animation tests, team member interviews, and much more".</p>
<p>Presumably it will be on Steam but they haven't revealed many other actual details yet.</p>

      <title>Cat Bait is another new take on the survivor-like genre about a cat running away from rats</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another new take on what Vampire Survivors and Brotato made popular? Yep. Cat Bait is out now in Early Access and there's a demo available too.</p>
<p>Much like all the others there's plenty of randomness, and lots of running around collecting something (coins in this case) to upgrade abilities. However, the idea here is that you don't have any abilities directly. Instead, you hire helper cats that stand on top of the walls that use their abilities to help you dodge all the rats and other nasties out to get you. As the name suggests, you're just bait.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="XkXBWgeOgZo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/248ed8903d8fd4c28162ec75f14e1ddb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/XkXBWgeOgZo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Unique Helper Cats: Each helper has its own special abilities and characteristics. For example, summon the Druid Cat to slow down enemies with roots and deal periodic damage. And who said you can summon only one helper?</li>
<li>Upgrade System: Upgrade your helpers during each run. Increase damage, add more projectiles, and unlock other unique upgrades for each cat.</li>
<li>Meta-Progression: Collect coins from defeated enemies to upgrade your character and helper cats between runs, making each new attempt more powerful.</li>
<li>Skins and Abilities: Unlock new skins for the Cat Bait that not only change the appearance but also add new active abilities. For example, the standard skin allows repelling enemies.</li>
<li>Epic Bosses: Fight unique bosses, like the mouse rider on a rat. Each boss has its own set of moves and attacks, making each battle unpredictable.</li>
<li>Interesting Locations: Choose from various locations, each offering its own challenges and variety of enemies. Start with an empty character and choose your first helper cat to begin the adventure.</li>
<li>Session Gameplay: Short gaming sessions make it easy to jump in and out of the game, continuing from the same wave you stopped at.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, if you've played any of these single-stick arena fighting survival games, you'll generally know what to expect. It's only a small twist on it with the helper cat system, where you need to choose carefully and then keep upgrading the few you have to hopefully survive to progress.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2929730/Cat_Bait/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">find it on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Speedollama is a completely ridiculous platformer-shooter releasing in October</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From Chaosmonger Studio who previously released ENCODYA and Clunky Hero have now announced their completely over the top platformer-shooter Speedollama will release October 21st. In their email the developer noted it will have full Linux and Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>Pulling in a big sprinkle of inspiration from classic titles like Metal Slug and Turrican, as well as modern hits like Broforce, Mercenary Kings, and Pizza Tower. If any of those types of games appeal to you, then get ready for some chaos it seems. Featuring vibrant pixel-art visuals that evoke the charm of retro arcades, while incorporating modern gameplay elements such as procedurally generated levels, chaotic humour, and gallons of pixelated blood.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EYFWldXi1bo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bd730858a46150fd1b096d0db71db9a7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EYFWldXi1bo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Procedurally generated levels offering endless replayability.</li>
<li>Vibrant, colored pixel-art graphics with hand-made frame-by-frame animations.</li>
<li>Fantasy violence with humorous splatter scenes and gallons of pixelated blood.</li>
<li>A variety of weapons and upgrades to enhance gameplay.</li>
<li>Extremely fast-paced action for adrenaline-fueled fun.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From the developer: "I know the indie game market is crowded, with countless platformers being released every month. Standing out in that jungle is no easy task. But I believe Speedollama brings something truly unique to the table—it's fast, quirky, packed with animated details, and, above all, incredibly fun to play. I'm excited to take on the challenge and see how players react to this bizarre and entertaining experience!"</p>
<p>There's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2571500/Speedollama/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">demo available right now on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era announced from the developer of Iratus: Lord of the Dead</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Unfrozen who previously made Iratus: Lord of the Dead have teamed up with Ubisoft, and they recently announced the new Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era. One for fans of the classics!</p>
<p>Unfrozen's previous game did have Native Linux support, but since they're now working with Ubisoft I fully expect it to need to run through <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> on Linux desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>What's interesting here is that this is actually a prequel, and very much looks like a return to the roots of the gameplay. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7065674751724855345gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7065674751724855345gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>More about it: "Heroes of Might &amp; Magic Olden Era is a new installment of the renowed series of turn-based strategy games, where action takes place in Enroth, on the continent of Jadame, mentioned but never explored in a Heroes of Might &amp; Magic game before. Traverse a vibrant and living fantasy world full of wonders and dangers, build magnificent capital cities, raise massive armies and clash in epic, highly tactical battles of heroes and mythical creatures.</p>
<p>Play solo with a new campaign, multiple single maps and limitless randomly generated scenarios, or engage in battle of wits and magic with other players — rivals or allies — in multiplayer mode. There is also an option to build your own story with the map editor tool, which you may make available to all the players around the world or keep to yourself."</p>

      <title>Squad tactics heist RPG Cyber Knights: Flashpoint gets double the content and a big sale</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Trese Brothers have kept up their ridiculous rate of updating Cyber Knights: Flashpoint during Early Access, steadily turning it into of of the best squad tactics RPGs.</p>
<p>What is it? A modern tactical RPG that blends elements of XCOM and similar games, with a big splash of Cyberpunk themes.</p>
<p>Just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1021210/view/4252047773027318019" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> is the "MAGNITUDE x2" update they said has effectively doubled the content available in the game, for the second time. This update has added in 2 new maps, 2 new objectives types and a total of 10 new map/objective combinations. The new mission types sound fun with one seeing you fight off a siege, and another sees you hunt down special items.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14102889241724854636gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14102889241724854636gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The developers said now their procedural generation system has been boosted again to give more variety, they will be going back to make some more hand-crafted missions over the next couple of months. Nice to see it will have a decent mixture.</p>
<p>If that wasn't enough they dropped <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1021210/view/4252047773029406551" rel="noopener" target="_blank">another</a> update (#132!) that added in a few new types of enemies, some of which use full-auto attacks that sound pretty menacing. Enemy scaling has been improved to keep it challenging, variety of enemy spawn combinations was improved and some bug fixes. With these updates together, it sounds like Cyber Knights: Flashpoint should have a pretty wide variety in everything now.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Playable. Well worth a look.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1021210/Cyber_Knights_Flashpoint/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck reaches over 16,000 playable and verified games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another great milestone for the popular Steam Deck from Valve, which in the last day or so managed to hit over 16,000 games that have been rated as Playable and Verified.</p>
<p>This is using Valve's official rating system, so it only covers those games that have actually been tested. So keep in mind there's thousands more that do run. Not a perfect measure, with it at times having the wrong rating, but overall it's working well. Here's the current numbers at time of writing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steam Deck Playable - 10,701</li>
<li>Steam Deck Verified - 5,318</li>
<li>Steam Deck Unsupported - 4,408</li>
</ul>
<p>Taken from <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified&amp;refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B1%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Playable" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> that shows unlisted games as well, since owners can continue to download and play them and Valve do rate them.</p>
<p>Some interesting fully Steam Deck Verified games rated over last month or so include:</p>

<p>There's still some major annoyances, namely EA with their newer EA anticheat which has repeatedly caused games to be entirely broken with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/battlefield-1-gets-ea-anticheat-in-september-will-be-left-broken-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the latest being Battlefield 1</a>. And the number of developers with multiplayer games that just refuse to enable their anti-cheat. I really hope over the next year as <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/black-myth-wukong-shows-very-clearly-valve-are-selling-a-lot-of-steam-decks/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Steam Deck continues to sell really well</a> that developers will reconsider that.</p>
<p>What have you been enjoying the most on Steam Deck recently?</p>

      <title>Microsoft donates the Mono Project to the Wine team</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, this is surprising isn't it? Microsoft are handing over the Mono Project to the Wine developers with a thank you note.</p>
<p>What is it? Mono is a software platform designed to allow developers to easily create cross platform applications. It is an open source implementation of Microsoft's .NET Framework based on the ECMA standards for C# and the Common Language Runtime.</p>
<p>Posted on the <a href="https://www.mono-project.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mono website</a>, along with a <a href="https://github.com/mono/mono/issues/21796" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub post</a>, Microsoft's Jeff Schwartz announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mono/mono" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mono Project (mono/mono)</a> (‘original mono’) has been an important part of the .NET ecosystem since it was launched in 2001. Microsoft became the steward of the Mono Project when it acquired Xamarin in 2016.</p>
<p>The last major release of the Mono Project was in July 2019, with minor patch releases since that time. The last patch release was February 2024.</p>
<p>We are happy to announce that the WineHQ organization will be taking over as the stewards of the Mono Project upstream at <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine-mono/mono" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wine-mono / Mono · GitLab (winehq.org)</a>. Source code in existing <a href="https://github.com/mono/mono" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mono/mono</a> and other repos will remain available, although repos may be archived. Binaries will remain available for up to four years.</p>
<p>Microsoft maintains a modern fork of <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/tree/main/src/mono" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mono runtime in the dotnet/runtime repo</a> and has been progressively moving workloads to that fork. That work is now complete, and we recommend that active Mono users and maintainers of Mono-based app frameworks migrate to <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/core" rel="noopener" target="_blank">.NET</a> which includes work from this fork.</p>
<p>We want to recognize that the Mono Project was the first .NET implementation on Android, iOS, Linux, and other operating systems. The Mono Project was a trailblazer for the .NET platform across many operating systems. It helped make cross-platform .NET a reality and enabled .NET in many new places and we appreciate the work of those who came before us.</p>
<p>Thank you to all the Mono developers!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only have Microsoft done a seemingly pretty good thing here, their acknowledgement of the Wine team and their work is also really nice to see.</p>

      <title>Battlefield 1 gets EA anticheat in September - will be left broken on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here we go once again, EA are about to completely break another game on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux and this time it's Battlefield 1. Originally released back in 2016, it still sees some pretty good player numbers on Steam hitting a concurrent player peak of 15,117 in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>In an official <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/eaac-and-battlefield" rel="noopener" target="_blank">news post</a>, which was recently updated, it now states that Battlefield 1 is set to get the kernel-mode anti-cheat and anti-tamper solution <em>EA anticheat</em> in September. This follows on from Battlefield 2042, Battlefield V, EA SPORTS WRC and Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2 that all added it after release. It's also in their EA SPORTS FC series, with it originally first rolling out in FIFA 23 and has since expanded to include the others.</p>
<p>The big problem is, EA don't support Linux platforms at all with EA anticheat and so games using it won't work at all on Steam Deck or Desktop Linux.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13134385071724781721gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>EA also recently did a <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/news/ea-anticheat-safety" rel="noopener" target="_blank">separate post</a> on August 22nd talking about EA anticheat noting is has "prevented nearly five million attempts (and counting!) to cheat in EA anticheat-protected games" and they make it clear they plan to add EA anticheat into <em>more</em> titles across "FY25" (the 2025 financial year).</p>
<p>What this does is just highlight a problem with buying multiplayer games that aren't explicitly said to be supported on your platform. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> is incredible, it does enable tens of thousands of games to run on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux, but in times like this EA can just write it off without a bother. How? Well, it's not EA selling it to you saying it's supported to run their Windows game it via Proton.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that Valve updated the Battlefield 1 Steam Deck rating from Playable to Unsupported 5 days ago. Still, no refunds will come for those who are outside the normal Steam refund policies, even if your primary way to play is a Linux-based platform and that stings to just have a broken game.</p>
<p>At this point, it's probably only a matter of time until Apex Legends gets EA anticheat. That one will really be a big issue, since it's one of the most popular games on Steam.</p>
<p>It's an interesting contrast with BioWare's Dragon Age: The Veilguard that EA publish, which is <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gets-steam-deck-verified-well-ahead-of-release/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Deck Verified</a> ahead of release with the developers <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/dragon-age-the-veilguard-devs-talk-up-their-pc-features-optimisations-and-steam-deck-verification/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">repeatedly mentioning</a> it. But hey, it's not a multiplayer game.</p>

      <title>Black Myth: Wukong shows very clearly Valve are selling a lot of Steam Decks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve don't exactly like to give out sales numbers, so we often have to make educated guesses but sometimes with huge hits like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2358720/Black_Myth_Wukong/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, it gives us a slightly clearer idea on how the Steam Deck is actually selling.</p>
<p>For a while I've been tracking the top sellers lists on Steam to see where the Steam Deck ranks. It's important for us especially that it does well, since it's a Linux device (SteamOS) flowing out into the hands of the public. And masses of improvements there benefit Linux gaming as a whole from driver improvements to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> upgrades.</p>
<p>The thing is, the top sellers lists on Steam go by <em>revenue</em>, not units sold. The Steam Deck costs (in comparison) a <em>lot more</em> compared to games so naturally it will rank quite high anyway most of the time. But, here's where the fun begins. Black Myth: Wukong is a <strong>huge</strong> hit, a truly massive seller. According to the official X/Twitter <a href="https://x.com/BlackMythGame/status/1826985302592049599" rel="noopener" target="_blank">account</a>, by August 23rd it had hit already 10 million sales across all platforms. Right now another 4 days later, both <a href="https://vginsights.com/game/2358720" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VG Insights</a> and <a href="https://gamalytic.com/game/2358720" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gamalytic</a> put it somewhere around 14 million sold <em>just</em> on Steam.</p>
<p>When you look at the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topsellers/global/2024-8-20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">global top seller list</a> on Steam right now, removing free to play titles so just those you have to pay for you end up with:</p>
<ol>
<li>Black Myth: Wukong</li>
<li>Steam Deck</li>
<li>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</li>
<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>All three of those games will be selling a lot and the cheapest of them (Black Myth: Wukong) is £49.99. Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 for example, is currently the second most-wishlisted game on Steam while also being a top seller on pre-orders. So, this shows pretty darn well in no uncertain terms, that the Steam Deck from Valve is also clearly selling a lot of units too right? Probably quite a few more than a lot of people thought. Likely even more than I thought recently too. Keep in mind that by November last year, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/steam-deck-global-top-seller-again-thanks-to-cheaper-lcds-and-the-steam-deck-oled/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve said</a> the Steam Deck had already sold "multiple millions".</p>
<p>Perhaps no surprise then when we see developers getting their games Steam Deck Verified well ahead of release, like the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gets-steam-deck-verified-well-ahead-of-release/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>.</p>
<p>So then, how about Fortnite on Linux / Steam Deck? Epic Games CEO <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/fortnite-on-linux-steam-deck-not-until-tens-of-millions-of-users/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tim Sweeney said</a> when it hits "tens of millions of users" that it "would actually make sense to support it". We must be pretty close by now right? Why ignore a platform that's sold multiple millions, and is clearly just continuing to fly off the shelves?</p>
<p>But, another thing, this also goes to show that Valve are likely in no rush at all on a Steam Deck 2. They simply don't need to do one right now. Also shows why Valve continue to roll out new Steam Deck features on Steam <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/valve-made-it-even-easier-to-see-who-played-on-steam-deck-in-user-reviews/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">like the reviews filter</a>, a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/valve-has-a-new-steam-chart-for-the-most-played-steam-deck-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">most played games chart</a> and why there's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/valve-confirm-plan-to-get-steam-decks-steamos-on-the-rog-ally-and-more-handhelds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">no rush to get SteamOS on other devices</a>.</p>

      <title>Judero is a strikingly odd looking stop-motion styled action-adventure</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Set to arrive on September 16, Judero is just something you have to see. An action/ adventure game inspired by the rich folk history of the Scottish Borders but it's really the style and animation that's really something.</p>
<p>As the developers explained it's "made from handcrafted objects and bespoke figurines, animated in the stop-motion tradition". For them they said the art style "invokes something nostalgic; in part comical but perhaps a little bit creepy too" and with the real-life models then rendered into a 3D world, it gives a real unique flavour to it while also giving it some flair like real-time lighting, shaders and post-processing effects while the cut-scenes use traditional stop-motion animation techniques and are much more cinematic.</p>
<p>Together you get something that's just seriously weird and quirky.</p>
<p>Have a look in the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="fL_Xta4i0Xo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bffb62609a0069958ae01770ca8b43da.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/fL_Xta4i0Xo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fast and Fluid Combat. Strike, and dodge your way through a myriad of foes culminating in exciting and unique boss challenges.</li>
<li>Possess Enemies. Take on the form of lesser creatures to greatly expand your abilities. Use these enchanted minions in combat and to solve puzzles.</li>
<li>A Rich Text System. Discover the world of Judero through branching dialogues and pithy, aphoristic NPCs.</li>
<li>Mini Games. Through your adventures you will encounter a number of diverse Mini Games with differing mechanics and visual styles. Mini games also vary the pace of the game and allow us to explore other narrative tangents.</li>
<li>Rewarding Exploration. There are many secrets and discoveries to find as you roam through the world of Judero. From collectables and pick-ups to whole optional story-lines and more.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1960900/Judero/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> and it appears it will have Native Linux support too.</p>

<p>Neva chronicles the story of Alba, a young woman bound to a curious wolf cub following a traumatic encounter with dark forces. Together they embark on a perilous journey through a once-beautiful world as it slowly decays around them.</p>
<p>Over time, their relationship will evolve as they learn to work together, helping one another to brave increasingly dangerous situations. The wolf will grow from a rebellious cub to an imposing adult seeking to forge her own identity, testing Alba’s love and their commitment to one another.</p>
<p>As the cursed world threatens to overwhelm them, Alba and her courageous companion will do whatever it takes to survive and make a new home, together.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

      <title>The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria arrives on Steam with Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>The Dwarves dug deep and broke out of the Epic Games Store, as The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria has released on Steam. Originally released back in October 2023 as an Epic Exclusive.</p>
<p>Free Range Games mentioned in a post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2933130/view/4241914673865774571" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> that they've been working on getting Steam Deck Verified, and while there's no current status given to it from Valve they made it clear the "experience will feel good on the Steam Deck on launch day". Noting features like the full controller support along with the in-game keyboard being hooked up, smooth performance, the correct resolution is set, fonts should look good and so on. However, they did say there's "more improvements coming" for Steam Deck too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6614593211724771492gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Once again, it's great to see more developers doing proper testing to ensure compatibility! Steam Deck testing with SteamOS will mean it works well for desktop Linux users too since both use the same <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> to run Windows games.</p>
<p>From the press release: “We are ecstatic to bring The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria to Steam and Xbox, providing the opportunity for a whole new audience to delve into the Mines of Moria," said John Miller, CEO, North Beach Games. "With the addition of all of the new features and content in The Golden Update, Return to Moria delivers the deepest look yet at a survival-crafting experience based on The Lord of the Rings, and we cannot wait to hear what players think.”</p>
<p>“The development team has put in so much work since we first launched in October 2023 and we’re really proud of how far the game has come,” said Jon-Paul Dumont, Game Director, Free Range Games. “From Crossplay to Sandbox mode, to all the new content and improvements based on player feedback, we’re more excited than ever for fans to play Return to Moria.”</p>

      <title>Wii U emulator Cemu 2.1 out now with AppImage and Flatpak support for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After going <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/wii-u-emulator-cemu-20-out-goes-open-source-and-gets-linux-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">open source back in mid 2022</a>, the Wii U emulator Cemu started providing experimental builds with Linux support and now it's out proper with the new Cemu 2.1 release.</p>
<p>Released late yesterday there's a lot of big improvements in this new release, that really advances Wii U emulation. This release brings together the 93 experimental releases since Cemu 2.0, they said to think of this like "the final experimental update". Basically, they're saying it's now properly ready for everyone to try out.</p>
<p>Major new additions include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added appimage and flatpak releases for Linux.</li>
<li>Added an experimental release for macOS. Available for x86-64 only for now but it can be run on ARM macs through Rosetta 2 emulation. MoltenVK is used as the graphics backend.</li>
<li>Added a tool to emulate the USB portals for Skylanders and Disney Infinity.</li>
<li>Added NFC/NTAG support. Pokemon Rumble U figures can now be scanned from a file similar to the existing Amiibo scanning.</li>
<li>Added support for titles stored in <code class="inline-code">.wuhb</code> (Wii U homebrew) and <code class="inline-code">.app</code> (NUS) format.</li>
<li>Added support for connecting to <a href="https://pretendo.network/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pretendo</a> network services.</li>
<li>Cemu on Windows is now non-portable by default for <ins>new installations only</ins>. All data and config files will be stored in <code class="inline-code">%appdata%/Cemu</code>. This makes the Windows installation match other platforms. Existing installations will not be affected.</li>
<li>Added portable mode by placing a directory named <code class="inline-code">portable</code> next to the Cemu executable. Cemu will then store data and config files in this folder. This works on all platforms.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And for those interested in the Linux improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added wayland support.</li>
<li>Added support for storing MLC and game files on case-sensitive filesystems.</li>
<li>Added an option to enable <a href="https://github.com/FeralInteractive/gamemode" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GameMode</a>.</li>
<li>Brought online features on a par with Windows builds.</li>
<li>Enabled DSU controller support.</li>
<li>Emulated games can now access HID devices from the host via libusb (e.g. Skylanders portal).</li>
<li>Many changes to improve robustness of the Linux build.</li>
<li>Added debug option to create core dumps on crash.</li>
<li>Improved diagnostics logging in case of crashes or other exceptions. Cemu is now also shipped with symbols so that stack traces show function names.</li>
<li>The CPU and memory statistics in the overlay now work on Linux.</li>
<li>The background colors of the Game List now match the brightness of the window theme instead of always using bright colors.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where closing the GamePad window would freeze Cemu.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the GamePad window would not render anything with OpenGL.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where some UI dialogs would cause Cemu to crash after closing them.</li>
<li>Fixed many smaller UI issues specific to WxWidget's wxGTK backend.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's also numerous improvements to their OpenGL and Vulkan renderers, lots of upgrades to the input system, fixes to online play support and much much more.</p>
<p>Incredible work by many different coders.</p>

      <title>Resident Evil 2 makes a return to GOG with lots of improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After re-releasing the first <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Resident Evil</a>, GOG have now done the same for <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil_2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Resident Evil 2</a>, getting a load of improvements in along the way. They haven't yet given a date on when <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil_3" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Resident Evil 3 </a>will land other than "soon" but that will also come with similar improvements.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5193555761724760335gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>All the improvements in this version:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Full compatibility with Windows 10 and Windows 11.</li>
<li>6 localizations of the game included (English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Japanese).</li>
<li>Improved DirectX game renderer.</li>
<li>New rendering options (Windowed Mode, Vertical Synchronization Control, Gamma Correction, Integer Scaling and more).</li>
<li>Improved audio volume and panning.</li>
<li>Improved cutscenes and subtitles.</li>
<li>Improved savegame manager.</li>
<li>Improved game video player.</li>
<li>Issue-less game exit.</li>
<li>Improved game registry settings.</li>
<li>Improved key-binding settings and audio settings screens.</li>
<li>Improved end credits in the German version.</li>
<li>Fixed issues with Rooms 114 and 115 (missing text), Room 210 (invisible diary), and Room 409 (looping sound).</li>
<li>Full support for modern controllers (Sony DualSense, Sony DualShock4, Microsoft Xbox Series, Microsoft Xbox One, Microsoft Xbox 360, Nintendo Switch, Logitech F series and many more) with optimal button binding regardless of the hardware and wireless mode.</li>
<li>4th Survivor and Tofu modes enabled from the very beginning.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Since it's a classic Windows game you'll need Wine / Proton to play it. Easy enough thanks to the Heroic Games Launcher which <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/heroic-games-launcher-v215-has-expanded-gog-support-ea-games-from-epic-store-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">only recently had some big GOG improvements</a>.</p>
<p>Don't forget there's also a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/claim-a-free-copy-of-tropico-4-on-gog-during-their-back-to-school-sale/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">big GOG sale now on</a>.</p>

      <title>Deadlock from Valve may need this quick-fix on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Depending on your Linux distribution, you may need a small fix to get Valve's new game Deadlock to work properly. So here's what you need to know. Currently the game does not have a Native Linux version, so you need to run it with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> and it runs pretty well. <em>It's also invite-only, so find a friend somewhere to invite you.</em></p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7979730991724758718gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7979730991724758718gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>If you find the game crashes when connecting to a server or otherwise, you likely need to raise your "vm.max_map_count". Yes, it strikes again. Many Windows games via Wine / Proton need a higher vm.max_map_count than some Linux distributions ship with out of the box.</p>
<p>You can find what yours currently is with this terminal command:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">cat /proc/sys/vm/max_map_count</code></p>
<p>To set it temporarily higher you can do this in terminal:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=1048576</code></p>
<p>That above is the newer default that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/ubuntu-2404-increases-vm-max-map-count-for-smoother-linux-gaming/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a>, Fedora and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/arch-linux-changes-vmmax-map-count-to-match-fedora-ubuntu-for-better-gaming/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Arch Linux</a> were updated with. Previously many distributions had it quite low at 65530.</p>
<p>For a permanent change you can edit the "/etc/sysctl.conf" file or "/etc/sysctl.d" depending on your distribution, add "vm.max_map_count=1048576" to the bottom and then run:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">sudo sysctl -p</code></p>
<p>Which should keep the change.</p>

Unable to go back, you must keep going to find out where he is being led... And why he left in the first place."</p>
<p>I also missed that it had a new demo update back at the end of July which is still up now, so it's worth a look. Check out the release date trailer below:</p>

      <title>Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter gets a fresh trailer and new release window</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Odd Bug Studio have revealed that Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter will be releasing in February 2025 and there's a brand new trailer. I'm really excited for this one, the artwork is gorgeous. It was originally planned for later this year but they said the new date "ensures we can provide the very best experience possible".</p>
<p>As for the new trailer it shows off some fresh gameplay that showcases " Arlo’s brutal journey of survival and revenge" and that the "Viking-esque aesthetic of this new story is emphasized by Fever Ray’s haunting 2008 track, ‘If I Had a Heart’ – we think it’s a fitting accompaniment to the harsh and unforgiving world Arlo must navigate through in the game".</p>

      <title>Bungie retro FPS Marathon Infinity now on Steam, whole trilogy get Steam Workshop support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Aleph One developers have now put all three of Bungie's (Halo / Destiny) classic FPS series on Steam with Classic Marathon Infinity now available free.</p>
<p>Not only that, all three now also have Steam Workshop support with the update to the <a href="https://alephone.lhowon.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Aleph One</a> open source game engine that powers all three games. The developers are still choosing not to put up the Native Linux versions though, so you'll either need to set them to use Proton, or if you do wish to run them with Linux builds there's <a href="https://github.com/luxtorpeda-dev/luxtorpeda" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Luxtorpeda</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18352630281724694454gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18352630281724694454gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I tested the game working nicely direct from Steam with Proton 9.</p>
<p>More about Marathon Infinity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Marathon Infinity takes the closed universe of the Marathon series and blows it wide open. The solo/co-op campaign, “Blood Tides of Lh’owon,” is a 20-level scenario sporting new textures, weapons, and enemies. More than that, the scenario sheds a surprising new light on the story’s characters and the meaning of events. Having defeated the Pfhor and reawakened the ancient remnants of the S’pht, the player now faces a world where friends become enemies and all is not what it seems…<br/>
<br/>
This classic 1996 Bungie™ FPS is now maintained by the fan community. Experience authentic game play using the original data files, with optional widescreen HUD support, 3D filtering/perspective, positional audio, and 60+ fps interpolation, just in case the original is <em>too</em> authentic.</p>

      <title>Deadlock from Valve has very quickly risen up the most played list on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Despite still being invite-only and only having the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/deadlock-from-valve-no-longer-a-secret-store-page-is-up-and-we-can-finally-talk-about-it/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">softest of announcements possible</a>, Deadlock from Valve has seen its player count rise sharply.</p>
<p>Since the lifting of public discussion restrictions on it the player count has gone from around 30,000 to a peak of 89,203. This means it has been seeing more players than Team Fortress 2, DayZ, Dead by Daylight, Overwatch 2 and other multiplayer games. At time of writing it's number 14 on the most played list.</p>
<p>Not surprising though is it? It's a <em>new</em> Valve game, <em>obviously</em> there was going to be immense hype around it. This is basically like saying "water is wet", but hey it's a new Valve game that <em>some</em> of you can actually play, right now. What a time to be alive.</p>
<p>I'm currently just cracking-up at the background info for some of the heroes like Lash who "is an asshole", and that's literally all we're given about them. Yes, this is really what Valve put in the game. Perfect, no notes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18288929021724692891gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18288929021724692891gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>But there's also Yamato, who doesn't speak English, and so their background isn't either:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16126971541724692892gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16126971541724692892gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Valve developers also confirmed recently in the Deadlock Discord server that they're currently working on "larger anti-cheat systems" for the game too.</p>
<p>You can follow it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422450/Deadlock/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the Steam page</a>. Currently on Linux you need <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> to play it.</p>

      <title>GameCube and Wii emulator Dolphin getting an official Flatpak for Linux and Steam Deck </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Emulation fans might like this! The GameCube and Wii emulator Dolphin, is going to finally get an official package for Linux Desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>This will come thanks to Flatpak and be available via <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/org.DolphinEmu.dolphin-emu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Flathub</a>. It's actually <em>already</em> available, but was originally done by the community. However, one of the Dolphin developers <a href="https://github.com/flathub/org.DolphinEmu.dolphin-emu/issues/224" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted</a> onto the GitHub page for the Flathub package about actually making it properly official.</p>
<p>As developer "OatmealDome" explained a few weeks ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the past 8 years, the Dolphin project has chosen not to create any official builds for Linux, instead opting to relegate that task to the distributions. However, with the rise of the Steam Deck, we've observed significant user demand for an official Flatpak version of Dolphin. As this unofficial Flatpak is being used by many people already, we think that collaborating with you and making this Flatpak official would be the best way to approach this. Is this something that everyone is interested in doing?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The work towards it is ongoing, but it's looking very positive with the Dolphin project making code <a href="https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin/pull/10556" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changes</a> to prepare for it, and the GitHub repository for the Flathub package being <a href="https://github.com/flathub/flathub/issues/5511" rel="noopener" target="_blank">moved</a> over to their control. So soon, the Flathub page should switch over to note it's official.</p>
<p>Why is this important? Well, it's like downloading and installing anything; you have the peace of mind to know that not only is it safe but actually maintained by the original developers and supported.</p>
<p>Nice to see the Steam Deck continuing to have a positive impact for Linux users everywhere. Valve clearly made the right decision to support installing apps via Flatpak/Flathub.</p>

      <title>Steam sets a new record with 37.2 million concurrent users online</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Only a few months after Steam first hit 36 million, the record has been broken again this year with Steam remaining the champion for PC gamers.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/753/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, yesterday saw 37,266,324 concurrent users online with 12,534,703 actually in-game. Looking back through the history that makes it the 4th time this year that the record has been broken. We saw Steam hit <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/steam-smashes-its-peak-players-online-record-to-over-34-million/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">34</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/steam-broke-another-record-with-over-35-million-people-online/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">35</a> and then <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/steam-breaking-records-again-hitting-over-36-million-players-online/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">36</a> million all in a single month back in March so it took a bit longer this time.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Around the time Steam hit the new record the top games were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Black Myth: Wukong</li>
<li>Counter-Strike 2</li>
<li>Dota 2</li>
<li>PUBG</li>
<li>Banana</li>
</ul>
<p>It's pretty clear that Black Myth: Wukong is really pushing the numbers there, itself hitting a peak concurrent player count of 2,068,291 in the last 24 hours and an all-time peak of 2,415,714 only 4 days ago. So it's doing really well, and has managed to become the second most-played game on Steam of all time just under PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS as per <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/?sort=peak" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>.</p>
<p>Five years ago, Randy Pitchford of Gearbox <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1117077275680264193" rel="noopener" target="_blank">predicted</a> in a post on X/Twitter, that Steam "may look like a dying store":</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="From a track record point of view, my expectation is that Epic’s investment in technology will outpace Valve’s substantially. When we look back at Steam in five or ten years, it may look like a dying store and other, competitive stores, will be the place to be. The competitive store that happens to be the leader in 10 years may not be Epic’s store, but it probably won’t be Valve’s and Epic’s moves right now are opening the door and paving the way for a vibrant competitive economy." src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19034512071724689714gol1.png"/></p>
<p><em>I think it's pretty safe to say that's not going to happen. </em></p>
<p>Worth noting Pitchford did follow that post up <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1826261635389882574" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently</a> when poked about Borderlands 4 coming to Steam:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="Yeah, Steam is the leading store for PC games and Epic is not pressing their advantage (which is a shame). I’m a Steam customer, but sure wish they had more and better competition that was more favorable to artists, designers, and creators than to the retailer. I will continue to support competitors to Steam and also support Steam." src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/542935941724690284gol1.png"/></p>

      <title>Valve made it even easier to see who played on Steam Deck in user reviews</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/steam-now-shows-who-played-mostly-on-steam-deck-in-user-reviews/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Just recently I reported</a> on Valve adding a new feature to Steam user reviews, showing off who played mostly on Steam Deck and now they've made this even easier.</p>
<p>Being able to see who mostly played on Steam Deck is great, as both an additional advert for the Steam Deck and to help potential buyers see if a particular game is worth picking up. My suggestion in the previous article was that "Valve just need to add a filter to show only Steam Deck reviews" and you'll never guess what — they did exactly that.</p>
<p>Now when you scroll down to user reviews on Steam and look inside the Playtime hover-menu, there's a specific option to show those who played mostly on Steam Deck (this is for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245620/ELDEN_RING/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ELDEN RING</a>):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/313404311724503080gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>That way if you're playing primarily on Steam Deck, you can choose to see only those types of reviews if you want to.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the previous update that added the Steam Deck icon to reviews allows you to hover over the icon to see how many hours detected were played on Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Deadlock from Valve no longer a secret - store page is up and we can finally talk about it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Deadlock, perhaps the <em>worst</em> kept secret from Valve, has now been <em>softly</em> revealed as the latest game from the maker of Half-Life, Counter-Strike, Portal and Team Fortress 2.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7194375701724500622gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7194375701724500622gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Even before it was officially announced, it managed to pull in over 44,000 concurrent players during their secret (but not very) invite-only play-testing. We know this thanks to public data from <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1422450/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, which tracks everything on Steam, and Deadlock itself has been on there for quite some time before being announced.</p>
<p>Technically, Valve haven't <em>really</em> announced it yet. They made a store page, which is incredibly light on details, a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/deadlock-1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Twitch</a> category, and they have posted in their official Discord to note people can now talk publicly about it:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="We are lifting the rules for public conversation about Deadlock to allow for things like streaming, community websites and discussions.  Nothing else is changing with our state of development. We are remaining invite-only and continue to be in an early development stage with lots of temporary art and experimental gameplay." src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13742207061724499268gol1.png"/></p>
<p><em>Since it's still invite-only, you'll have to find someone who has access.</em></p>
<p>Previously, the game would give you a warning when you first load in, asking you clearly not to share details publicly, which some (hi <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/12/24219016/valve-deadlock-hands-on-secret-new-game" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Verge</a>) decided to ignore. This has now been replaced with a simple reminder that it's in early development and feedback is welcome.</p>
<p>So <em>what</em> is it? Well, that’s a little complicated to answer. But, I did have access pretty early thanks to an invite so my best attempt at a simple explanation: it takes the lanes, towers and AI creeps gameplay from Dota 2 and turns it into a third-person hero shooter with rails in the air you can jump on to travel across the map quickly. It’s definitely peculiar and much like Dota 2, it’s easy enough to get into but really takes a good while to learn properly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10909323371724500620gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10909323371724500620gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>With its two 6 on 6 teams, each team fights across defined lanes in the map that have guardians at specific points you need to destroy. You push through each lane with the help of your teammates and your AI creeps. Gradually, you push the enemy team back by taking down different types of guardians to eventually make it into the enemy base. Inside the enemy base you take down their Patron, which is like a multi-stage boss battle, while also trying not to die from the enemy team madly firing off every single ability they have at you.</p>
<p>You’re not forced into any particular lane though, you can run or rail across the map and go wherever you like. It’s a team game after all, but leaving a lane empty is of course not a good idea. The rail system definitely adds a nice spin to it, letting you quickly zip across the map from your base. You can get a fast speed-boost from it too, but once used it goes into a cooldown. Additionally, the rails for you only work in your territory, so once you push past an enemy guardian, your team's active rail length will expand.</p>
<p>It has a pretty fun character movement system too where you can dash, double-jump, mantle over things and slide too. So it's reasonably fast paced, especially during combat between players when you're all jumping around trying to avoid all the abilities going off.</p>
<p>There’s quite a number of characters already, all with their own set of abilities, much like Dota 2 or any of the various hero shooters out there. So learning it can be quite overwhelming initially, as you not only need to learn your abilities, but how to deal with whatever characters the opposing team picks. Thankfully, a good few of the characters are super-simple to play as.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16027965131724499688gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16027965131724499688gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's not just the characters though, you also need to keep upgrading as you go through a match and learn what works best for each character. And here's where it's once again like Dota 2. You have to earn a currency, souls, and then run along to a shop to buy up character upgrades. Thankfully, there's a suggested build system you can follow and anyone can make one and publish it for you to follow.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10215610311724500862gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10215610311724500862gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18823123341724502223gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18823123341724502223gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Valve seem to be learning a clear lesson from the failure of Artifact here, building it up gradually with a growing community and tweaking it constantly based on player feedback. The secrecy around it, along with the invite system, has attracted a lot of attention and even though it's been leaked <em>constantly</em>, this plays quite well for free advertising for Valve.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what happens with it when Valve open it up fully. Will it have the staying power of other popular Valve games? Will it end up eating away at the numbers of CS2, Dota 2, TF2 and others? Who knows. It's a weird one, but it can be a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Currently, there's no Native Linux version, but I can confirm it works really nicely on Desktop with Proton. I have yet to try it on Steam Deck but will soon.</p>
<p>You can follow it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422450/Deadlock/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Steam page</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck gets a global resolution override in latest Beta, plus more desktop Steam fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a couple more Steam Beta Client releases recently for both Steam Deck and Desktop so here's all you need to know.</p>
<p>On the <strong>Steam Deck</strong> side, you may be pleased to see that Valve has now added a global game resolution override feature to the display settings page. Available in Settings-&gt;Display-&gt;Advanced, here you can set the maximum resolution allowed to be used by games. This feature technically isn't new, since it was available per-game already, but having it global is great for those who play a lot docked and want everything to be available at a higher resolution.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6847346651724499864gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6847346651724499864gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>

</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>While over on <strong>Steam Desktop</strong> a lot of the changes are the same, but there's a couple of differences.

      <title>Wine 9.16 released with more Wayland work and an initial Driver Store implementation</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/releases/wine-9.16" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wine 9.16</a> development release is now available for this compatibility layer to run Windows apps and games on Linux. Here's all that's changed. Reminder: Wine is a huge part of what makes <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a> able to do its thing so you can play lots of games on Linux Desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The main highlights of this release include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial Driver Store implementation.</li>
<li>Pbuffer support in the Wayland driver.</li>
<li>More prototype objects in MSHTML.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>For those curious about this Driver Store looking it up on Microsoft's <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/driver-store" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website</a> they explain it as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Starting with Windows Vista, the Driver Store is a trusted collection of inbox and third-party <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/driver-packages" rel="noopener" target="_blank">driver packages</a>. The operating system maintains this collection in a secure location on the local hard disk. Only the driver packages in the Driver Store can be installed on a device.</p>
<p>When a driver package is copied to the Driver Store, all of its files are copied. This includes the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/overview-of-inf-files" rel="noopener" target="_blank">INF file</a> and all files that are referenced by the INF file. All files that are in the driver package are considered critical to the device installation. The INF file must reference all of the required files for device installation so that they are present in the Driver Store. If the INF file references a file that is not included in the driver package, the driver package is not copied to the store.</p>
<p>The process of copying a driver package to the Driver Store is called <em>staging</em>. A driver package must be <em>staged</em> to the Driver Store before the package can be used to install any devices. As a result, driver staging and device installation are separate operations.</p>
<p>A driver package is staged to the Driver Store by being verified and validated.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA driver with Linux kernel 6.10 causing kernel oops</title>
      <author>nwildner</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA is currently investigating a bug where their drivers are crashing on modern kernels (6.10+). This appears to happen across drivers 550, 555 and even the latest 560.</p>
<p>From the troubleshooting data that can be found on the NVIDIA forums and the crashes I'm facing myself, this seems to be a regression that started with Linux kernel 6.10 and it affects users when suspension mechanism is triggered or some application is processing 3D. It affects both the closed and open NVIDIA drivers.</p>
<p>This happened on my computer recently, and it is really annoying. Example log:</p>

      <title>Dragon Age: The Veilguard devs talk up their PC features, optimisations and Steam Deck verification</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>BioWare and Electronic Arts are gearing up for the release of Dragon Age: The Veilguard on October 31st and they've revealed a whole bunch of details about the PC release.</p>
<p>We already saw before that it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gets-steam-deck-verified-well-ahead-of-release/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">became Steam Deck Verified</a>, clearly showing plenty of early testing has been done there. So it should be looking good on desktop Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> thanks to that too.</p>
<p>In the latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1845910/view/6302310962453571761" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam post</a> the developers mentioned how PCs made up "40% of our platform testing effort, with over 200,000 hours of performance and compatibility testing", so with that in mind, I'm expecting some pretty good things from this since they "created a dedicated team to focus on PC". Then again, you would generally expect that sort of thing from a big game getting a PC release. And, as already confirmed before, no EA App is needed - so Steam Deck / Linux players won't have to deal with launcher breakage constantly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9192046611724335396gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The good news continues with the controls and UI being nicely tweaked for keyboard / mouse and controller, with seamless transitions between control types. They even implemented character class-specific keybinds, so you can customize per character which sounds interesting.</p>
<p>And they gave a nice big list of all the settings available:</p>

<p>I'm curious to see how well this one runs, especially on Steam Deck where the Verified rating at times still has games dropping below 30FPS. I really do hope this is nicely optimized.</p>

      <title>Genki reveal a new Tokyo Xtreme Racer is in the works</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Genki are returning to their racing roots with a brand new Tokyo Xtreme Racer in the works, due out for release sometime in 2025. The first series title in 18 years, no doubt fans of the classic Genki racers will be happy about this, especially as it's coming to Steam too so you'll be able to play it with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> on Steam Deck / Desktop Linux.</p>
<p>Their teaser was brief and didn't really show anything:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="sEhzyVcUCCM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/199d51036535b9ad8aae0df6b25a0afd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/sEhzyVcUCCM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Their Steam page was also light on any actual details too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Tokyo Xtreme Racer" is a racing game set in a sealed-off future Tokyo, where you compete for the fastest speed in your customized cars on the highways that weave through the city, aiming to reach the top.<br/>
<br/>
Drive real cars on meticulously recreated courses, compete against powerful rivals,<br/>
slip through other cars, and engage in spirit-wracking battles.<br/>
This is a series with unparalleled appeal.<br/>
<br/>
A new title, "Tokyo Xtreme Racer" now in development<br/>
please look forward to the release of more information.</p>

      <title>Steam now shows who played mostly on Steam Deck in user reviews</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update - 22/08/24 17:40 UTC</strong>: Valve has now actually <a href="https://x.com/OnDeck/status/1826673475119186082" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> this change.</p>
<hr/>
<p>While I can't find anywhere that Valve actually announced this, they've done another tweak to the user review system on Steam to show who primarily played on Steam Deck. This follows on from the recent user review update that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/valve-attempts-to-deal-with-jokes-memes-and-ascii-art-reviews-on-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">attempted to deal with jokes, memes and ASCII art</a>.</p>
<p>Just another way for Valve to advertise their Steam Deck in a neat way, and importantly for potential buyers to see who is <em>really</em> playing on Steam Deck. It's a good way to gauge if a game is truly worth a purchase for you, if you're also primarily a Steam Decker.</p>
<p>When you look over various user reviews on Steam, you might now spot a Steam Deck icon, the same one that was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/steam-will-now-show-you-who-is-playing-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">added to the friends list recently</a> to show who is currently online on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>As some examples here's one from the excellent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Selaco</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14668991371724327903gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>And another from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1868140/DAVE_THE_DIVER/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DAVE THE DIVER</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/266177871724328096gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/266177871724328096gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>This might even push more Steam Deck players to make a review, just to show off how many hours they've put into a game. Which can then help push even more game sales, and perhaps more Steam Deck sales too.</p>
<p>Now Valve just need to add a filter to show only Steam Deck reviews, and it should work quite nicely.</p>

      <title>D.O.T. Defence looks like a fun spin on the RTS genre</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>D.O.T. Defence from Rattleaxe Games plans to launch in 2025 and looks like it will put a nice unique spin on RTS games, with matches you play in short bursts designed for single-player and local multiplayer. Another unique game made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>!</p>
<p>More about it: "Welcome to D.O.T. Defence, a simplified yet deeply strategic RTS experience that seamlessly blends accessibility with tactical depth. We offer a simplified economy system, massive automated battles with light command, and a fun simplified upgrade system. Play in short bursts as matches last between 5-10minutes!</p>
<p>The only objective is to protect your HQ and destroy the enemies! Crafted by developers passionate about the genre, this game delivers a nostalgic experience reminiscent of their childhoods."</p>
<p>Check out the teaser trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4iwfeI2oR4g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/920adaccb4c4e3d640565e23f42b2c8a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4iwfeI2oR4g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's all about capturing little square regions across the map to expand, and defend, so you can push further towards the enemy HQ. You end up with what they call Turret Mayhem, as you defend against hordes of enemies trying to capture your territory with various types of turrets to use. Split across a Wave Defense mode and a more traditional RTS experience in the Skirmish mode it sounds like it could be a lot of fun.</p>
<p>It will support 1v1, 2v2 and free-for-all battles with local multiplayer and battles against AI.</p>

<p>The developer said it blends together elements of existential horror with corporate satire and should set your back around 5 hours of adventuring.</p>
<p>However, I know plenty of you aren't keen on AI, and it does use AI in the game. Their statement on it: "The voices are generated using ElevenLabs and many of images are painted over and modified AI generations.". There will no doubt be a lot more games coming out using AI like this in some way.</p>

      <title>I&#39;m quite excited for the Starship Troopers: Extermination single-player</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Starship Troopers: Extermination is already a fun game, but the initial Early Access release was short-lived due to a lack of content. Over time, Offworld have really built it up and the new upcoming single-player mode has me really excited. <em>I have a real sweet spot for Starship Troopers, as one of my favourite sci-fi movies.</em></p>
<p>There's been a lot of performance updates over the last year with DLSS and FSR3 also being added. Weak points were introduced to bugs to aim for; new planets; a new carnage system so the maps will fill up with bug bodies instead of them vanishing, that all have collisions too, creating some interesting interactions; different types of ammo and lots more.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer featuring Casper Van Dien from the original sci-fi classic movie:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Q-z4hGP89YM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5e18c149b1781a669ad2bb7cb5b96db2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Q-z4hGP89YM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's also a new developer diary that goes over the upcoming massive tanker bug addition, appearing just as it did in the 1997 classic movie. Also mentioned is another new planet coming, the icy planet Boreas, where you'll face various mutated bugs.</p>
<p>On top of that there's some new details on the single-player mode, which sees you undertake a multitude of missions that vary in scope and objectives. Mainly, they're designed to prepare you for the 16-player online mode, with more missions planned after the October 11th launch out of Early Access.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kRpzrSa0ibI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fc1c6d90dadfcfd64197c35f5a87314f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kRpzrSa0ibI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Hopefully at the full release it will have more players, as it's good fun. The biggest problem with it is actually getting into a game, as you're forced to matchmake with seemingly no ability just to start a game by yourself and let others come in later.</p>
<p>It's currently Unsupported on Steam Deck, but does run on Desktop Linux with Proton 9.</p>

      <title>Celebrating 6 years since Valve announced Steam Play Proton for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Today marks 6 years since Valve decided to change everything, especially for Linux fans, with the announcement of Steam Play Proton. Thanks to it, the Steam Deck and Desktop Linux gaming have continued to thrive. <em>Want a Proton beginner's guide? <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Got you covered at this link</a>.</em></p>
<p>Heck, the Steam Deck <em>never</em> would have been a thing without Proton. Could you imagine it? Trying to market a Linux handheld without the vast majority of games people want to play? It was also only <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/5-years-later-valve-finally-gives-windows-compatibility-tool-proton-a-logo/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">in February this year</a> that Valve actually decided to give it a logo too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17719696571724266234gol1.png"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Proton's official logo</em></p>
<p>Thanks to all the work put into Proton from Valve developers, contractors and everyone who contributes to <a href="https://www.winehq.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wine</a> development that Proton is based upon, we have a ridiculous amount of games where you can just click the Play button and forget about everything else in Steam.</p>
<p>Going by the official Valve Proton <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, there's been 66 releases of Proton during this time, and that's not counting all the interim updates to Proton Experimental and Proton Hotfix for quick game-specific fixes. The Proton changelog has seen 388 changes, although some will be text corrections, that's again showing just how much goes into it. It's an incredible amount of work when you think about just how many games are on Steam, and developers really love to do some <em>weird</em> stuff that Valve often has to work around. And let's not forget the likes of <a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CodeWeavers</a>, who employ people to work on Wine and Proton.</p>
<p><em>As for the current state of Desktop Linux and Steam Deck gaming overall…</em></p>
<p>Looking over the current numbers on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a>, the community website where anyone can report how games work: there's 22,002 games reported to work by at least one person, 13,297 by at least two people and 9,751 that has three or more reports.</p>
<p>Going by Valve's own Steam Deck Verified system there's 5,297 rated Verified and 10,646 rated Playable.</p>
<p>Both ProtonDB and Valve's own ratings are only a small slice of Steam though, which has over 100,000 according to the Game tag on <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5BappType%5D%5B0%5D=Game" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>. There's only so many games Valve can test officially and that people can report to ProtonDB, so there's likely thousands of games not reported by anyone that will just work out of the box with Proton.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10311193491724267345gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10311193491724267345gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - HELLDIVERS 2 on Linux</em></p>
<p>It's pretty amazing that we can play the likes of HELLDIVERS 2, Baldur's Gate 3, Black Myth: Wukong, Grand Theft Auto V, Cyberpunk 2077, Fallout 4, Balatro, ELDEN RING, Hades II, Dead by Daylight, No Man's Sky and so many more at the click of a button in Steam now.</p>
<p>Now we just need more anti-cheat support, including from developers who already use anti-cheat that is supported to actually enable it. This is really the last major hurdle.</p>
<p>So here we are again, happy birthday to Proton, 6 years strong enabling gaming on Linux and Steam Deck to be an incredible thing.</p>

      <title>Microsoft breaks some Linux dual-boots in a recent Windows update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you dual-boot Windows and Linux? Well, a recent Windows update seems to have been a bit messy and may have broken the ability to boot into Linux. Causing an alarming message to display of "Something has gone seriously wrong".</p>
<p>The update in question is in relation to <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-2601" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CVE-2022-2601</a>, and as the numbers there suggests, it's an issue from way back in 2022 that Microsoft decided just last week to go and patch up <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2022-2601" rel="noopener" target="_blank">themselves</a>. From the CVE:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A buffer overflow was found in grub_font_construct_glyph(). A malicious crafted pf2 font can lead to an overflow when calculating the max_glyph_size value, allocating a smaller than needed buffer for the glyph, this further leads to a buffer overflow and a heap based out-of-bounds write. An attacker may use this vulnerability to circumvent the secure boot mechanism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It wasn't supposed to affect you if you do have Linux installed, as per Microsoft's own info they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To address this security issue, Windows will apply a Secure Boot Advanced Targeting (SBAT) update to block vulnerable Linux boot loaders that could have an impact on Windows security. The SBAT value is not applied to dual-boot systems that boot both Windows and Linux and should not affect these systems. You might find that older Linux distribution ISOs will not boot. If this occurs, work with your Linux vendor to get an update.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, that seems to have still caused problems for those that <em>do</em> dual-boot. Oops. There's been <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/1523438/verifying-shim-sbat-data-failed-security-policy-violation" rel="noopener" target="_blank">quite</a> a <a href="https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=427297" rel="noopener" target="_blank">few</a> <a href="https://forum.zorin.com/t/verifying-shim-sbat-data-failed-security-policy-violation/40257" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reports</a> of people <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/1euuha4/please_help_error_message_verifying_shim_sbat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">unable</a> to <a href="https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/issues/2947" rel="noopener" target="_blank">boot</a> into their Linux distributions as a result of this update. A potential solution can be found in an Ubuntu <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/sbat-revocations-boot-process/34996" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Discourse post</a> from 2023 for a previous issue.</p>
<p>Microsoft haven't yet said anything about it that I can find, and their <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/august-13-2024-security-update-kb5041160-3e8026f2-bb4c-4c1c-9855-d41e1b5b1bd9" rel="noopener" target="_blank">update page</a> notes "Microsoft is not currently aware of any issues with this update", so <em>clearly</em> that needs an update.</p>

      <title>Dead Cells has its final update out now with The End is Near</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Six years after the main release, Dead Cells has seen its final update, packed full of content to give it a good send off. Easily one of the best action-platformers around blending in metroidvania and rogue-lite elements, and continues to be one of my favourites.</p>
<p>The End is Near gives you new monsters, weapons, mutations, biome effects, an expanded curse mechanic, over 40 new head skins, around 20 new legendary affixes, more accessibility options and the list goes on. A lot of the new additions are based on the Curse mechanic, giving you access to Cursed Biomes if your run is at Boss Cell level 2 or higher so all this stuff won't just spawn randomly in your game and they're optional. If you decide to risk going into a Cursed Biome you can end up with some pretty nice rewards for your time.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Ey694m9TEUU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2963529b74be20be6dba567842feb7fa.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Ey694m9TEUU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For those interested these are the new accessibility options:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added two new sets of control icons and an option to select them. You can select either "Legacy" (current icons), "New" (a new, cleaner set) or "Big" (accessibiliy focused, easier to read).</li>
<li>Changed the Daily Challenge's boss arrow opacity, for better visibility.</li>
<li>Added new input options for the "going through platform" action.</li>
<li>Added options to change the controller triggers' deadzone.</li>
<li>Reworked the Auto-hit assist mode option. It will no longer force the use of a melee weapon in the first slot.</li>
<li>Added an option to add a background to most texts in the game. The background's color and opacity can be adjusted.</li>
<li>The left stick can now be used to scroll through item descriptions in the pause menu.</li>
<li>Added options to fully invert the player and camera movement.</li>
<li>Added a bunch of options to tweak the camera's behavior. The influence of the player's movement, combat, or points of interest can be customized.</li>
<li>Split the "controller sticks deadzone" into two options, one for each stick.</li>
<li>Added an outline option for spikes.</li>
<li>Added a button to center the minimap on the player.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can buy Dead Cells from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/dead-cells?partner=gamingonlinux" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/dead_cells?as=1636858786" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/588650/Dead_Cells/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>.

      <title>Star Labs recently revealed the StarBook 7 a 14-inch beauty</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're in the market for new hardware, perhaps the new Star Labs StarBook 7 might be what you should be looking at. Their 7th generation has a number of nice upgrades and changes compared to what came before.</p>
<p>Naturally, it comes properly tested with full Linux support. With a choice between many different Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Manjaro, MX Linux, Zorin and even Windows 11 if you wish.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/453349721724239458gol1.png"/></p>
<p>You can grab it with either the 1GHz 4-core Intel Processor N200 (Intel UHD Graphics) or the 1.40GHz 16-core Intel Core Ultra 7 Processor 165H (Intel Arc graphics). Both models come with a 14-inch (diagonal) LED-backlit matte display with IPS technology (16:9 3840x2160). You also get 512GB Gen3 PCIe SSD as standard, 8GB of 3200MHz DDR4 memory, Intel Wi-Fi 6E AX210, Bluetooth 5.3, a 65-watt-hour lithium-polymer battery they claim has up to 14 hours battery life and plenty of ports available:</p>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Left</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>HDMI</li>
<li>USB Type A</li>
<li>Ultra 7:</li>
<li>2x Thunderbolt 4.0 with Power Delivery 3.0</li>
<li>N200:</li>
<li>2x USB Type C with Power Delivery 3.0</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Right</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Micro SD Memory Card Reader</li>
<li>USB 3.0</li>
<li>USB 2.0</li>
<li>3.5mm Combination Jack</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also have it with coreboot and firmware updates easily via LVFS.</p>
<p>Nice to see a UK hardware vendor doing well, as we don't have too many of them, a lot of Linux hardware is often pretty centered around the USA.</p>
<p>See more on the <a href="https://starlabs.systems/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Star Labs website</a>. Pricing starts at £597 right now during pre-production for early-bird savings, but after it will go up to £753.</p>

      <title>shapez 2 is a big hit with over 150,000 copies sold in less than a week</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>At least for some smaller teams, things are looking pretty good, with shapez 2 from tobspr Games only launching into Early Access on August 15th and it's sold really well. Read <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/shapez-2-is-an-absurdly-great-and-accessible-factory-building-game-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my early thoughts in my previous article</a>.</p>
<p>Their press team, Game Drive, announced that it managed to sell "over 150,000 copies during its first weekend" which is pretty incredible. And it managed to hit a peak player count of 18,806, putting it easily in the top 100 most played games on Steam.</p>
<p>Considering the first game sold more than 650,000 units, it's perhaps not a big surprise to see a massively expanded sequel do so well.</p>
<p>Tobias Springer, CEO of Tobspr Games said, “We are thrilled and taken aback by the success of shapez 2 over its launch weekend and are excited to see so many people jumping in to give it a go. Rest assured that we are listening to all feedback from our players and working to make the game even more satisfying and enjoyable during Early Access.”</p>

      <title>Valve bans keyboard automation in Counter-Strike 2 update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some keyboards have special features like Razer's Snap Tap and Wooting's SOCD, that can give an unfair advantage in online games, and so Valve have put their foot down and entirely banned such tricks in Counter-Strike 2.</p>
<p>Valve didn't name any hardware makers directly, because of course they wouldn't - they don't want to get in trouble, but it's easy to find out who it's aimed at. Snap Tap, or Simultaneous Opposing Cardinal Directions (SOCD), in super-simple terms is a way to have two keys (like A/D for character strafing) not cause you to come to an abrupt stop when you hold both down, instead allowing you to instantly change directions while keeping your accuracy (see Razer's <a href="https://www.razer.com/gb-en/technology/snap-tap-mode" rel="noopener" target="_blank">explainer</a>). In fact, Wooting themselves even said "SOCD is basically cheating" in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-Hgo9k_0v4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">video</a> to showcase the feature.</p>
<p>Now, Valve decided enough is enough and it's actually a skill to get it right with your fancy fingers and so they've banned any kind of similar automation.</p>
<p>Here's what Valve said in the Counter-Strike 2 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/6500469346429600836" rel="noopener" target="_blank">update</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Counter-Strike is constantly evolving. From art, to maps, to inventive plays, and even player input, the CS community shapes the game.</p>
<p>Scripting and automating player commands has always been contentious, but over the years some forms of scripting (e.g., jump-throws) have gained acceptance, as they enable plays that wouldn't otherwise be possible. In fact, jump-throws became such an important part of the game that we've done the work to make them reliable without any special scripting or binds (i.e., by jumping and quickly throwing a grenade).</p>
<p>Developing one's coordination and reaction time has always been key to mastering Counter-Strike.</p>
<p>Recently, some hardware features have blurred the line between manual input and automation, so we've decided to draw a clear line on what is or isn't acceptable in Counter-Strike.</p>
<p>We are no longer going to allow automation (via scripting or hardware) that circumvent these core skills and, moving forward, (and initially--exclusively on Valve Official Servers) players suspected of automating multiple player actions from a single game input may be kicked from their match.</p>
<p>To prevent accidental infractions, in-game binds that include more than one movement and/or attack actions will no longer work (e.g., null-binds and jump-throw binds).</p>
<p>If you have a keyboard that includes an input-automation feature (e.g., "Snap Tap Mode"), be sure to disable the feature before you join a match in order to avoid any interruption to your matches.</p>

      <title>Sid Meier&#39;s Civilization VII arrives February 11, 2025 - Gameplay reveal trailer live</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A Gameplay reveal trailer has been released for Sid Meier's Civilization VII and we have a release date of February 11th, 2025. Some other good news is there will be no extra launcher this time too (and it was recently removed from the previous game), although they are requiring a 2K account for online play.</p>
<p>Check out the first gameplay below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kK_JrrP9m2U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e11196832bbe950cc97a4bb7df59d8c8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kK_JrrP9m2U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's available to pre-order starting from £59.99 / 69,99€ / $69.99 and more for the other editions of the game. The Deluxe and Founders edition give a bunch of extras, along with Advanced Access to get into the game on February 5th.</p>
<p>You can also check out their longer showcase:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Tc3_EO6Bj2M"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/493ae3f99eb507d34aa568ebb01a1561.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Tc3_EO6Bj2M" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Their previous press releases very clearly mentioned Linux support and the pre-order on Steam has the SteamOS (Linux) icon too, so as far as I know, it will have Linux support again but it's not been stated who is doing it if it will be Firaxis Games themselves, Aspyr Media again or another team. The Linux system requirements are just noted as "TBD" (Windows and macOS are the same). <strong>Update 21/08/24 9:32 UTC</strong>: Their press release sent out later once again confirmed very clearly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><small>[…]</small> it will be available on PlayStation®5 (PS5®), PlayStation®4 (PS4®), Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo™ Switch, PC via Steam and Epic Games Store, and Mac and <strong>Linux</strong> via Steam</p>

      <title>Path of Exile 2 hits Early Access on November 15</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I know lots of action-RPG fans will be excited for this one. Path of Exile 2 is now set to release into Early Access on November 15th. Hopefully it will work well, if they kept up with their Vulkan support it would make it a lot easier to run through <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> on Desktop Linux and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Quite excited for this one, especially after some of the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/path-of-exile-2-will-have-couch-co-op-cross-play-and-cross-progression/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">great features they revealed previously</a> like full proper couch co-op support on all systems.</p>

      <title>MudRunner and SnowRunner creator announced RoadCraft a heavy machinery construction sim</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oh, now this looks good! Saber Interactive and Focus Entertainment who made the likes of MudRunner and SnowRunner just revealed RoadCraft.</p>
<p>I'm a big fan of SnowRunner, despite how terrible I am at it, always getting completely stuck no matter what I do and RoadCraft takes things in a different direction. Instead of just transporting goods from one location to another, you're in charge of rebuilding after natural disasters with various forms of heavy machinery.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Ajbx_1Sk1Wo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ce7524bcd69effe81bf20b83c2a07ad0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Ajbx_1Sk1Wo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rebuild devastated areas solo or in co-op mode for up to four players in a simulation featuring advanced physics.</li>
<li>Operate more than 40 vehicles, from bulldozers to construction cranes.</li>
<li>Work in various regions around the world with eight maps, each 4 km² in size.</li>
<li>Manipulate materials such as wood, sand and asphalt using Saber’s new physics engine.</li>
<li>Construct new roads and bridges to facilitate movement across rugged terrain.</li>
<li>Plot point-to-point routes on your map to guide your logistics convoys and recycle every piece of debris into reconstruction materials.</li>
</ul>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to embark on a new journey with Saber Interactive and announce <em>RoadCraft </em>today at the Opening Night Live 2024,” said John Bert, Managing Director at Focus Entertainment. “Saber’s experience combined with our expertise in the genre will pave the way for the success of this new franchise and allow players to discover a deep construction simulation experience.”</p>
<p>"Saber continues to explore ways to innovate using our industry-leading off-road simulation technology," said Matthew Karch, CEO of Saber Interactive. "We are constantly in search of new and fun types of gameplay experiences that complement our best-selling titles, such as <em>SnowRunner </em>and <em>MudRunner</em>. <em>RoadCraft </em>is our first foray into heavy equipment simulation. The game provides the best combination of off-road and construction simulations to create a new experience unlike anything that has preceded it.”</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2104890/RoadCraft/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>. It will release sometime in 2025. You'll need <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a> to play it on Desktop Linux / Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Kyle Crane returns in Dying Light: The Beast</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Techland are bringing back the original protagonist in Dying Light: The Beast, with you once again jumping into the shoes of Kyle Crane.</p>
<p>You are Kyle Crane, the man whose selflessness during the initial virus outbreak saved many from a fate worse than death. After more than a decade in captivity, you find yourself in a world that’s changed, and not for the better. Now, you’ll need to use the survival skills that kept you alive all those years ago to save even more innocent lives.</p>
<p>Voice actor Roger Craig Smith is returning for Kyle Crane too! Here's what they said: "Stepping back into Kyle Crane's shoes feels like a reunion with an old friend," Smith said. "And even though he’s gone through a terrible time, there’s still plenty of legendary hero left in him.”</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="c50gFkG91jc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a869999707184903985e867e08b5d490.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/c50gFkG91jc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This was actually supposed to be a DLC for Dying Light 2 but Techland said "after two years of work, its size and scope has changed so much that it evolved into a standalone, self-contained experience". If you own the Dying Light 2 Stay Human Ultimate Edition, you'll get it free.</p>
<p>Sounds like it will be quite unique in the series too with you having transformation abilities: "They caged you like an animal. Years of brutal experimentation took its toll, but the zombie DNA and yours are now intertwined so that you are able to unleash a beast-like power. It flows through your veins. No one can take it from you. Use it. And you’ll discover it’s not just a curse.".</p>
<p>No release date yet, we'll find out more later this year. Plenty of time for Valve to ensure <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> is in a good state to have it work at release. <em>And time for me to actually finish Dying Light 2…</em></p>

      <title>Borderlands 4 is coming in 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gearbox and 2K today announced Borderlands 4 is real and it's going to release sometime in 2025 although we don't know many details yet. Hopefully it will work okay with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>
<p>After the absolute disaster that was the Borderlands movie, no doubt fans are itching for something less terrible to blast through. The Steam store page doesn't exactly give much away just noting the obvious: "See if you have what it takes to go down in history as a legendary Vault Hunter as you search for secret alien treasure, blasting everything in sight."</p>
<p>See the new teaser trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1Q8WImF649E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f653bd903bf1712da7c4588e371c8044.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1Q8WImF649E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>What are you hoping to see from it? It's been a few years since the last mainline game, Borderlands 3, which released back in 2019.</p>
<p>You can get a whole lot of Borderlands real cheap right now on <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/franchises/borderlands?ref=gol" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fanatical</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/franchise/Borderlands" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Starground blends together factory building automation with dungeon crawling</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Build a factory, get it automated and go on an adventure? Sure why not! Starground will give you exactly that alone or with friends. While it completely failed to get anywhere on Kickstarter, the developer didn't give up and it's now in Early Access on Steam with Native Linux support.</p>
<p><em>It's another game built with the free and open source <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>!</em></p>
<p>More about it: "Starground is a top-down automation dungeon crawler combo. Alternate between gathering and refining resources on your home planet, and venturing across space to fight through action roguelite-inspired dungeons. How you split your time is entirely up to you! There's no right way to play the game, and any path will progress the story."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="YXyu4bXAWdg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b81046afd5b17268b3d1548263afbaf7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/YXyu4bXAWdg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>MULTIPLAYER - Starground was built up with multiplayer from the beginning. Experience what Starground has to offer as a full co-operative experience with as many friends as you'd like. Invite your friends to work towards common goals, or divide and conquer each part of the game. If multiplayer isn't your thing though, you can play alone in single player too!</li>
<li>AUTOMATION - Develop and maximize an island of resources through automation. Work your way through a research tree filled with all sorts of unique machines and solutions to your logistical needs. Start humble by mining resources by hand and smelting manually, but soon build up to a formidable factory that can tackle anything you can throw at it.</li>
<li>DUNGEONS - If you're not into automation, or need to wait for your factory, then venture to other places in the solar system to explore and crawl your way through a variety of dungeons. Battle enemies, avoid obstacles, kill bosses, and reap the rewards of your effort. Take resources from dungeons back to your factory, or use rare loot to make yourself stronger and craft modular weapons. Make a spear, dual-bladed sword, or maybe a gun on a stick. The choice is yours.</li>
</ul>

<p>I saw only recently a few comments asking for something similar to this, so perhaps this may be what some GamingOnLinux readers have been after.</p>

      <title>MOUSE: P.I. For Hire looks like Steamboat Willie as a FPS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developer of MOUSE: P.I. For Hire, originally just known as MOUSE, certainly aren't shying away from their retro Disney inspiration here. With Steamboat Willie now in the public domain, we can bet there will be more that use classic Mickey Mouse.</p>
<p>You still have quite a while to wait on it though, since it's not going to release until 2025. Reminds me in a few ways of what <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/bye-sweet-carole-blends-horror-with-what-looks-like-classic-disney-movies/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bye Sweet Carole is doing</a> with the classic Disney style.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19543006671724174956gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>More about it: "MOUSE: P.I. For Hire, a gritty and noir-fueled FPS shooter that draws inspiration from classic cartoons of the 1930s.</p>
<p>MOUSE: P.I. For Hire boasts a unique visual style inspired by the charm of 1930s rubber hose animation, transporting players to a nostalgic era of early cartoons. Assume the role of a private detective navigating a noir city teeming with gangs, mobs, and characters from the dark side. Unravel a quest for justice in a noir city mired in chaos, corruption, and vibrant energy, utilizing a diverse arsenal of weapons, power-ups, and explosives to thwart the takeover by corrupt politicians. The game's playful weaponry and distinctive health display, coupled with enemies behaving like cartoon characters, add a lighthearted twist to traditional FPS gameplay."</p>
<p>A brand new trailer was just shown off too, take a look below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8-ueTky6eEk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fe434eb44cbbd4d4470131ed0f5cead8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8-ueTky6eEk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can follow it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2416450/MOUSE_PI_For_Hire/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Hopefully it will run fine on Desktop Linux / Steam Deck with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>

      <title>Elevator Down claims to be Papers, Please meets The Good Place</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Announced today is Elevator Down, a game the developer claims is like Papers, Please blended with The Good Place. They told me via email "The game will be released with 100% support on both Linux and the Steam Deck".</p>
<p>Coming from Greek indie studio eNVy softworks, Elevator Down is a a satirical bureaucratic simulation game where you're the newest recruit in the Afterlife's least glamorous department: Life Evaluation. Talk to Souls, check their documents, reference Holy Texts and decide if they're going Up or Down. Follow the Rules or trust your own moral compass and see where your choices take you - hopefully not the express elevator to hell.…</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BHXDTJgeeVU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f348f16012cc7ace81e8c34f89b8ec6e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BHXDTJgeeVU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Paperwork Purgatory: </strong>Tackle mountains of forms, holy texts and absurdly specific guidelines to determine where each Soul belongs. Of course, you can always wing it and hope for the best… </li>
<li><strong>Divine Dilemmas: </strong>Come face to face with Souls begging you not to send them Down. What is more important, the Rules or Justice? Have you entered your Villain Era and are now sending everyone Down? </li>
<li><strong>Soul Parade:</strong> Meet an eclectic mix of characters from every corner of the Afterlife, each with their own sob stories and supernatural quirks. Who knows? Maybe amongst them you might find the love of your [after]life!</li>
<li><strong>Eternal Endings: </strong>Every choice counts, with multiple possible outcomes that determine your own Afterlife fate. Mess up too bad and maybe even the entire World could be at stake! No pressure.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2866290/Elevator_Down/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam now</a> for release in Q1 2025.</p>

      <title>Descent 3 open source project gets a first release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After getting open sourced back in April and now run as a community project, the Descent 3 open source engine has a first release available. You do need a copy of the game to run it which you can get from <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/descent_3_expansion" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/273590/Descent_3/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>This open source release also includes the "1.5" patch written by Kevin Bentley and Jeff Slutter several years ago and brought to a stable condition by the Descent community.</p>
<p>So what's actually in this new 1.5 release? They said in the release notes that it "fills in the gaps left in the never-released 1.5 patch of the game, and makes it more accessible and convenient to run on modern devices". Their main focus was to get it running properly on modern CPUs and improve the developer experience. Thanks to the work "Descent 3 now runs on 64-bit Linux, Windows and MacOS using SDL2, on AMD64 as well as ARM64 CPUs" with 32bit support dropped.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5183365391724173270gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Also now available is a <a href="https://github.com/DescentDevelopers/Descent3/discussions/531" rel="noopener" target="_blank">roadmap</a> towards the next release which includes plans for a graphics renderer rewrite to use more modern OpenGL, support for higher screen resolutions, localization support improvements and more.</p>
<p>Will be fun to see this classic see a new life!</p>

      <title>Canonical bring more Steam Snap improvements, also hiring more Desktop Software Engineers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Canonical developers continue working towards Ubuntu 24.10, the next release of the popular Linux distribution, and thankfully more fixes are coming for the Steam Snap package.</p>
<p>Mentioned in an <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-desktop-s-24-10-dev-cycle-part-4-august-update/47217" rel="noopener" target="_blank">update</a> in the Ubuntu Discourse forum, Oliver Smith who is the Interim Engineering Director for Ubuntu Desktop, talked about issues with Snap + NVIDIA + Steam. The team has worked on a "more permissive AppArmor profile" for the Steam Snap package to "grant broader permissions to the snap" and that this "looks to resolve a majority of outstanding game compatibility issues that were not present in the Steam deb".</p>
<p>So hopefully, this will mean the Steam Snap package, that Canonical promoted from experimental to stable, will actually be properly usable soon.</p>
<p>It was also mentioned how they found issues with the NVIDIA 550 driver, which have been fixed. Thankfully that's coming sooner rather than later with a newer version of snapd that will arrive before Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS. Additionally there's some better testing in place now for future driver updates.</p>
<p>Thanks to all this they "expect a significant improvement in the quality of compatibility of the Steam snap".</p>
<p>Also, if you're looking for a job, Canonical are again hiring for more <a href="https://canonical.com/careers/all?filter=Engineering" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Desktop Software Engineers</a>.</p>
<p><em>Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS is due out on August 29th.</em></p>

      <title>Check out the fancy new trailer for Beyond All Reason a really great free and open source RTS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Beyond All Reason is quietly building up to be one of the best real-time strategy (RTS) games around. It's free, open source and it has a fancy new trailer.</p>
<p>Technically, it's nowhere near finished as a game, they call it "Alpha+" but it's extremely playable and is a huge amount of fun to send massive armies across the map. I've been playing it for quite some time now and really enjoy their attention to the details.</p>
<p>A lot of history to this one too going all the way back to the 1997 classic Total Annihilation. Beyond All Reason originally used the <a href="https://springrts.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SpringRTS</a> (Spring Engine) game engine, which itself started off life as a 3D game engine for classic Total Annihilation. Beyond All Reason is also a fork of Balanced Annihilation, a mod for SpringRTS. Nowadays it runs on <a href="https://beyond-all-reason.github.io/spring/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Recoil</a>, a "hard fork of Spring".</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<p>You can download and play right now from the <a href="https://www.beyondallreason.info/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official site</a>. A Steam release is planned eventually.</p>

If you want to see how well it will work with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> on Desktop Linux or Steam Deck, there's a demo available right now too.</p>

Before long, Clive will be caught up in a great tragedy and swear revenge on the Dark Eikon Ifrit, a mysterious entity that brings calamity in its wake.</p>

      <title>Get ready to collect some Rabbits in Usagi Shima: Bunny Island</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Usagi Shima: Bunny Island is a game I've been following for quite some time, as it looks adorable (and as a Rabbit owner I couldn't resist) and it finally has a Steam page. Currently available on mobile platforms, it was built with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> so hopefully they won't have too much trouble with a PC release, which will come with Linux support too.</p>
<p>A nice relaxing casual game for those of you who prefer the more chilled side of gaming. As the developer said: "It is heavily inspired by cute, soothing games like Neko Atsume and Animal Crossing.

      <title>Colony building sim Odd Realm is officially out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After being in Early Access for a few years, Unknown Origin Games have now fully launched their mystical colony sim Odd Realm.</p>
<p>A pretty complex game inspired by the likes of RimWorld and Dwarf Fortress, it's one where you could end up spending days in it. Start off with nothing, and eventually watch as your little pixel people do your bidding and build up a big bustling colony. Dig deep for riches and watch out for some less than friendly neighbours.</p>
<p>Check out the brand new trailer for the 1.0 release:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="opFFQLdP-5M"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/82ed98142d827172cfc123504e562ce8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/opFFQLdP-5M" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking about the release the developer said: "I started making this little game at the beginning of 2017. I didn't know what I was getting into at the time, but I knew I wanted to make a colony sim set in a strange, little fantasy world. It has been a monumental challenge, and it's because of your constant patience and encouragement that I was able to get to 1.0. Especially over the last several months where players have helped me find bugs in the beta or simply kept me company. So, for that, truly, a genuine thank you to all of you.</p>
<p>And if you are a new player, thank you for playing my game. It means a great deal to me.</p>
<p>Now, this isn't the end. We are just getting cooking! If you've read my previous posts, you know that there's a lot planned for upcoming versions of the game."</p>
<p>The developer confirmed more is coming including another playable race, overworld conquest, deeper history and events, modding support, localization and more content overall.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Current features:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 races to start your kingdom with, each with unique playstyles.</li>
<li>Unlimited procedurally generated deserts, mountains, tropical islands, and frozen tundras.</li>
<li>Dynamic weather and seasons unique to each biome.</li>
<li>Hundreds of plants, animals, and items.</li>
<li>A research tree with options for each race that unlock new blueprints and rooms.</li>
<li>Outfit individual settlers with tools, weapons, and gear.</li>
<li>Manage your kingdom and view other kingdoms on an expansive world map.</li>
<li>Battle raiders, invading armies, and underground horrors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Odd Realm has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Playable.</p>

      <title>GOG confirm Resident Evil 2 re-release date for August</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news retro game lovers, as <a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a> have now confirmed that <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/resident_evil_2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Resident Evil 2</a> is due to get its re-release on August 27th.

<p>Like with the first, GOG are ensuring there's a bunch of updates to get it working nicely including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>

<li>6 localizations of the game included (English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Japanese).</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For Linux Desktop and Steam Deck players, you'll need Wine / Proton to play it, but hopefully this will be the best edition of the classic given that impressive sounding list. Getting GOG games on Linux is pretty darn easy with my favourite <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/heroic-games-launcher-v215-has-expanded-gog-support-ea-games-from-epic-store-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher which only just had some big GOG improvements</a> too.</p>

      <title>shapez 2 is an absurdly great and accessible factory-building game out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Time to cut some shapes, and I don't mean on the dance floor. Factory-building sim shapez 2 is out now in Early Access with Linux support. <em>Note: Key provided by GameDriveNL.</em></p>
<p>The idea here is that there's this big swirly hungry vortex, it's desperately hungry for some shapes, and it's your job to pull them all out and send them into the void. How you go about that is your choice, it mostly leaves you to just chill out and have fun building these massive ridiculous sprawling factories across a gigantic map.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15528492201723827823gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15528492201723827823gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Stacking circles on top of squares, and cutting squares into tiny squares.</em></p>
<p>shapez 2 has done something truly quite exceptional here. Not only has improved on the idea of the first game in pretty much every possible way, it's done so while adding deeper gameplay mechanics and moved it from 2D to full 3D. I'm honestly astonished at every part of it. Not only does it run really well, but it looks quite pretty too. Seeing all sorts of shapes flowing across the map is quite mesmerising.</p>
<p>The way everything just flows is impressive, and how it eases you into it carefully but quite quickly you soon get to grips with the mechanics. That's also thanks to the very clear interface, clearly a lot of attention has gone into all the little things with shapez 2. Plenty of clear and easily explained details from the in-game guide for any time you lost too.</p>
<p>Not only is it now in 3D, but it's multi-layered too, so you'll be building conveyor belts on top of other belts, dropping things on top of each other. But even there, the controls and UI are really super-simple to understand and it just makes it so satisfying to play. I will admit there was a brief bit of confusion there, but again due to how clear the UI and style of the game is, it's not frustrating, and there's no punishments, you just delete a few belts and re-do it quickly and easily.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SFoml48FR2M"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/be3417b8476aac2e78935fe3a3aa1d65.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SFoml48FR2M" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Once you really get going, giving you a chance to sit back and what all the moving pieces while you progress through the next shape quest, it feels like watching a fancy Rube Goldberg machine, like being a child again watching marbles just fall through various things to eventually drop into something.</p>
<p>It takes the most basic elements of Factorio, Satisfactory and other similar titles and really distils it into the purest form of factory building. One that's great for the more casual audience, but just as engrossing for those who love the chaos that can come from others, it just has a bit of everything but with no pesky aliens to worry about coming along and wrecking your perfect designs.</p>
<p>Current features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi-Layer 3D Factories:</strong> Design and optimize your factories in a whole new dimension.</li>
<li><strong>Trains: </strong>Connect distant stations with a network of space trains.</li>
<li><strong>Research System:</strong> Unlock buildings, mechanics &amp; upgrades in the all-new tech tree.</li>
<li><strong>New Shape Mechanics: </strong>Discover new shapes types with unique properties and logic.</li>
<li><strong>Blueprint Library: </strong>Save, load, export and share factory design blueprints with anyone.</li>
<li><strong>All-new Visuals: </strong>Build factories and stations in a stunning immersive space environment.</li>
<li><strong>Fluids: </strong>Use different types of liquids to process shapes or boost production.</li>
<li><strong>Animated Open Buildings: </strong>See what's happening inside buildings in your factory.</li>
<li><strong>Easy editing: </strong>Cutting, cloning, rotating and destroying sections of your factory has never been so intuitive.</li>
<li><strong>Undo/Redo: </strong>Gain the ability to undo/redo unwanted operations.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>With the Native Linux version tested, I've not encountered any problems. It's silky smooth, looks good, performs well and no graphical issues noted. Probably one of the best launches (especially for Early Access) that I've seen for some time. There's a lot to like about this one that I can truly see myself spending numerous hours in.</p>
<p>From the press release: Tobias Springer, founder of tobspr Games, said “We’re very excited and proud to have finally launched shapez 2 into Early Access. This game has been a labor of love so we couldn’t be happier with what we have managed to deliver to our players at Early Access launch. The game is already in a fantastic state but as we move forward, we are going to continue to develop it by listening to our community and implementing features that will make it even better for both our fans and those new to the factory building genre. We’re hugely thankful for the support we have received so far and look forward to continuing building shapez 2 into an even more satisfying strategy experience”.</p>
<p>No surprise to see before publishing the article, a quick check on Steam shows an Overwhelmingly Positive user rating. One I truly think is 100% deserves here.</p>

      <title>Vampire Survivors gets free content in The Darkasso update, online co-op still in development </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The game that started it all and has been cloned repeatedly, Vampire Survivors has another free update out with The Darkasso update. After some truly cryptic and confusing teasers, the developers have now properly announced it.</p>
<p>Non-spoilery version of what's in the update::</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>9 new EXTRA achievements</li>
<li>1 new challenge stage</li>
<li>1 new relic</li>
<li>2 new special character skins</li>
<li>5 new Arcanas</li>
<li>🦇🦇🦇</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And they have another ridiculous trailer to go along with it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZY-SoV-A39s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3c0d76a08e1c88ad4356540befe8606d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZY-SoV-A39s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For those waiting on the online co-op support, they said it's still progressing well but too early to give details. As for other things to come, they're still being quite secretive there, other than saying "we have put one on hold, substituted another one, two are still ongoing, and finally we have greenlit 2 of them" with more details coming in 2025 on whatever it is.</p>
<p>They also joked how they basically throw darts on their roadmap on what to pick:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2388482051723821064gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2388482051723821064gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Other bug fixes and improvements from patch 1.11 include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Obtaining the Yellow Sign also allows to see if a treasure chest has the potential to contain an evolution (Silver Chests)<br/>
- Carréllo projectiles won't be destroyed anymore when they hit the top or bottom edge of the screen<br/>
- GoldFingers are now pulled into Mad Groove, unless spawned directly on the map (e.g. Astral Stair ones are ignored)<br/>
- Fix for negative coin values (added correction on save data load)<br/>
- Fixed dodgy price formatting on powerups<br/>
- Fix for controller navigation on long lists on the recap page<br/>
- Fix for displaying over 5 arcanas in pause page<br/>
- Fix inversion of trigger zones in stages with visual inversion not allowed<br/>
- Fixed bestiary text overflow<br/>
- Fix for Pentagram scaring the rising water but not the Drowner<br/>
- Various fixes to Arcana selection and draft screens<br/>
- Various fixes to cursor navigation when playing co-op<br/>
- Stacking multiples of the same added weapons in recap screen (eg candy box)<br/>
- [Moonspell] Nightsword and Muramasa deal bonus damage depending on Greed<br/>
- [Foscari] Fixed collision shape and stats scaling of SpellStream<br/>
- [Foscari] Fixed Insatiable by making magnet values match original intended JS version<br/>

      <title>Get ready to paint the world in tracks with Super Loco World from the Farlanders creator</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developer of Farlanders, Andriy Bychkovskyi, has revealed their next game with Super Loco World, a train building management and automation sim. With a soft casual style it looks quite inviting, but that definitely seems like it hides the complexities of it. For anyone who loves traffic management sims, railroad tycoon-styled games, this may be one for you.</p>
<p>Unlike some other games, the trains won't magically be able to turn around. So here, you really have the challenge of not only getting trains from station to station across a dynamic world, but you need to ensure they can actually get back the other way.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5761523191723815009gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5761523191723815009gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1696140041723815011gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1696140041723815011gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>On top of that, there's a lot of management and automation at play here. You need to set all their speeds, manage the junctions, rail signals and much more. The developer mentioned how you're free to experiment with it as the game "encourages creativity and does not penalize you for rebuilding railroads or infrastructure".</p>
<p>As you build up your networks the world evolves with you with expanding villages that grow into small town and eventually bigger. Trains actually consume fuel here too, so you'll need stations for that, along with the money to keep it all ticking over. However, as a nice little accessibility feature, fuel cost can be turned off.</p>
<p>Each time is fresh too with the game world and resource distribution being randomly generated.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="L0KZyRC55ng"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9d17a02b4b4b8e908732ce0f75ac7ee3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/L0KZyRC55ng" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer told me over email it will have full Native Linux support. Sounds like a nice one to keep an eye on. Looks really quite charming.</p>

<p>Factorio is a game about building and automating, but it's also all about defending from vicious aliens and the new lot coming in Factorio: Space Age look like the stuff of nightmares.</p>
<p>The developers have been showing off some of the new planets coming with the expansion that's due in October, and one planet they've been highlighting recently is <a href="https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-413" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gleba</a>. Originally known internally as the "biological planet", it looks a whole lot more alive than other planets. In fact, it looks really gross and vibrant and I can't wait to explore and cover it with belts.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11590479021723811934gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11590479021723811934gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12491440531723811936gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12491440531723811936gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>In the <a href="https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-424" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest developer diary</a>, the team showed off some of the horrors that will await you on planet Gleba. And uh, you're going to need some firepower to deal with them. Based on "distant relatives of starfish or seastars", you'll be facing off against small and rather large 5-legged Pentapods.</p>
<p>Since Factorio will have multiple planets in the expansion, the developers are doing some interesting balancing work on the enemies here. As you might face them late in the game when you're fully equipped, or you might go in a bit under-prepared depending on where you expand. Thankfully, these new beasties won't seek you out right away to devour you, instead mainly focusing on protecting their nests or nearby allies. As the developer said they are "fairly passive" but "If you do fight them and win then they will evolve".</p>
<p>Have a look at them below:</p>

      <title>Chilled castle doodling game Tiny Glade releases September 23 and the demo is back</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tiny Glade is a wonderful idea, letting you just chilled out and doodle castles with their fantastic tools and it's now set to launch on September 23. It's also one of the <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/mostwished/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">most wishlisted</a> games on Steam, after the demo clearly hooked a lot of people in.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2198150/view/6124418777150844821" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Announced</a> on Steam as part of the Wholesome Games Festival, the demo is back up again and will be until it releases so you can get a taste of it again. It also has full Native Linux support. The demo was also updated with "small birdies, trapdoors, ability to move freehand walls, color lanterns, and many other tweaks across the smörgåsbord" so you may want to re-try it anyway.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CdWpq2efN8Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3320c22e3b2f4c041ffa8fcb1f88e0c4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CdWpq2efN8Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tiny Glade is a relaxing free-form building game. Tap into the joy of making something pretty with no management, no combat, or wrong answers - just kick back, doodle some castles, and turn forgotten meadows into lovable dioramas.</p>
<p>Explore gridless building chemistry, and watch the game carefully assemble every brick, pebble and plank. Draw a path through a wall? An arch pops up! Widen the arch? Pillars line up. Lower the wall? Arches turn into fences and gates.</p>
<p>There are no wrong answers or failure states. You can change your mind at any time, and whatever you make will look cozy out of the box.</p>

      <title>Free classic RTS OpenRA mod &#39;Command &amp; Conquer - Combined Arms&#39; has a huge overhaul</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you love your classic RTS games, especially those from Westwood like Command &amp; Conquer and Red Alert, you need to play the <a href="https://www.openra.net/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">OpenRA</a> mod Command &amp; Conquer - Combined Arms. <em>This standalone game mod for the open source OpenRA bundles in so much it's crazy.</em></p>
<p>Going over the changelog, it's quite ridiculous the amount that's included in this update. There's new artwork and visual effects, various new units across each faction, new structures, new gameplay mechanics and the list goes on.</p>
<p>One of the major additions is a change to the ranking system and upgrades. The Soviet side has an entirely new ranking system with more depth, while the Allied and Scrin factions now feature mutually exclusive upgrade paths, offering greater variety and strategic choices in the high-tech endgame. These enhancements will provide fresh tactical options and new ways to customize your forces.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13709213001723806588gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13709213001723806588gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

<p>Ready to go on an adventure? Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars: Reforged from Revolution Software Ltd is ready to release on September 19. A complete remaster of the original, first in the series, it comes complete with Native Linux support.</p>
<p>This is thanks to their previous Kickstarter campaign where the developer raised £618,626 in funds.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“Point and click offers a simple interface from which captivating, challenging gameplay emerges,” says Charles Cecil, founder and CEO of Revolution Software. “But the user experience has remained unchanged since the ‘90s when Broken Sword redefined the genre. Our research suggested that gamers now prefer a more contemporary experience. Broken Sword has a hugely passionate fan base, which runs over three generations. With these graphic and user experience enhancements, we look forward to hearing from fans once the game crosses over, once again, to a fourth generation who love narrative-driven games.”</p>

      <title>Hunt: Showdown 1896 broke on Linux / Steam Deck, here&#39;s the quick fix for now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 17/08/24, 9:00 UTC</strong>: Proton Hotfix was updated with the needed fix to get it working. Valve has set this by default for it so you should uncheck any forced compatibility options you have set. Nice to see Valve react so quickly once again.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Hunt: Showdown had a huge update and rebranded to Hunt: Showdown 1896, but the update came with breakage on Linux Desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Valve have been really quick at times when this sort of thing happens to bigger games. And once again, Valve to the rescue. Use this fix at your own risk though, as it can cause other issues, it will also affect any other games you currently have set to Proton Experimental.</p>
<p>For the fix:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Proton Experimental in your Steam Library.</li>
<li>Go into Properties -&gt; Betas.</li>
<li>Select the "bleeding-edge latest and untested dxvk, vkd3d-proton and wine changes; backup your prefixes before using" (not the 8.0 version!).</li>
<li>Then ensure Proton Experimental has updated.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19425189781723801884gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19425189781723801884gol1.png"/></a></p>
<ul>
<li>After that, find Hunt: Showdown 1896 in your Steam Library.</li>
<li>Go into Properties -&gt; Compatibility, tick the box and select Proton Experimental.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20752440071723801978gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20752440071723801978gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>After that, you'll be good to go. No doubt a fresh normal version of Proton Experimental will come soon so that first part eventually won't be needed.</p>
<p>What's new in the game? Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New Map – Mammon's Gulch, a whole new biome set in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado.</li>
<li>New Wild Target – the Hellborn is Hunt's newest Wild Target who uses an onslaught of fiery attacks. Once downed, the Hellborn will grant a Bounty Token with no Banish time.</li>
<li>Scorched Earth – a new Live Event giving players brand-new rewards to earn.</li>
<li>New CRYEINGINE 5.11 integration – ushering in upgraded visuals, audio, performance, and more.</li>
<li>New UI - overhauled to improve navigation, with plenty more updates to come.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's the trailer for the new update:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="16vBsmpcxh4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8d7e8b8499d36f5460941ceba538b761.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/16vBsmpcxh4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's having a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/594650/Hunt_Showdown_1896/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Free Weekend on Steam</a> right now too so you can try before you buy.</p>

      <title>Valve released Windows drivers for Steam Deck OLED but no official support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While it is not in any way officially supported by Valve, they have now released Windows drivers for the newer Steam Deck OLED model.</p>
<p>Since the Steam Deck ships with SteamOS (Linux) out of the box, and all of Valve's work goes into that, you're basically on your own if you choose to put Windows on the Steam Deck OLED. As per the <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/6121-ECCD-D643-BAA8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">support page</a>, they note very clearly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are providing these resources as is and are unfortunately unable to offer 'Windows on Deck' support. If you get stuck and need a way back to the default Steam Deck OS, please follow <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/1B71-EDF2-EB6D-2BB3" rel="noopener" target="_blank">these recovery instructions</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>This is the same status for the original Steam Deck LCD model.</em></p>
<p>If you do wish to do so, you'll need to first update to SteamOS 3.6.9+ (currently in Beta/Preview), which includes the latest firmware. The drivers for Windows also need a <em>manual</em> download for each one including: APU, Audio, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth drivers. Currently though, the audio drivers only enable audio via headphones or Bluetooth, work for the speakers is still ongoing.</p>
<p>Dual-booting is also still not supported either but that is being worked on still but there's no timeline for it.</p>
<p>If you're thinking about Windows due to other stores and launchers, perhaps first look into the likes of the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/heroic-games-launcher-v215-has-expanded-gog-support-ea-games-from-epic-store-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/nonsteamlaunchers-decky-loader-plugin-for-steam-deck-released/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NonSteamLaunchers</a>.</p>

      <title>Stellaris Cosmic Storms expansion will launch September 10</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Might be time for another run in Stellaris with the Cosmic Storms announced today to release on September 10th. Developed in collaboration with Behaviour Rotterdam, it's set to expand space weather in a big way.</p>
<p>Not only have they totally overhauled the original Space Storm into an entire system of features, but there's also a new weather map mode for forecasting these storms and predicting their motion, with technologies and buildings to attract, repel, or with an Ascension Perk, even create storms.</p>
<p>While some storm may be bad, not everything will be, some may reveal buried treasures for you or leave planets with new intriguing effects. Check out the release date trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2VfVkAHidAY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0c35fc6ea4a4d230488df7413e988886.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2VfVkAHidAY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What you get with the DLC:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NEW STORMS</strong></p>
<p>This expansion adds 8 types of Cosmic Storms (Electric, Particle, Gravity, Magnetic, Radiant, Stardust, Shroud and Nexus) that replace the existing Space Storms, spawning randomly on the map. They travel the galaxy at various speeds, growing and shrinking with time.</p>
<p><strong>STORM CHASER ORIGIN</strong></p>
<p>The Storm Chasers are an empire made of people that seek to push themselves beyond their own limits. They believe enlightenment is found in engaging with the greatest force the universe has to offer: the Cosmic Storms.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>3 NEW CIVICS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Astrometeorology</li>
<li>Storm Devotion</li>
<li>Environmental Architects</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2 PRECURSOR NARRATIVES</strong></p>
<p>Discover the stories of the Ancients, vanished masters of the storms: Weather Manipulators and the adAkkaria Convention of Benevolence. The completion of these narratives will unlock a new relic for each.</p>
<p>On top of that, <em>Cosmic Storms</em> adds technologies dedicated to storms, Galactic Community Resolutions, Anomalies, Arc Sites, and Weather Forecast Map Mode. It also adds a new Galactic Weather Control ascension perk, that makes it possible to create cosmic storms with science ships.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can pre-purchase for €12.99 / $12.99 / £10.99 or buy it as part of Stellaris: Season 08 - Expansion Pass.</p>
<p>Stellaris has Native Linux support and you can buy it from:</p>

      <title>NonSteamLaunchers Decky Loader plugin for Steam Deck released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Making it perhaps easier than ever to get more stores and launchers onto your Steam Deck, the <a href="https://github.com/moraroy/NonSteamLaunchers-On-Steam-Deck" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NonSteamLaunchers</a> plugin for Decky Loader is now available. It's been in testing for a while, but now it's available in the main Decky Loader store.</p>
<p>It supports installing and setting up Amazon Games Launcher, Battle.net, EA App, Epic Games, GOG Galaxy, Humble Games Collection, IndieGala, itch.io, Rockstar Games, Ubisoft Connect and various others.</p>
<p>You'll need to <em>first</em> install <a href="https://decky.xyz/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Decky Loader</a>, which is incredibly simple now. Just hit the download on the official site in Desktop Mode, then double-click it to run it from your Downloads folder and follow the plain on-screen instructions. Once done, you can just boot back into Gaming Mode and install NonSteamLaunchers right from the Decky Loader store.</p>
<p>Finding it in the Decky Loader store:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6431428211723732190gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6431428211723732190gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Once installed, it gives you a few different options:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19130586111723732191gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19130586111723732191gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Picking to install the Epic Games Store as an example:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14611314171723732192gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14611314171723732192gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15176184961723732192gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15176184961723732192gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>And finally, there it is all installed for me with a nice shortcut in the Non-Steam part of your Steam Library:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14065529931723732290gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14065529931723732290gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>There's a lot of different stores and launchers, so this really can just help simplify the process. There's other methods of course like the Heroic Games Store for Epic, GOG and Amazon Prime Games but NonSteamLaunchers uses the official launchers run through Proton.</p>
<p>You'll see this addition from <a href="http://github.com/moraroy/NonSteamLaunchers-On-Steam-Deck/releases/tag/v3.9.3" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NonSteamLaunchers v3.9.3</a> which also includes a few other enhancements.</p>

      <title>Godot Engine 4.3 is out now with huge new features and a fancy release page</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Looks like the Godot team went all-out for the Godot Engine 4.3 release, bringing this royalty-free open source game engine into a bright future.</p>
<p>Their new <a href="https://godotengine.org/releases/4.3/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release page</a> is certainly more interesting than before! Instead of paragraphs of text, they more clearly show off all the new stuff included (a bit more like how Blender do their release pages). This is probably the most truly professional I've seen Godot seem.</p>
<p>Some really impressive features added in this release too!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14115793751723729579gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14115793751723729579gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
Pictured - Godot 4.3, messing with the <a href="https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2755" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Voxel Game Demo</a>.</p>
<p>Some highlights of the new features includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>New audio resources to make complex, layered music and transitions.</li>
<li>2D physics interpolation.</li>
<li>An overhauled visual shader editor.</li>
<li>General multi-threading improvements.</li>
<li>More flexible layers for TileMaps.</li>
<li>New skeletal animation import options.</li>
<li>Improved pixel art stability.</li>
<li>Big improvement to Godot's parallax system.</li>
<li>Project Manager design improvements.</li>
<li>Depth-based fog now possible.</li>
<li>Direct3D 12 support.</li>
<li>A Compositor effects API to let users hook into the built in Godot rendering.</li>
<li>More Wayland improvements on Linux but still opt-in.</li>
<li>2D content renders less blurry in XR.</li>
<li>Slimmer GDScript project exports with Binary tokenization.</li>
<li>+ lots more. Seriously there's loads.</li>
</ul>
