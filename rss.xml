      <title>Wine 9.22 released noting the &#39;Wayland driver enabled in default configuration&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Closing in on the Wine 10 stable release now! Wine 9.22 has been released, ahead of the first release candidate for Wine 10 in two weeks time. The Wine 10 release itself is <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/windows-to-linux-compatibility-layer-wine-10-0-planned-for-mid-january-2025/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">due for sometime around mid-January</a>.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/releases/wine-9.22" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release notes</a> the highlights are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Support for display mode virtualization.</li>
<li>Locale data updated to Unicode CLDR 46.</li>
<li>More support for network sessions in DirectPlay.</li>
<li>Wayland driver enabled in default configuration.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Going by the <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/merge_requests/5583" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitLab</a>, it seems Wayland is only currently used when x11 fails. So it's enabled, but not the default go-to, likely as more Wayland work still needs to be done.</p>
<p>There's also bug fixes noted for Dark Souls Remastered, World Of Warcraft and Steam. Plus a few other miscellaneous behaviour fixes.</p>

      <title>War Thunder adds stealth tech, ray tracing and graphics upgrades in the Firebirds update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Every time a new War Thunder update comes out, I think to myself: I'm finally going to progress a bit more into the aircraft research and then get side-tracked by tanks. But now, with stealth added in the Firebirds update, I might just have to sink some more hours in.</p>
<p>An exciting addition is the F-117A (Squadron Vehicle) which brings in a brand new stealth capability to the game. The developers note this craft has a "lower IR and radio signature". There's also multiple other aircraft including the F-15E, Su-34, Tornado GR.4 and Mirage 2000 RMV. There's also multiple new helicopters and new tanks.</p>
<p>But there's a lot more to this update as they've added in AMD FSR 3.1, DLAA, XeSS, TSR, Direct3D 12 (beta) and Ray Tracing (beta) with an overhaul to the graphics settings menu. They say they're looking at adding frame generation for a future update too. There's also some small reworks to multiple locations, but the "Abandoned Factory" got a huge upgrade visually and looks awesome. </p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Z7_LWZxyhdY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e334888f3a100ccc516be905aecdd337.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Z7_LWZxyhdY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While it has Native Linux support with Vulkan, it looks like AMD FSR, XeSS and Ray Tracing are all currently only available via DirectX 12 - so you'll need to run War Thunder with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> to see any of that. <em>I'm hoping they continue to work on their Vulkan renderer too.</em></p>
<p>See a lot more about the update on the Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/236390/view/4455841997094125905" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>.</p>

      <title>Check out the new trailer for Truckful, a driving adventure mystery game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Truckful was revealed back in July, and the idea of it had me really intrigued and now they have a new trailer up for this driving action-adventure mystery game. It will have Native Linux support at release.</p>
<p>What seems like initially a peaceful but challenging game about trucking and delivering packages, where you upgrade your vehicle as you go, and have to learn how to handle some tricky roads with all sorts of packages seems to soon turn into something a bit weirder. As they said when it was announced: </p>
<p>"This seemingly idyllic countryside hides its fair share of mysteries, though. The ancient forest on the outskirts whispers through local legends and folklore, its dense canopy creating an unsettling atmosphere, with something lurking in the shadows… Explore hidden paths, navigate misty wetlands, and brave treacherous marshes and quicksands to uncover the truth beneath the branches."</p>
<p>Anyway, announced during The MIX Fall Showcase 2024 was a new trailer you can see below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="sS3hpCthbqg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f1beb824aab9502bc742aeaa0b54a86d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/sS3hpCthbqg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drive, upgrade and customize your pickup truck</li>
<li>Pack the truck bed with cargo of all shapes and sizes</li>
<li>Complete errands for villagers in need</li>
<li>Enjoy a physics-based car handling gameplay</li>
<li>Unravel the mystery of the old forest</li>
</ul>

      <title>Free-to-play pixel art survival game Ruins To Fortress arrives December 13</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ruins To Fortress looks like it could be interesting, a post-apocalyptic free-to-play pixel art open survival game. The developers have announced it's going to enter Early Access on December 13th.</p>
<p>Like a sort of blending somewhere between Terraria and Starbound, set on a single island where you craft tools, grow food, build formidable defences, and raze enemy bases. Here though you can either cooperate, or go after rivals so it's more on the competitive side. So perhaps a bit more like a side-scrolling Rust as you'll be able to host your own servers too.</p>
<p>They also have a new trailer to show it off:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WH9SqPen_bY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0e1a2014cbd212f49d0e3546bba33a15.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WH9SqPen_bY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Since it will be free they will be offering a single DLC to support the game that will include what sounds like mostly cosmetic items.</p>
<p>It will have Native Linux support at release.</p>
<p></p>

      <title>Oxygen Not Included gets a Free Weekend, big update live and new DLC coming soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oxygen Not Included is one of my favourites from Klei Entertainment, a space-colony simulation game that's Steam Deck Verified and has full Native Linux support.</p>
<p>If you still haven't tried it out, there's good news. A Free Weekend for it is live on Steam so you can try it completely free all weekend, and it has a big 66% discount on it too.</p>
<p>A new DLC was also revealed with Oxygen Not Included: The Bionic Booster Pack that "revolutionizes the workforce with new bionic Duplicants, skill-enhancing bionic booster modules, portable power storage, and remote-work buildings—everything you need to create a colony of cosmic proportions".</p>
<p>These bionic Duplicants sound really useful, since they can work in low-breathability environments thanks to having their own little oxygen supply. A lot more to it like portable power banks for your bionic buddies, rockets that can be pilot-less, remote-work buildings and new cosmetic items. No release date for it yet though.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20774611031732273143gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>As for the free update for all players it's quite a big one too. It includes new buildings for everyone, upgrades to the schedule system, various UI improvements and lots of bug fixes across the base game and other DLC.</p>

      <title>Mesa 24.3.0 graphics drivers for Linux released with many new features and bug fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Dylan Baker announced the early release of Mesa 24.3.0, the latest set of Linux open source graphics drivers full of new features. As usual they suggested waiting on Mesa 24.3.1 if you want stability.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the release announcement email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I'd hoped we were able to pull in the Mesa 24.3 release cycle by one week! Thanks to everyone who helped close or dismiss blocking issues! This is great, as it means we'll leap frog both the US Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. This does mean that we will have a release due on New Years day, I will release that either the Thursday or Friday if there anything worth releasing (that two weeks is generally quite slow), otherwise we'll plan to just skip that resume on January 15th.</p>
<p>This release has seen the continuing trend of OpenGL work slowing down and Vulkan work speeding up. Anv, Radv, Nvk, and v3dv dominate the list of new features, with v3dv gaining Vulkan 1.3 conformance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the <a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/relnotes/24.3.0.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release notes</a> all of these are newly supported features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expose Vulkan 1.3 on v3dv, both rpi4 and rpi5</li>
<li>VK_EXT_descriptor_buffer on nvk</li>
<li>VK_EXT_post_depth_coverage on nvk</li>
<li>VK_KHR_video_maintenance1 on radv</li>
<li>VK_EXT_legacy_vertex_attributes on nvk</li>
<li>GL_KHR_shader_subgroup on radeonsi</li>

<li>GL_EXT_disjoint_timer_query on Panfrost</li>
<li>VK_KHR_pipeline_binary on RADV</li>
<li>VK_KHR_compute_shader_derivatives on anv</li>

<li>VK_KHR_shader_relaxed_extended_instruction on anv, hasvk, hk, nvk, radv, tu, v3dv, lvp</li>
<li>GL_OVR_multiview and GL_OVR_multiview2 on zink</li>
<li>VK_KHR_shader_float_controls2 on radv</li>
<li>VK_KHR_shader_float_controls2 on nvk</li>
<li>VK_EXT_device_generated_commands on nvk, radv</li>
<li>VK_EXT_host_image_copy on nvk/Turing+</li>
<li>VK_EXT_depth_clamp_control on anv, hasvk, nvk, radv</li>
<li>VK_KHR_shader_quad_control on nvk</li>

<li>VK_EXT_depth_clamp_zero_one on NVK</li>

</ul>
<p>There's also bug fixes noted across different drivers for Red Dead Redemption 2, Resident Evil 6 Benchmark Tool, Total War Warhammer 2, OpenMW, Silent Hill 2 Remake, War Thunder, Detroit Become Human, Deadlock, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, Ion Fury, Genshin Impact, Black Myth Wukong, Dota 2, Counter-Strike 2, Fallout 3 and various other games. Plus a few improvements to the shader cache.</p>

      <title>Dungeon Clawler will grab hold of your free time now it&#39;s in Early Access, plus keys to give away</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Stray Fawn Studio developers of The Wandering Village and Nimbatus have released their latest game into Early Access with Dungeon Clawler. It has Native Linux support, and while it has no Steam Deck rating yet the developer mentioned they've done extensive testing to ensure it's a good experience.</p>
<p>Ever lost a good amount of change to a claw machine in an arcade? I know I have. When you think "that next coin will do it!", well it's a little like that, only you <em>won't</em> lose so much money (it's only £8.50). Here it blends a claw machine, with a deck-builder, turn-based combat and a little bit of dungeon exploration on top. Pretty clever and unique, especially with all the different ways it will mess with you.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3UDTxqZf0qw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/30f0095372d7abb081ead50f08a711f4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3UDTxqZf0qw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The ultimate claw machine roguelike experience..</li>
<li>Alot of interesting items and perks to build your deck</li>
<li>Unique characters each with their different strengths and weaknesses.</li>
<li>Multiple difficulty levels and unlockable lucky paws to customize your run.</li>
<li>Break the game – go crazy with different claw and item synergies.</li>
<li>Venture into mystery locations and discover treasures as well as strange and dangerous obstacles.</li>
<li>Spend your hard earned coins in the dungeon's pachinko machines..</li>
<li>Meet different characters who might help you on your journey.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A little history behind its development:</p>
<p>"Dungeon Clawler is Stray Fawn Studio's fifth self-developed game. It started as a small side project of Micha, one of the studio's co-founders. Fueled by the passion for roguelike-games and a fondness for claw machines that they first discovered on a journey to Tokyo (and its arcades), the project grew and garnered more and more interest. It has now blossomed into a unique roguelike deckbuilding experience, combining the elements of traditional deckbuilders with an arcade-like claw machine mechanic." — Stray Fawn Studio</p>
<p>Gosh I love indie developers, making all kinds of smaller games that really suck you in like this.</p>
<p><strong>Giveaway</strong></p>
<p>Want to win a copy? The developer sent over two Steam keys to give away. All you have to do is comment clearly you would like to enter. This is open to all users old and new. Giveaway will end Monday, November 25th at 7PM UTC. Winners will be sent a DM here on GamingOnLinux.</p>

      <title>Give your Steam Deck a refreshed look with these new Razer skins</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Popular hardware vendor Razer have announced a couple of new fancy skins for the Steam Deck, so if you're wanting to give it a little more style perhaps you might find something you like.</p>
<p>I have to admit, I didn't even know Razer were doing skins for the Steam Deck until a link was dropped into the <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux Discord</a>. They actually have 9 flashy looking covers to wrap around your Deck to keep it cosy and looking fresh. A nice alternative to swapping the shell from the likes of JSAUX and eXtremeRate, or buying a Limited Edition Steam Deck from Valve.</p>
<p>The two new skins are Sludge:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2048925951732204208gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2048925951732204208gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19473990861732204209gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19473990861732204209gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>And then Acid Sludge:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1052007531732204209gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1052007531732204209gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8729992971732204247gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/8729992971732204247gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Must admit, that Acid Sludge really does look <em>awesome</em> on the back of the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Annoyingly, they don't seem to be available in the UK, so I couldn't get them even if I wanted. Looks like they might only be available in the US.</p>
<p>See more on the <a href="https://www.razer.com/skins" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Razer store</a>.</p>
<p>Have you got a skin on your Steam Deck? Did you manage to get it bubble free? Leave a comment.</p>

      <title>Squad-tactics cyberpunk strategy game Cyber Knights: Flashpoint now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The supremely cool XCOM-like squad-tactics game Cyber Knights: Flashpoint from developers Trese Brothers is now properly Steam Deck Verified. After going through over 170 updates in Early Access, the Trese Brothers are absolutely relentless at expanding the game and enhancing it from player input. </p>
<p>As they said in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1021210/view/4445710804718714886" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many thanks to the players in the forums, on reddit and in our Discord who have been giving us feedback on both our default controls and the Steam Deck experience. We're continuing to work on improvements here and there (e.g. the filtering in cold storage, squashing any bugs reported through the in-game click left stick system), but the overall playability is feeling great. Verification signifies we've now checked off the final few details with text size (adjustable in the Options menu as well) and every keybinding in the game properly showing controller prompts (all fully rebindable). And Cyber Knights provides a native Linux build, so great performance with no need for Proton.<br/>
<br/>
As most of you know, we're on a hot streak with...</p>
<ul>
<li>a new map being added each week</li>
<li>the new Gunslinger class (bringing us to 44 total possible character class combinations!)</li>
<li>last season's big push of major feature additions</li>
<li>being right on the threshold of Overwhelmingly Positive reviews</li>
</ul>
<p>...so Steam Deck Verification (and our ongoing rollout of new content) feels like a great way to wrap up the fall season. If you know any Deck players, please do tell them about our game!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16190216111732203574gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Absolutely love what they're doing with this game, I'm thoroughly amazed every time I jump in at how much they've expanded it.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Interesting industry news here for you, especially for developers. The Khronos Group announced they've launched the Slang Initiative, taking over the Slang shading language supported by NVIDIA since 2017.</p>
<p>No longer being tied to a single graphics vendor, instead under the wing of the multi-company governance at Khronos, means it can truly be a proper modern open standard for everyone. </p>
<p>Slang is supported across "D3D12, Vulkan, Metal, D3D11, OpenGL, CUDA, and even generate code to run on a CPU. For textual targets, such as Metal Shading Language (MSL) and CUDA".</p>
<p>Some choice quotes from the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/news/press/khronos-group-launches-slang-initiative-hosting-open-source-compiler-contributed-by-nvidia" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>:</p>
<p>“Slang is now a significant shading language option for graphics developers everywhere, as all are enabled to directly influence and participate in its ongoing development,” said Neil Trevett, president of The Khronos Group and vice president developer ecosystems, NVIDIA. “Khronos’s innovative Slang governance structure blends open-source development agility with the patent safeguards of open standards. Slang is freely available for any platform or API to use, including Khronos, which will leverage Slang in the Vulkan ecosystem while ensuring SPIR-V remains responsive to Slang’s requirements."</p>
<p>“NVIDIA will continue its longstanding investment in Slang, which is designed to meet the needs of today’s graphics developers while paving the way for the neural graphics revolution,” said Nicholas Haemel, vice president of graphics and system software, NVIDIA. “With Slang in open governance at Khronos, the graphics community can collaboratively advance and harness the advantages of cross-platform support, scalable graphics systems, reduced compile times, and enhanced modularity.”</p>
<p>“The process of getting our large HLSL shader codebase working with Slang went extremely smoothly. We were able to integrate Slang into the Source 2 engine and ship the generated SPIR-V into production on multiple titles, including Counter-Strike 2 and Dota 2, with minimal changes to our shaders. After completing the initial integration, we have since adopted some of the advanced features of Slang, such as BufferPointer, enumerants, interfaces, and generics. We are very thankful for NVIDIA offering Slang to the open-source community and believe ongoing contributions from multiple companies within Khronos will help ensure a healthy future for Slang,” said Dan Ginsburg, software developer, Valve.</p>

      <title>Steam getting proper Season Pass support with clearer guidelines and refunds for cancellations</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have another Steam store update incoming, with seemingly proper built-in support for a Season Pass along with new guidance for developers.</p>
<p>Initially spotted by SteamDB developer Pavel Djundik on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/xpaw.me/post/3lbfpzdgjdc23" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> pointing out a new Steamworks page for <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/seasonpass" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Season Passes</a>. Valve note on this page that Season Pass store pages will be listing all of the DLC included, along with their release dates. If developers aren't ready to clearly tell you when each DLC will be released then developers "shouldn't offer a Season Pass on Steam".</p>
<p>Valve said they will only offer Season Passes to developers "in a few rare cases with partners with which we have a well-established relationship and that have a proven track record on Steam".</p>
<p>The new guidelines include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a Season Pass is made available for purchase on Steam, it must include the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>A complete list of all DLC included in the Pass. (i.e. listing each of the four DLCs included in a Pass).</li>
<li>A basic description of the content that’s included in each DLC. For example, the first content release might be “The Glitterlands Expansion – New area to explore, two new weapons, and new enemies.” It’s not required for the DLC to have a final name at the launch of the Season Pass. The information about the content in the DLC doesn’t need to be detailed (simply “new weapons” or “two new weapons” is acceptable, they don’t have to list the exact weapons).</li>
<li>Expected release date for each DLC. Quarter and Year (i.e. January to March 2025) or Season/Year is acceptable. Of course, a date that’s more precise is also fine (i.e. June, 2025 or June 1st, 2025).</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>
<u>A Season Pass must include at least one released DLC when it is made available for purchase*</u><br/>
*with the exception of Season Passes included in a Pre-Purchase of a deluxe edition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If developers need to delay an included DLC they get a one-time release date delay by up to three months. If they need longer, they need to contact Valve directly. However, if a DLC in a Season Pass is cancelled, gamers will be "offered a refund for the value of unreleased DLC".</p>
<p>Not a big surprise to see, since it's a much-used feature by plenty of bigger developers. Just like with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/valve-makes-paid-advanced-access-a-clear-feature-on-steam-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Advanced Access being a thing</a>, Valve continue moving with what developers are doing. By making it an actual dedicated feature, Valve can ensure some quality-control there for gamers by holding developers to account on repeated delays and cancellations.</p>

      <title>Valve fixes up Steam Input bug with ROG Ally X</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/valve-confirm-plan-to-get-steam-decks-steamos-on-the-rog-ally-and-more-handhelds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve confirmed back in August</a> they still had plans to release SteamOS 3 outside of the Steam Deck for other handhelds, and it's nice to see they're still working away on the Steam Client for various hardware.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/gamescope-gets-improved-rog-ally-support-hinting-at-more-progress-for-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">In October</a> we saw an update for Gamescope from the community that improved configuring the display on the ASUS ROG Ally and the newer ASUS ROG Ally X, which <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steamos-alternative-bazzite-adds-support-for-onexplayer-plus-improvements-for-rog-ally/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">was actually for the SteamOS-like Bazzite</a>, one of the best ways to use Linux on various PC gaming handhelds.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Now the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/4489620901087674430?snr=2___" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">latest</a> Steam Client Beta has a fix included for Steam Input directly on the ASUS ROG Ally X:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Game Recording</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed audio desync that occurs for some videos when played in Steam or Chrome browser.</li>
<li>Added settings button to allow resetting the game recording folder to the default path.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed duplicate controllers showing up on the ROG Ally X.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Remote Play</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed store and community features being disabled when streaming to a Mac.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So at least for now if you're using some other form of Linux, like Bazzite, or Windows, with the latest Steam Client Beta the experience should be a little better without the duplicated controllers.</p>

      <title>itch.io store now requires AI generated content disclosures for assets</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With AI generated content continuing to spread everywhere, the <a href="http://itch.io" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">itch.io</a> store has made a change to now require AI generated content disclosures.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://itch.io/t/4309690/generative-ai-disclosure-tagging" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> it specifically mentions it's now <em>required</em> for "Asset Creators" meaning developers who provide things like graphics, sounds and more for developers to use in their games. All pages get the option though, so game developers can tag their creations as using or not using AI.</p>
<p>From their updated guidelines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We recently added the AI Disclosure feature. You will have time to review and update your pages accordingly, but we are strictly enforcing disclosure for all game asset pages due to legal ambiguity around rights associated with Generative AI content. Failure to tag your asset page may result in delisting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Valve made a similar move for Steam <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/valve-announces-new-rules-for-games-with-ai-content-on-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in early January</a>.</p>
<p>This is a good change, because the store is getting flooded with it. Doing a quick search today, and keep in mind this is only those that are correctly tagged, showed 1,214 assets on itch.io that were made using some form of AI generation versus 13,536 now tagged as not using AI generation.</p>
<p>A number of game developers have updated their itch.io pages too, with it showing 337 made using AI generation at time of writing.</p>

      <title>Monster catcher Cassette Beasts adds Steam Workshop support and a new battle mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cassette Beasts from Bytten Studio is a brilliant spin on the whole monster catching genre, and a fresh update out now continues expanding it.</p>
<p>The Gauntlet Update, version 1.7, has release and the first major addition is Magikrab's Gauntlet, a series of randomised combat encounters that can be played solo or online with a friend. And, to enhance things even further, modding should be a whole lot easier with Steam Workshop support now enabled for it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="auwooxCiZhU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/693bdbe001d8d0d23ac6ac673f9b8fc7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/auwooxCiZhU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Main New Additions:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Magikrab’s Gauntlet has been added. This is a new gameplay system that is available in Night’s Bridge Station after completing the Land of Confusion and Take Me On quests.
	<ul>
<li>In the gauntlet you face an endless series of randomised and increasingly difficult battles against friends and foes old and new.</li>
<li>You can take on the gauntlet on your own, or invite a friend through online multiplayer to take on the challenges together.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ranger Wilma now provides a Sticker Fusion service after you’ve completed Land of Confusion and Take Me On. Sticker Fusion allows you to move rare and uncommon attributes you like from one sticker to another.</li>
<li>After Frankie has completed her training, you can speak to her in the Town Hall to clear the ranger noticeboard of quests you don’t want. This costs a certain amount of Fused Material, and you get no quest rewards.</li>
<li>During multiplayer raids and gauntlet battles you can now:
	<ul>
<li>Use items</li>
<li>Fuse with your partner NPC</li>
<li>Switch to your partner NPC’s tape</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Steam Workshop support has been added.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Cassette Beasts has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified. It's also just thoroughly cool, you should check it out. Another great one made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot</a>.</p>

      <title>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well there's a surprise. Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered from Guerrilla Games / Nixxes Software and PlayStation Publishing has been given the Steam Deck Verified <img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> tick from Valve.</p>
<p>Despite the game bringing in some more enhanced rendering and updated graphics, it appears it's running well enough for Valve to think the "game works great on Steam Deck, right out of the box". It does, however, need an internet connection for first-time setup thanks to the forcing of a PlayStation Network Account.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rgDYyxOKBgg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bacbcfdc514ff85c6a89bad568a4607f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rgDYyxOKBgg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The release came with Ultrawide 21:9 and Super Ultrawide 32:9 resolutions, as well as 48:9 triple monitor support, NVIDIA DLSS 3, NVIDIA DLAA, NVIDIA Reflex, AMD FSR 3.1 and Intel XeSS. So if you're playing on Desktop Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> you've got plenty of options to tweak it to your liking.</p>
<p>Valve's testing on Steam Deck used the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/proton-90-3-released-and-proton-experimental-upgraded-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest stable Proton 9.0-3</a>.</p>

      <title>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl review - works on Linux Desktop with Proton but poorly on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl from GSC Game World has now been released and after playing it pre-release, I've had a damn fun time with it. There's some clear issues though, that I'll get into. <em>Disclosure: key provided by Renaissance PR.</em></p>
<p>Thankfully, the game works out of the box on Desktop Linux. With the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/proton-90-3-released-and-proton-experimental-upgraded-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-3</a>, everything works as expected, including the intro video with no broken test-screen. Being able to play it instantly has been quite a highlight of this year. It’s a <em>huge</em> game, both in terms of world size and install size, you’re going to need to free up some space because it’s about 160GB!</p>
<p>Do you need to play the originals? No. While it <em>does</em> follow on from the originals, it’s a standalone game with its own story. The developers <em>suggest</em> playing the originals to "maximize the immersion". But really, it’s fine. You may not get every reference here and there, but it all explains itself as you play.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8209864151732034296gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8209864151732034296gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>When you first load up the game, you will need to let it compile shaders, it does this before you even get into the main menu. That initial compiling took about 13 minutes, so it takes a little while, but features like this are worth it to get a smoother game overall. So grab a coffee.</p>
<p>The developers say that no procedural generation was used in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornoby, <em>everything</em> was made by hand. They even used photogrammetry, along with real objects and places with prominent landmarks included from the real world. However, plenty has been rearranged for the sake of the gameplay, they say it’s “fictionally revised”.</p>
<p><em>Note: there will probably be some form of spoilers from here on out.</em></p>

<h4><strong>Steam Deck Performance</strong></h4>
<p>Now a few quick words on Steam Deck performance and expectations because this won’t take long. Truthfully, I <em>didn’t</em> expect it to be playable and… it’s really not.</p>
<p>Firstly, there’s the initial shader compiling. On Steam Deck (OLED) it took 51 minutes to complete. It will do it each time you load the game fresh too, but much faster, only about 2 minutes. The initial shader compiling also took a whole 40% battery time away - ouch.</p>
<p>After that, there’s no controller input at all. It sometimes detected I was using a controller (the Deck itself) showing gamepad button prompts, but no actual input. Switching it over to Keyboard / Mouse in Steam Input at least allows you to continue. To be fair, it’s advertised with “Partial Controller Support” on Steam, but that’s clearly pushing it.</p>
<p>It only gets worse from this point on.</p>
<p>Performance is <em>awful</em>. Truly bad. Tested on the <em>lowest</em> possible settings in the game, even with nothing going on, it’s often well below 30FPS. Without upscaling, it’s about 15FPS. Then trying it with all the various upscalers in the game, and you can at times get it to <em>briefly</em> give you around 30FPS at select moments, but it’s mostly going to be around 20FPS and below.</p>
<p>This screenshot below is 1280x800, the Low preset, with AMD FSR set to Ultra Performance and it should speak for itself at 23FPS:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18494085041732032242gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18494085041732032242gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>How about FSR 3 Frame Generation? It may give you a few more FPS in some cases, but it destroys the Frame Timing and turns it into something comical with input all over the place. See the screenshot below, in the top left notice the frame timing going wild resulting in serious input delay.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2842523511732032243gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2842523511732032243gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>FSR 3 Frame Generation really needs the game to already perform quite well to actually make a difference.</p>
<p>That performance only gets <em>worse</em> at various points I tested, some dropping below 10FPS on the lowest possible settings. This is just <u>clearly</u> just <em>not</em> a game for the Steam Deck. Even if you managed to get the performance higher doing extra tweaks like we often see after releases, the low visuals simply aren't worth it in this.</p>
<p><em>Edit: release day update note - Valve set it as Unsupported on Steam Deck.</em></p>
<h4><strong>Desktop Linux Performance</strong></h4>
<p>On Kubuntu 24.10 with my Ryzen 5800X / Radeon 6800 XT at 2560x1440 resolution, I’ve gone through various settings to see where I could get it performing well. And, quick tip here, Steam Game Recording seemed to suck away a good 20FPS from this game, so I would make sure it’s not recording for it. Some games just don’t play particularly nice with it.</p>
<p>For reference, here’s their suggested system requirements:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4066123991731671887gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4066123991731671887gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>However, the developers put a small note in the actual Steam system requirements, to note even the Minimum listed specifications were using upscaling.</p>
<p>With that in mind. Performance here will depend of course on your hardware, and your chosen upscaling. At 1440p resolution on the High preset as per their suggestion based on my system, using no upscaling simply <em>wasn’t</em> an option, performance was all over the place often dropping well below 60FPS, even when dropping it down to Medium.</p>
<p>Eventually I settled on TSR (Temporal Super Resolution) “Quality” with 80% Resolution Scale, which works <em>impressively</em> well on both the visual quality and performance uplift. Add into that FSR 3 Frame Generation, and often it was sitting usually above 80FPS and often a fair amount higher even on the High preset.</p>
<p>As an example here, in a pretty empty area with nothing going on. High settings preset, Frame Generation (Left), and with no Frame Generation (Right):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4248529471732032443gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4248529471732032443gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12311106061732032445gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12311106061732032445gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

<p>So <em>without</em> any FSR 3 Frame Generation, this empty area was hovering just at 60FPS (that’s with TSR at 80% resolution scale as well). FSR 3 Frame Generation added just about 50FPS. Frame Gen also improved the Frame Timings too so it's overall smoother.</p>
<p>While I am impressed how smooth Frame Generation makes it, clearly the game directly just <em>needs</em> various performance improvements and is quite messy without upscaling. Perhaps we may see future Proton improvements to help it too like we’ve seen for other games. Even though plenty of it performed well with my settings, numerous parts also did not perform well regardless of the settings picked.</p>
<h4><strong>Gameplay</strong></h4>
<p>Note: review codes came quite close to release, so i’m short on time to fully explore everything i wanted to, and a basic play through is around 40 hours <em>at least</em>. Additionally, there’s multiple endings depending on what you do, and given that it’s a pretty dynamic open-world game, other people may get to see a <em>very</em> different experience.</p>
<p>I should probably preface this by noting that this is the first time I’ve personally <em>properly</em> experienced this world, after bouncing off the older games for various reasons. I just couldn't get into them. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 though, this is very much my jam.</p>
<p>For people new to the series, keep in mind this is <em>not</em> a fast-paced run and gun FPS. It’s supposed to be an immersive first-person exploration horror shooter. You start with very little and it’s all about looting as you go. It’s a thoroughly challenging game, and that’s how it’s designed, they say it’s an “anti-power fantasy”, as you’re just another expendable person exploring a hostile environment. With no levelling system, you <em>need</em> to loot to get a better chance at surviving for better weapons, equipment and items to just keep you somewhat alive (but probably a bit irradiated).</p>
<p>It’s a survival game too where you’ll be dealing with hunger, bleeding, sleep and radiation that all need a constant watch over, so you’ll need to be stocking up on plenty of supplies. No character choice though, you're simply thrust into the shoes of Skif.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18025324531732032629gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18025324531732032629gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>As for the difficulty, it can be pretty <em>brutal</em>. However, they have thankfully included difficulty modes. The intended experience <em>is</em> for it to be difficult, but not impossible. There’s even a Rookie mode for you to get more forgiving combat to help you explore the world, and you can change the difficulty at any point. My play-through has been with their intended middle difficulty.</p>
<p>The world is huge too, “64-km²” they say, and it does take a <em>long</em> time to travel across it. Half the time because of so many <em>distractions</em> and encounters. Totally seamless though, no special loading screens to get in the way of the exploration and action.</p>
<p>While there is a main story quest line to follow, outside of that there’s this loop that you end up doing. Going through each different zone, talking to everyone you can to grab side-quests, then gearing up to go and explore. You repeat this quite a lot, and as you explore you’ll likely uncover more random side-quests that continually have you explore more, and further into danger. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2, like most open world games, is very much what you make of it. You could blast through it a lot quicker, but half the fun is in all the encounters and some of the side-quests are pretty good.</p>
<p>Part of this loop is also hunting for artifacts, special items you can equip in a slot to help you on your travels. You'll see lots of different anomalies in the Zone, and you have equipment that not only warns you about them with beeps, but you can pull it out to help you hunt down where exactly an artifact might be found in select areas. There's a few different types of these detectors you'll find on your travels.</p>
<p>As for the artifacts, they all have different buffs and debuffs and different levels of each and even just finding them can cause a whole lot of death.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21154181831732037350gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/21154181831732037350gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19633096511732037351gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19633096511732037351gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

<p>While they can give you some protection, they can also cause some serious radiation issues. So they're very much a constant toss-up between risk / reward to use.</p>
<p>Something I did find slightly funny, is the <em>yellow paint</em> styled objects being a thing even in a game like this. You’ll see it in various places, indicating you can do something like climb a ladder or break apart some wood. It’s quite subtle, but still amusing to see it in such a game.</p>
<p>The game can feel somewhat alive, thanks to all the various NPC encounters. You’ll see groups roaming, that will encounter each other and fight without you even needing to get involved. You can watch the fireworks from the sidelines and scoop up some loot later, or engage and speed things up a bit and potentially save some extra ammo if you manage to do it quietly.</p>
<p>While it’s not meant to be a fast-paced game, I wouldn’t say it was particularly stealthy or slow either. Enemies seem to spot you quite easily even from afar, and track you a bit after you move around too. I can’t say I’ve really experienced a whole lot of this “Advanced artificial intelligence system” that they talk about a fair bit. When a single enemy in a group, not actually next to the group, spots you, they all seem to just <em>instantly</em> know where you are and turn to you guns blazing. This is typical of most shooters but here I was expecting a little more smarts from S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2. The amount of times I tried certain encounters over and over and <em>over again</em> with different methods, always found by one single person setting off the whole group - I ended up just going in guns blazing myself a lot of the time.</p>
<p>Your movement speed is somewhat quick too, and while you can crouch, you cannot go prone - which feels a bit <em>odd</em> here if you’re wanting to be more stealthy. I get it though, it’s <em>not</em> meant to be a fully tactical game, but there’s so many situations it would have been great to have. Especially as the current stealth system is…not especially great.</p>
<p>Wonderful atmosphere all the way through. Especially with the day and night cycle, and then the weather system on top of that. Rain, full-on storms - it all really adds to the immersion. The storms especially can look awesome at night while you’re out and about.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7875088791732032762gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7875088791732032762gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>One interesting game mechanic here is that you have an unlimited supply of bolts. You can pull them out any time, and throw them at various types of Anomalies in the game to set them off. This allows you to see where certain types start and end, plus move past them safely once they’ve been set off and you get a few seconds cool-down before they reappear.</p>
<p>You’ll be using this feature a lot to access certain areas, some may even surround some fun loot. One particular quest had me direct an NPC through a field of electrical anomalies, and it took me a while to get it right without killing them or us both.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1312371401732032849gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1312371401732032849gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There’s a lot that can go wrong in this game. So my one big tip for anyone jumping in: <strong>save early, save often</strong>. Mash that F5 button, <em>wear it out</em>. Also, the game doesn’t pause when you’re messing with your inventory, so don’t stick around for too long. Saves are great! Especially when you’re low on health, heading towards somewhere that may have some loot, only to come across a group of bandits and just when you think you’re going to live with 1HP and a dream after taking them down for their loot, a cute little anomaly appears and gives you the sweet kiss of death. I did say it was brutal right?</p>
<p>Some of the encounters I will never forget. Exploring early on, low health, trying to find some meds when suddenly I heard this almighty roar. My character was freaking out, the screen went all weird and clearly something was close by. But what? It felt like it was <em>stalking</em> me a bit, the top of the screen was glowing red, clearly showing an enemy is nearby and I could hear it grunting. I didn’t get a chance to see though, because some weird anomaly appeared as I was searching for it that sucked me in and — dead. Reloaded, explored the same area, and ended up finding 5 med packs close-ish to where I died, great success.</p>
<p>5 minutes later, I heard that roar again, so I quietly explored around some more. Eventually, I came to a house that clearly had a tunnel dug into it from below. Did I explore it? You bet I did! Did I regret that decision? Also very much yes. I saw a dead body, and thought “great, some loot!” and then out of the darkness ahead came a very <em>angry</em> speedy Bloodsucker that wanted me for dinner. That might be one of the most crazy-terrifying moments I’ve had in a game. I died <em>again</em>, obviously.</p>
<p>I love the environmental interactions in this too. Those Bloodsuckers make my heart beat real fast, and seeing them near water is quite fun, because even though they have some sort of cloaking, you can spot them through the water like in the shot below, you’ll see the ripples. That was an especially fun encounter.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13400746291732032984gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13400746291732032984gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is just insanely intense all the time you’re exploring as you never know quite what’s going to happen.</p>
<p>Another time I came out of a tunnel, minding my own business, and was suddenly pushed to the floor with a grunt. Got up, looked around and saw a bunch of what looked like wild boar running rampant trying to attack me. After running for a few seconds to safety on top of a truck, I suddenly heard a load of barking. A whole pack of mutated dogs had come along for some fun too, and then the boar just seemed to chase them around. Guess what happened next? I died, because the truck I jumped onto for <em>safety</em> was a super-source of radiation. <em>Nothing in this game is safe dammit.</em></p>
<p>Some parts of the general design I found <em>odd</em> that I didn’t like though including only being able to lean if you’re holding a gun. But what if I want to peek around a corner with a knife? Nope. There’s also the sin of some NPCs running slower than you walk, which is especially <em>annoying</em> on certain quests you pick. The mantling system to climb up something is also pretty rubbish, and only works at seemingly very select places. On top of that, in some places, even the slightest jump down can kill you. You know the times I'm talking about I'm sure, it happens in other games, you look and think "even my unfit ass could jump / side down that without a single injury".</p>
<p>While there’s no character-specific upgrade system, there’s still plenty of ways to customise your whole experience. Weapons, for example, can be <em>individually</em> tweaked with various attachments and upgrades. It can get a little costly though depending on how many you wish to keep around. You also need to deal with weapon durability, and if it drops too low bullets will get jammed. Weapon durability can end up a fatal mistake to ignore, when you’ve got some good loot and a pack of hostile people or creatures come across you. Weapons end up wearing out somewhat quicker than I was expecting too, which is thoroughly annoying.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18089629711732033055gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18089629711732033055gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16317179191732033056gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16317179191732033056gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The overall dynamic nature of it means some quests and side-quests can go a fair bit differently each time, depending on your involvement, or not at all if you step out of the way.</p>
<p>One particular quest came to mind where I tried talking a group out of killing someone in a house, but they didn’t listen. As they were about to go in, the person hiding came running out guns-blazing at them. First time around, the person in the house managed to take them all down after running outside and taking cover. Second time the group point blank shot the person the second they stepped outside, which was quite comical to see after the initial run of it due to how abrupt it was. Just <em>pow</em>, dead.</p>
<p>I’ve also had quite a lot of times where I’m out roaming for loot when enemies spotted and started firing at me, only for a big creature to come along and annihilate them so I could run away while they’re all distracted. So many little events that keep going throughout the game, and you get to choose what to do about them all.</p>
<p>Something I truly hated though is the weight system. I can't think of a single time, in any game – ever, that has made being overencumbered in any way fun. It's a game mechanic I despise. Let me stock up on things without slowing to a crawl. Considering how far between traders are, and your own stash, it's just a ridiculous nuisance. Let me hoard sausages in peace! Why are a few of them as heavy as some of the guns?</p>
<p>I hope you like rats…as there can be swarms. Vicious, hungry, screeching swarms of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12934600221732033233gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12934600221732033233gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Thankfully again due to the dynamic nature of the game, you might at times come across a roaming friendly patrol to help you deal with them, or use as your distraction meat-shield.</p>
<p>I'll also take this moment to say screw these guys and their stupidly annoying telekinesis that picks up guns, fires them at you and steals your gun away from you:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17694670001732033341gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17694670001732033341gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Say cheese! Still smiling at me after death, annoying little thing.</em></p>
<p>There's some other bouncy little critters that can also go to hell, that make me jump every time they make an appearance and I'm not expecting them. But I won't spoil those. You can just <em>enjoy</em> meeting them for yourselves.</p>
<p>Even though the world is huge, there is (thankfully) a form of fast-travel. Much like the game world though, it’s on the punishing side, as it will cost you a bit every time you decide to use it. However, it can be incredibly useful too. If you’re stocked up on loot and want to get to your stash, or to a different area to sell it and carry on with more quests, it can be beneficial anyway to find a guide to initiate fast-travel so you don’t lose anything on the road. I can’t count the number of times I died to a random creature, then bandits appearing and finally losing it to an anomaly with loot on me. Thankfully, I quick-save as much as I breathe but still, you get the point.</p>
<p>The quest system is dynamic too, and at least a little smart. You can build up quite a lot of quests, and there’s various ways of doing each of them differently. Some of them can be completed with a shotgun to the face of a particular person, but that person might give you other options. Shooting first, questions later is not always the best option, but sometimes it’s also just fun to do so you can loot everyone in a particular location. If you’re allowed to kill a particular quest giver, they’ll have the items you need on them. Other times, a quest giver might have been killed by someone, or something, and they’ll all show up in your Failed Quest list.</p>
<p>Another big issue to deal with are powerful emissions. They’re insane crazy storms that turn the sky red, with lightning everywhere and staying outside during one is 100% guaranteed death. You do get a fair bit of warning when one is coming, but even so, getting to shelter fast can still be an issue. Nearly everything in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 wants you dead.</p>

<p>I haven't even gotten a chance yet to talk about the story, which I won't spoil, because it would be so easy to do so. It revolves around a particular item that gets taken from you, and your main initial quest to try and find it and who was involved. This of course leads onto various other intertwining stories, and things spiral a fair bit from there and it gets…weird.</p>
<p>Dealing with various gangs and different factions along the way. It's exciting even from the moment you load it up, with an impressive intro to the game. Even though the story is interesting as it expands, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is very much about <em>everything else</em>. Plenty of the individual quests you do, along with their story progression, are really fun as they unfold. Backed up by some great voice acting, I especially liked the blind brainwashed preacher when you meet the remnants of the Monolith organisation, and a particular mind-controlling "boss battle" of sorts that took me a good few attempts to get right.</p>
<p>As always, every experience you have depends on your equipment, you really will want to constantly be sorting through what you have and swapping things around depending on your currently picked quest-line.</p>
<p><em>Hope you like FPS platforming too because there's a bit of that spread throughout the game.</em></p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8057729621732050516gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8057729621732050516gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>With a game like this, I'm really only scratching the surface. I need to go back through and play more, to try out making some different decisions. You do get to make a few interesting choices as you play, and so I'm keen to see what the real difference is when you treat a faction differently.</p>
<h4><strong>Bugs and Technical Issues</strong></h4>
<p>In my time in the game I’ve seen a fair amount of bugs. Just to give you a full idea of what to expect that I’ve come across: objects falling through the world, annoyingly at times I needed them too (darn ammo and meds); dead bodies that spring back up in some sort of T pose and then flop back down again; characters that at times seem to do a mini-teleport and guns that fire without a sound at all. Others like: bodies you can’t get close enough to move, that end up blocking your way in certain situations; I’ve seen NPCs with legs going through the floor in buildings; NPCs that walk on top of objects and just stare point-blank at walls; NPCs walking on the spot never going anywhere and then just vanishing; various NPCs that aren't even close to the floor (or the bed) and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5147835951732033476gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5147835951732033476gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>During my run I've also seen one of the single <em>funniest</em> bugs I’ve ever seen in a game. I was at an enemy base, sneaking around, got discovered and so an enemy started firing at me. I shot them, and then they just suddenly started wildly spinning, and then their body took off like a helicopter and just carried on spinning going up and up and up. The physics system can be pretty <em>hilarious</em>. This ended up happening multiple times too.</p>
<p>Radio chatter audio is even a problem too. When you get a call it often flicks between radio-style sounding one sentence, to chatting like they're right next to you and back again. Thoroughly odd.</p>
<p>Objects NPCs are wearing don’t always line up correctly too, like a particular discussion where their headphones and tape player move without them and the camera ends up focusing on that as you move around. Hilarious again.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10259717461732033435gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10259717461732033435gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Saved games act <em>oddly</em> too. I assume due to the dynamic nature of the game, but the AI seems to just make things up when you reload the game. Numerous times I’ve saved somewhat close to enemies, reloaded and they’re suddenly looking for me even when they weren’t before or they know exactly where I am and start shooting. Their position seems to <em>shift</em> during save reloading, as does their behaviour. I gave advice earlier to “save early, save often” and you’ll need it, because this issue has caused me to load earlier saves more times than I can remember.</p>
<p>None of the problems actually stopped me enjoying it for the most part, some even just made me laugh, but yeah — there’s definitely a fair amount of bugs there. I’m honestly surprised at how many. Some do end up breaking the game, like quests that don’t go through properly causing you to reload an earlier save.</p>
<p>A fair amount of flickering textures too in <em>some</em> places, which might be issues with it running with Proton on Linux. So I’ll give it some allowance there until we know more after release. Example video:</p>
<div class="ckeditor-html5-video" data-responsive="true" style="text-align: center;">
<video controls="controls" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10836592101732104709gol1.mp4" style="height:auto; max-width:100%"></video>
</div>
<p>That flickering is only in a select few places, but very distracting when it happens.</p>
<p>One major graphical issue I came across, that I’ve <em>never</em> ever seen before in <em>any</em> other game, is that I had to completely disable adaptive sync directly in my <em>monitor</em> control panel. Otherwise, lots of light sources would have some insane flicker. Took me ages to figure out what that cause was. But I’ve not had to do that for any other game.</p>
<p>It's clear the game is coming in hot, with plenty of bugs still to be worked through. There's been patches during the review period, some fixes I may not have seen yet, but still many issues to be found during testing even on release day showing many.</p>
<p>Quite stable though, surprisingly so, only a single hard-crash to desktop in my entire run.</p>
<h4><strong>To sum up</strong></h4>
<p>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 has been equal parts mesmerising as it has been terrifying at the same time. There’s been lots of moments where I’ve just sat and watched something happen, to the times where something has made me jump so fiercely that I threw my mouse across my desk. Some of the encounters really can end up quite <em>frightful</em>, but other times I’ve been just amazed by things happening around me. However, all the bugs can definitely be really <em>frustrating</em> to deal with.</p>
<p>My main concern with it aside from the many bugs is the performance on Linux (and just performance in general), you clearly need some power and without Frame Generation it’s pretty rough. Apart from that, and speaking overall, my time spent with it for the most part has been thoroughly good fun.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11797481641732033789gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11797481641732033789gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>If I could compare it to previous experiences, it was like the first time I jumped into and completed the original Dying Light or Fallout 3. Worlds full of seemingly endless possibilities, that’s truly never dull to load up a save and explore, and you don’t necessarily need to stick to the storyline if you want to just keep exploring and discovering. There’s hours and hours of content here to discover. But also a whole <strong>lot</strong> of <em>jankiness</em>, so expect plenty of patches to come.</p>
<p>With the mod support, I really cannot wait to see what people cook up to add into it. I feel like this is going to be a game that has a very-long shelf-life that people will be playing for years to come. Add into that the multiplayer they’re promising that will come “soon after release” as a free addition, I have zero doubts that it’s going to be popular.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Unique gameplay built on a blend of FPS, horror, and immersive sim.</li>

<p>“It feels utterly surreal to say that, but after more than 7 years in the making, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is now released. That’s totally wild. So was the whole development story. What started as the most ambitious game by GSC eventually turned out to be an ultimate personal challenge. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 was always supposed to be a truly Ukrainian product, showing our culture to the world in the ongoing effort of the nation to be recognized. I truly believe the team we have consists of exceptional people, but I never actually thought they would be finishing the game under the circumstances like these. Despite all the odds, it’s there. Our biggest game, our own story, our love letter to Ukraine. All the time, effort and passion we put into this is about to be witnessed by the players from all around the globe. After 15 years, the doors to the Zone will be opened once again”, — says Ievgen Grygorovych, CEO and Game Director.</p>

      <title>FromSoftware owner Kadokawa confirms Sony sent an &#39;initial letter of intent&#39; to acquire them</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/sony-reportedly-looking-to-acquire-kadokawa-owner-of-elden-ring-dev-fromsoftware/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Recently I covered</a> that Kadokawa, the owner of ELDEN RING developer FromSoftware, were potentially being acquired by Sony and now Kadokawa have confirmed there's something going on.</p>
<p>No decision has been made yet though. Before you go jumping to conclusions. In a press <a href="https://ssl4.eir-parts.net/doc/9468/ir_material7/240956/00.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release</a> issued via their <a href="https://group.kadokawa.co.jp/global/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, they issued a brief statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are some articles on the acquisition of KADOKAWA Corporation (hereinafter "the Company") by<br/>
Sony Group Inc. However, this information is not announced by the Company. The Company has received an<br/>
initial letter of intent to acquire the Company's shares, but no decision has been made at this time. If there are<br/>
any facts that should be announced in the future, we will make an announcement in a timely and appropriate<br/>
manner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now at least we know the previous report is correct, but we'll have to wait on their decision.</p>
<p>If the deal goes through this really will be a huge deal in the world of video games since Kadokawa control FromSoftware (ELDEN RING, <em>ARMORED CORE), </em>Spike Chunsoft (Danganronpa, DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO), ACQUIRE Corp. (OCTOPATH TRAVELER) and Gotcha Gotcha Games (RPG Maker) as well as various Anime and Manga.</p>
<p>Shows you how big this deal is that they had to put out a statement to clarify things, and that nothing has happened just yet.</p>

      <title>Euro Truck Simulator 2 - Greece lands December 4, SCS continue updating legacy art assets for both truck sims</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SCS Software have announced that Euro Truck Simulator 2 - Greece is set for release on December 4th. Plus, they're continuing to update the visuals for both Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck Simulator.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.scssoft.com/2024/11/under-hood-reimagining-legacy-assets.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> the developers gave a little background info on their rework of various art assets used in both games noting that: "Since the release of Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck Simulator, the processing power of personal computers has made some serious advancements. In turn, we've continually brought updates to both our titles to introduce new technology and techniques, which has allowed us to introduce higher levels of visual fidelity to our content."</p>
<p>Thanks to the work from two team members they're going through "enhancing the quality and optimization of game models that have started to look outdated and inconsistent with newer additions". Nice to see they continue updating the game for everyone, on top of all the various newer location DLC.</p>
<p>On that note, Euro Truck Simulator 2 - Greece arrives December 4th, check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="TnstEfkCYFM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/42f912db843c6109727d3e41dc1fc52d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/TnstEfkCYFM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The Greece DLC as you can imagine adds a lot of new areas to explore, but SCS said it's more than just that. It introduces hotel complexes and vibrant cotton farms as new depots as well. <em>Might have to dust off my wheel soon…</em></p>
<p>12 years after release, Euro Truck Simulator 2 has some impressive numbers seeing a peak player count of 36,919 in the last 24 hours. Not many games are able to do that.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>ROSE is a free rogue-lite arena shooter where you sacrifice your body parts to progress</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A free game to play midweek? Why not eh? You really should check out ROSE, a violent rogue-lite arena shooter where you sacrifice your body parts to progress and gain new weapons and abilities. Developer Zakroutil launched it free on Steam, with an optional donation DLC on November 18th.</p>
<p>I'm really surprised this is free, it's actually really good! You go through waves of enemies across various different arenas full of traps, and when you defeat a wave you can choose to sacrifice a body part which gives you a debuff, that you can later use to give yourself a big boost when you've sacrificed enough. A pretty clever game mechanic that really makes runs feel quite exciting.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ORnCVVdnJ4Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/86cf76ee88dda5d16bcfecf82ff2b915.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ORnCVVdnJ4Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Sacrifice your flesh and blood to progress.</li>
<li>Reverse sacrifices to gain boosts instead.</li>
<li>Unlock and upgrade unique weapons.</li>
<li>Slaughter waves of demented enemies.</li>
<li>Defeat titanic bosses.</li>
<li>Progress through the randomized arenas to uncover the dark story.</li>
<li>Avoid traps and other procedurally placed obstacles.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Properly weird, unique and terribly good fun. Difficult as hell though, with the speed of it and all the different types of insane enemies that come after you. Some can even latch onto you to keep hurting you. It's a visually wild experience that's for sure.</p>
<p>It works great on Desktop Linux with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/proton-90-3-released-and-proton-experimental-upgraded-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-3</a>.</p>

      <title>Vehicular combat shooter Mad Mechs looks like one to watch</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

<p>The Steam page at least has Linux system requirements in a tab, although it's "TBD" (to be decided) so it might even get Linux support. Otherwise, there's always Proton. Will be keeping an eye on it.</p>

      <title>Steam Controller 2 is apparently a thing and being &#39;tooled for a mass production&#39; plus a new VR controller</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Take this with a pinch of salt as you always do with leaks, but it appears Valve may be prepping a Steam Controller 2, along with a new controller for their Deckard VR kit as well.</p>
<p>News about this comes from <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1858925211363553316" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Brad Lynch</a> on X, who has covered a lot of Valve leaks for upcoming VR hardware in the past who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Codename for Steam Controller 2 is “Ibex”</p>
<p>Separate product from Deckard’s “Roy” controller(s)</p>
<p>Both are being tooled for a mass production goal in their factories right now. That’s why I know they’re in later stages of productization</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you wondering where the name Roy for the Deckard VR headset comes from, it seem Valve really love <em>Blade Runner</em> references with <em>Rick Deckard</em> and <em>Roy Batty</em>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, according to Lynch in <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1857153531897131182" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">another</a> post, the Deckard Roy controller has quite a lot of inputs on it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Valve Roy controller(s) have at least: DPAD, Bumpers, Grip Buttons, Triggers, ABXY, system button, and some sort of strap</p>
<p>I am confident in this info based on datamining AND sources who wished not to be named</p>
<p>There is also an unreleased OpenXR extension for these controllers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1856871543684436415" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">might</a> even get some eye-tracking in the Deckard headset.</p>
<p>Long time readers of GamingOnLinux will know that this nearly made my heart explode, because I'm a die-hard fan of the original Steam Controller. I even wrote about my continued love of it in a little article <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/06/confessing-my-continued-love-of-the-steam-controller-a-few-years-after-release/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in 2019</a>. So the news of a potential new and updated one really has me excited.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Just two things I want from it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two thumbsticks in addition to the trackpads.</li>
<li>Better battery placement, because the original is a nightmare to get batteries out.</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously Valve won't confirm any leaks, we'll just have to wait and see what it all turns out to be.</p>
<p>What makes me truly curious on the Steam Controller 2 is just — why? The original was done along with the Steam Machines and Steam Link. While we do have the Steam Deck now, it has been out for years already , and Steam Input works great with tons of different controllers, so why would Valve be again making their own? Just because they can? Because it might sell well for all the people docking the Steam Deck that want a dedicated controller? Or perhaps we might finally see Valve decide to make another attempt at a true home-console like Steam Machine?</p>
<p>You can bet I'll be first in line to buy one either way. <em>I'll be pushing you all out of my way to get it. </em></p>
<p>Interesting times ahead.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA stable driver 550.135 released for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While NVIDIA continues working on new features for their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/nvidia-565-57-01-beta-has-wayland-and-hdr-improvements-plus-dxvk-and-vkd3d-optimizations/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">565 Beta series</a>, and they have their current <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/nvidia-stable-driver-560-35-03-released-for-linux-with-wayland-fixes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new-feature branch 560.35.03</a>, they also have the slightly older and stable version that just updated to version <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/details/236036/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">550.135</a>.</p>
<p>The main highlights / changes in this release are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In Linux kernel 6.11, drm_fbdev_generic was renamed to drm_fbdev_ttm.Use drm_fbdev_ttm when present to keep supporting direct frame buffer access needed for Wayland compositors to present content on newer kernels.</li>
<li>In linux-next commit 446d0f4849b1, output_poll_changed is removed from struct drm_mode_config_funcs. Do not implement the function pointer member when not present to ensure the driver can compile with newer kernels. The driver now supports enumerating modes on hotplug events through the DRM fbdev API.</li>
<li>Updated the kernel module build process to use CONFIG_CC_VERSION_TEXT from the Linux kernel's Kconfig to detect the compiler used to build the kernel. This may help select the correct compiler on systems where the kernel was built with a compiler other than the default one.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented kernel modules linked using precompiled kernel interface files from loading on recent Debian systems.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Since it's a stable driver, you should be fine to upgrade without issues. I imagine most of you gaming are likely at least on the 560 series that I covered previously. For this 550 series though NVIDIA describes it as: "This driver meets the quality levels applied to Windows drivers that pass testing in Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL), therefore providing the same attention to driver reliability, robustness, and performance for non-Windows operating systems (e.g., Linux)".</p>

<p>It's not clear if this is via <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> or a Native Linux version.

      <title>Hotloop is a twin-stick shooter where you fling yourself around using gravity from planets</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need some fresh twin-stick shooting fun? Hotloop looks like a nice one, with an interesting gravity mechanic to throw your ship around using gravity from various planets.</p>
<p>More: "It is a dynamic mix of old school arcade and simulation. In this game you will meet a realistic system of spacecraft behaviour and precise orbital mechanics. You have to curb the force of gravity and learn how to use it to your advantage in order to repel numerous enemies."</p>
<p>Check out the gameplay trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8913s_0CKLo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/47ea7a2b0660a6297b97341e265eea30.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8913s_0CKLo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A game where you use the environment directly to defeat enemies by smashing them into asteroids, make them burn up in the sun, fall into a black hole and more. All while you're trying to keep yourself moving, with the pull of various celestial bodies. With the fuel mechanic, you'll need to make great use of gravity to keep some spare.</p>
<p>Various different types of weapons and utilities and it just looks like some good classic fun.</p>
<p>The developer also noted just recently they did some <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2253660/view/6855136062298128798" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">improvements</a> for Steam Deck players too including tweaking the UI and input updates, plus it has a Native Linux version.</p>

      <title>Sony reportedly looking to acquire Kadokawa, owner of ELDEN RING dev FromSoftware</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/sony-talks-buy-media-powerhouse-behind-elden-ring-sources-say-2024-11-19/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Reuters</a>, Sony are currently in talks to buy Kadokawa Corporation, the owner of ELDEN RING developer FromSoftware. They also made Armored Core, Dark Souls and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.</p>
<p>Seems like a purchase that would make sense for Sony. Kadokawa are a big name in both Anime and Manga publishing, and with Sony owning Crunchyroll (and Funimation) it would help them expand it even more. Kadokawa also own some huge names in the industry including Spike Chunsoft (Danganronpa), Gotcha Gotcha Games (RPG Maker) and various others.</p>
<p>Reuters said "Sony declined to comment. Kadokawa said it cannot comment." but according to their sources a deal might be signed as soon as a few weeks time.</p>
<hr/>
<p>If Sony do acquire them, this could have a big effect industry-wide. For PC releases, it <em>could</em> even mean seeing more games end up requiring the PlayStation Network account system. That would make sense, as Sony keep pushing that with more recent games, and acquiring more companies to push it even further would also align with their plans to bring more players into their system.</p>

      <title>The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth gets online co-op in the latest update with Repentance+ </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Available in Beta for The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, is the new The Binding of Isaac: Repentance+ update that brings online co-op.</p>
<p>You need to own <u>all</u> the DLC for it, and they're classing it as a Beta for now while they refine it and squash remaining bugs. Additionally, as far as I know, while the base game has Linux support you <em>need</em> <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> to run this because the Repentance DLC is only supported on Windows.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="j7yPmbNCP4I"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/22049dac596d2e756b0825c371ed43cd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/j7yPmbNCP4I" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Online play supports all game modes, all achievements that you get in solo can be earned while playing online but overall there's a few differences from solo play as they detailed in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/250900/view/7119722540407193807" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Online play has a few differences from solo play. Defeated bosses will drop an item for each player in the match. If a match is joined in progress, the new player will be granted several items to catch them up based on how far along the run is. Players can spend coins at the revive machine in the starting room of each floor to bring back dead players. Be warned, however, that the cost goes up each time the machine is used. Defeating a boss at the end of the stage will also revive any dead players. There might be some other special things to discover online as well!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Something to note is that mods are not supported to play online, you need to disable any mods.</p>
<p>Did they change anything for solo players? Yes, lots. There's various item improvements and reworks, plus many general quality of life fixes and bug fixes. It's a big update overall.</p>
<p>Doesn't seem like GOG have the update yet, so stick to Steam if you want all the goodies.</p>

      <title>Arcane Wilds is a western-themed fantasy RTS now on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now in Early Access, Arcane Wilds gives a slightly different take on the base-building RTS genre and comes with Linux support.</p>
<p>Not only is the setting quite interesting with the blending of themes, but the way it handles resources is a fun one. Resources you gather actually remain at the gathering sites, needing direct transportation for you to be able to use them. This means you can actually steal resources from opponents, requiring each player to properly protect them. It also has a special online co-op survival mode too which sounds pretty fun.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="XocajfH1DDk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/41fc2cd7e4ced618b82d3831240efc3d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/XocajfH1DDk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Three very different factions too:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Army: Boasting a powerful arsenal, the Army faction excels in ranged combat with essence-powered cannons, compensating for their low mobility with exceptional firepower.</li>
<li>Colony: Comprising a motley crew of gunslingers, the Colony faction employs explosive barrels and rapid-firing gatling guns, creating a versatile force on the battlefield.</li>
<li>Tribe: Known for their agility and adaptability, the Tribe faction utilizes movable structures and chaos-inducing abilities from medicine men and shamans to wreak havoc among enemies.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Some fun modding capabilities too with "first-class scripting support with Lua" they say so players can make their own maps and game modes, with Steam Workshop support.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck OLED: Limited Edition White and Steam Deck Australia have launched</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two big things have arrived. The first is that you can attempt to grab the sleek looking Steam Deck OLED: Limited Edition White right now, and the Steam Deck is now available in Australia.</p>
<p>The new Limited Edition White costs £599 / $679 and has the same specifications as the 1TB OLED. Although, you do get an exclusive Limited Edition White carrying case, startup movie, and virtual keyboard theme. Valve said they've "allocated stock proportionally across all regions, and restricting purchases to 1 unit per account" and that to purchase your account "must have made a Steam purchase before November 2024 and be in good standing".</p>
<p>Once it's gone, it's gone. So if you're somehow still on the fence, now might be the best time to get one of the coolest-looking models.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20287088481731971816gol1.png"/></p>

<ul>
<li>256GB LCD: $649.00 AUD</li>
<li>512GB OLED: $899.00 AUD</li>

      <title>Devs of chill arcade freeriding game SNØ: Ultimate Freeriding use the Steam Deck as their performance target</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SNØ: Ultimate Freeriding is a recent discovery that looks wonderful. A chill arcade freeriding game where it's just you against the raw wilderness and they plan to have it working to perfection on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>They're using the Steam Deck as their performance target and optimizing directly against it. As detailed in a recent Steam <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2943150/announcements/detail/6491470391966433407" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>, that follows on from an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2943150/view/6491470391966433298" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">earlier</a> post about hitting their smooth 60FPS goal, the Steam Deck as a target means it will run smoothly on a lot of "normal" PCs.</p>
<p>How? As they briefly explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The how is a bit more complicated, but the short of it was that we generate and spawn in new terrain continuously as you ski down the mountain. Our terrain generation algorithm isn't super heavy, but heavy enough that when we ran it on the main thread of the CPU you could easily drop down to 40-50 frames, and in very dense areas even lower perhaps. The solution? Multithreading and parallel processing for calculating the terrain, as well as spacing out spawning of objects. This got rid of 99% of stutter, and the last pieces was some graphics optimization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a result of their work, as they showed in two small GIFs, is that the performance on Steam Deck went from 30FPS and below (a bit all over the place) to a clear smooth 60FPS. Very nice.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4Ab0O4Km2zk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0444f30d4b92710a8429cb9d053424bf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4Ab0O4Km2zk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's a demo available on Steam right now. It doesn't have a full release date yet.</p>

      <title>Direct3D to Vulkan translation layer DXVK v2.5.1 released fixing GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition and an anisotropic filtering regression</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Following on from the rather large <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/direct3d-to-vulkan-translation-layer-dxvk-v25-released-with-rewritten-memory-management/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DXVK 2.5 update a week ago</a>, a smaller bug-fix release is out now for the Direct3D to Vulkan translation layer used by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>. The projects works with Direct3D 8/9/10/11.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's the main changes included in the <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v2.5.1" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">DXVK 2.5.1</a> release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a major regression where anisotropic filtering would not work correctly in D3D9 games. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/4452" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4452</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed some build issues with dxvk-native. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4446" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4446</a>)</li>

<hr/>
<p>If you're curious on how to upgrade, you <em>don't</em> actually need to do anything. Proton and GE-Proton use DXVK directly, and so they both pull in updates in their new releases. However, for those who like to live on the <em>wild</em> side, you <em>can</em> upgrade the DXVK version in Proton yourself. Do it at your own risk.</p>
<p>To do so you can just overwrite the existing DXVK files with the release download of the latest DXVK. You can find your Proton install <em>somewhere</em> like this (depending on your Steam Library drives):</p>
<p>For Proton 9 and Proton Experimental:</p>
<p><code>path-to-your/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Proton x.x/files</code></p>
<p>Proton 8 and below:</p>
<p><code>path-to-your/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Proton x.x/dist</code></p>
<p><em>Where x.x is whatever Proton version installed you wish to give a new DXVK.</em></p>
<p>Inside there you will see "lib" and "lib64", for 32bit and 64bit. Inside each of those, there's a "wine" folder and inside there is a "dxvk" folder and that's where you replace the files with new versions. If you mess anything up, one way to ensure it gets reinstalled cleanly is just to remove the "/dist" folder.</p>

      <title>Linux kernel 6.12 is out now with real-time capabilities, more gaming handheld support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here it is, another big Linux kernel release is out now. Linux kernel 6.12 is an exciting one too with a big feature finally landing.</p>
<p>From the release <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2024/11/17/326" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>, Linus Torvalds said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No strange surprises this last week, so we're sticking to the regular release schedule, and that obviously means that the merge window opens tomorrow. I already have two dozen+ pull requests in my mailbox, kudos to all the early birds.</p>
<p>But before the merge window opens, please give this a quick test to make sure we didn't mess anything up. The shortlog below gives you the summary for the last week, and nothing really jumps out at me. A number of last-minute reverts, and some random fairly small fixes fairly spread out in the tree.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The real big one for this release is the enabling of PREEMPT_RT, implementing real-time computing capabilities. This was merged by Linus Torvalds on September 20th from Thomas Gleixner that noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enable PREEMPT_RT on supported architectures:</p>
<p>After twenty years of development we finally reached the point to enable PREEMPT_RT support in the mainline kernel.</p>
<p>All prerequisites are merged, so enable it on the supported architectures ARM64, RISCV and X86(32/64-bit)</p>

<p>There's a good interview on <a href="https://www.linux.com/news/in-the-trenches-with-thomas-gleixner-real-time-linux-kernel-patch-set/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Linux.com</a> to give a bit of background on it, here's an excerpt where Gleixner explained what it actually really means:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>TG:</strong> Real-Time in the context of operating systems means that the operating system provides mechanisms to guarantee that the associated real-time task processes an event within a specified period of time. Real-Time is often confused with “really fast.” The late Prof. Doug Niehaus explained it this way: “Real-Time is not as fast as possible; it is as fast as specified.”</p>
<p>The specified time constraint is application-dependent. A control loop for a water treatment plant can have comparatively large time constraints measured in seconds or even minutes, while a robotics control loop has time constraints in the range of microseconds. But for both scenarios missing the deadline at which the computation has to be finished can result in malfunction. For some application scenarios, missing the deadline can have fatal consequences.</p>
<p>In the strict sense of Real-Time, the guarantee which is provided by the operating system must be verifiable, e.g., by mathematical proof of the worst-case execution time. In some application areas, especially those related to functional safety (aerospace, medical, automation, automotive, just to name a few), this is a mandatory requirement. But for other scenarios or scenarios where there is a separate mechanism for providing the safety requirements, the proof of correctness can be more relaxed. But even in the more relaxed case, the malfunction of a real-time system can cause substantial damage, which obviously wants to be avoided.</p>

<p>Some other fun stuff added in this kernel release include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expanded <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/hwmon/oxp-sensors.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">oxp-sensors</a> support for OrangePi NEO-01, OneXPlayer 2 series, OneXFly, and X1 series. Plus AYANEO models 2S, AIR 1S, Flip series, GEEK 1S, and KUN.</li>
<li>Fixed up ROG ALLY X audio support.</li>
<li>Added support for the GameForce Ace handheld (Rockchip RK3588s SoC).</li>
<li>Improved support for the Anbernic RG28XX handheld (H700 ARM Cortex-A53).</li>
<li>Improved Raspberry Pi 5 support.</li>
<li>Intel Battlemage and Lunar Lake support enabled by default.</li>
<li>Intel graphics fan speed reporting.</li>
<li>More work towards supporting Intel Panther Lake.</li>
<li>Support for showing a QR code for Linux kernel panics.</li>
<li>Lots of improved support for various laptops.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/scheduler/sched-ext.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">sched_ext</a>, "a scheduler class whose behavior can be defined by a set of BPF programs" is now in.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm just searching through and cherry-picking random bits here as usual. It's a ridiculously long read as always with thousands of changes across all areas.

      <title>Half-Life: Blue Shift remake mod Black Mesa: Blue Shift - Chapter 5: Focal Point released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Black Mesa: Blue Shift is a remake of the classic Half-Life: Blue Shift, made as a mod for the Half-Life remake Black Mesa. A big new update just landed for Black Mesa: Blue Shift that includes the new Chapter 5 of the story.</p>
<p>A lengthier explanation of what it is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Initially developed and released by Gearbox Software in 2001, second Half-Life add-on, Half-Life: Blue Shift is a return to the Black Mesa Research Facility and another look at the Incident's consequences from the eyes of Gordon Freeman's best friend - Barney Calhoun. In 2012, Crowbar Collective has delighted Half-Life fans with release of the magnificent Half-Life remake, but there are still no released remakes for add-ons. This is when we are coming in - HECU Collective are developing the Black Mesa: Blue Shift - a free remake with use of Black Mesa resources and style. We will try to stay as close to the original Blue Shift and Black Mesa as possible. Our mod will be releasing partially, chapter by chapter, so those who are not patient for the full release will finally have something to play!</p>

<p>For people who have played it before, here's what's new in the latest release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New and improved scenes for Living Quarters Outbound and Insecurity chapters;</li>
<li>Improved skybox textures, lighting and Post Processing in all earthbound surface maps;</li>
<li>Added responsive surface sounds to some environments that will be played with nearby explosions;</li>
<li>Improved all explosions SFX and added distance attenuation to them;</li>
<li>Added completely new surface properties for certain props with unique physics sounds. (E.g. barrels, tarps, monitors, crates);</li>
<li>Updated many BM and BM:BS textures/materials;</li>
<li>Updated previously supported localizations;</li>
<li>Added UI and captions support for Italian, Mexican Spanish, Portuguese (Portugal) and Romanian;*</li>
<li>Added UI support for Indonesian*;</li>
<li>Various other visual improvements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>More info on the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2424633574" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Workshop</a> and <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/black-mesa-blue-shift-remake/news/chapter-5-focal-point-release" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Mod DB</a>. You do need to read the install instructions carefully, as there's some manual work required.</p>
<p>Running the mod with the Native Linux version of Black Mesa seems like a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2424633574/6670425060425995281/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">mess</a>. But with Proton 9.0-3 I was able to get into the mod. On Linux the simplest way would be subscribing to the Steam Workshop item, then copying over all the files as per their instructions:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Go to "*/Steam/steamapps/workshop/content/362890/2424633574";</li>
<li>Copy the "bshift" folder and the .bat files into your Black Mesa root directory ("*/Steam/steamapps/Common/Black Mesa");</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>After that, set it as a launch option on Black Mesa (right click -&gt; properties):</p>

      <title>Linux GPU Configuration Tool &#39;LACT&#39; adds NVIDIA support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>No longer just for the AMD camp, Linux GPU Configuration Tool 'LACT' has a fresh release out that brings in NVIDIA support.</p>
<p>This free and open source app gives you a fancy readout of various GPU stats, along with giving you control over fan control, power and thermals monitor, overclocking, power states and more. Some feature are specific to certain GPUs and vendors though.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">In version 0.6.0 here's the main standout additions:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Nvidia support! LACT now works with Nvidia GPUs for all of the core functionality (monitoring, clocks configuration, power limits and fan control). It uses the NVML library, so unlike the Nvidia control panel it doesn't rely on X11 extensions and works under Wayland.</li>
<li>Multiple profiles for configuration. Currently it is not possible to switch them automatically, but they are configurable through the UI or the unix socket.</li>
<li>Clocks configuration now works on AMD IGPUs (at least RDNA2). Previously it was not parsed properly due to lack of VRAM settings.</li>
<li>Zero RPM mode settings on RDNA3. Currently this needs a linux-next to be used, and the functionality is expected to land in kernel 6.13. But this resolves a long-standing issue with RDNA3 that made the fan always disabled below a certain temperature, even if using a custom curve.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plenty more listed in the <a href="https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/releases/tag/v0.6.0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a>.</p>
<p>What NVIDIA GPUs does it support? According to the documentation, "Anything Maxwell or newer should work, but generation support has not yet been tested thoroughly".</p>

      <title>Inspired by SSX, arcade snowboarding game Tricky Madness is now in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a new snowboarding game built like the classics? Tricky Madness is out in Early Access and includes Linux support.</p>
<p>From solo developed Nathan Dearth, the idea is to capture the spirit of classics of the late 90s and early 2000s like SSX and 1080° Snowboarding. Great news for newcomers and returning snowboard enthusiasts alike, but with a modern take to give you a polished and familiar trick input system.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_KwYoeS-Pno"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/09a3f38c4b1807fd54072155e561e748.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_KwYoeS-Pno" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Handcrafted standalone maps each with hidden surprises and experiences.</li>
<li>A dedicated campaign mode set on an open-world mountain with secrets and collectibles.</li>
<li>Fully voiced characters with their own backstory, personalities, and snowboarding tricks.</li>
<li>A voiced in-game DJ commentator, hyping you up as you make your way through the game.</li>
<li>Three exhilarating game modes to test your speed and skills including freestyle, time trials, and races.</li>
<li>An enhanced tricking points system encourages you to trick more often for speed boosts and unlocks Uber Tricks and Grinds.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the developer all the core mechanics are there along with game modes but they still need to expand on the levels and characters. The planned campaign mode and planned multiplayer are still awaiting further development.</p>
<p>We've seen a good few retro-themed sports games come along recently and I love to see it!</p>

      <title>New Hearts of Iron IV DLC lets you rewrite German history, pushing player counts up to a new peak</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox Interactive have now released Hearts of Iron IV: Götterdämmerung, a Germany-focused expansion to their popular historical strategy game.</p>
<p>As a result, I spotted earlier that it has been quite a hit, since it pushed up Hearts of Iron IV to a new all-time peak concurrent player count to 79,337. Last time it managed to break the record was back in October 2023, so clearly this is doing well. It already has a Very Positive user rating on Steam too! Taking point in this expansion are the new focus trees for Germany, along with multiple other new additions.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FrDwvcy40ZM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7c081f02f42b3e607a0ba69b9d6b5198.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FrDwvcy40ZM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Larger German Focus Tree: Revised national focuses and alternate historical paths for one of the most played nations in Hearts of Iron IV. Revised political paths include new monarchist content, a restored democratic Germany and alternate fascist militarist paths. More character driven events add flavor to the war’s central player.</li>
<li>Revised Austrian Focus Tree: New alternate histories for Austria free of German control, as well as content for surrounding countries that were once part of the Habsburg Empire. There is also a revised historical path for AI controlled Austria.</li>
<li>Hungarian Focus Tree: Rebuild the nation, using technology to overcome manpower shortages. Reform the Austro-Hungarian Empire and forge a powerful, unified faction.</li>
<li>Belgian Focus Tree: Resist or welcome German supremacy. Draw on the natural wealth of the Congo and build potential for an African government-in-exile.</li>
<li>Special Projects: Pursue advanced research in special projects, assigning scientists to further your war effort. Special projects include nuclear physics, advanced aircraft, rocketry, advanced tanks and artillery, naval engineering and electronics.</li>
<li>Raids: Attack important enemy targets with carefully planned strikes. Enemy ports, industrial structures, research facilities and special resource collection areas are potential targets for bombing strikes, commando raids or paratroop attacks.</li>
<li>And more: Including changes to the map art to show new structures, AI improvements to planning attacks, and changes to the use and effectiveness of atomic warfare.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Hearts of Iron IV has Native Linux support. It's also rated Steam Deck Playable.</p>
<p>You can buy this DLC by itself for $24.99 / £21.99 / €24.99 or as part of the Hearts of Iron IV Expansion Pass 1.</p>

      <title>Hybrid gaming controller MoveMaster has a new website, shipping to the UK now available and 10% off</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>MoveMaster is a thoroughly odd, unique and very interesting device that you might want to take a look at to change the way you game. I've had one for a little while now, donated thanks to a reader, and I honestly think it's <em>awesome</em>. One of my favourite gadgets to hook up for a gaming session, although it does depend on the game.</p>
<p>You would use the MoveMaster in place of a keyboard, for smoother movement and interactions with the game. It takes some getting used to, but it really can making gaming feel not just different but a little bit more exciting.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18303512561731670710gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Using it is really simple. You rest your palm on the top of it, and simply move your palm around on it for the movement. It's weirdly smooth and actually feels a lot more natural in certain games compared with pushing down keys on a keyboard or flicking sticks with your thumbs on a gamepad. Highly configurable in the software, which directly supports Linux too, which is pretty rare for a hardware vendor.</p>
<p>If you have small hands (like me) you can move up the buttons on the front of it too, getting that perfect fit, which is a nice touch. Same with the bottom thumb button.</p>
<p>They also recently announced a version for left-handers too, that has the two thumb buttons on the opposite side of the unit.</p>

<p>Corben on Twitch has a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/collections/AxHkx779Uhc-OA?filter=collections" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">video</a> of it in action on Linux with Everspace 2. Unfortunately, I forgot to save the previous livestreams with it on I did on the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamingonlinux" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux Twitch</a>, because I'm a <em>true professional</em> of course.</p>
<p>Their team just announced a brand new easier to use website, and they can now ship directly to the UK. Want to get it a bit cheaper? They have a 10% discount code "<strong>Launch10</strong>" right now.</p>

      <title>Avowed from Obsidian gets a release date, and pre-orders with earlier access if you pay £80</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The continuing trend of getting you to pay more to play just a few days earlier continues. Avowed from Obsidian Entertainment does look like bloody good fun, but £80 of fun?</p>
<p>Xbox Game Studios and Obsidian Entertainment announced the February 18th release date today. Although, that's only the date for us regular chumps that pay £60 / $70, you crazy people with money to burn that decide to pay £80 / $90 can play on February 13th with Advanced Access that Valve promoted <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/valve-makes-paid-advanced-access-a-clear-feature-on-steam-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">as a normal feature on Steam</a> earlier this year.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EbB4-LoURRs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1c550db61bb59baa3633cb0b6b7ca6ff.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EbB4-LoURRs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">The minimum Windows PC specifications were also revealed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>CPU</strong>: AMD Ryzen 5 2600 / Intel i5-8400</li>
<li><strong>GPU</strong>: AMD RX 5700 / Nvidia GTX 1070 / Intel Arc A580</li>
<li><strong>Memory</strong>:16GB</li>
<li><strong>Storage</strong>: SSD required (75GB install size)</li>
<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on that, it <em>should</em> run quite well on Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> don't you think? Perhaps even 30FPS on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>More about it: "Set in the fictional world of Eora that was first introduced to players in the Pillars of Eternity franchise, Avowed is a first-person fantasy action RPG from the award-winning team at Obsidian Entertainment.</p>
<p>You are the envoy of Aedyr, a distant land, sent to investigate rumors of a spreading plague throughout the Living Lands - an island full of mysteries and secrets, danger and adventure, and choices and consequences, and untamed wilderness. You discover a personal connection to the Living Lands and an ancient secret that threatens to destroy everything. Can you save this unknown frontier and your soul from the forces threatening to tear them asunder?"</p>

<p>Half-Life 2 RTX looks like it's coming along quite nicely, if you're a fan of everything being a bit shinier.</p>
<p>NVIDIA recently put up a blog post to celebrate Half-Life 2's 20th Anniversary that's coming up — <em>checking notes to see if it's real</em> — tomorrow, oh wow, it's really that old? Anyway, NVIDIA put up a new video with fresh footage of Half-Life 2 RTX in a new anniversary tribute you can watch below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5FZ49Ou8zAE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e59525f170c00552e6d17920dbf5ef6e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5FZ49Ou8zAE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>NVIDIA are also giving away a custom wrapped <em>Half-Life 2</em> GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER graphics card. I must admit, it looks pretty sweet. Although you have to engage with NVIDIA across either X, TikTok, Facebook, or Instagram to actually enter to win it.</p>
<p>See more in the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-eu/geforce/news/half-life-2-20th-anniversary-rtx-wishlist/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>It will be available as a "free DLC for all Half-Life 2 owners". You'll likely need <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> to play it on Linux.</p>

      <title>EVERSPACE 2 fixes videos playback on Linux and Steam Deck with Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In the latest little update to EVERSPACE 2, it's a good one for players on Desktop Linux and Steam Deck, as it includes an important fix.</p>
<p>Players may have noticed missing or broken videos on Linux / Steam Deck with Proton, but thankfully the latest update should have now fully solved this with DX12. On top of that the developers also say they fixed a memory leak when using NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation. <em>In related news, Proton Experimental <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/proton-experimental-adds-dlss-3-frame-generation-support-plus-fixes-for-dragon-age-the-veilguard-rivals-of-aether-ii-and-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently added support for DLSS 3 Frame Generation</a>.</em></p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Yup, Valve are still updating and improving Team Fortress 2, and another fresh upgrade is out now improving the matchmaking experience.</p>
<p>Nice to see, after the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/team-fortress-2-gets-a-summer-event-update-new-comic-on-the-way/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Summer Update</a> that seemed to again help deal with the bots, and the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/the-save-team-fortress-2-petition-lands-at-valve-hq-with-over-340000-names/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">delivery of the big petition to Valve</a>, that work on TF2 continues.

<li>Improved matchmaker decision making for cross-region parties.</li>
<li>Added error messages when being ejected from the matchmaking queue due to connectivity or authentication failures, rather than the queue simply silently vanishing.</li>

<li>Fixed multiple cases of in-progress casual matches abruptly terminating or failing to be assigned any new players if the game server ever loses connection to Steam.</li>

      <title>Old Skies from Wadjet Eye Games looks like one to remember with a new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're a lover of point and click adventure games, you're going to want to watch the new trailer for Old Skies from Wadjet Eye Games. Due out sometime in Spring 2025, it will have Native Linux support.</p>
<p>A little reminder on what it is: "Time Travel is real and history is up for grabs! In this point-and-click, you play Fia Quinn, a time agent for the ChronoZen agency. Your job is to keep close watch on seven travelers who have the desire (and the bank accounts) to sightsee in the past. Some are simply curious. Others have unfinished business to resolve. And they’ve all put down a lot of money for the trip, so it’s vital that you keep them happy while ensuring they follow the rules. But what could go wrong? It's only time travel, after all."</p>
<p>Check out the brand new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SCiEk-LezlY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/16133fced6a1c1fbd6293968c4f26339.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SCiEk-LezlY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Seems I haven't covered this since the original reveal trailer <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/old-skies-is-an-upcoming-time-travel-adventure-from-wadjet-eye-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in mid 2022</a>, so it's nice to see how it's coming along! Keeping this now firmly in my watch-list, that trailer really caught my attention.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Seven eras of history to visit! From the speakeasies of Prohibition to the gangs of the Gilded Age to the morning of September 11th.</li>
<li>High resolution 1920 x 1080 graphics! That's 3x higher than Unavowed.</li>
<li>Lots of puzzles that require temporal thinking to solve.</li>
<li>Death! You CAN die in this adventure game, but time travel means you can try again. And again. And again.</li>
<li>Musical score by Thomas Regin (composer for Unavowed and the Blackwell series)</li>
<li>Full voice acting! Our largest cast yet.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Temtem: Swarm is a survivor-like bullet heaven with cute creatures to evolve out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Available now in Early Access, survivor-like bullet heaven Temtem: Swarm is another game entering the crowded but popular genre from developer Crema. <em>Note: the developer provided a key.</em></p>
<p>Based on the massive popularity of Vampire Survivors, but in the world Crema created for their online creature-collection game Temtem. Check out the gameplay trailer to see what you're in for:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OFQI1xMIhSU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b9f580ad5db9d8e820e0c443cf108ce4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OFQI1xMIhSU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Since it's unfinished, I'll reserve final judgement for when it is but they say it's going to be in Early Access for around a year while they add in more content. Based on what's there right now though from the time I've played, it's a visually welcoming and action-packed game that's easy to lose track of time with.</p>
<p>The addition of online co-op is nice so you can take down the swarms together, and dead players get a ghost to move around with and get revived, so as an online co-op game it can be pretty great too. No <em>local</em> co-op though, which seems like a big missed opportunity considering it would be a perfect game for it. It's not just a multiplayer game though, to be clear, it's all playable solo.</p>
<p>However, it does suffer from being <em>not quite</em> unique enough I think. If you've played a few of these survivor-likes by now, I don't think it's going to particularly sway you over just yet, but as an entry into the genre it does a great job to be entertaining to play. I actually <em>love</em> the the ultimate abilities of the Temtem that visually look awesome when you get to fire them off.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8320394711731602699gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8320394711731602699gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Smashing through the crowds in the image above as Baboong (evolved from Smazee) with their ultimate ability, which spawns two spinning boulders you can swing around is definitely a highlight. Love watching them spin through a big wave. Juicy.</p>
<p>Evolving your character into their next stage is a good addition too, seeing them grow and change visually with a statistics buff and animation, but I was hoping there was a little bit more to it than just that. Seems like something else that could have been expanded upon, to give you more of something else when you evolve, like an additional power. Although, that said, you can entirely skip the evolution to pick a different upgrade but still, evolution's feel like they need something else to them.</p>
<p>There's a Synergies system included too which is where if you pair up certain abilities with specific gear, will turn it into something more powerful. It's <em>not</em> very well explained though. When you play in co-op it also makes it more interesting, as if your co-op partner has the required gear it will also work. </p>
<p>Outside of running around and blasting through it, there's also a pretty decently sized meta-progression system to unlock all sorts from new techniques to use in the battles to specifically upgrading each Temtem directly. This is the key to the game, getting you to play more and more to expand what you have access to. I'm not overly keen on the Temtem meta upgrade system as it is right now though, with lots hidden behind specific "Kudos" (like challenges) without telling you what they are. You just have to play to discover whatever the challenge is. If they made that clearer, I think I would enjoy it more so I can know what I really want to work towards for each Temtem to play as.</p>
<p>It works great on Linux using the latest <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/proton-90-3-released-and-proton-experimental-upgraded-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-3</a> and performance on Steam Deck has mostly been fine too. Some text is a little bit small, which I found even on a big TV was also a bit problematic. Too many developers are still putting out games with small text, and that's quite annoying. Valve gave it a Deck Playable rating.</p>
<p>For now it's a tentative recommendation because it looks good, plays well but it really feels like it's missing some special sauce to hook me in like other similar games have. I'll keep checking back though with major updates. It really does have some of the best visual and character design in the genre though.</p>

      <title>Minecraft-like free and open source game VoxeLibre (formerly MineClone2) hits over 500K downloads</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Originally called MineClone2, <a href="https://content.luanti.org/packages/Wuzzy/mineclone2/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">VoxeLibre</a> is a free and open source sandbox game that's inspired by Minecraft and it recently hit a big milestone. <em>This is a game you would play via <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/luanti-formerly-minetest-v5100-out-now-bringing-ui-updates-fancier-shaders-renaming-work/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Luanti (formerly Minetest)</a>.</em></p>
<p>As per the official <a href="https://content.luanti.org/packages/Wuzzy/mineclone2/stats/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">statistics</a>, the game has now been downloaded well over 500,000 times, averaging nearly 1,000 per day over the last month. Pretty incredible for such an open source project, and nice to see it lively with plenty of fans as an alternative to Minecraft. Originally it had a target of sticking to Minecraft 1.12 as its inspiration, but now it's gradually becoming more of its own thing.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6499681591731599351gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>A former maintainer on the project shared the news in the <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux Discord</a> and mentioned some other fun statistics about the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lifetime stats of nearly 8 years of work:<br/>
- over 3000 issues (69% closed)<br/>
- over 1600 pull requests (95% closed)</p>
<p>Last 12 months:<br/>
- 7 Releases published<br/>
- 269 Pull requests merged by 46 users<br/>
- 75 Pull requests proposed by 21 users<br/>
- 199 Issues closed from 67 users<br/>
- 192 Issues created by 44 users<br/>
- 234 Unresolved Conversations</p>
<p>Upcoming release: 87% Completed</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Certainly seems like a healthy bit of development going on for it.</p>

      <title>Classic Unreal Tournament and Unreal now easier to download free thanks to OldUnreal (updated)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 14/11/2024 - 17:28 UTC</strong>: an Epic Games Spokesperson replied with a short statement:</p>
<blockquote>We can confirm that Unreal 1 and Unreal Tournament are available on <a href="http://archive.org" target="_blank">archive.org</a> and people are free to independently link to and play these versions.</blockquote>
<p>So there you have it, both games are officially properly free to grab. As approved by Epic Games.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Epic Games <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/epic-games-are-killing-off-a-bunch-of-classics-like-unreal-tournament/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced back at the end of 2022</a> that they were pulling a whole bunch of classics like Unreal Tournament and Unreal from stores, along with turning off servers, but now it's a bit easier to get them running again.</p>
<p>The news comes thanks to the <a href="https://www.oldunreal.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">OldUnreal</a> team, who have been publishing patches for the likes of Unreal Tournament for a long time now. Shared in the <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux Discord</a> yesterday, was the news that the OldUnreal team are now providing easy installers for both the original classics: Unreal Tournament and Unreal.</p>
<p>However, to be clear, these installers actually pull the ISO downloads from the Internet Archive. OldUnreal's team said (via their <a href="https://discord.com/channels/143986633992175616/820336164946575441/1306313593091788890" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Discord</a>) yesterday they actually now have "Epic's approval to distribute the Unreal Gold ISO". A few days before, another OldUnreal team member also mentioned (via <a href="https://discord.com/channels/143986633992175616/820336164946575441/1300797583232602164" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Discord</a>) how "With Epic's permission" they were linking to the downloads from the Internet Archive for both games.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18149970531731587827gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Unreal Tournament</em></p>
<p>Their installers for <a href="https://www.oldunreal.com/downloads/unrealtournament/full-game-installers/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Unreal Tournament</a> and <a href="https://www.oldunreal.com/downloads/unreal/full-game-installers/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Unreal</a> are currently Windows-only, so hopefully Linux builds will come eventually. For Linux, there's actually a <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/com.epicgames.ut99" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Flathub</a> installer for Unreal Tournament that pulls in OldUnreal updates too, but you still need to grab the content yourself (available in the <a href="https://archive.org/download/ut-goty/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Internet Archive</a>). The OldUnreal team also pointed out there's Lutris installers for both <a href="https://lutris.net/games/unreal-gold/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Unreal Gold</a> and <a href="https://lutris.net/games/unreal-tournament/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Unreal Tournament</a>.</p>
<p>Doing my due diligence, I've reached out to my Epic Games contacts directly to see if I can actually get a proper confirmation that Epic Games really did give their approval for all this. Will update on any reply I receive.</p>

      <title>Old School Rally gets split-screen support, new stages and a new car</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Old School Rally is properly awesome. Bringing back some fond memories for me of playing Colin McRae Rally on the original PlayStation and now it just got a whole lot better. It's Steam Deck Verified and runs great on Linux with the latest Proton 9.0-3.</p>
<p>The big addition in the latest update is split-screen support! So now you can challenge friends locally or via Steam Remote Play that's supported for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8500596601731585431gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Also in this release is a new vehicle with the Pada B82, that's "Inspired by one of the best-selling cars in the history of automobile". Plus new stages: Arizona SS1, United Kindom SS1, and two new variants of fan-favourite tracks from Finland and Sweden.</p>
<p>On top of that there's new S-Class rally events added in to play through, a new foggy weather effect, five new music tracks, improved support for steering wheels, wipers will show up in cockpit view for rainy weather, new collectables to unlock and of course bug fixes. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11090195021731585730gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Loving watching this one progress. It's in Early Access so there's more content to come.</p>

      <title>Godot Engine 4.4 dev 4 released with interactive in-game editing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>An exciting new feature for game developers has begun to land in the free and open source Godot Engine, with the start of interactive in-game editing.</p>
<p>Coming in Godot 4.4 which just had a 4th developer preview released, this feature lets developers more easily debug an actual running game. Instead of me trying to explain it poorly as a non-dev though, here's what they said about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the most requested features is the ability to debug the running game from within the editor including pausing the game, clicking on elements within the scene, and embedding the running game window inside the editor. Dev4 comes with the first two of these workflows thanks to the contribution from <a href="https://github.com/YeldhamDev" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">YeldhamDev</a> of Lone Wolf Technology &amp; W4 Games, users are now able to explore their project’s world freely!</p>
<p>The actual embedding of the game window into the editor will come later in a subsequent PR.</p>
<p>Check out the PR (<a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/97257" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GH-97257</a>) and the video below to see exactly what this change enables.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the PR noted above this includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Selection of 2D/3D nodes at runtime, this includes anything that has collisions or some sort of visual representation. When a node is selected, a selection box will appear around it and it will be opened in the inspector.</li>
<li>Suspend mode. This is a middle ground between in-game pausing and the editor's break feature. When this mode is enabled, it allows node selection, and frame skipping.</li>
<li>Next frame. This allows the game to run one frame at the time when the it's suspended.
	<ul>
<li><em>Production edit: This closes <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/3105" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Add a keyboard shortcut to perform frame-by-frame stepping when running a project from the editor  godot-proposals#3105</a>.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2D/3D camera override. The camera manipulation can come from within the game, or the 2D and 3D editors.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And a little video they included to show it off a bit:</p>
<div class="ckeditor-html5-video" style="text-align: center;">
<video controls="controls" loop="loop" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19557003511731583880gol1.mp4"></video>
</div>
<p>There's some other really nice sounding features added into Godot as well with this release including ubershaders and pipeline pre-compilation. The result is two big improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Ubershaders: a technique that allows us to completely avoid shader stutter when objects are viewed in a scene for the first time</li>
<li>Dedicated transfer queues: by relying on special hardware functions we can dramatically improve the load time for scenes containing many graphics assets like meshes and textures.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>So future games made with at least Godot 4.4 should see some real nice performance improvements there. Not just for players, but for developers as well since the previous dev3 release also had a massive optimized scene startup for large projects.</p>
<p>Godot is really getting some advanced features lately, wonderful to see for cross-platform game development.</p>

      <title>Little Big Adventure – Twinsen&#39;s Quest a remake of the original classic is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Little Big Adventure – Twinsen's Quest from [2.21] and Microids is out now. It's a remake of the original classic with a graphical makeover and modernized gameplay.</p>
<p>Initially released in 1994 under the name Little Big Adventure, this classic action-adventure game imagined by Frédérick Raynal (Alone in the Dark) was a worldwide success. Little Big Adventure – Twinsen’s Quest features a new artistic direction, modernised gameplay and brand-new music by Philippe Vachey, the original composer.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UQzpG8WHC1s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2004fc994687be8ae6c18c91545a90e0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UQzpG8WHC1s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Their press team did initially offer me pre-release access to take a look. But they <em>didn't</em> actually reply to my follow-up email enquiring about any Steam Deck / Linux support, so I won't be directly taking a look right now since no key was provided. I'm sure plenty of readers will still be interested to know it's out anyway, but you will need <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> to play it.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Discover a richly layered story filled with complex themes.</li>
<li>Navigate through Twinsun with a revamped level layout and redesigned controls.</li>
<li>Defeat foes with an enhanced Magic Ball.</li>
<li>Enjoy a unique and updated artistic vision.</li>
<li>Immerse yourself with a new soundtrack by the original composer.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Train finally returns to Counter-Strike 2 in the latest big update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Train! It's back! A fan favourite map returns that was annoyingly missing from the release of Counter-Strike 2. But it's now back and looking better than ever in the latest update to Valve's FPS.</p>
<p>Writing in a news post the Valve developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's plenty of classic Counter-Strike in every inch of this map—but we also made sure to mix up the gameplay a bit to keep you Train veterans on your toes. We also gave it a full visual overhaul, which means your favorite bleak Eastern European train yard is now 60% cloudier. With a chance of rain? We guarantee it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8273035481731582563gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8273035481731582563gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Train, CS2 on Linux, Max Settings</em></p>
<p>Additionally Valve also updated Overpass based on feedback, and there's four new community maps added into the game. Basalt makes a return, along with Edin in casual and competitive game modes. Plus Palais and Whistle have been added to Wingman.</p>
<p>Also new in this release is a damage prediction setting. This allows clients (your PC) to "immediately play the audio/visual effects of inflicting damage without waiting for confirmation from the server". It can make things feel more responsive but it "comes with the risk of occasionally being wrong (e.g. due to aim punch, tagging, or a death that your client isn't yet aware of)".</p>
<p>Valve also made various other adjustments to the gameplay recently including networking issues, that seem to have been quite well received to make the gameplay feel better overall.</p>

      <title>Mesa 24.2.7 out now and Mesa 24.3 may come sooner than expected</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest update for the open source graphics drivers is here with Mesa 24.2.7 out now. Plus we might see Mesa 24.3 a bit sooner than expected.</p>
<p>For Mesa 24.2.7 the release <a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/relnotes/24.2.7.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">notes</a> mention these fixes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>brw_fs_opt_copy_propagation incorrectly handles size changes of uniforms.</li>
<li>nouveau paraview msaa corruption 23.1 bisected regression.</li>
<li>Missing xshmfence dependency for X11 WSI on macOS.</li>
<li>[AMDGPU RDNA3] Black square artifacts in viewport renders in Blender.</li>
<li>radv: test_sm67_sample_cmp_level test in vkd3d-proton fails.</li>
<li>[ANV] LNL tiled corruption in background traci Blackops3-trace-dx11-1080p-high.</li>
<li>[anv] Possible regression in e3814dee1ac0f90771b921a4f6f5aed10f06e8d4.</li>
<li>Confidential issue #12092.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>No new features, since it's a point-release for the last stable release.</p>
<p>However, we also have news that Mesa 24.3 development has gone seemingly better than expected, which will have new features. In the release announcement email for the second Release Candidate, developer Dylan Baker mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have a fairly small RC2 today, with a bit of work across the board. We currently only have 2 open blocking issues, and given that we delayed the branchpoint by 3 weeks, I wouldn't object to pulling in the RC period by 1 week and have rc3 rather than rc4 be the final release, if we can get all of the issues closed in time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on the release schedule, that might then put the Mesa 24.3 release around November 20th.</p>

      <title>Yawnoc is chaotic top-down shooter rogue-lite inspired by Conway&#39;s Game of Life and other cellular automata</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the source code available along with the game, Yawnoc is a chaotic top-down shooter rogue-lite inspired by Conway's Game of Life and other cellular automata that's out now. <em>Note: personal purchase.</em></p>
<p>This is a thoroughly strange one. And to be honest, I didn't initially have the tiniest idea what it all really means. I tried reading up on it for a while, into some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> pages and other literature and my brain is now thoroughly fried. Basically, you run around shooting strange machines in a wave, then go and buy a bunch of upgrades and new weapons before jumping into the next wave.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6497768291731518512gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>From the Steam page the developer explains it as this: "Fight machines from different automata algorithms including Conway's Game of Life, Brian's Brain, and LowDeath. As you progress through the forest, the machines will begin to follow different cellular automata rulesets that change their behavior. Master each algorithm to learn how to quickly exterminate machines in every area!"</p>
<p>Playing it helps you understand it. Depending on where you hit them with your bullets, will change what they do. Some do nothing or fire back, others grow and grow some more, a few might launch what appear to be mortars or some sort of grenades at you. It just gets <em>weird</em>. After a few waves a hostile but more living-like creature was running around firing everywhere, I took them down, and when finishing the wave they woke up and it was another living being like me and they decided to join me to help out. Nice.</p>
<p>During a wave enemies flicker about all over the place, and sometimes send you into what looks like another dimension when things get…weird.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7774496801731518579gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I've only begun scratching the surface of it but it has a really nice overall idea. And the Linux version does run great.</p>
<p>Be sure to check out the release trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5i5lAmJbaiA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c7f68183c385e6605a4264a7f1e4bdda.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5i5lAmJbaiA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Not only does it have full Native Linux support but it also includes the source code as well. As per the readme in the installed folder:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yawnoc is written in Python, Pygame, and ModernGL. Developed with Python 3.11.7 on Windows 11 &amp; Ubuntu 20.</p>
<p>The source code is hacked together to help ship the game in a reasonable amount of time, so while it may be easy to tinker with since it's Python, changing complex mechanics may be messy.</p>
<p>Steam launches the yawnoc executable, but the source can be run with a valid Python environment from yawnoc.py. The rest of the code is in the scripts folder.</p>
</blockquote>

      <title>GOG launch their Preservation Program to make games live forever with a hundred classics being &#39;re-released&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> going back to their roots a little here with the announcement of the GOG Preservation Program, with an aim to ensure various games get to live on forever.<em> A fitting announcement for their 16th anniversary don't you think?</em></p>
<p>What's it all about then? GOG will be directly maintaining various classic games, ensuring they work on modern systems, and giving each of them a big special stamp on the GOG store page to show you. Like this one for one of my faves, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/theme_hospital" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Theme Hospital</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20223086901731506744gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>They've already been doing it for a while, and this includes the re-releases of recent classics like <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/alpha_protocol" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Alpha Protocol</a> and the <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil_bundle" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Resident Evil Bundle</a> — but now they're putting an official stamp on it. GOG said in a press release that "100 classic games from our catalog are being re-released today with updated or quality-tested builds" including <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_3_complete_edition" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Heroes of Might and Magic 3: Complete</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/dungeon_keeper_2" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Dungeon Keeper 2</a>.</p>
<p>However, it's not <em>just</em> classic retro games, they will be up for maintaining any game, even if it was only released "just a few months ago" but not brand new games as they expect the developer to do that directly. As long as GOG can commit to it, they'll seemingly look at any game to keep it going.</p>
<p>They won't be using community fixes and patches though, as they "want to avoid passing the responsibility of maintaining the game’s quality on to the community" and to preserve the original experience.</p>
<p>GOG say the GOG Preservation Program is currently Windows-only as their "priority is to preserve as many games as possible under the Program, before expanding to other operating systems". That's pretty much expected really from GOG.</p>
<p>See more on the <a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG website</a>. They also launched a <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/2024_16_gog_anniversary" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">big 16th anniversary sale</a>.</p>
<p>You can install and keep GOG games easily up to date on Linux / Steam Deck with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/heroic-games-launcher-2152-released-fixing-amazon-gog-and-epic-games-issues/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a>.</p>

      <title>Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition gets updated, needs a fix on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rockstar Games decided to update the Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition which includes Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Grand Theft Auto III but it seems you'll need this quick fix to run it now on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Various players have been reporting a "Fatal error" being encountered when trying to play any of them. However, there's two workarounds I know of to get around it. What's interesting is that this <em>might</em> be specific to the Steam Deck OLED, as it's to do with HDR not working. So you can try this launch option first:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">DXVK_HDR=0 %command%</code></p>
<p>To do this. Go into the game in your Steam Library, over to the little cog icon on the right for the Properties, and put that in the Launch Options box.</p>
<p>Another potential workaround is to force DirectX 12 for it:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">%command% -dx12 </code></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15685870081731506023gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Grand Theft Auto III – The Definitive Edition</em></p>
<p>An update for DXVK was <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4450" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">merged</a> that should fix this so it's likely to land in Proton Experimental sometime soon. After that, Valve will probably then switch the three games in the collection to default to it until a new main version of Proton is released. At least until then, you can use those workarounds to play each game.</p>
<p>According to Rockstar the <a href="https://support.rockstargames.com/articles/35337378670739/Grand-Theft-Auto-The-Trilogy-The-Definitive-Edition-Title-Update-Notes-1-112-PlayStation-5-Xbox-Series-X-S-PC" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> for the collection contained:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Numerous fixes and improvements.</li>
<li>Added Classic Lighting mode which restores the look and feel of the sky in the original games.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The trilogy is available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sub/817628/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Chrono is a puzzler about time-controlling objects in the world</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For fans of Portal and other first-person puzzle games, the indie game Chrono from Portuguese developer David Simoes is all about time-controlling objects across various rooms to progress. <em>Note: the developer sent me a key.</em></p>
<p>Here you get to explore a bunch of puzzle rooms after a computer accident sets you free. The game mechanics are quite simple, but used to great effect. After your escape you'll find a special remote, that allows you to control the temporal properties of objects. You can pause things, rewind them to send them backwards, change their direction and more. There's some really nice ideas in there and it won't take you particularly long to get through (a few hours).</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6Y1DOkvwDS8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1959f6ba3380c19cadbebc4b494fb885.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6Y1DOkvwDS8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As shown in the trailer above you'll come across moving platforms, lasers, spinning turbine blades and more that you'll need to figure out the sequence of changing them all using your remote.</p>
<p>It has a nice idea, that I hope they're able to expand on in future, perhaps with a slightly bigger budget. But if you like smaller puzzle games at £2.49 you can't really argue with that price.</p>
<p>Chrono has Native Linux support and works on the Steam Deck. There's also a demo available.</p>

      <title>Stellar Blade should come to PC in 2025, dev expects sales to exceed console</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Stellar Blade, the story-driven action adventure that's currently a PlayStation exclusive, looks like it's coming to PC sometime in 2025.</p>
<p>As posted in their 3Q 2024 <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/ir.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=203&amp;page=1&amp;code=ir_eng" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">earnings report</a> they said "The release is being considered within 2025. Considering recent trends such as Steam's expanding market share in the AAA game sector and the global success of Black Myth: Wukong, we expect the performance on PC to exceed that on consoles.".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20279867651731500624gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p><em>It's also set for a NieR:Automata crossover DLC to release soon.</em></p>
<p>Hopefully it will work well with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a> on Desktop Linux and Steam Deck. Nice to see more console exclusives making their way onto Steam. Having to own a specific piece of gaming hardware to play a specific game just seems so backwards to me.</p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ravaged by strange, powerful creatures, Earth has been abandoned, and what is left of the decimated human race has fled to a Colony in outer space.</p>
<p>After travelling from the Colony, 7th Airborne Squad member EVE arrives on the desolate remains of our planet with a clear-cut mission: to save humankind by reclaiming Earth from the Naytiba – the malevolent force that has devastated it.</p>
<p>But as EVE tackles the Naytiba one-by-one, piecing together the mysteries of the past in the ruins of human civilization, she realizes that her mission is far from straightforward. In fact, almost nothing is as it seems…</p>

      <title>Check out the demo for Into The Grid that blends dungeon-crawling hacking, deck-building and combat</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Into The Grid is coming next year and this award-winning mixture of dungeon-crawling, deck-building and turn-based combat now has a demo available. <em>It has Native Linux support.</em></p>
<p>Really interesting mixture of styles here. The dungeon crawling side of it reminded me of the hacking mini-game in the later Deus Ex games. And on top of that you get to build a deck of slick looking cards, then fight turn-based battles against various types of enemies that have some nice 3D animations on them. As far as deck-builders go, this is pretty dynamic and definitely feels unique in a crowded space. All wrapped up in a sleek cyberpunk style, with a story focused on taking down the evil mega corporations that control the world from the shadows — it's one to watch.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0uyftbKqvp8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4b3043adae00dc1d22b40eae25d222c9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0uyftbKqvp8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Main Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>An exciting blend of deckbuilding, card battler and dungeon crawler</strong> - Into The Grid introduces a map exploration system to the genre that’s a breath of fresh air. You will need to be tactical and strategical not only in the way you put together your deck and play your cards, but also in how you explore the map and manage your limited resources to find and reach your goal before The Grid kicks you out, sends a private security force to your location, or worse.</li>
<li><strong>A unique dual resource system to diminish RNG and leverage “dead draws”</strong> - Into The Grid introduces a novel combat mechanic called “Commands”, skills you can activate during combat by spending a resource that almost every card in the game generates just by playing them. Commands are designed to have supporting effects that help to play around RNG by letting you, for example, draw or fetch cards from specific places. Their varied effects also enable different archetypes within each character, creating a new fan of possibilities as you change your Commands in between battles and adjust them to your current deck.</li>
<li><strong>5 Characters and Factions to discover the deep lore of the “2112 Universe”</strong><br/>
	​Into The Grid takes place in the year 2112, in a universe that Flatline Studios has been developing for even longer than the game itself. This universe is full of characters and entities with their own agendas and motivations. In gameplay terms, the full game will include 5 different characters, each one belonging to a different hacker Faction that determines the hacker’s ethos and their reasons to be outlaws.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The Linux demo did appear to run very nicely.</p>
<p>Into The Grid also took part in the recent Save &amp; Sound festival, where the composer and sound designer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOlc0sNOUPU" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">did some tunes</a>.</p>

      <title>Face off against mutated snacks as a Banana in Bronana which aims to be the next Brotato</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bronana aims to be the next Brotato but you're a Banana, with clear inspiration from the potato wave-survival game along with all the survivor-likes. To be fair to it though, it once again does a few things differently to try and stand out amongst a crowded and constantly growing genre.</p>
<p>Here you pick your Banana and head off into an arena where you face off against all the weird snacks. Pick up the coins they drop as the wave continues to count down until the end, and then you'll get to upgrade your character. What makes it different is the progression here. At the end of each wave it will drop three items on the floor for you to pick from, and then you're given a choice of paths to run through to get to the next wave, with each door giving you a different benefit (like an XP boost).</p>
<p>There's also various NPCs to interact with that can present you with random events to participate in, so it is a bit more dynamic than Brotato (but nowhere near as polished). Check out the new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Hc8TpZ8Z5-U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/185d845b5f560db17ce36208ea34dea2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Hc8TpZ8Z5-U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release: "Bronana offers a thrilling gameplay experience full of unpredictable events and fun NPC interactions," said PK, director at busy bear "Prepare for a snacktastic struggle for survival with slippery maneuvers, quirky yet challenging stages, and incredibly high replayability potential when the title arrives on PC via Steam and Steam Deck next month!"</p>
<p>Another game made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> but no Linux version though, so you'll need <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> for this one. There's a demo available now which worked fine with Proton 9.0-3, although clearly a little rough around the edges. I liked what I saw though, it gets pretty chaotic and there's plenty of over-the-top action.</p>
<p>It's releasing December 13th for $4.99.</p>

      <title>Vehicle combat in Scaravan 66 looks nuts and I want it now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lithic Entertainment just revealed Scaravan 66, and I smashed that wishlist button faster than ever because it looks so damn delicious.</p>
<p>What is it? A fast-paced car combat game about exploding your way to freedom on the road where you'll battle all sorts of monsters and even the Devil directly. I was told to "Imagine the chaotic car combat of Twisted Metal blended with the endlessly engaging character-driven roguelike of Hades" and that's apparently what you get here. Like a lot of developers though, they're really stretching the limits of what a "roguelike" is.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Gunning for the End of the Road: </strong>As a Road Reaper, you'll gun down every Devil-sent demon and undead on your way to that elusive end of the road. With each attempt to escape your hell, you'll grow stronger and unravel more about yourself and the world you're tethered to.</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Perks, Powers, and Pit Stops: </strong>Need to make a pit stop? Make strategic stops and visit other Road Reapers on the route who will lend you their powers and help you go that extra mile.</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Geared for Replayability: </strong>No two attempts to escape your tether are ever the same. With each attempt, discover more about your fellow Reapers, the fiends who stand in your way, and even yourself.</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Devil’s Diabolical Designs: </strong>The Devil is always one step ahead as she orchestrates her symphony of carnage against you. Enemies sent to stop your escape will differ in number and strength, as she watches your every move and fine-tunes her strategy. She is always plotting against you!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Karate Survivor will have you kicking, punching, rolling over tables and throwing chairs at people</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Continuing my quest to play every survivor-like there is, Karate Survivor is the latest I've been kicking and punching through and it's great and surprisingly different to the rest of the crop. <em>Note: key provided by Vicarious PR.</em></p>
<p>This one is like playing through a camp 80s martial arts movie, only in a Vampire Survivors-like form. In fact, I got a little Streets of Rage vibe from this one too, I could have seen this on my shelf next to it in the days of the Sega Mega Drive. It has the usual marks of a survivor-like with auto-attacks, lots of enemies swarming you and various upgrades to build up a crazy character as you go.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/228605971731424411gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>However, compared to a lot of the survivor-likes, this genuinely does do plenty differently. For starters, it is of course melee focused, it's all about getting up close and personal.</p>
<p>There's also no specific weapon or ability timers. Instead, you have a <em>character</em> timer. You wait for it to tick down each time, and then it goes through a timeline of moves you've stacked and upgraded after each level-up. You can switch these abilities around in the timeline, and build up combo moves matching colour types to truly kick some ass as you run around. That alone is rather unique in the space, and quite challenging to be in the right position when the timeline is running through so you actually hit everyone. And thanks to that, each run can end up very differently.</p>
<p>There's also weapons spread around the maps like brooms, lamps and plenty more to grab and do some quick smashing over enemies heads. Weapons only have <em>limited</em> uses though as they'll break after only a few hits leaving you once again to spin those arms around. There's even funny special moves at times when you pick up certain objects, like a diving flying kick that will smash a big area after you select the direction.</p>
<p>Release trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WH_KjiLuvMg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/42d04534633b56b1a37669092367b3c3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WH_KjiLuvMg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I really love the map destruction too. As you fight you'll be smashing various parts of the map apart too. It doesn't feel quite as static and lifeless as a lot of similar games in the genre as you'll actually be using a lot of things placed around each map.</p>
<p>During your run through you'll be collecting teeth (hah!), which is your currency for permanent unlocks to boost your character properly with the usual suspects like more damage. What I also enjoyed about this is that as you progress more through it, you'll also unlock more general abilities like rolling over obstacles, kicking objects at people, accessing new areas and a lot more. It sprinkles it all in somewhat quickly too, as long as you do enough during a run and so even after an hour of gameplay you'll have an increasing amount of fun with it.</p>
<p>Played on Linux with the latest <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/proton-90-3-released-and-proton-experimental-upgraded-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-3</a> it works great. Really fun on Steam Deck too, although the performance can at times drop just a bit, it's always over 40FPS in my testing and largely around 60FPS. There's no Steam Deck rating for it yet but the developer noted in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3027930/view/4470479417177538616" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they were directly testing and optimising for it.</p>
<p>Really good fun, unique and worth jumping into for sure. It's strangely somewhere between a beat 'em up and a survivor-like that captivated me. I just wish your character was just a <em>little</em> bit speedier to begin with, but a minor point. Overall it's an easy recommendation.</p>

      <title>Claw machine deckbuilder Dungeon Clawler arrives November 21 and it&#39;s going to grab you</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dungeon Clawler from Stray Fawn Studio who also made The Wandering Village is a claw machine deckbuilder that's now planned to hit Early Access on November 21st.</p>
<p>I've had access for a while as the developer sent an early key, and it's totally grabbed me. I'm a huge sucker for these more casual games, most recently sinking hours into Peglin and now this is going to absolutely destroy my time. Such a simple idea but really makes you itch to have just one more run. Really clever idea and game mechanics, looking forward to seeing it out to see what more players think of it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3UDTxqZf0qw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/30f0095372d7abb081ead50f08a711f4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3UDTxqZf0qw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Since the previous demo in Steam Next Fest they've added lots of content including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty modes (Normal, Hard, Very Hard and Nightmare).</li>
<li>Unlockable lucky paws to equip your character with.</li>
<li>5 new playable characters Squiddy, Garbage Greg, Anne Bunny and Hare L. Quinn.</li>
<li>New rooms (Alchemist to change materials, various mystery rooms).</li>
<li>Reworked 20 floor map featuring multiple exists to choose from.</li>
<li>Full gamepad support.</li>
<li>New music and sound effects.</li>
<li>13 new items.</li>
<li>11 new perks.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>During Early Access they plan to add in new items, perks, enemies and game mechanics and they're estimating it will be in development for at least another year until it's ready.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Fan-made Half-Life 2 Episode 3 demo arrives with Project Borealis: Prologue now on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We may never get Half-Life 2: Episode 3 (basically Half-Life 3), but at least we have the first taster of Project Borealis out now with Project Borealis: Prologue. <em>You know how these prologues work, it's a glorified demo with a fancy name.</em></p>
<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 5 this game is "inspired by the epic cliffhanger from Half-Life 2: Episode Two, Project Borealis represents a fan-made effort to realize a cohesive story conclusion to the episodic series. This prologue chapter invites players back into the HEV suit of Gordon Freeman, offering a glimpse into the next chapter of his journey".</p>
<p>There's no Linux version, so you'll need Proton to try it out. Although, you will need to swap it to Proton Experimental, as the current main Proton 9.0-3 results in this error:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5290795201731405080gol1.png"/></p>
<p>It loads up fine with Proton Experimental. <em>See more in my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton beginner's guide</a> if you're confused.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1964537481731406274gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The developer said they are already planning plenty of updates to fix up various bugs and performance issues. If you can't even launch it, you might be able to with the "-vulkan" launch command on the game (right click -&gt; properties) but the developers noted it's not directly supported on that mode.</p>
<p>Performance on my system showed it to not be especially great, but playable enough when changing a few settings down. But even on Medium overall settings it struggled to stay at 60FPS with my Ryzen 5800x / Radeon 6800 XT.</p>
<p>Don't expect something big (yet) from it, the demo is incredibly short. I managed to finish it including the credits rolling in only about 15 minutes. Incredibly exciting though, they've clearly put a huge amount of effort into this and it really does look and feel the part.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8424739401731406275gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Although we might not be getting Half-Life 3 exactly, Valve do appear to be working on <em>something</em> Half-Life related as <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/valve-working-on-a-new-game-that-could-be-half-life-3/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">we saw from a previous leak</a>.</p>

      <title>Supernatural comedy point-and-click adventure A Vampyre Story: A Bat&#39;s Tale announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The original A Vampyre Story released back in 2008 and now there's finally going to be a new one with A Vampyre Story: A Bat's Tale.</p>
<p>Announced at the end of October, that I missed, Autumn Moon Entertainment that includes Bill Tiller (The Curse of Monkey Island, The Dig), Dave Harris and other ex-LucasArts veterans have partnered up with developer Tag of Joy for this one who made Crowns and Pawns: Kingdom of Deceit. We're set for a fresh and exciting adventure like the classics with this one.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kk4T0IhbtQw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fbf4dafa611055d81e27a323ef006ac9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kk4T0IhbtQw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Vampyre Story: A Bat’s Tale follows Mona, a Parisian opera singer who is kidnapped and taken to a castle in Draxsylvania where she is turned into a vampire. Fortunately, she’s aided by her loyal companion, a wisecracking bat named Froderick. Guide both Froderick and Mona through a landscape of crazy characters, clever puzzles and gorgeous locations, including Dr. Legume’s Home for the Sanity Challenged, the Executioner’s Practice Grounds, the Mortus Labs™ and many others! It will be up to the player to help Mona escape the clutches of a mad scientist and stop his evil plan, find a vampire familiar, and continue her quest to return home.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“I love LucasArts graphic adventures, Halloween, and the classic Universal Monster movies of the 40’s and 50’s. So when I created the original A Vampyre Story, I combined all those things I love together. Since its release, adventure game technology has vastly improved, and by partnering with Tag of Joy, we’ll be able to continue the story of Mona and Froderick in a modern gaming experience that also still evokes the feel of a classic LucasArts graphic adventure,” says Bill Tiller, CEO and Creative Director of Autumn Moon Games. “I couldn’t be more excited about our collaboration. With Tag of Joy’s help we raised enough funding to finally kick off development of the new game, so it’s really amazing to announce that this is finally happening!”</p>
<p>“My brother and I came of age playing games like The Curse of Monkey Island and have released a modern point and click adventure ourselves, so when we learned that Bill was looking to resurrect his A Vampyre Story franchise, we reached out and suggested a collaboration. We are super excited that Bill agreed, and he’s also really friendly and easy to work with!” says Šarūnas Ledas, the CEO and co-founder of Tag of Joy. “Bill’s knowledge, beautiful artwork and a very fun IP combined with our team’s recent experience in creating a 2.5D adventure makes a perfect mix.”</p>
<p>No release date has been given for it yet.</p>

      <title>Direct3D to Vulkan translation layer DXVK v2.5 released with rewritten memory management</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another big release of the Direct3D 8/9/10/11 to Vulkan translation layer (used by Proton) has been released. With DXVK v2.5 bringing rewritten resource and memory management. This should make it a whole lot more efficient at allocating video memory.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Noted in the announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Reduced fragmentation may reduce peak memory usage in games such as <strong>God of War</strong> by up to 1 GiB in extreme cases.</li>
<li>Memory defragmentation is now performed periodically to return some unused memory back to the system.<br/>
	The goal is <strong>not</strong> to reduce VRAM usage at all costs; instead this is done conservatively if the system is under memory pressure, or if a significant amount of allocated memory is unused. Keeping <em>some</em> unused memory is useful to quickly service subsequent allocations.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This will work best if you have GPU drivers that support both VK_EXT_memory_budget and VK_KHR_maintenance5. They're now recommending you have at least Mesa 24.0 or NVIDIA 560.35.03.</p>
<p>Hopefully then, this will mean less potential lock-ups in certain games on systems like the Steam Deck, which has in the past been a bit notorious for VRAM spiking up and then the system just locking up. Something I and many others have seen in God of War and various other AAA games.</p>
<p>Various other enhancements like support for emulated cursors was implemented for the D3D9 cursor API, allowing games to properly set an image as the mouse cursor.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">For D3D9, a fix was implemented for Unreal Engine 3 games that was causing some visual inaccuracies. They also noted some D3D9 games that had specific fixes including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ascension to the Throne.</li>
<li>Command &amp; Conquer: Generals.</li>
<li>King's Bounty: Warriors of the North.</li>
<li>Tomb Raider: Legend.</li>
<li>Rayman 3.</li>
</ul>
<p>Onto D3D11 / DXGI there's also improvements to "reduce system memory pressure and improve stability in 32-bit games" resulting in fixes for Total War: Rome II, Total War: Warhammer III and Ryse: Son of Rome. But some CPU-bound games will see lower performance like Shadow Warrior 2.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13397927841731400614gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some more games that had specific fixes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.</li>
<li>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Campaign Remastered.</li>
<li>Diablo 4.</li>
<li>The Sims 4.</li>
<li>Vindictus.</li>
<li>Yakuza 0 and Yakuza Kiwami.</li>
<li>Dishonored 2.</li>
<li>Tales of Arise.</li>
</ul>
<p>This release also brings an SDL3 backend for DXVK-Native, for using DXVK with Native Linux games.</p>
<p>See more in <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v2.5" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the release notes</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>If you're curious on how to upgrade, you <em>don't</em> actually need to do anything. Proton and GE-Proton use DXVK directly, and so they both pull in updates in their new releases. However, for those who like to live on the <em>wild</em> side, you <em>can</em> upgrade the DXVK version in Proton yourself. Do it at your own risk.</p>
<p>To do so you can just overwrite the existing DXVK files with the release download of the latest DXVK. You can find your Proton install <em>somewhere</em> like this (depending on your Steam Library drives):</p>
<p>For Proton 9 and Proton Experimental:</p>
<p><code>path-to-your/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Proton x.x/files</code></p>
<p>Proton 8 and below:</p>
<p><code>path-to-your/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Proton x.x/dist</code></p>
<p><em>Where x.x is whatever Proton version installed you wish to give a new DXVK.</em></p>
<p>Inside there you will see "lib" and "lib64", for 32bit and 64bit. Inside each of those, there's a "wine" folder and inside there is a "dxvk" folder and that's where you replace the files with new versions. If you mess anything up, one way to ensure it gets reinstalled cleanly is just to remove the "/dist" folder.</p>

      <title>Valve dev details more on the work behind making Steam for Linux more stable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/steam-game-recording-has-officially-launched/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Game Recording was recently released</a>, which came as part of a big Stable Steam Client update that noted it had fixes for "miscellaneous common crashes" on Linux. Now we know a little more on what's happening behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Coming from a <a href="https://ttimo.typepad.com/blog/2024/11/the-steam-client-update-earlier-this-week-mentions-fixed-some-miscellaneous-common-crashes-in-the-linux-notes-which-i-wante.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> from developer Timothée Besset, who does a lot of Valve work, Besset mentions how a change to how they approach the <em>setenv</em> and <em>getenv</em> functions that made the "most significant impact to Steam client stability on Linux".</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">For some context:</p>
<ul>
<li>setenv: change or add an environment variable.</li>
<li>getenv: get an environment variable.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to Besset, one of their colleagues claimed <em>setenv</em> as "the worst Linux API", even though it's such a common API available across all platforms "it was a little difficult to convince ourselves just how bad it is" — ouch. And they already knew, at least on Linux, that "setenv and getenv aren't safe to use in multithreaded environments".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3170509671731398948gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3170509671731398948gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Steam Client</em></p>
<p>Part of their problem though is how on Linux you have so many distributions with different window managers, desktop environments, driver versions, extensive user customization and so on. So their own crash reports end up "very noisy". Another issue is that setenv will at times in a multithreaded program "crash outright", on top of that they found that "other threads would blow up though, usually with a SIGABRT, shortly after calling getenv", and their backtraces for the crashes were "all over the place and could not be easily tied to a single cause".</p>
<p>So what did they do? Here's what:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>We removed the majority of <code class="inline-code">setenv</code> calls. It was mostly used when spawning processes, and refactoring to use <code class="inline-code">exevpe</code> to pass down a prepared environment is an all around improvement.</li>
<li>We reduced how much we rely on <code class="inline-code">getenv</code>, mostly by caching the calls. There is still an uncomfortable amount of it, but it's in OS libraries at this point (x11, xcb, dbus etc.) and we continue reducing it's usage.</li>
<li>For the few remaining <code class="inline-code">setenv</code> use cases that could not be easily refactored, we introduced an 'environment manager' that pre-allocates large enough value buffers at startup for fixed environment variable names, before any threading has started.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a fun little read worth a couple minutes of your time if you're interested on behind the scenes info, and how at times building for Linux can be a minefield.</p>
<p>According to a comment on the post, these issues are in fact being <a href="https://patchwork.sourceware.org/project/glibc/list/?series=36745" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">worked on</a> in glibc, so it may not be such a problem in future for Linux developers.</p>
<p>The more stable it is, the better the experience will be for people switching to Linux, and of course for the Steam Deck too since SteamOS is Linux. Nice to see Valve developers constantly trying to make everything better.</p>

      <title>New Steam Beta has more Game Recording improvements and a Linux fix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released another update to the Steam Beta Client for Steam Deck and Desktop Steam, which includes more improvements and tweaks to Game Recording.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's what the listed in the Desktop <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/4489619632029696340?snr=2___" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed some outdated or missing strings in non-English languages.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Game Recording</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed layout issues in the BPM Game Recording settings page.</li>
<li>Added export time to the progress bar in the send to phone dialog.</li>

      <title>Valve announced the Steam Deck OLED: Limited Edition White</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I am terribly jealous of anyone who is able to grab one of these. Valve just announced the Steam Deck OLED: Limited Edition White is coming soon.</p>
<p>Available starting November 18th at 11PM UTC, like the previous Limited Edition there will be only limited quantities available so it's very much first come first served until they run out. Unlike the other Limited Edition though that was US only, this will be available <em>everywhere</em> the Steam Deck currently is and that includes the newly launched Australia region.</p>
<p>Stock will be allocated "proportionally" across each region, with separate availability between US, CA, UK, EU, AU, and regions covered by KOMODO (Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12505343581731396832gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Valve say the Steam Deck OLED: Limited Edition White has all the <em>same</em> specs as the Steam Deck OLED 1TB model, but in white and grey (and it comes with an exclusive white carrying case).</p>
<p>Same price as the previous translucent Limited Edition at $679 USD.</p>
<p>Why are they doing this? From the press email sent to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last year, we released a smoky translucent limited edition Steam Deck OLED as an experiment to find out if there was interest in alternative colorways (there was!). This is our second experiment along those lines. The difference this time (aside from the color!) is that we're able to ship the Limited Edition White to all regions where Steam Deck already ships. We're curious to see what the response is, and will use what we learn to inform future decisions about any potential new color variants down the line.</p>
<p>We've been super happy with the reception of Steam Deck since we first launched the LCD version in March of 2022. We've always said our intent is to continually work on improving Steam Deck, and that's true from both a software perspective (continuing to ship improvements) and a hardware one (Steam Deck OLED, as well as ongoing work toward the future of Steam Deck and other hardware plans).</p>
<p>As always, we're looking forward to hearing feedback from customers once we start shipping.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keep an eye on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Deck website</a> for when it goes live to buy one. It's restricted to 1 per account, and you must have made a Steam purchase before November 2024 to be able to buy one.</p>

      <title>Rogue Point is a new tactical shooter from Half-Life remake Black Mesa developer Crowbar Collective</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Crowbar Collective are moving on from Half-Life remake Black Mesa, teaming up with Team17 as publisher for their new tactical FPS Rogue Point. They're not using the Source Engine this time, instead going with Unreal Engine.</p>
<p>This is an online co-op tactical FPS rogue-lite that the developer says is "perfect for both fresh recruits and seasoned veterans, presenting an accessible entry point that reveals layers of depth for those who seek a challenge". Check out the first trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="jFQvOaxl6lk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6cceb203bd4555d59dfdbfde8d0e9680.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/jFQvOaxl6lk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Unlock cosmetics, weapons and campaign modifiers to create loadouts specific to the needs of the mission.</li>
<li>Plan and shoot your way through a dynamic campaign, where no two playthroughs are alike.</li>
<li>Each MERX class presents a unique threat, that challenges you in new and surprising ways.</li>
<li>Evolve operators' skills, interacting with the rogue-lite element of the game.</li>
<li>Gather Intel, plan your assault, and adapt your strategy along the way. Fight your way through missions spread across 4 diverse locations, with each map reshaped by the game's Parametric Design System, offering new strategies and challenges with every play.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not clear if it will have Linux support like Black Mesa, I emailed them to confirm, but they only sent the announcement email about the game shortly before the public announcement. They did only recently do a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/black-mesa-has-a-new-beta-with-way-better-support-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">big upgrade in Beta for Black Mesa on Linux</a>.</p>
<p>From the press email — CEO and Project Lead, Adam Engels, said: “We’re very excited to share that we have partnered with Team 17 for our upcoming co-op shooter, Rogue Point. We cannot wait to go in depth about the game, and everything we learned while creating a new IP (as well as turning Crowbar Collective into a full time development studio). We can’t thank Team 17 enough for their support and expertise. Just like Black Mesa, we want to heavily involve the community in our development and updates. Our community was critical in the Early Access of Black Mesa and having Team 17 as a partner for Rogue Point helps us focus on development and community feedback!”</p>

      <title>With lovely artwork, go prospecting in the wild west one tile at a time in ColdRidge</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ColdRidge is a tile-based exploration strategy game that puts you in the wild west. As a prospector, you'll pick contracts and venture out to do some exploring. <em>Note: key provided by the developer.</em></p>
<p>I've seen quite a few websites previously state before it was released (even when it had a demo) that it was a bit like the early turns of Civilization games. Really, it's <em>nothing</em> like it though. So if you read that elsewhere, get it out of your mind first. Yes you explore tiles, and it's turn-based, but that's about as far as the comparison goes.</p>
<p>Here you control a single person and pick some contracts of things to find that they want, then set off by yourself to go and explore — and hopefully hit the quota of each contract you pick. Things like finding bison, wood, creating a special "portal" on a tile enabling you to warp to it at any point in the current year, or even just going over specific tiles as many times as possible giving you more and more gold each time you do.</p>
<p>There's no combat, no building, just pure tile-clicking in a world that's beautifully styled with some chill-out tunes to keep you focused. You have a limited amount of turns, and so planning your exploration is the key to the game and what makes it a surprising challenge. The challenge is of the casual and relaxing sort though, since it's just click-click-click in the tiles to move around.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14039558001731342807gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>You might think that sounds simple, and well — it is. But that's only a small part of it. There's a fair amount to discover in the game outside of just the basic contracts you take. And to help you on your way, once you finish an expedition, you're then able to stock up on a few goods based on the amount of gold you've personally received for doing a good job. Or not, if you fail a contract, you'll <em>lose</em> some of that precious shiny gold.</p>
<p>Guild Merchants can offer to give you various consumables like a map that reveals a few tiles, give you extra days for your expeditions, reveal tiles containing specific resources and more. You can only stack a few items at a time, ready to then use at any point during your expedition.</p>
<p>As you explore you may come across lost prospectors which have optional extra contracts you can take from them, which you have to be careful on given that you might only have a few turns left, but the extra gold is worth it if you can manage it. You can also come across special merchants, who will have permanent items you can buy and stack in a different set of inventory slots to have things like a special pot that increases in value constantly, additional gold when claiming, consumable price reductions and plenty more.</p>
<p>Once you finish the current expedition, you'll see a nice end of turn sequence where a group will venture out into the tiles you put down flags on to carry off the resources leaving the tiles empty. And from there, you then repeat the picking of contracts (which you can individually re-roll for a price), buying from the merchant and then setting off in a direction of your choosing hoping to fulfil your contracts to keep making a profit.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BhXA1aqDRH8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/aac419c6af02e6a9f0a22e32e704a292.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BhXA1aqDRH8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Each chapter of the game is split across a few years, with you doing multiple expeditions in each year until your time is up to then move onto unlocking the next chapter of the game. When a year is up, if you do manage to hit your quota, then you'll be given a fresh map wiped by the Winter to go exploring again.</p>
<p>Each time you finish a run (succeed or fail) you will begin to unlock more of the game regardless to access more permanent items, more consumable types and other extras depending on how much gold you earned during your run.</p>
<p>A really lovely exploration game that can get quite challenging. It's all about planning ahead and weighing up options to maximise your own profit. Good stuff. Worth picking up.</p>
<p>Developed by Frog Collective, a newer indie studio based in France that was formed by two AMPLITUDE Studios veterans. They previously worked on all of AMPLITUDE Studios' strategy games like the ENDLESS franchise and HUMANKIND.</p>

<p>The Native Linux version works to perfection as far as I can see. Although I expected it would given that it's made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>. Going with Godot, the developer said: "We decided to build on Godot because we’re believers in open source initiatives for gaming, we hope to do our part and contribute in the future.".</p>

      <title>House Hopper is a funny and challenging golf-like 3D platformer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After trying their previous demo, I was totally sold on the golf-like 3D platformer House Hopper, and now it's officially out.</p>
<p>Using a few different household objects, you throw yourself around various rooms in a house to gather up all the keys. The physics of it, and the shape of the items, makes it quite a challenging game and pretty funny to play through too. One that will test you but not overly frustrating, since the physics of it you can usually gauge how you will land…usually. Each room you flip and flop into gives its own set of unique challenges.</p>
<p>Check out the release trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="VsN17L1JVxs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/234d34f1cbeb52cec8f1a8a241746a13.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/VsN17L1JVxs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>House Hopper is a game about falling, falling some more, bouncing off of everything and at times setting yourself on fire. It's Golf but not the Golf you're thinking of. A nice little break from all the survivor-likes that have been released recently, at least not every developer is doing one (even if I love them).</p>
<p>House Hopper has Native Linux support that appeared to work great. Worth a shot!</p>

      <title>NVIDIA detail upcoming Linux driver features for Wayland and explain current support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA have a new official forum post up detailing the the state of Wayland on their Linux drivers, along with plans for upcoming features. Really nice to see NVIDIA being more open on their communication.</p>
<p>Written up by NVIDIA dev Aaron Plattner it firstly goes over some features not supported on Wayland due to a lack of support by Wayland compositors or the Wayland protocol. Here's what simply will not be supported:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Stereo rendering using GLX/EGL/Vulkan</li>
<li>Implicit SLI Mosaic
	<ul>
<li>This feature refers to when an application presents to a virtual display which is tiled across multiple physical displays.</li>
<li>Please see below for how “Explicit SLI” will be supported.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>nvidia-settings will not offer same level of configuration.
	<ul>
<li>There is no cross-compositor method for configuration that would allow nvidia-settings to manage displays on Wayland as it does on X11. nvidia-settings will still provide details about the system and power usage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Other features will be supported through Vulkan Direct to Display like:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Stereo rendering
	<ul>
<li>VK_KHR_multiview provides optimization for drawing multiple viewports.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Vulkan Explicit SLI
	<ul>
<li>Will be supported through VK_KHR_device_group</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Swap Groups
	<ul>
<li>Supported by VK_NV_present_barrier</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Frame Lock and Genlock</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps more exciting then, right now, is what NVIDIA plan to bring to their future driver releases. They've outlined this as well noting some of these are either already in progress, or at least planned to be implemented as the Wayland ecosystem continues to evolve. So you can look forward to:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Multi-monitor VRR on Wayland will be in an upcoming release.</li>
<li>nvidia-drm fbdev=1 parameter set by default
	<ul>
<li>This helps fix invalid output with compositors when nvidia-drm and simpledrm have device nodes driving the same display</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>nvidia-drm modeset=1 parameter set by default</li>
<li>Display multiplexers (muxes) are typically used in laptops with both integrated and discrete GPUs to provide a direct connection between the discrete GPU and the built-in display (internal mux) or an external display (external mux). On X11, the display mux can be automatically switched when a full-screen application is running on the discrete GPU, enabling enhanced display features and improved performance, but no Wayland compositors currently support this functionality.</li>
<li>Advanced display pipeline features including warp and blend, pixel shift, and the COLOR_ENCODING/COLOR_RANGE plane properties.
	<ul>
<li>These features may be exposed through DRM properties to allow compositors to use them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Front-buffer rendering in GLX with Xwayland.</li>
<li>nvidia-drm Presentation Timing information.</li>
<li>VDPAU support on Wayland.</li>
<li>vGPU support on Wayland.</li>
</ul>

      <title>s&amp;box the spiritual successor to Garry&#39;s Mod now has a Steam page up</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Making it easier to follow along and get notified when it's available, s&amp;box the spiritual successor to Garry's Mod now has a Steam page up.</p>
<p>Unlike Garry's Mod, it's not just going to be a platform for people to make games in, Facepunch plan to let you export games with it like a full game engine too. Using Valve's Source 2, Facepunch say they're working with Valve to properly license it so there will be no licensing fees or royalties for developers to pay. For those who stick to using s&amp;box directly, they will also be working on a monetization platform but details on that are still to be worked out.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15188792301731321312gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15188792301731321312gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - s&amp;box editor</em></p>
<p>Currently in an "open developer preview" it's not yet ready for the masses but Facepunch have been steadily expanding it. You can get access on the <a href="https://sbox.game" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully it will all work nicely with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a> to play the games on Linux / Steam Deck. I did try it myself today in a game or two, but performance seemed to be quite <em>atrocious</em> on my pretty powerful desktop so it seems Proton compatibility is not great just yet.</p>

      <title>City-building on a massive creature, The Wandering Village - Research &amp; Economy update is live</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Wandering Village is a city-builder where you're building on the back of a big walking creature, it's wonderful and a big new update is out now with Research &amp; Economy.</p>
<p>From Stray Fawn Studio it's still in Early Access and has been since September 2022 but is already worth playing! It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified too! Compared with other city-builders, it feels really different with you never knowing quite what's coming, and with the events system it keeps you on your toes. It also just looks really darn cool to see the creature moving about with all your people running around on its back.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19853584101731321378gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The major changes / highlights from this update include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The research system has received a major overhaul. Unlocking new technologies now costs resources, and everything has been unified in a single tree. The tree's design has also been overhauled to show all important information at a glance.</li>
<li>Onbu's back is now full of dense forests, large rocks and more. Your villagers will have to plan around these natural obstacles at first, and gradually free up more space to expand their village.</li>
<li>Build Woodcutting Camps and Mining Camps to automatically let your workers harvest nearby resources. And when the resources are exhausted, simply move the camps to a new location!</li>
<li>Nomads will want to join your village regularly as long as you manage to keep your villagers' happiness high enough.</li>
<li>The game now features two completely rebalanced difficulty modes, "Relaxed" and "Survival". In contrast to the old "Novice" mode, "Relaxed" will never get too difficult.</li>
<li>The tutorial has been completely reworked and adapted to all new and updated game mechanics.</li>
<li>Two new building materials, clay and brick, have been added to add more depth to building construction.</li>
<li>Five new Onbu food spots have been added! Each one comes with its unique up- and downsides.</li>
<li>Scavenging has received an overhaul. You can see the expected resources beforehand to make an informed decision, but be wary - something unexpected may always happen!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a lot more to it than that in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1121640/view/4478359995220492849" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>
<p>Really looking forward to seeing the finished product on this one.</p>

      <title>Luanti (formerly Minetest) v5.10.0 out now bringing UI updates, fancier shaders, renaming work</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/minetest-breaks-the-chains-of-being-a-minecraft-clone-with-a-new-name-luanti/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Minetest now called Luanti</a>, a fresh release is out bringing work towards getting things renamed along with some new features and fixes. Luanti itself is <em>not</em> a game, it's a voxel game engine, so instead you add games and mods into it like <a href="https://content.luanti.org/packages/Wuzzy/mineclone2/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">VoxeLibre</a>.</p>
<p>As of version 5.10.0 that's out now there's some compatibility changes with OpenGL ES 1.0 no longer supported, you need at least OpenGL ES 2.0, and basic shaders are starting to become a requirement now too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12861867921731319667gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - VoxeLibre</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some of the main noticeable changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The main menu server filter / search box now filters more intuitively.</li>
<li>Touch controls are now enabled/disabled based on the used input device.</li>
<li>Main menu: redesigned ContentDB tab.</li>
<li>More fancy shaders with a server-controlled bloom shader API.</li>
<li>Fixes to minimap scaling.</li>
<li>For servers there's more fine-grained control over anticheat, plus improved collision detection for lag.</li>
<li>Lots of scripting API and modding improvements for creators.</li>
<li>Various networking improvements with crash fixes.</li>

      <title>GE-Proton 9-20 includes a fix for Diablo IV, plus Proton-Sarek 9-20 for older GPUs released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two new updates for community-build versions of Proton are out now. As is tradition for GE-Proton, a hotfix arrived to fix problems and a new version of Proton-Sarek (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/check-out-proton-sarek-if-you-have-an-older-gpu-for-windows-games-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">that I recently wrote about</a>) for older GPUs is also out.</p>
<p><em>Confused on Proton? See <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my beginner's guide</a>.</em></p>
<p>GE-Proton 9-20 quickly followed on from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/ge-proton-9-19-brings-fixes-for-horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-monster-hunter-wilds-and-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the recent GE-Proton 9-19</a> release that includes these changes:</p>

<p>Additionally there's Proton-Sarek 9-20, for older GPUs which includes the GE-Proton hotfix above, plus Proton-Sarek 9-19 also includes these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Global Prefix Update:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Restored Global Prefix</strong> to Valve’s/GE default configuration.</li>

      <title>Sony say their PSN account requirement on PC is so you can enjoy their games &#39;safely&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sony forcing you to have a PlayStation Network account for all their recent PC releases hasn't been well liked, and they of course have no plans to back down on it.</p>
<p>During the latest Sony Group Corporation <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/fast/20241108/f5KHiS63/202503_2q_02_en/index.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">investors call</a> in their Q&amp;A session at about 45:40, a question came up about what lessons they will take away from Concord (which Sony shut down and then closed the game studio).</p>
<p>Hiroki Totoki (President, COO and CFO) replied with an English translation from a live interpreter, so the translation is a bit loose and <em>rough</em>, but this is what was said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Regarding that matter we have learned a lot. The way to face the issues regarding PC for instance, the PlayStation accounts that we have offered, by offering them for instance, sometimes that tends to invite push-back. But for the live service games, so in order to maintain order of the gaming, so that anybody can enjoy the game safely, we need to create environment conducive to that, of course enjoying the game freely. </p>
<p>Having some restrictions, may not call it rule, but to ask the users and gamers to follow the manner, and those balances are very important and we have to continue to seek the best way to achieve this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly the PSN requirement isn't going anywhere, and will be in all their future games, even though it's unpopular and locks out a whole lot of regions from buying their games. Sony want that extra control over their games, especially when they're now releasing outside of their own PlayStation console.</p>
<p>In <em>some</em> ways, it makes sense for their online live-service games, and you do have to remember the context of the question was for Concord that was <em>supposed</em> to be live-service. </p>
<p>However, it really makes very little sense for their single-player games where it's also now forced like Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, Until Dawn, God of War Ragnarök and more to come. Forcing online accounts for single-player games is never going to go down well but it's here to stay for Sony's PC releases.</p>

      <title>Steam Beta gets fixes for WiFi on Steam Deck, plus AMD GPU startup crash on Desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Following on from the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/steam-game-recording-has-officially-launched/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">big release of Steam Game Recording</a> in the stable Steam Client, there's a new smaller Beta available for Steam Deck and Desktop.</p>

<p>And the rest of the changes from the Desktop changelog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a potential startup crash on systems with an AMD GPU.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Game Recording</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue with the layout of the recording player in Big Picture.</li>
<li>Updated the Game Properties Game Recording tab to more accurately reflect the current state of the Game Recording feature.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a case where a controller could not show up in the UI the very first time it was connected for an account.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steam VR</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue with certain keys on the keyboard causing unexpected behavior.</li>
<li>Restores single-click Exit VR functionality</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Linux VR interface would show the incorrect UI</li>
</ul>

      <title>AYANEO 3 now officially announced with AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 and HDR OLED</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The AYANEO 3 has now had more of a proper announcement with more details and a clear picture of what it actually looks like.</p>
<p>Announced today it will come in two models with either the AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 or the AMD Ryzen 7 8840U. You also get two different screen options between a 7" high-refresh LCD horizontal display and a 7" high-refresh high-brightness HDR OLED. AYANEO didn't say, but I <em>presume</em> the older AMD Ryzen chip will be paired up with the plain LCD screen to make their manufacturing simpler and cheaper.</p>
<p>AYANEO also said it will have new rear buttons and trigger lock keys, an "impressive leap in audio quality" along with "several proprietary key components" with more info to be revealed later.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12367834241731089312gol1.jpeg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - AYANEO 3, credit: AYANEO.</em></p>
<p>And of course, there's some fancy lighting around the thumbsticks too because everything <em>gamer</em> related has to has some form of RGB lighting.</p>
<p>They also put up a video for the announcement:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="GWObbquf1l4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/242ab6a7e87a1b7d87197c0fa2ff7c01.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/GWObbquf1l4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They have not yet revealed a price. So while yes, it's an announcement, it's still pretty lacking in many details.</p>
<p>As a big fan of gaming handhelds as a regular Steam Deck gamer, I'm keen to see this hardware category continue to evolve, especially with a bit more power to run more of the latest games at acceptable performance.</p>
<p>For this though, since it will ship with Windows, we'll be waiting on the likes of Bazzite and ChimeraOS to get support for it hooked up for running Linux on it. Hopefully they won't have too much trouble with whatever these "proprietary key components" turn out to be, which does cause some concern.</p>
<p>So far then, it seems very much like their usual refresh of their handhelds, certainly <em>nothing</em> they've said comes even close to the "revolution" they <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/ayaneo-tease-the-ayaneo-3-as-a-revolution-and-a-completely-new-concept/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">initially announced it as</a>.</p>
<p>More info when I have it.</p>

      <title>Steam gets new tools for game devs to offer players version switching in-game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve announced something that I'm sure a lot of game developers and players will appreciate: new APIs to allow developers to have version switching directly in their games!</p>
<p>Steam has long a way for players to <em>manually</em> opt into a Beta individually per-game, if one is available. This can be used for testing new features or for accessing previous versions. However the current system is somewhat obscure, and relies on you looking around various Steam news posts or forum posts for each game to know if there's a new feature Beta available, or if they provide an older version of the game you can switch over to via the Beta system.</p>
<p>Valve's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4547039255696769967" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> makes it clear that the idea of this new set of APIs is to allow game developers to present this to gamers <em>directly</em> in-game. Valve give some examples on why developers may want to use this like preserving game saves when making major changes to your game, something Paradox Interactive do with their various strategy games. Like this for Stellaris:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4109455851731088033gol1.png"/></p>
<p>So with the new system, developers could just put this in-game directly.</p>
<p>As part of this, a recent Steam client update also shows you on the game page in your Library when you have a Beta picked:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1412717731731088693gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Really seems like a nice addition that I'm surprised hasn't been a thing until now. Hopefully more developers will think about keeping older versions available now, especially with Valve suggesting it as a good idea in some cases.</p>

      <title>Strategy game ZEPHON from the devs of Warhammer 40,000: Gladius is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Proxy Studios who made Warhammer 40,000: Gladius have just released their brand new 4x strategy game ZEPHON. It comes with Native Linux support. It's <em>similar</em> to Gladius in a lot of ways, but set in their own universe that they can continue to expand on.</p>
<p>"Control the survivors of humanity in a near-future apocalypse of alien origin. Pick a path between the indifferent abominations of the Voice and the uncaring automata of ZEPHON, with city management, turn-based tactical combat, unholy research, diplomatic maneuvering, and branching narrative quests. Gather your allies and pick your actions wisely.</p>
<p>On the planet Earth, that was once a cradle of life, the extinction of humanity is at hand."</p>
<p>Release trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zZXl5I73vys"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7c875cc338647d066581db592ab19351.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zZXl5I73vys" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking over email the developer previously said to me: "Our previous game, Gladius, has been played by over 1.5 million players. In Zephon we did some fun stuff to tackle the "endgame problem" in 4X games, leaned heavily into Souls-like world-building and added narrative design elements to reward players who play multiple sessions (inspired by Hades and co.)."</p>
<p>Looks like a good one! The developer did send me a pre-release key but I haven't had time to write up any extended thoughts on it just yet, but from what I played it was really interesting and worked well on a technical level.</p>
