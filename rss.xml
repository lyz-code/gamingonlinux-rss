      <title>Embracer Group put out their plans for AI in game development </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After killing off and selling off various studios and causing lots of job losses, Embracer Group have put out their latest annual report and they have big plans for AI.</p>
<p>Embracer Group control the likes of THQ Nordic, PLAION, Coffee Stain, Amplifier Game Invest, DECA Games, Easybrain, Asmodee Group, Dark Horse Media, Freemode and Crystal Dynamics – Eidos. They have around 106 game development studios under their belt.</p>
<p>It was only a matter of time of course until they started talking up AI, as with other major game developers and publishers, and basically every big company that exists — they're all trying to shove AI into something so they can say "hey look we have AI too!".</p>
<p>Embracer think AI and large language models (LLMs) will <em>empower</em> their developer teams and say they don't want AI to replace people. From the <a href="https://embracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Embracer-Group-publishes-Annual-Report-20232024-240620.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">annual report</a> in their Risk and Mitigation overview it states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AI has the capability to massively enhance game development by increasing resource efficiency, adding intelligent behaviors, personalization, and optimization to gameplay experiences. By leveraging AI, we create more engaging and immersive experiences that provide each player with a unique, dynamic, and personalized experience. We also see great opportunities for AI in game development speed, logistics and planning. Embracer Group also understands the potential risks associated with the use of AI. Our aim is to empower our employees with AI applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what they've done is create a "Group AI Policy" that includes various guiding principles, risk assessment, and a risk framework that they're implementing across their companies with the idea being "human empowerment". Here's what Tomas Hedman, Head of Privacy &amp; AI Governance at Embracer Group, had to say about it:</p>
<p>"Certainly, one of the major risks for a company is not to use AI, as this would mean a competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis other industry players. Most companies will move forward on AI integration in different ways. For us, it is the way that we do this that is the most critical element.</p>
<p>We do not want to replace people with AI, we want to empower them. This is the core of our human-centric approach to leveraging the potential with AI.</p>
<p>It’s not just that AI enables our developers to do even more, and to become more efficient on certain tasks, it will also open up coding to a broader group of developers. Entry into the industry might be easier for individuals with disabilities who, for instance, cannot use a keyboard as easily as others.</p>
<p>AI is trained on historical data, which tilts in a certain direction. As a result, you can end up with imbalanced automated decision-making. Let’s say you’re building a village. If you use AI for this, depending on how it’s trained and the decisions it takes, you may end up with a village with a demography that displays some sort of imbalance.</p>
<p>As AI models become more powerful, we can leverage their capacity also in the creative process, for example, by identifying inconsistencies in scripts and storytelling. There will be tremendous benefits for our creative teams regarding scriptwriting, image creation, idea generation, quality control, and more. And, as models become more human-like, the interaction between players and AI-supported functions will be much more dynamic. If in a game scenario you bargain, AI can remember this the next time. That makes the whole gaming experience much more interesting and lifelike."</p>
<hr/>
<p>It's worth noting that in the last GDC Survey, it showed that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/31-of-devs-already-using-ai-pc-platform-is-healthy-overall/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">31% of devs were already using AI</a>.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this?</p>

      <title>X4: Foundations Update 7.00 and X4: Timelines DLC are out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>X4: Foundations 7.00 Update and X4: Timelines from Egosoft bring some huge changes to the huge space sim and there's never been a better time to try it out.</p>
<p>The new expansion for starters, X4: Timelines, is something quite different. Designed for new players and veterns alike, Egosoft say it uses "novel ways to introduce new players to X4's core gameplay mechanics" and it introduces a whole new storyline that takes place outside the main X4 sandbox so its properly standalone (but still a DLC) that will give you "colossal challenges and unexpected excursions into the depths of the X series lore and history" and it's an "adventure that transcends time and space"</p>
<p>Check out the DLC trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6WV1YJsfSss"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b09f2d0f7a604d29eb8877342ab30ce6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6WV1YJsfSss" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On top of that of course is the next major free upgrade, X4: Foundations 7.00. This brings in additional advice for new players, expanded tutorials, improved AI, a FOV slider, TAA support, improved explosions, improved shadows, additional sectors and landmarks, new accessibility options, a customizable radial menu for quick access to actions, a new late-game crisis for advanced players and so much more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="9dumQL9dK-c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/62e94f12a7c3150d1692a98c4e56de8d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/9dumQL9dK-c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Overall this all sounds pretty incredible. </p>
<p>Available with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/392160/X4_Foundations/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Native Linux support on Steam</a>. It's also rated Steam Deck Playable.</p>

      <title>Cosmic horror post-apocalyptic RPG Death Trash has a teaser for a new update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Death Trash features a world where cosmic horrors long for humanity but meet punks with shotguns. Influenced by post-apocalyptic, horror, and cyberpunk classics. Death Trash is certainly promising, and it's finally gearing up for a content update.</p>
<p>There's no date for it The Perished City update yet but developer Crafting Legends mentioned there will be a Beta in the coming months, after that we will see another content update with Northern Wasteland planned for the end of 2024.</p>
<p>Check out the teaser:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FvMoiEELr0c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8298fa102a8f43f6619081c696ebb400.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FvMoiEELr0c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it: "Death Trash is an open-world, singleplayer role-playing game with handcrafted levels, a strong story campaign and optional local co-op gameplay.</p>
<p>The game features real-time gameplay with ranged and melee combat, stealth, multiple choice dialogue, an inventory of items and worms, a crafting system, and skills like pickpocketing and puking."</p>
<p>This update has been a long time coming, with no released update to the game since December last year. Slow going, but it should be worth it. Based on what I've already played, the style and atmosphere is awesome.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/death_trash?as=1636858786" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://craftinglegends.itch.io/deathtrash" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/941460/Death_Trash/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Bippinbits have announced PVKK: Planetenverteidigungskanonenkommandant (yes really) as their next game following Dome Keeper. It looks suspiciously like Dome Keeper is 3D, but it's a lot more than that.</p>
<p>More about it: "In PVKK, you step into the role of a cannon pilot for an autocratic regime, confined to a defense bunker. Your mission: manually control a massive planetary defense cannon to fend off an ongoing interplanetary invasion. Master the various systems to protect your home world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Interact with a retro-tech cockpit filled with satisfying buttons, levers, dials, and switches. Manage energy generators, scan the skies for enemy vessels, analyze threats, calculate fire trajectories, and execute precise firing procedures. With limited resources and a strict regime, strategic thinking is key to your success."</p>

      <title>ELDEN RING Shadow of the Erdtree DLC update causing problems on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ELDEN RING Shadow of the Erdtree releases soon, and there's a patch out but sadly this has been causing issues for players on Steam Deck and desktop Linux.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-version-112" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Patch 1.12</a> has gone live, and unfortunately it seems to cause two major problems. The first, is that you can no longer do online play as their Easy Anti-Cheat for Linux platforms seems a bit broken. It will just refuse to let you play online with an error message.</p>
<p>On top of that on Steam Deck, if you leave it idle for more than 5 minutes, it seems to just break the game and you can no longer do anything, so you would need to quit it and reload. <em>That's…annoying.</em></p>
<p>The official ELDEN RING account on X (Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1803730488751743427" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: a Steam Deck related issue has been identified and a hotfix is being worked on. Leaving your Steam Deck inactive for more than 5 minutes may stop the game from accepting inputs. We apologize for inconvenience. The date and time of the hotfix will be announced separately.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully they won't keep players waiting long. And so far, they haven't acknowledged the anti-cheat issue. Seems like not enough (or any?) testing was done here. Quite problematic for a Steam Deck "Verified" title.</p>

<p>I will aim update the article if they fix it any time soon. If it's a couple of days or longer though, look out for a future article noting the fix is live.</p>

      <title>DRM lease protocol support finally merged for GNOME Wayland - great for VR fans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>VR fans rejoice! The GNOME project has finally pulled in DRM lease protocol support today, something required for getting VR under GNOME on Wayland working well.</p>
<p>The issue was posted to the GNOME GitLab <em><a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/-/issues/1743" rel="noopener" target="_blank">over 3 years ago</a></em>, so this really has been a long time coming.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/-/merge_requests/3746" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Merge Request</a> to actually add in support for it was created by developer José Expósito on May 10th, based on work done by developers Jonas Ådahl and Sebastian Wick. So now the issue noted above created over 3 years ago has been <em>closed</em> with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/uploads/articles/tagline_images/90803740id24762gol.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Valve Index</em></p>
<p>So with this, you should hopefully be good to go using services like SteamVR on Linux (and others) under GNOME Wayland, once the next release of GNOME and Mutter are out with this new code pulled in.</p>
<p>The next release, GNOME 47, is due on September 14th. Followed up by GNOME 47.1 due on October 12th.</p>
<p>Really great to see!</p>

      <title>Selaco now has a Bullet Time mod inspired by Max Payne and it&#39;s amazing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I was already a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/selaco-is-now-in-early-access-one-of-the-best-shooters-ive-played-in-forever/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ridiculously big fan of Selaco</a>, with it being one of the best retro-styled shooters (and just...shooters in general) I've played in forever and now the Bullet Time X mod has just made it even more amazing.</p>
<p>Available via the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3268589630" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Workshop</a> making it a one-click addition to the game, thanks to Selaco having great modding support. It adds in a slow-motion system to the game you can activate at the touch of a button. Inspired by the Max Payne game not only is the world slowed down but everything including weapons, movement, sounds, everything.</p>
<p>The mod gives you a new adrenaline meter that slowly fills up by itself, and you can bump it up by taking down enemies. There's two modes where you can tap B to slow things down, or press V to activate "Shootdodge" to jump and make it go <em>even slower</em>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kuddK5vdyt8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/de020108dd08ba4c940c096fba550f8c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kuddK5vdyt8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You also get a mod menu, so you can adjust some settings, like giving yourself infinite bullet time.</p>
<p>This is going to be so much fun to use and it works with existing save games, no need to start over with it. I can't wait to see what other crazy mods people make for Selaco. You might also want the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3258941092" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Infinite Flashlight</a> mod too perhaps.</p>
<p>Selaco has Native Linux support and is playable on Steam Deck. It's currently in Early Access.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">buy Selaco on Steam</a> priced at $24.99 / €24.50 / £20.99.</p>

      <title>Guide a caravan of adventurers through hostile environments in Sandwalkers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A bit of a blending of Curious Expedition and Vagrus - The Riven Realms we have here with Sandwalkers, a roguelike turn-based exploration game where you guide a caravan across hostile environments. From Goblinz Studio the same group that made Legend of Keepers.</p>
<p>Story: "Every decade, the Mka tribe sends caravans of adventurers into the Phithi, the meteorological chaos that keeps the Uwando tribes isolated from each other and makes life outside the refuges almost impossible.</p>
<p>Their mission: to establish diplomatic and trade relations, to explore and reclaim the lands left to the mercy of monsters and pirates, and, most importantly, to plant a new tree city that can become a refuge for the Mka and their allies. Regardless of the success or failure of their mission, the caravans must send the memories they have gained back to the capital, using the crystospheres carried by traveling beetles."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lVtfoWXtkmk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c792e3dad8cf3c476ee37b18b96590a4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lVtfoWXtkmk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guide a caravan of adventurers through varied landscapes.</li>
<li>Fight hordes of pirates, wizards and monsters, and survive acid rain, storms and heat waves.</li>
<li>Rescue refugees, seek allies to support you and stir up the past in search of the causes of Phithi.</li>
<li>Keep <em>hope</em>: in this hostile desert, the caravaneers' faith in their mission is all that protects them from certain death.</li>
<li>Progress by passing on your knowledge to a new caravan.</li>
<li>Make choices that will affect your future expeditions.</li>
<li>Each character has different powers. It's up to you to explore lost ruins as an archaeologist or to track down massive creatures as a hunter.</li>
<li>Don't underestimate the weather! It conditions the movements of caravanners and the outcome of confrontations.</li>
<li>Repair the broken climate, and put an end to centuries of wandering.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sandwalkers has Native Linux support and it's currently in Early Access.</p>

      <title>Star Fox like shooter Whisker Squadron: Survivor just added a campaign mode to blast through</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Taking Star Fox and putting the survivor-like spin on it with lots of upgrades and repeat runs, Whisker Squadron: Survivor has levelled up with a new campaign mode that's really worth a go.</p>
<p>With the new campaign mode, they said they've redesigned the overall experience of the game, giving you a choice of randomly generated paths. Each campaign will include a variety of environments, and increasingly difficult combat encounters culminating in a boss fight at the end of each of the 3 acts.</p>
<p>This includes major additions like 2 shops with new characters, the start of a deeper narrative, various new enemies to face, a new wave-based spawning system for enemies, 3 save slots now, a new intro cut-scene and lots of other <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2140100/view/6085006571972613994" rel="noopener" target="_blank">improvements</a>.</p>

      <title>Death Road to Canada gets a major 2024 upgrade with new events, characters, perks and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Death Road to Canada is a name I haven't heard for quite a while. A co-op action post-zombie apocalypse road trip game and it just had a big update for 2024.</p>
<p>Built for you to replay it as many times as you like everything is randomized including locations, events, survivor appearances and personalities as you hit the road and attempt to survive.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11584291871718881739gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The new OMENTUM update that launched today has added in plenty for you to jump back in including 4 new special rare characters to find, 11 new events to play through, various new event images, you can now use a fire extinguisher as a weapon (and support for putting out more fires), AI improvements so they can actually pick up and throw zombies now, new character perks and traits added and plenty of bug fixes.</p>
<p>Sounds like an excellent time to try it out again.</p>
<p>Death Road to Canada has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>You can buy it from:</p>

      <title>ElectricMaple joins WiVRn and ALVR in giving options to stream VR to a headset</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Helping you cut down on all those wires, and potentially making way for cheaper low-end VR headsets for streaming, ElectricMaple was announced by Collabora and PlutoVR joining the likes of WiVRn and ALVR.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/alvr-org/ALVR" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ALVR</a> is probably one of the best known VR streaming options, allowing you to stream VR games from your PC to your headset via Wi-Fi that works with SteamVR or Oculus Software (using Revive), and it supports various headsets although their Linux support is still rough.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Meumeu/WiVRn" rel="noopener" target="_blank">WiVRn</a> is another, that the developer of posted in <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our Discord</a> recently, which implements OpenXR, built on top of Monado that the developer says "the client application works on most standalone headsets". This project is a bit more fresh and recent, with the developer noting they "think it is now mature enough for people to use".</p>
<p>And now another has arrived with <a href="https://github.com/PlutoVR/electric-maple" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ElectricMaple</a> that Collabora posted about on <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/electricmaple-remote-rendering-debuts-at-awe-2024.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">their blog</a> today. Working in collaboration with PlutoVR, they note it's "designed to enhance standalone XR experiences through remote-rendering" and that it uses "the power of Monado OpenXR and GStreamer, ElectricMaple enables high-quality XR streaming from graphics-capable servers to lightweight standalone headsets".</p>
<p>ElectricMaple seems like it's geared more towards hardware vendors, whereas ALVR and WiVRn are more for users to try on existing headsets. But it will still be usable on desktop Linux, and eventually Windows too. Collabora are showing it off at the <a href="https://awexr.com/usa-2024" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Augmented World Expo (AWE)</a>.</p>
<p>There's also <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0E2C-406B-9135-38A4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Link for Meta Quest</a>, allowing you to stream games directly from Steam to a Meta Quest headset. Although, Valve are yet to hook up Linux support for that, perhaps some of these projects may help them.</p>

      <title>Heroes Of Loot: Gauntlet Of Power is a fresh take on dungeon crawling with a very unique weapon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you absolutely love action-heavy dungeon crawlers like The Binding of Isaac, and the chaos from Vampire Survivors you're going to <em>need</em> to take a look at Heroes Of Loot: Gauntlet Of Power from Orangepixel. </p>
<p>There's a very familiar feeling with Gauntlet Of Power, giving you a randomly generated dungeon to run through a room at a time with your little character and take down all the enemies in each room. If you've ever played a real-time dungeon crawler (especially Isaac), you'll be instantly familiar with one major difference and it's thoroughly unique which is — the Gauntlet.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16451212251718812988gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16451212251718812988gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Your Gauntlet is your weapon. Well, actually, it's many different weapons in one. It has eight slots, one for each direction you can fire in. When you pick your starting character, you get an initial weapon on one direction slot. As you take down enemies and level up, you get to pick a new weapon to stick into one of the directional slots to then fire that weapon automatically in that direction. You can also pick the same weapon, to place onto an existing one in a slot to power it up a level too.</p>
<p>That alone would be pretty darn interesting and it's a really fun spin on the genre, giving you an endless amount of replay value, allowing you to make some really interesting characters during your run. There's more to it though. Plenty more.</p>
<p>Not only do you pick a random weapon to add in a direction of your choosing, there's also various special weapon combinations to discover in the Gauntlet slots. Two weapons together might create a union with a new weapon. There's also a whole bunch of items to find, to further boost and change your character during your run.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12364519461718813308gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12364519461718813308gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>On top of that there's boss battles, a shop to spend your coins in, new characters to unlock and more.</p>
<p>There's definitely some Vampire Survivor style chaos going on as you're running around in here. At times, it can be a little difficult to tell what's going on, as you're firing off eight different weapons with pixel-art enemies running around at the same time, some coming straight for you and some keeping distance firing at you. It definitely could do with highlighting enemy projectiles better but that's about my only issue with it.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="L3Ga3SNmTY8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c2111dfc602f55d0711e70b06d2f48f8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/L3Ga3SNmTY8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Randomly generated dungeons, items enemies and bosses, you never play the same game twice.</li>
<li>5 base weapons and 9 special combo's and union weapons - all upgradable in strength.</li>
<li>Unique items that enhance your powers against the horde of enemies.</li>
<li>Over 14 end bosses.</li>
<li>6 dungeons covering 16 levels and a final boss-of-all-bosses battle.</li>
<li>2 playable and 2 unlockable classes.</li>
<li>Unlockable Rune-power options to support you in completing the game.</li>
<li>Perma unlockable Forged cards.</li>
<li>Secret rooms, Quests, Treasure rooms, and Shops.</li>
</ul>
<p>Works great on desktop Linux (Kubuntu 24.04) and perfect on Steam Deck too. Might actually be my favourite game so far from Orangepixel.</p>
<p>Heroes Of Loot: Gauntlet Of Power is available with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2374320/Heroes_Of__Loot_Gauntlet_Of_Power/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Native Linux support on Steam</a>.</p>

<p>The story: "One day a giant sinkhole has appeared slowly devouring the world. Many refer to it as the Abyss. In it's wake, insurmountable amounts of unknown creatures were released and have wreck havoc upon the land. The world became engulfed with death, and the creatures reigned supreme.</p>
<p>This is when Goddess of Creation called upon the remaining brave adventurers of the realm to take arms, and fight against the denizens of the Abyss. Tasked with destroying the Primal Entity, will they be able to save the world?"</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6400895901718802697gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6400895901718802697gol1.jpg"/></a></p>

      <title>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora now on Steam, broken for Steam Deck and Desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora has now released on Steam, and at least when it comes to AMD GPUs, it seems to be currently a no-go and just doesn't run with Proton on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux.</p>
<p>Testing on my Kubuntu 24.04 desktop across Proton 9 and Proton Experimental with an Radeon RX 6800 XT on Mesa 24.1.1 and Mesa 24.0.6 nothing makes it work. It will attempt to load, and then nothing happens and Steam reports it has just stopped running. Even trying the community-made GE-Proton 9-7, same thing again. There's a bug report on <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/7843" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a> with others reporting the same.</p>
<p><em>It might be possible with an NVIDIA GPU, but I haven't tested.</em></p>
<p>As for Steam Deck, it just doesn't work there either from the Steam release. Testing again Proton 9 and Proton Experimental, it won't launch. Checked across SteamOS 3.5 Stable and the current SteamOS 3.6 Preview with the same issue. Even <em>if</em> it did run, the performance in the open world is simply <em>unplayable</em> constantly below 30FPS and a mess on Deck as shown in various <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7H2ZqTCZdI" rel="noopener" target="_blank">videos</a> of people who got the Epic or Ubisoft version of it to boot.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/942235911718799856gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Hopefully at least for desktop Linux, a future Proton update might make it playable.</p>

      <title>KittyToy is a cute little casual digital-pet game about stray cats</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Inspired by animated cursor-chasing cat software like Neko and the mobile app Neko Atsume, KittyToy is a simple little casual chill-out game about stray cats. Made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, it's free to grab (you can donate too) from the itch.io page.</p>
<p>Imagine something a bit like a Tamagotchi, a digital pet app, but here you're trying to keep the strays happy so you earn lots of coins to keep adding more to your little area. The happier they are when they leave, the more coins you get, but you can also pop a collar on them to adopt them and then they won't leave.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2200641111718800479gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2200641111718800479gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>The developer just put up version 0.9 adding in a whole bunch of new items and features like wall decorations, new floor lamps, a message log, a "cat-alog" for looking back on the past, new heart effects for when the cats are donig something they like and more in preparation for future updates.</p>
<p><em>Just a nice simple chill game tip for you.</em></p>

      <title>Swap flesh with fallen enemies in the weird upcoming co-op action game SWAP/MEAT</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SWAP/MEAT has a really fun idea where you (and hopefully some friends) become Meat Scientists. You go planet-hopping to steal the meat of strange creatures and turn their flesh into your own body parts.</p>
<p>This seems like a really fun idea for a co-op game. A third-person shooter with roguelite progression systems, where you raid the galaxy's weirdest worlds taking down angry aliens and then use their body parts to augment yourself, changing your character as you go. It's all about your career here with each planetary run moving you closer to <em>Upper Management</em>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FcNCnMq28rU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c4bbe7c22b30474213d26cb0abf5736c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FcNCnMq28rU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In SWAP/MEAT, you swap meat! Loot defeated enemies for fresh meat to boost your stats and fine-tune your hero’s arsenal of abilities as you face down the next wave of weirdos.</li>
<li>This shooter is roguelite as heck! SWAP/MEAT is a third-person shooter with roguelite progression, wild abilities and satisfying gunplay. Choose your next planet from the galactic map, drop in, and engage in combat with the unfriendly locals. Complete your missions and extract the planet’s meat core before your goose is cooked.</li>
<li>There's no I in Meat! Play solo if you’re in the mood for a single serving, or squad up with your coworkers, err, friends — SWAP/MEAT’s tuned for co-op shootin’ and lootin’! With shared upgrades, strategic teamplay, and brutal boss fights, the chain’s only as strong as its weakest (sausage) link.</li>
<li>I’m Doing My Part! You’re a “Meat Scientist” for Rangus Meats — a multigalactic corporation dedicated to creating a sustainable food source to feed the universe (also, operating profitable theme parks). Your job: scour the universe’s frontier for fresh meat to add to Rangus' portfolio of meat-based products. It’s dangerous, and the pay is mid, but at least you get to do it with your friends.</li>
<li>Advance Your Corporate Career! SWAP/MEAT has the deep and rewarding progression you’d expect from a great roguelite. Every time you make it back to the mothership with your meat parts intact, you can upgrade your weapons, your abilities, and even yourself. Move yourself ever closer to Rangus Meats Upper Management — and ridin' first class on the gravy train.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer plans to support Linux, although this will be via Proton (not a Native Linux build). I've been told it already runs great with Proton.</p>
<p>Sounds like it will be a good laugh to play with friends. The developer is currently taking on <a href="https://meatlab.playswapmeat.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sign-ups for playtesting</a>.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2790700/SWAPMEAT/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>War Thunder brings another major update with Seek &amp; Destroy</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gaijin Entertainment have released the Seek &amp; Destroy update for War Thunder which as usual sprinkles in a bunch of new content, along with some general tweaks across the board.</p>
<p>Some of the new content includes separate flares &amp; chaff, new crew models, the introduction of brand-new FOX-3 missiles for each nation and a whole lot of new vehicles. There's new ground vehicles for: USA, China, USSR, Great Britain, Italy, France, Sweden, Israel and new aircraft for: USA, Germany, USSR, Great Britain, Japan, China, Italy, France, Sweden and Israel. They've also remade various helicopter cockpits, there's a bunch of new naval units too, a new air battle map, a new naval battle map, an option for smaller air realistic battle team sizes, Wheels on ground vehicles are now physical and will fall off a vehicle when shot at and so much more.</p>
<p>There's a couple of nice UI improvements too like finally getting the ability to drag and drop vehicles from the research tree, and the ability to change the order of crew slots. You can also now remove a vehicle by simply dragging it over a remove box, plus some appearance changes to the slotbar for crews and vehicles to make them "more visually convenient and easy to use". You can even now collapse ranks in the research tree, hiding the ones you've already completely done to focus on the later vehicles. There's lots of little additions like that, finally making the UI feel better.</p>

      <title>Drill Keeper seems to have it all with deckbuilding, tower defense and roguelite survival</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hooded Horse sure do pick some gems to publish with the latest announcement being Drill Keeper from ShoulderByte GmbH that looks like an intoxicating mix of genres.</p>
<p>Combining together roguelite mechanics for repeatable runs, deckbuilding, tower defense and RTS gameplay this has a bit of something for everyone. Honestly, seems like they knew exactly what I wanted in a game, this looks properly chaotic and fun.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0kL1lFkWvkY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3f9916cd00a4891fb61652f38f6a9b3a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0kL1lFkWvkY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore fully destructible worlds, gather resources, play cards, and manipulate the terrain to build smart defenses.</li>
<li>Roguelike mechanics where resources persist between runs, which players can use to unlock new cards and abilities for the drill.</li>
<li>Customize the starting deck to match a chosen strategy before a run. Find more cards during a run and decide which ones to add to the deck.</li>
<li>Procedurally generated worlds with unique challenges. </li>
<li>Chaos mode as another fun way to play!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>First announced last year and in development since 2021, Drill Keeper is the brainchild of solo developer Dennis Strümpel. “Teaming up with Hooded Horse marks an exciting chapter for my little studio,” says Strümpel. “Their commitment to innovation and quality perfectly aligns with my creative vision, and together, we will drill down to the core of what makes a great strategy game.” </p>
<p>“I love Dungeon Keeper, Slay the Spire, and Dwarves (in any game, movie, or form),” says Hooded Horse CEO Tim Bender. “ The existence of this game will significantly hurt my productivity here at Hooded Horse, so might as well make it part of the portfolio so I have some loose business justification for the hours I'm going to spend.”</p>

      <title>RISC-V Framework Laptop mainboard teased, plus open source releases of laptop shells</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some exciting news for hardware enthusiasts, as Framework just announced today that DeepComputing has made the first partner-developed mainboard with RISC-V.</p>
<p>This RISC-V StarFive JH7110 SoC mainboard will be compatible with the Framework Laptop 13 model, truly showing the power of what modular computing can be for laptops. Here's a shot of it below:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6680752681718721310gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6680752681718721310gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>DeepComputing will be showing it off during the RISC-V Summit Europe 2024 between June 24th - 28th in Germany. They noted it's still in early development though, but it's designed to just be an easy quick swap like other modules for the Framework Laptop 13.</p>
<p>From the DeepComputing <a href="https://deepcomputing.io/a-risc-v-world-first-independently-developed-risc-v-mainboard-for-a-framework-laptop-from-deepcomputing/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release</a>:</p>
<p>“This is just the beginning. This modular RISC-V mainboard showcases our commitment to pioneering open-source hardware solutions that will empower developers and enthusiasts alike.” says Yuning Liang, CEO of DeepComputing.</p>
<p>“There is fantastic philosophical alignment between the Framework and RISC-V communities with a focus on developer and end-user empowerment. We designed the Framework Laptop from the start to enable this kind of architectural flexibility, and we’re excited to see what DeepComputing is creating with the new RISC-V Mainboard.” says Nirav Patel, CEO of Framework.</p>
<p>You can see more in the Framework <a href="https://frame.work/gb/en/blog/introducing-a-new-risc-v-mainboard-from-deepcomputing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a> too which goes over some more details. Linux and open source enthusiasts should keep a close eye on RISC-V with it being an entirely open architecture, so there's no fees involved like with ARM and no gatekeeping like x86-64.</p>
<p>Framework also recently put up open source shell CAD designs for both the <a href="https://github.com/FrameworkComputer/Framework-Laptop-13" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Framework Laptop 13</a> and <a href="https://github.com/FrameworkComputer/Framework-Laptop-16" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Framework Laptop 16</a>, so that you can basically do anything with it that Framework said was to enable "unlocking development of cases, skins, and other customization parts".</p>
<p>DeepComputing also recently <a href="https://deepcomputing.io/worlds-first-risc-v-laptop-gets-a-massive-upgrade-and-equips-with-ubuntu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> an Ubuntu RISC-V laptop as well, the DC-ROMA laptop II, that features the SpacemiT’s SoC K1.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3326253221718722069gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3326253221718722069gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>A very fun time to be following hardware with RISC-V and ARM both taking bigger steps towards more desktop use. The next 10 years certainly will be interesting, looks like we're slowly getting a processor shakeup that's been long overdue.</p>

      <title>Plasma 6.1 released with Explicit Sync, Triple Buffering for Wayland and much more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>KDE Plasma 6.1 has been released today bringing with it plenty of exciting new features, some big and some small but there's plenty to enjoy. My favourite desktop environment! I use it on Kubuntu, and it's the same desktop as you see on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some of the bigger features added include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remote Desktop support from within System Settings.</li>
<li>Customization with the Plasma Edit Mode was overhauled.</li>
<li>Plasma can now re-open apps from your last session on Wayland.</li>
<li>The start of RGB LED sync with your desktop accent colour.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20629950211718710998gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20629950211718710998gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - KDE Plasma 6.1</em></p>
<p>There's a lot more to it including simplifying the logoff / shutdown options, screen locking can now act like a screensaver, visual accessibility improvements including cursor shake and an edge barrier for multi-monitor users.</p>
<p>Another two big additions for Plasma on Wayland include Explicit Sync which helps NVIDIA quite a lot and Triple Buffering, making rendering smoother.</p>

      <title>The hybrid combat mechanics in The Nightscarred: Forgotten Gods sounds exciting</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 5, The Nightscarred: Forgotten Gods from Shadowfall Studios is an immersive first-person action genre, combining a powerful spellcrafting system with hybrid combat mechanics that allow players to wield crafted magical abilities and melee weapons independently.</p>
<p>Something else that's interesting about it is the rich Turkic mythology setting, one not explored often by games.</p>
<p>Have a look at the announcement trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6L35UANS3mc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7cf033d5f5894d06c5c2bfffcbe7e9b6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6L35UANS3mc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Key Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>1. Fast-Paced Hybrid Combat:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Choose your playstyle: run, kick, cast spells, sneak, and defeat enemies using various creative methods.</li>
<li>Independently use magical abilities and melee weapons, maintaining full control over each during gameplay.</li>
<li>Enjoy unrestricted movement capabilities, allowing you to perform offensive abilities while on the move.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>2. Spellcrafting:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Craft your own spells using runes gathered during gameplay.</li>
<li>Combine runes to create unique spells within Nightscarred’s hybrid combat system.</li>
<li>Modify imbuement types, casting methods, and additional stats to tailor spells to your playstyle.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>3. Unique &amp; Dynamic World:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Immerse yourself in an unprecedented lore based on the ancient shamanic world of Turkic mythology.</li>
<li>Navigate dynamic environments, solve physics-based puzzles, and uncover hidden secrets.</li>
<li>Utilize your telekinesis ability to manipulate physical objects (and sometimes enemies) to your advantage</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>4. Co-Op Play:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While the game can still be played solo, the story is also tailored for 2-player co-op playthroughs.</li>
<li>Invite your friends and experience the story in the most enjoyable way.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>"Our top priority is to give players freedom on how they want to play in this immersive action experience", says Shadowfall Studios' Co-founder and Gameplay Programmer, Doğa Can Yanıkoğlu. "In The Nightscarred: Forgotten Gods, we give players the ability to craft their own magical abilities, and leave them the creativity of how to combine them with melee combat mechanics. The best part? You can do that either alone, or with your friend in co-op playthrough."</p>
<p>Note: Doğa Can Yanıkoğlu from their team emailed this in, noting it will have Steam Deck support. The Steam page also already shows the Linux system requirements and they have an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2427530/discussions/0/6579276631059744527/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FAQ</a> post on Steam Deck / Linux.</p>

      <title>Restore a garden back to life in Horticular coming in July</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer inDirection Games announced their cute looking gardening game Horticular is now set to arrive on July 11th. Here you are summoned by a bunch of mysterious gnomes, given the task of breathing new life into a long-lost garden, abandoned by its previous caretaker.</p>
<p>"Enter a magical world where you build up and expand a lush garden at your own pace. In your journey, you attract adorable animals to inhabit every corner; uncover helpful upgrades; and assist quirky characters for rewards and story development—all while juggling decay and fending off corruption sent by your nemesis!"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Lwcse4m5sYk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6a5d16ea275b712fd8e1686444de5e48.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Lwcse4m5sYk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Their plans for the full release include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Complete Story: Launching straight to 1.0 - Through the course of the game you will receive letters from The Council, a collection of garden gnomes that will guide the player and allow them to defeat a mysterious entity known only as The Nemesis.</li>
<li>Varied Game Modes: Alongside the main story mode the game will feature a story mode with 3 different difficulty balance settings as well as a storyless sandbox mode with a further 3 play styles such as Storyless, Peaceful and Creative.</li>
<li>Controller Support: Full controller support means that you can sit back, relax, and experience the game from start to finish without needing to touch your keyboard and mouse - perfect for those lazy TV days. This means it also plays great with the Steam Deck!</li>
<li>Twitch Integration: Streamers and content creators can now incorporate their community into their Horticular gameplay like never before. Viewers will be able to use Bits to add their name to the naming pool for all incoming creatures and Keepers to the garden, as well as sending mail for the streamer to receive in-game.</li>
<li>Mod Support: Horticular will feature full mod support on launch via an included editor, allowing the community to contribute their own additions to the game. Steam Workshop is also fully integrated, meaning installing mods will be quick and easy.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1928540/Horticular/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>. It will have Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Squad, Offworld&#39;s tactical FPS should now run better on Linux with EAC issues fixed</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Squad from Offworld is a tactical first-person shooter that has run on Linux for a while now with Proton, but some Linux distributions had issues with Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC).</p>
<p>As of the latest update to Squad, version 8.0 from June 10, many people are now reporting that Offworld actually finally updated their version of EAC. Linux distributions like Arch had problems with it, due to an issue with later Glibc versions. Thankfully, that's no longer a problem!</p>
<p>I've had a few emails on this, and <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/393380?device=any" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> reports are showing the same, so now you should be good to go playing Squad on various Linux distributions!</p>

      <title>Paradox Interactive completely cancelled Life by You (update Paradox Tectonic to close)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox Interactive announced today that Life by You from their studio Paradox Tectonic is now fully cancelled, after previously being delayed. Tectonic is led by former Executive Vice President of EA Play and Head of The Sims label Rod Humble.</p>
<p>A once promising sounding take on The Sims, it seems it just wasn't going to be good enough and so rather than push out another failure, they're canning it completely.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>"For a long time, we’ve held hopes for Life by You and the potential we saw in it, but it is now clear that the game will not be able to meet our expectations. A version that we’d be satisfied with is too far away, and therefore we are taking the difficult decision to cancel the release. Moving forward, we should perform at a much higher level, and it’s obvious that we have work ahead of us," said Fredrik Wester, CEO of Paradox Interactive.</p>
<p>"We’ve performed poorly in recent releases," continued Wester. "Even though we now start new projects in a different manner, it is clear that we must make further changes so that quality is more consistent and the promises we make to our players are met. We have to evaluate how we manage projects and how we organize, for we will and must get better. We have a very solid financial position and a strong core game portfolio, which keeps us confident about our future."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13144738361718654950gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13144738361718654950gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10566097291718654952gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10566097291718654952gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured: Life By You, shots taken from the Steam page</em></p>
<p>An expanded announcement was <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/life-by-you-is-cancelled.1688889/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted</a> on the official Paradox Forum from Mattias Lilja, Deputy CEO of Paradox Interactive, which for the most part was a slightly wordier version of the above, but ended on this note:</p>
<p>"At the end of the day, our job is to release games that are fun, interesting, and challenging for our players, and our every decision should be taken with that purpose in mind. When we get that right, we earn our pay. So, how do we ensure we don’t find ourselves here again? Honestly, there are no real guarantees. Games are difficult to get right, and we’ll definitely make mistakes, which, as these things go, always become painfully apparent in hindsight, but still shouldn’t reach this kind of magnitude regardless. We have to take a long and hard look at what led us here and see what changes we have to make to become better. In the end, our mission remains the same, and we’ll continue to take whatever steps we need to do just that."</p>
<p>The press release notes that this will "negatively" impact their second quarter by "MSEK 208" (nearly 20 million USD).</p>
<p>Paradox aren't exactly doing too great lately, as Wester noted above. Looking at games they've published there's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1268590/Millennia/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Millennia</a> that released in March, which has a Mixed review score on Steam and the player counts dropped like a rock since release. Then there's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1622900/Star_Trek_Infinite/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Star Trek: Infinite</a>, a fancy re-skin of Stellaris, which they abruptly stopped all updates for last year and now has a Very Negative recent review score. At least <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/983870/FOUNDRY/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FOUNDRY</a> that just released in May seems to be doing okay so far though.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Update 18/06/24 9:00 AM UTC</strong> - Paradox Interactive sent out a PR this morning to note that Paradox Tectonic are being shut down: "This is difficult and drastic news for our colleagues at Tectonic, who’ve worked hard on Life by You’s Early Access release. Sadly, with cancellation of their sole project we have to take the tough decision to close down the studio. We are deeply grateful for their hard work in trying to take Paradox into a new genre," says Fredrik Wester, CEO of Paradox Interactive.</p>
<p>Tectonic employed 24 people.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>Remember when falling sand on your screen was all the rage? The Powder Toy is a classic physics sandbox game, which simulates air pressure and velocity, heat, gravity and a countless number of interactions.</p>
<p>It's free and open source, with a pretty active community around it and a lot of fans and now it's been released on Steam too. Making it easier than ever to mess with physics and just — see what happens. It has Native Linux support and my test of the Steam release showed it working fine on Kubuntu 24.04.</p>

      <title>Open source evolution sim Thrive adds endosymbiosis, toxin customization, day / night cycle</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Thrive just keeps on getting more interesting. An open source evolution sim powered by <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot</a> that allows you to take control of a species from its first steps as a tiny organism.</p>
<p>With Thrive version 0.6.7 out now it adds in some pretty big new features. The first being endosymbiosis, which allows you to be more of a predator, giving you the option to engulf prey and process them to serve your needs. This is used as an alternative method to normal unlock conditions for organelles (what you use to build and evolve your creature).</p>
<p>An upgraded day and night cycle is now turned on by default, new toxin varieties to weaponize yourself with, each with a unique effect and colour and <a href="https://github.com/Revolutionary-Games/Thrive/releases/tag/v0.6.7" rel="noopener" target="_blank">lots more</a>. In the next set of updates they're looking into "the implementation of a stamina and sprinting system, new cell parts and customization, and expanded features for toxins".</p>

      <title>Burn With Me is a deck-builder where you burn your cards to win</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, that's certainly different. Usually a deck-builder card game is about building up your deck, here's it's about sacrificing them and burning them away.</p>
<p>Burn With Me was originally made for the Ludum Dare 55 game jam, but it's now getting an extended version with a Steam release. Made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot</a>, the <a href="https://nozomu57.itch.io/burn-with-me" rel="noopener" target="_blank">itch.io page</a> for the original has it available to try in the browser and there's free downloads for Windows / macOS. My testing showed it working well in Wine 9 on Linux, with the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2954010/Burn_With_Me/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> release noting it will have Linux support.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/695716671718629773gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/695716671718629773gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You only have a limited amount of cards to burn through, with the idea being you place one onto each corner of the Pentagram to add up to the score required to beat the current creature without using up all your cards. The cards all have different totals, and some work together to boost your total.</p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Burn With Me: game prototype that we summoned in 3 days at Ludum Dare 55:</p>
<ul>
<li>14 creatures with unique effects</li>
<li>A wild mechanic of sacrificing your own deck card by card to get advantage</li>
<li>Choosing your difficulty right at the final boss</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">What can you expect in full Steam release?</p>
<ul>
<li>A secret companion to guide you through the mysteries (and to introduce new ones)</li>
<li>Polished graphics, animations and sounds</li>
<li>New cards for new strategies</li>
<li>Branching paths and mini-bosses</li>
<li>New game modes</li>
<li>Ways to bend fate in your favor (at a cost)</li>
<li>A dark story to reveal</li>
</ul>

      <title>Canonical detail improvements the Steam Snap, work to advance gaming continues on Ubuntu</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Canonical are well into development on Ubuntu 24.10, the next non-LTS version of the popular Linux distribution and things keep improving for gamers.</p>
<p>In their latest <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-desktop-s-24-10-dev-cycle-june-update/45784" rel="noopener" target="_blank">developer update</a>, Oliver Smith the Interim Engineering Director for Ubuntu Desktop, goes over some details that were already made in Ubuntu 24.04 like some of the <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/fine-tuning-the-ubuntu-24-04-kernel-for-low-latency-throughput-and-power-efficiency/44834" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fine-tuning</a> they did to the Linux kernel that improved gaming performance.</p>
<p>As for what's to come, plenty of changes are planned for the Steam Snap package. This actually appeared for the first time in the recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/linux-user-share-on-steam-breaks-2pc-thanks-to-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Survey for May</a>, which shows up as "Ubuntu Core 22". Smith noted how the Steam Snap will soon get updates "with a broader range of permissions that should resolve a number of outstanding reports" that will "enable Steam to have access to the things it expects whilst still maintaining the dependency management and updated userspace driver benefits".</p>
<p>More changes are coming like GNOME 46.2 for Ubuntu 24.04 and there's improvements to the new Ubuntu Desktop installer. Their App Center is getting various improvements like running Snaps no longer blocking "users from using the ‘update all’ option in the management interface", supporting externally downloaded .deb files and the gaming tab will soon sort applications by their average rating by default.</p>

      <title>Factory building sim shapez 2 is launching in August</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The truly impressive looking shapez 2 from tobspr Games now has a release window, with the Early Access period set to begin in August.</p>
<p>More about it: "Shapez 2 is a top-down factory-building game where you extract and process geometric shapes. Each shape is its own set of building-blocks that your factories can take apart, stack, paint and put back together in unique ways. Build and automate to produce distinct shapes and solve the production challenge of each goal."</p>
<p>Posted in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2162800/view/4149584538797983676" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam the developer mentioned it should be "Mid-August" but they're not ready to give an exact date just yet. The game has advanced so much since the first title, they're saying the first game now feels much more like a prototype for this second game. They've added in trains, multi-layer factories, fluids, platforms, undo / redo, customizable map generation and so much more. On top of the new fully 3D look too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0VO_52LJ268"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/95d1a2afb300507942c52c325258bf32.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0VO_52LJ268" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's launching with Native Linux support. I'm looking forward to getting lost in this for hours.</p>

      <title>Cats is another idle / clicker item farming game like Banana rising up the Steam player counts</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It seems Egg and it's copy <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/hundreds-of-thousands-of-people-are-now-clicking-a-banana-on-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Banana</a> have potentially started off another trend on Steam, with games designed for you to farm items to sell on the Steam Market.</p>
<p>Banana continues to explode in "player" counts on Steam, with it hitting an all-time peak of 834,343 only 24 hours ago. Of course, most of those are likely bots and people with multiple Steam accounts trying their luck. Meanwhile, Cats has managed a peak count of 48,668 in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>Cats released on May 21st and it's using the same basic idea. Give you something super simple, that you can click a few times and run in the background and over time you get special item drops into your Steam Inventory. These items include various styles of cats, sushi and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17291553261718619145gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17291553261718619145gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>As you can see opening for a few minutes, clicking a few times and it dropped me a few items:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12300029711718619263gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12300029711718619263gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>That one selected above as you can see, has been sold almost 100,000 times on the Steam Market. It's completely ridiculous. People are leaning into these like the NFT craze, only with less of the blockchain scam silliness. Here it's just as <em>dumb</em> though, but it's also a seemingly super-simple way for a developer to earn money when they get a % cut (I believe it's 10%) of all Steam Market item sales (Valve get a cut too). So if a developer can hook enough people in (or bots…) it's probably a reasonable amount going into their pocket.</p>
<p>Expect others of this type to come as more developers figure it out. We're likely to see quite a few low-effort attempts, and I imagine we'll gradually see them expand to pull in more people with a couple extra hooks. We've had the explosion of survivor-like bullet heaven games (thanks Vampire Survivors), now we're getting Egg-likes? Just like Vampire Survivors, they're not the <em>first</em> to do them, but they do seem to be the first few to really make it big.</p>
<p>You can find Cats on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2977660/Cats/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It runs with Proton 9, not that I suggest you try it, I just like to cover the absurd things that happen on Steam at times.</p>

      <title>Selaco has sold 51,000 copies in only two weeks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The seriously impressive GZDoom-powered shooter Selaco from Altered Orbit Studios has managed to do quite well for the Early Access launch. Be sure to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/selaco-is-now-in-early-access-one-of-the-best-shooters-ive-played-in-forever/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check out my initial thoughts</a>.</p>
<p>Posting on X (Twitter) the developer <a href="https://x.com/SelacoGame/status/1802359554262335590" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SELACO has sold 51,000 units in just two weeks!</p>
<p>Thank you all so much for making this possible 💙</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11820592521718618462gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>In a follow-up post they also mentioned the first "True Update" is due this week, Chapter 2 production is about to begin (which will be a free update) and the official soundtrack is coming really soon which includes extra bonus and unused tracks.</p>
<p>For Steam Deck players, they also posted in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1592280/view/4152961604374721645" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam, that for some reason Valve gave the game a Playable rating for the game using Proton 9 instead of their Native Linux version. This is not what they wanted, as it "skips all of the optimizations we made for the Steam Deck, the custom menus and will make old save files not show in game" so you'll need to tick the Compatibility box in the settings and pick the Linux Runtime which will force it to grab the Linux version. They said they are "still working with Valve to get the game verified".</p>

<p>We've seen NVIDIA make a few more direct steps towards open source lately like the 560 series and above will <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/nvidia-switching-to-open-kernel-modules-by-default-in-future-driver-update-for-turing/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">switch to open kernel modules</a> by default on Turing+, a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/former-nouveau-driver-lead-joins-nvidia-and-sent-a-massive-patch-set/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">big patch set for Nouveau</a>, and even <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/nvidia-developer-contributing-to-the-open-source-nvk-driver/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">contributions to NVK</a>.</p>
<p>Now they're exploring more ways to support the an upstream kernel mode driver. As <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/dri-devel/2024-June/457630.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted</a> on the dri-devel mailing list from NVIDIA's Ben Skeggs, who was the former Nouveau lead:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NVIDIA has been exploring ways to better support the effort for an upstream kernel mode driver for GPUs that are capable of running GSP-RM firmware, since the introduction<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/3ed356488c9b0ca93845501425d427309f4cf616.camel@redhat.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">[1]</a> to Nova.</p>
<p>Use cases have been identified for which separating the core GPU programming out of the full DRM driver stack is a strong requirement from our key customers.</p>
<p>An upstreamed NVIDIA GPU driver should be able to support current and emerging customer use cases for vGPU hosts. NVIDIA's vGPU deployments to date do not support compute or graphics functionality within the hypervisor host, and have no dependency on the Linux graphics subsystem, instead implementing the minimal functionality required to run vGPU guest VMs.</p>
<p>For security-sensitive environments such as cloud infrastructure, it's important to continue support for running a minimal footprint vGPU host driver in a stripped-down / barebones kernel environment.</p>
<p>This can be achieved by supporting both VFIO and DRM drivers as clients of a core driver, without requiring a full-fledged DRM driver (or the DRM subsystem itself) to be built into the host kernel.</p>
<p>A core driver would be responsible for booting and communicating with GSP-RM, enumeration of HW configuration, shared/partitioned resource management, exception handling, and event dispatch.</p>
<p>The DRM driver would do all the standard things a DRM driver does, and implement GPU memory management (TTM/HMM), KMS, command submission etc, as well as providing UAPI for userspace clients. These features would be implemented using HW resources allocated from a core driver, rather than the DRM driver being directly responsible for HW programming.</p>
<p>As Nouveau's KMD is already split (in the logical sense) along similar lines, we're using it here for the purposes of this RFC to demonstrate the feasibility of such an architecture, and open it up for discussion.</p>

      <title>SteamOS 3.6.5 Preview for Steam Deck out, plus two Steam Beta Client updates</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has now put up SteamOS 3.6.5 Preview for Steam Deck, plus a further two Beta releases of the Steam Client for all users.<em> They're all pretty small updates.</em></p>
<p>First up SteamOS 3.6.5 Preview <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/6851744408519077027" rel="noopener" target="_blank">notes</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue with 3.6.4 that could cause incorrect inputs on the left side of the Deck controller.</li>

It's going to be another fun one to see everyone on that includes the likes of an updated Arch Linux base, updated Mesa graphics drivers, support for some HDMI CEC features, Steam Deck LCD overclocking and much more.</p>
<p>And the two Beta updates for the main Steam Client (Desktop and Steam Deck) <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements" rel="noopener" target="_blank">include</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed disk write failures reported in the logs when starting games with the shader manager disabled. (June 14th)</li>

      <title>Mysterious new Shovel Knight title teased, plus Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope DX</title>
      <author>Pengling</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As confirmed by developer Yacht Club Games at the end of their latest <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js_FCGpSAgM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Yacht Club Games Presents broadcast</a>, a brand new Shovel Knight game is on the way! Plus, we're also being treated to Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope DX.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/what-s-next-for-shovel-knight/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the official announcement</a>;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>We're committed to crafting an experience that not only honors the Shovel Knight legacy but also pioneers groundbreaking, innovative gameplay mechanics. This isn't just another sequel - it's a bold new adventure that will launch Shovel Knight into an entirely new dimension of gaming.</em></p>
<p><em>We're not quite ready to unveil everything just yet, rest assured, the game will bring electrifying action, richer mechanics, and all the timeless charm you expect from a Shovel Knight title.</em></p>
<p><em>It's been four years in the making because we're dedicated to perfecting every pixel and ensuring that the innovation will redefine what a Shovel Knight game can be.</em></p>
<p><em>And for those of you eager to uncover what's coming next, you might find subtle clues scattered throughout our previous games. Be sure to play Dig, Pocket Dungeon, and all the games in the Treasure Trove to notice the hidden details we've planted. Stay tuned, Shovelers- the future of the Blue Burrower is bright!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A cryptic 9-second teaser video was also provided;</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lfhm3IPPMcU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/94d705db879e729edd8c27d3ff0ec45c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lfhm3IPPMcU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The description's mention of "<em>an entirely new dimension of gaming</em>", and the teaser simply showing the Yacht Club Games logo in 3D, might suggest that the long-requested so-called "Shovel Knight 64" 3D platformer could finally be on the way - though that's just my own speculation!</p>
<p>No other details, including platforms, have been announced as yet, but hopefully the fact that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/250760/Shovel_Knight_Treasure_Trove/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the original Shovel Knight</a> had a native Linux version will have some bearing here. If not, we've always got Proton!</p>
<p>On top of that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2661310/Shovel_Knight_Shovel_of_Hope_DX/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope DX</a> is coming which is an "enhanced edition of the pixel-perfect adventure that started it all". This does list Linux in the system requirements just like the original. More:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jump, battle foes, and seek treasures as you quest to defeat the Order of No Quarter and their vile leader, The Enchantress. Shovel of Hope DX enriches the original game with 20 distinctive playable characters, seamless online multiplayer, and innovative additions like rewind and save states. Whether you're a long-time shoveler or eager to discover the Blue Burrower for the first time, Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope DX invites everyone to celebrate a decade of digging, dashing, and discovery.</p>

      <title>Killer Bean looks absolutely nuts in the latest trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Over the top action? Check. You play as a Bean? Check. I'm not sure what else you need to really know about it other than you obviously need to play it.</p>
<p>"After being betrayed by the Shadow Agency and learning the truth about their evil ways, Killer Bean has made it his life goal to destroy them. Yet this is easier said than done, as Killer Bean will face armies of enemies, and mysterious Shadow Beans who are better trained and more powerful than him."</p>
<p>What you get is a first and third person roguelike shooter. Each campaign you play is fresh, with everything changed. So the locations will be different, new missions, new characters, new bosses and even the story changes each time.</p>
<p>Check out the newer slightly extended trailer from a few days ago below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="87KtMnmZWzQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8debe9895567ba2fcfa3786b07356b8d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/87KtMnmZWzQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Totally procedurally generated missions and story, packed with plot twists and surprises.</li>
<li>Level up Skill Trees for your style of play: Stealth, Melee Combat, Parkour, Guns Blazing.</li>
<li>Different factions of enemies who all dislike each other.</li>
<li>Ragdolls and physics combat galore.</li>
<li>Lots of vehicles to drive, and lots of weapons to try.</li>
<li>Main characters that roam the map, who will either help you or hurt you.</li>
<li>Design your own Shadow Beans that will hunt down Killer Bean.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As for what support to expect? Well it was already confirmed <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/08/the-ridiculous-killer-bean-is-getting-a-third-person-shooter-video-game/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in 2021</a> that it will have Linux support. That was quite a while ago though, so the developer has <a href="https://x.com/Real_KillerBean/status/1801496757198639328" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed</a> again on X (Twitter) in reply to a question about if it's going to be Steam Deck optimised: "Yes, I have a Steam Deck to test on. Plus it will be a native Linux build.".</p>

      <title>The Tricky Trials update is live now for Minecraft</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another big Minecraft update is live now with Tricky Trials bringing with it new decorative blocks, hostile mobs, items, weapons, paintings and the trial chambers.</p>
<p>With the new trial chambers structure you get to explore something filled with traps and treasures, so there's plenty of challenge. You'll also find the new mobs to fight off in here too including the breeze that has a powerful projectile attack to send you flying, and it like to spin around in circles around you. There's also the bogged too, a poisonous skeleton that will be quite a nuisance.</p>
<p>A new block with the vault is a big part of this too. Once you defeat all the mobs from the spawner, you get a trial key which can open the vault and every player involved gets it, instead of one player just emptying the rewards.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NG-5L34HqOs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/aca8538bef52e523c070a1c2a8ef07f7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NG-5L34HqOs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's a lot more to this update including a larger system of opt-in challenges that include village raids, a new mace weapon, a new block with the crafter to set up auto-crafting, a whole bunch of new decorative blocks, new music discs, 4 new tipped arrows, 6 new status effects, 9 new music tracks and more in the <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-java-edition-1-21" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Minecraft</a> is also on sale with 50% off so a good time to go and grab it.</p>

      <title>Steam Client updated with improvements for Steam Deck, Linux, VR and Steam Input</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lots and lots of improvements and bug fixes have arrived in the latest stable update to the Steam Client for Linux, macOS, Windows, VR and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>First up the stuff that's <em>specific</em> to the <strong>Steam Deck</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Show battery information for connected Bluetooth devices under Settings-&gt;Bluetooth and in the Quick Access menu.</li>
<li>Added a per-device toggle to Settings-&gt;Bluetooth that controls whether a device is allowed to wake SteamDeck from sleep.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that would cause the UI to show stale data for Bluetooth devices.</li>
<li>Fixed clickable screenshots in the post-game summary and library screenshot section not opening the screenshot dialog to the correct item.</li>
<li>The magnifier scale can now be configured in Settings-&gt;Display.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And then the main Steam Client update that everyone will see across Linux, macOS, Windows and Steam Deck:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed recent apps section of systray menu being offset when game icons are hidden.</li>
<li>Fixed some issues with video playback not working in client browsers.</li>
<li>Fixed support browser windows not closing when close button is clicked.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Overlay</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Significantly improved in-game overlay responsiveness and fixed cases where the UI could feel stuck or run at 1fps on Windows. This bug previously occurred mostly when running a fully GPU bound game (ie, newer game + older GPU hardware). This bug also mostly only occurred with the Windows Hardware Accelerated GPU scheduling setting enabled.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Library</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed beta selection dropdown for games with very long beta names.</li>
<li>Fixed app activity feed to refresh more reliably.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Update the Steam/Guide button configurations for non-Deck gamepads to match the behavior on Deck, ex: Steam+X button to open the on-screen keyboard instead of Steam + Select, etc.</li>
<li>Allow external gamepad controllers to load the same guide button configuration they would normally load on Desktop.</li>
<li>Improved Gyro To Mouse behavior when connected over bluetooth.</li>
<li>Added the -nojoy command line option to prevent Steam from enumerating controllers for users with who are experiencing crashes.</li>
<li>Added "Universal Face Button Glyphs" toggle in controller settings.</li>
<li>Added exclusion of Gyro Activation Buttons from controller configs that don't have those buttons.</li>
<li>Fixed issue with stale bindings on Quick Settings menu when multiple controllers are plugged in.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remote Play</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added a one time pairing step when streaming from a remote computer.</li>
<li>The Remote Play Together UI is always available in the Steam overlay for supported games.</li>
<li>Use ScreenCaptureKit for desktop capture on macOS 14 (Sonoma).</li>
<li>Added support for hardware video encoding on macOS 14 (Sonoma).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Big Picture Mode</strong></p>

<li>Fixed a crash when opening the overlay in some games.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>VR</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fix for empty Steam screen in SteamVR dashboard after launching a game.</li>
<li>Improved the layout of notifications.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Build the greatest car parks ever in the retro-tycoon styled Car Park Capital</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I feel like I just need to play Car Park Capital after discovering it today. Styled much like a late 90s retro tycoon game, it looks like it's from a different time and I love it.</p>
<p>You know the games I mean right? The classics like Transport Tycoon Deluxe, Rollercoaster Tycoon, Sim City and all the others from around that sort of time. Car Park Capital would fit right in there!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The car industry has identified a few places on earth that do not know <strong>THE FREEDOM OF CAR DEPENDENCY</strong>.<br/>
So they hired you to increase car sales and oil consumption.<br/>
How? <strong>By building the greatest car parks ever!</strong><br/>
<br/>
Turn neighborhoods into car parks, create the need for car commuting and parking.<br/>
Use propaganda to inform people on why they need it.<br/>
<br/>
Learn to become a real tycoon.. Asphalt means freedom, <em>right</em>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have a look at their first trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="VU5TaRFOOs4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3f35dcad5b7fda26f3578b30caa92367.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/VU5TaRFOOs4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Real time simulation with hundreds of vehicles and citizens.</li>
<li>Per-person behavior simulation: Each person is different, except they're all bald.</li>
<li>Play into their minds with propaganda.</li>
<li>3D map editing: Be creative when designing car parks or other buildings. You can make multi-floor structures.</li>
<li>Expand as the demand increases. Get rewarded accordingly.</li>
<li>Elevators!</li>
<li>Retro styled graphics with an aesthetic color palette.</li>
<li>Moddability: Scripts and content can be altered if you possess some Lua skills.</li>
<li><em>More features are in development.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The developer mentioned it's being built on Linux, so it will of course have Native Linux support.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3031880/Car_Park_Capital/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wishlist / follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Square Enix have now released the KINGDOM HEARTS series on Steam, enabling many more people to experience the grand adventure on Steam Deck and desktop Linux easily with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>
<p>The beloved KINGDOM HEARTS franchise was first released in 2002 by Square Enix, and led by legendary game director Tetsuya Nomura, thus launching the longstanding collaboration between Square Enix and Disney. Since then, over 36 million copies have shipped worldwide.</p>
<p>Finally, after being Epic Exclusive for so long! Hopefully we won't see such long exclusive deals in future, as part of Square Enix's change in strategy they <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/square-enix-shifting-from-quantity-to-quality-and-be-more-multi-platform/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced recently</a>.</p>
<p>The Steam release includes all these across different packages:</p>
<ul>
<li>KINGDOM HEARTS HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMIX.</li>
<li>KINGDOM HEARTS HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue.</li>
<li>KINGDOM HEARTS III + Re Mind DLC.</li>
<li>KINGDOM HEARTS INTEGRUM MASTERPIECE (bundle that includes all the above compilations).</li>
</ul>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="G5_3qdf19BU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6ce1d3d472abaef6cbbfcfc335c56ff7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/G5_3qdf19BU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They're also giving away <em>multiple</em> Steam Decks as <a href="https://x.com/KINGDOMHEARTS/status/1801268544006709402" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> on X (formerly Twitter). See their <a href="https://gleam.io/1WS2o/khonsteam" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official giveaway</a> on how to enter. Good luck if you're planning to enter!</p>
<p>Currently at time of writing there's no Steam Deck rating from Valve on any of them, but I would expect Valve to put them through review soon. </p>
<p>You can buy the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/franchise/KINGDOMHEARTSSeries" rel="noopener" target="_blank">series on Steam</a>. The games also 31% off until June 27th.</p>

      <title>Bronze Age pixel-arts RTS game TFC: The Fertile Crescent 1.0 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For those of you who love base-building RTS games like Age of Empires, perhaps give TFC: The Fertile Crescent a try now it's fully released.</p>
<p>It's a little different to most other similar strategy games though, with food playing a much more active role in the game. It's not just a case of getting x amount of food to train units, as food determines the growth rate of your population and the speed at which you accumulate Knowledge Points. You need to keep a constant eye on your food, as a sneak attack on your farmland could end up crippling you. It's as much about your economy and defense, as it is about destroying the enemy base. Quite a challenge actually overall!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vZIlCRfQ3po"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/12cb00520b2c8170f5a7e0fdfa4a2542.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vZIlCRfQ3po" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

<li><strong>Campaign Mode:</strong> Dive into 10 missions that will test your strategic skills across diverse challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Overhauled Artwork:</strong> Experience revamped pixel art graphics, showcasing a fresh new look for environments, as well as an enhanced user interface.</li>
<li><strong>New Map Types: </strong>Explore new terrains with our newly added map types, each offering unique strategic challenges. Expect map obstacles, rivers, and fish to add depth and variety to your gameplay.</li>
<li><strong>War Chariot Units:</strong> Unleash the power of the war chariot, a formidable new unit that can turn the tide of battle with its speed and strength. The war chariot has different stats for each Bronze Age civilization.</li>
<li><strong>New Technologies: </strong>Enhance your civilization with cutting-edge Bronze Age technologies: Master of Siege Warfare for the Assyrians, Improved Watchtower for the Babylonians and Hieroglyphic Networks for the Egyptians.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Game Mechanics:</strong> Prepare for deeper strategic gameplay with improved starvation mechanics.

      <title>Hypersomnia is a free and open source top-down competitive 2D shooter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Feeling competitive? Hypersomnia from Patryk Czachurski is a top-down 2D competitive online shooter. It's free, open source and you can play it via Steam or directly in your browser. The developer of it mentioned they wrote it in C++ without using a game engine, and some of the code they've written (<a href="https://github.com/TeamHypersomnia/rectpack2D" rel="noopener" target="_blank">rectpack2D</a>) was even used in the likes of Assassin's Creed: Valhalla.</p>
<p>What's their aim with it? They want it to become the "ultimate open-source 2D shooter - a grand community project extensible without limit". A lofty goal but perhaps they just might be able to do it, if they get some more eyes on it and what they've been able to do with it is quite impressive.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="riMEv9VRC0w"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/73c7288db08be341f0ae858eb51019c2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/riMEv9VRC0w" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>24 unique firearms.</li>
<li>2 game modes: Bomb defusal (team-based) and Gun game (free-for all).</li>
<li>6 magic spells, 4 grenade types and 7 melee weapons.</li>
<li>An in-game map editor that lets you host a work-in-progress map to test with your friends in a single click. Quickly iterate your map unlike in any game engine.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Writing about the game the developer mentioned in <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our Discord</a>: "The netcode relies on full simulation determinism - this includes Box2D physics. I'm using standard floating-point calculations and rely on IEEE754 compliance. I also use STREFLOP for portable math function implementations. This is commonly done for RTS games with a lot of synchronized units, however this technique is rarely if ever seen in games with complex physics, esp. shooters." — sounds like some impressive tech going on behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Check it out free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2660970/Hypersomnia/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>, play via the <a href="https://hypersomnia.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website</a> and see the code on <a href="https://github.com/TeamHypersomnia/Hypersomnia" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a> (AGPL-3.0 license). It has Native Linux support too of course.</p>

<p>The laptops are made in partnership with Carbon Systems, a company known for supplying the MSP channel but with Kubuntu Focus ensuring all parts have the "most complete, Linux-first support".</p>
<p>“Linux powers many of the ecosystems we rely on today, from servers to smartphones. The Ir series is perfect for developers, creators, and engineers who want a reliable, Linux-native device compatible with these ecosystems.” says Dana Roth, CEO. “These beautiful, light-weight, slim notebooks are portable, and make working anywhere incredibly easy.”</p>
<p>They offer free shipping to continental US and Canada but outside those regions you need to get in touch with them.</p>

      <title>Valve faces a £656 million lawsuit in the UK for &#39;overcharging 14 million PC gamers&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A new lawsuit was filed earlier this month in the UK that alleges Valve, owner of Steam, has been "overcharging 14 million PC gamers and abusing its dominant position in the UK".</p>
<p>First reported by the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpwwyj6v24xo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BBC</a>, the claim was filed by Vicki Shotbolt, the founder and CEO of <a href="https://parentzone.org.uk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Parent Zone</a>. Shotbolt is also on the executive board of the UK Council for Child Internet Safety and is a trustee for MILA the media literacy and information alliance.</p>
<p>There's even been a dedicated website set up for this lawsuit under <a href="https://steamyouoweus.co.uk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">steamyouoweus.co.uk</a>, with Shotbolt setting up a company named Vicki Shotbolt Class Representative Limited to bring this action.</p>
<p>From the claim website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Valve Corporation faces a £656 million collective action claim for overcharging 14 million PC gamers and abusing its dominant position in the UK. Valve owns and operates Steam – the largest digital distribution platform for PC games in the world.</p>
<p>Companies who hold a dominant position in a market are not allowed to charge excessive or anti-competitive prices. They also cannot impose other unfair trading conditions that prevent or hinder others from competing with them.</p>
<p>We believe Valve Corporation has been unfairly shutting out competition for PC games and in-game content, which has meant that UK customers have paid too much for these products.</p>
<p>Vicki Shotbolt, a leading campaigner for children’s digital rights, filed the claim, via Vicki Shotbolt Class Representative Limited, on behalf of all affected gamers at the Competition Appeal Tribunal 5 June 2024.</p>
<p>Vicki accuses Valve Corporation of shutting out competition in the PC gaming market by forcing game publishers to sign up to pricing restrictions that dictate the lowest price games can be sold for on rival platforms.</p>
<p>This has led to UK consumers paying too much for PC games and add-on content, and has enabled the gaming giant to continue charging an excessive commission – of up to 30% – to publishers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Represented by Milberg London LLP, it's worth noting this is not their first rodeo, as they're also <a href="https://playstationyouoweus.co.uk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">going after Sony</a> for £5 billion.</p>
<p>Natasha Pearman, the partner leading the case, says: “Valve has a had a stranglehold on the PC games market for a long time and with this claim we’re challenging the status quo. Competition law is there to protect consumers and ensure that markets work properly. When they don’t work properly and consumers are harmed, collective actions of this kind provide consumers with a voice and a way of holding big companies, like Valve, to account. We’re delighted to be working with Vicki to seek compensation for UK consumers.”</p>
<p>It boils down to their three main issues that they claim:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>Price </strong><strong>parity obligation clauses</strong>: We say that Valve Corporation imposes price parity clauses that restrict and prevent game developers from offering better prices on PC-games on rival platforms, limiting consumer choice and harming competition.</li>
<li><strong>Tying</strong>: We say that the restrictions Valve Corporation imposes, that mean the add-on content for games must also be purchased from Steam, restricts competition in the market.</li>
<li><strong>Excessive pricing</strong>: We argue that Valve Corporation has imposed an excessive commission, of up to 30%, charged to publishers, that resulted in inflated prices on its Steam platform.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The first point is one we've heard repeated many times before, but there's never been any proof on it. Which perhaps the Wolfire lawsuit and this may actually bring to light. An accusation doesn't necessarily mean they're right though. Something people get confused on often is Steam Keys, which are completely separate to Steam Store purchases. Valve <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/keys" rel="noopener" target="_blank">do ask</a> developers not to "give Steam customers a worse deal than Steam Key purchasers", but again, that's specifically for Steam Keys.</p>
<p>This sounds very similar to the case that Wolfire brought up against Valve in the US.</p>
<p><em>I've reached out to Valve press for any comments on it. Will update if they reply,</em></p>

      <title>Combat encounters are a challenging and unique experience in Bittersweet Birthday </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bittersweet Birthday is a game that hasn't been mentioned here in quite some time, but thankfully World Eater Games have a big update to share on this unique action adventure RPG.</p>
<p>More about it: "You wake up...dazed, and with no memories. As you ask yourself where you are and how you got there, a strange voice breaks through the speaker system offering you a way out. Unstable individuals are hunting you down and it looks like your only chance of escape...is to listen...</p>
<p>Bittersweet Birthday is an action game where every combat encounter is a challenging and unique experience. Learn your enemy's patterns, plan your movements and tear down your opponent in fierce battles that combine Soulslike dodge roll mechanics with bullet hell mayhem."</p>
<p>The developer has announced that they've found a publisher with Dangen Entertainment, along with an official release window of Q2 2025. There's been a whole lot of changes for the game too with progress ongoing, so there's also a new trailer below and a refreshed demo to check out.</p>

      <title>Terrorformer TD is a tower defense roguelite with a map you terraform as you go</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a map that erodes and grows as the game progresses, Terrorformer TD puts a rather unique spin on the tower defense genre.</p>
<p>What began as a Master of Fine Arts thesis project quickly transformed into the pride and joy of solo developer TJ Cioffe of onewinter games, as he realized that this was a real opportunity to build upon previous tower defense staples and take the genre in his own direction. Check out the trailer for Steam Next Fest:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WtgP7XmrM-Q"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/590be82bf837f81ab6992944e5da58e4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WtgP7XmrM-Q" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"I've had a blast researching and testing what makes the best tower defense games so good,” onewinter games solo developer TJ Cioffe stated. “It’s a fascinating genre that stands between modern Vampire Survivors-likes and RTS classics like Starcraft that’s spawning some really creative concepts lately. There’s never been a more interesting time to be making a tower defense game and I’m excited to share Terrorformer TD with the world!"</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Terraform the Battlefield: </strong>Unlock new procedurally generated maps, each with unique terraforming opportunities and base-building strategies. Grow along with the dynamic battlefield and design the right defenses for each playthrough's challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Assemble a Home Tower: </strong>Customize your Home Tower each run from the components you've unlocked, giving you access to special abilities, upgrades, and weapons! Earn dozens of permanent perks as you play and level up, increasing your survivability on each run.</li>
<li><strong>Choose Your Own Adventure:</strong> Unlocks, upgrades, and map erosion are randomized every round, so each playthrough is different. Try your hand at a harder difficulty, or see how long you can last using the Weekly Challenge's loadout!</li>
<li><strong>Take on Enemy Hordes:</strong> Counter enemy abilities like Fortify, Warp, and Disable Tower with 25 unique towers that earn XP and level up, growing stronger as the game goes on. Mix-and-match defenses to find the best combination for each enemy challenge.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2837760/Terrorformer_TD/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a> - it has Native Linux support. The full release is planned for September 2024.</p>

      <title>Sally is a life sim about community and belonging aboard a magic flying ship</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Points for trying something a little different with the life sim genre here. Sally puts you aboard a magic flying ship, which is a bit unusual.</p>
<p>It has all the usual points you might expect though like crafting, cooking, farming, building and then add into that exploring the skies. The skies are filled with floating islands each their own distinct ecosystem with different seasons, resources, animals and inhabitants. There's some random generation here with each play-through being different as it gives you new characters each time with their own emotions, tastes, interests and more. You also get to completely customize your character.</p>

<p>This one actually had a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lucid-tales/sally/description" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> campaign which was quite successful back in 2022 with CA$137,377 raised.</p>

      <title>Piece together the broken memories of a cybernetic house in Psychroma</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Psychroma looks pretty wild. A narrative-driven side-scroller where you play as a digital medium. Confront the past by piecing together the broken memories of a cybernetic house, and exorcise the ghosts in the machine.</p>
<p>If you enjoy games that have a diverse setting with BIPOC and LGBTQIA+ characters that are central to the narrative, this one is for you. This is quite a <em>dark</em> game too with a mature and violent theme to it. So you've been warned on that. This is probably one of the wildest looking side-scrolling adventure games I've seen for a while.</p>
<p>More about it: "Acid rain rots away exposed rebar in the half-developed megacity once known as Toronto. Humanity modifies itself at a frequency never seen before. A housing crisis not only endangers the market, but the displaced and unhoused. One dilapidated house, only referred to as The Commons, is the center of our story. What was once meant to be a safe haven has turned against every occupant to have dwelled within.</p>
<p>You can't remember how you got here, and you are trapped inside. You must use a strange deck of memory cards holding the recorded memories of the past and present residents to manipulate time and navigate the house."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UgjmwywNCgI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0e768fff955beb69da62996b7eb9371c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UgjmwywNCgI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>/TIME JUMP</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use a cybernetic memory card system to navigate through time.</li>
<li>Gain the perspective of others' stored memories.</li>
<li>Gain access to new parts of the house.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>/COMMUNICATE WITH THE DEAD</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use an interactive Ouija system to speak with ghosts and gather info that would otherwise be hidden.</li>
<li>Descramble memories by inputting keywords provided by the ghost in the machine.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>/SURGERY</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Perform surgical procedures to help stabilize injured victims.</li>
<li>Uncover the debilitating effects of the Psychroma</li>
<li>Learn about the technology that unleashed the monster</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available with a Native Linux <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1879950/Psychroma/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">version on Steam</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Update 13/06/24 16:00 UTC</strong>: on desktop Linux it's currently an empty download so I've let the developer know. The issue is that they've set it for Steam Deck in their Steam admin, which ends up making it <em>only</em> available to download on Steam Deck and not desktop Linux. This has been a repeating issue lately, so I've emailed Valve to ask if they plan to make this more clear for developers.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1879950/depots/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> as an example, you can see their Linux build is set for Steam Deck:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20173188601718292896gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The idea, as I understand it on the Steam Deck setting, is for special content <em>just</em> for Steam Deck. So when it's set, that's <em>only</em> available for Steam Deck.</p>
<p><strong>Update 14/06/24 08:00 UTC</strong>: the developer has now fixed that issue above.</p>

      <title>Prickle is a wholesome Sokoban-style puzzler about catching baby hedgehogs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In the game Prickle you play as a hedgehog dad trying to collect all your children, as they've done a bit of a runner so you need to stick them all together and get them back home.</p>
<p>Prickle is a Sokoban-style puzzler but instead of the usual block-pushing, you're zipping around levels and collecting little hoglets that stick together like glue. Then you need to somehow get around to the exit, which is easier said than done. It's actually quite a nice little tweak to the usual because these sticky little critters can end up stuck together in all sorts of different ways, so you'll need to attempt to get them stuck exactly how you want, so you can rotate them all around and get them home.</p>
<p>It's a very sweet and wholesome idea.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mVsXREWWFG4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/80b743a63247397ca8afadc136fe79e2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mVsXREWWFG4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

      <title>Logic puzzler Linkito will tease your brain as you connect everything together</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>French solo developer Kalinarm has a demo available for Linkito, a logic puzzler all about making engineering connections. Split across over 80 levels in the full game you'll be mastering the flow of power and information in no time, apparently.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5198950981718177718gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5198950981718177718gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>What's quite interesting with this one is that not only does it have the main story campaign to play through, where you use your logic to climb the corporate ladder, but there's also a full level editor with over 100 elements to design your own puzzles, and of course play the creations of others including full campaigns. But not just that, it will also have integrations with real-life circuits like Arduino or OSC protocols. There's even going to be a special Twitch campaign to play with viewers.</p>
<p>The developer gave a nice overview in a recent video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cuomdMWBd7A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7b8aa7d85f4165158181d02a99ee968a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cuomdMWBd7A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Use your logic in many challenging puzzles exploring various connection-based mechanics.</li>
<li>Tinker with, connect, arrange, flick or even push 100+ different types of physical blocks.</li>
<li>Uncover the truth about Albatross Technologies in an original 50s dystopian setting.</li>
<li>Progress through an easy to learn but hard to master engineering journey.</li>
<li>Crank up your creativity and create your own logic puzzles with the level editor.</li>
<li>Play community created levels in one click.</li>
<li>Link with reality through Twitch, Arduino and OSC integrations.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Hundreds of thousands of people are now clicking a Banana on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As a ridiculous update to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/over-30000-people-are-clicking-a-picture-of-a-banana-on-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an article I did recently</a> about the free game called Banana, where it seemed insane that over 30,000 people were clicking it - now a whole lot more people are doing so too.</p>
<p>To refresh your little minds a moment. On Steam, there's a game called Banana. It's an idle clicker game, where all you do is load it up and click a picture of a Banana. You can leave it in the background, and let it do its thing. Over time, you gradually get Steam Items in the form of random Bananas.</p>
<p>It looks like this and that's literally it:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20102023881718137047gol1.png"/></p>
<p>The number of players has only continued to climb on it too. About 7 hours ago (<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2923300/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>) it hit a peak player count of 252,171. Although, according to what the developer told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24173617/banana-clicker-game-steam-egg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Polygon</a>, they've had a bit of a bot problem they're trying to solve. The developer has given the game updates, like forcing you to actually click now and then, to help reduce some botting so the actual number of people is probably a reasonably good deal lower.</p>
<p>In a recent post, the developer also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2923300/view/4190115667805431237" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> over 650,000 people have now downloaded it.</p>
<p>Why? Those Steam Items. Those gloriously tasty bananas. People are going, well — ape over them. Bananas go into your Steam inventory and so you can sell them. And clearly, people are actually buying them too, just look at my Retronana that's had nearly 10,000 sold in the last 24 hours. Not for much though for these but some of them are very limited and so people are trying their luck.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8925894331718137290gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8925894331718137290gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>The game has a Linux version, although it doesn't work for me, but Proton 9 does. Not that I suggest you "play" it, I just find it amusingly <em>absurd</em> that this continues to be a thing. It's <em>not</em> a surprise though, this <em>is</em> the kind of thing Valve invites with the Steam market.</p>
<p>It's low-stakes trading that takes no effort at all from everyone, somewhat reminiscent of the stupid NFT bubble (glad that's over) or actual trading cards but not as fun. People just like to collect things and be a part of something in some ways, while of course there's going to be a large percentage that are hoping to nab one of the rare items that they might be able to sucker someone into buying to then spend their Banana money on Steam directly for a new game.</p>
<p>Banana is available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2923300/Banana/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Old school immersive sim FPS &#39;Core Decay&#39; still alive and the latest update sounds awesome</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A few months ago there was <a href="https://x.com/ScottApogee/status/1742587980785590339" rel="noopener" target="_blank">news</a> about layoffs at 3D Realms and Slipgate Ironworks, and it seemed like Ivar Hill's immersive sim Core Decay was hit. Thankfully though, Core Decay is alive and well.</p>
<p>Posted in an update on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1260940/view/4148458004753967730" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> and the developer's new <a href="https://community.coredecay.com/blog" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website</a>, Hill mentioned "I am entirely dedicated to seeing the project to completion and am personally working on it every day" but there's "no specific news to share in regards to the development schedule or involved parties, but it is my full intent to continue to work on Core Decay".</p>
<p>Some fresh screenshots were shared as well and it's looking rather interesting:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10389615811718116360gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10389615811718116360gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15241609211718116362gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15241609211718116362gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The latest <a href="https://community.coredecay.com/blog/16-dev-blog-2-troubleshooter" rel="noopener" target="_blank">development update</a> posted June 9th goes into a lot more design detail, with even more screenshots sprinkled in it and it's a fun read, and getting me quite excited for it. I like the thought of having multiple ways to go about an objective, from brute force to talking people into doing it for you, or just finding another way around sneakily.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12851744061718116556gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12851744061718116556gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Certainly sounds like a Deus Ex game, and that's awesome.</p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>THE FINAL BREATH OF HUMANITY.</strong> Travel a world on the brink of annihilation, uncover a great conspiracy, and face the lengths we are willing to go for our own survival. Your search for answers takes you across Antarctica, Asia, North America, Africa, and Europe.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>A TRUE IMMERSIVE SIM.</strong> Engage with an endless variety of gameplay mechanics, and solve challenges your own way. Talk your way out of tricky situations, pick locks and hack computers, find paths through city rooftops and ancient sewer systems, engage in lethal or non-lethal combat, and explore places that feel like real locations inhabited by real people.<br/>
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most recent trailer from 2023 is below:</p>

<p>Core Decay will have Native Linux support. In fact, Hill actually <a href="https://mastodon.social/@ivarhill/110407571977284554" rel="noopener" target="_blank">moved over</a> to using Linux last year.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

      <title>WOLFHOUND is a sci-fi World War II metroidvania from the creator of Chasm </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bit Kid creator of Chasm have announced WOLFHOUND, a sci-fi World War II metroidvania where you play as a one-man-army Capt. Chuck “WOLFHOUND” Rosetti.</p>
<p>Here you infiltrate a super secret Axis base in the Bermuda Triangle where Allied forces have gone missing. WOLFHOUND quickly finds not just enemy soldiers, but grotesque, mutated nightmares out to stop him. Steal their weaponry and use powerful experimental equipment while venturing into the heart of the island, where castles and crystal caverns hide dark, fascinating secrets.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="iWprFF0A-io"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/08694a166dfa9e8154ceefe7fc8b138c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/iWprFF0A-io" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explore</strong> a massive, hand-crafted island with 10 interconnected areas</li>
<li><strong>Relive</strong> an iconic era of action gaming with challenging 2D mechanics and authentic pixel art (320x180 native res), with native 4K resolution and your choice of razor sharp pixels or convincing CRT effects</li>
<li><strong>Survive and thrive</strong> with cutting-edge technology like an upgradable jetpack, offering new strategies for overcoming obstacles</li>

<li><strong>Upgrade</strong> your arsenal to pack an extra punch using modified gun parts and special types of ammunition</li>
</ul>
<p>It will have a Native Linux version and Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>After more than 200,000 recruits ventured into the procedurally-generated depths of Chasm, Bit Kid sought to return to the Metroidvania genre, while eschewing procedural generation in favor of a single, intricately-designed world. Bit Kid brought together artistic talent behind the Shantae series, Freedom Planet 2, and Sparklite along with a heroic chiptune soundtrack courtesy of musician RushJet1 (Cave Story+, Alwa’s Legacy, PewDiePie's Tuber Simulator).</p>
<p>“While I’ve always been a big fan of retro games and pixel art, I really wanted to dive deep into the style of NES and 8-bit gaming,” said James Petruzzi, founder and lead developer at Bit Kid. “We’re aiming to be as authentic as possible, stylistically: an 8-bit color palette, 320x180 pixel resolution, and a soundtrack composed in Famitracker which has enabled homebrewers to create authentic NES music for many years.”</p>

      <title>Core Keeper 1.0 will bring new PvP, revamped world-gen and a mysterious new biome</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pugstorm and Fireshine Games have revealed more details about the 1.0 release for Core Keeper that will arrive on August 27th.</p>
<p>Coming to Core Keeper for the very first time, the 1.0 update will introduce brand new (optional) PvP functionality, an entirely revamped world generation system and a mysterious new biome to explore: The Passage. We're also getting two brand new combat styles with the introduction of the Mage and Warlock builds, plus new skill trees, equipment, enemies, bosses and the conclusive chapter to Core Keeper’s main story, alongside much, much more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="L4IVUApXbXU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1b20c8d9159f498e4574bdab083fe6e2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/L4IVUApXbXU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With the new world generation, old worlds will still work, but the developers said they "strong encourage" players to start a new world to get all of it.</p>
<p>Honestly, it sounds amazing from what they've said. </p>
<p>Core Keeper is available right now in Early Access on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1621690/Core_Keeper/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Free-roaming megasim sandbox RPG &#39;Streets of Fortuna&#39; sounds wonderfully unique</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently announced by Kitfox Games (publisher of Dwarf Fortress) is Streets of Fortuna, a free-roaming megasim sandbox RPG that's a bit like The Sims meets Project Zomboid but a whole lot more than that.</p>
<p>Kitfox say it's "complicated" in how to describe it, because it's "sort of its own special sandbox you'll muck around in, and the city texture gives that playfulness a tone we haven't seen in other games".</p>
<p>A megasim sandbox where you just do whatever the heck you want, and deal with the emergent chaos that comes with it rather than following a story. So you can live as a thief, a blacksmith, a rebel, a priest, a smuggler, a lover, a cook, or just a street rat. Eventually even take on the ruler of the land, if you want.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-IlPTZ8-bjE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/465faadbcdc253cc973182359bdee2ed.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-IlPTZ8-bjE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Freeform gameplay in a dense, seamless, generated city.</li>
<li>No job or class system to constrain you, only heaps of skills to grow.</li>
<li>Made in consultation with the creators of Dwarf Fortress to optimize for emergent player stories.</li>
<li>Simulated people and communities for infinite hours of megasim gameplay.</li>
<li>Focus on narrow escapes and heists rather than toe-to-toe combat.</li>
<li>Original, richly textured world and lore, loosely inspired by Constantinople circa 500 AD.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kitfox mentioned they've been working on it in secret for years, and they've had Tarn Adams of Dwarf Fortress give over their time to help with as they said in their email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For now Tarn has been generous enough to share an hour of his time every 4-6 weeks, but they've been really valuable hours for us at Kitfox, going anywhere from NPC movement simulation to playtesting to save files, sometimes more fluffy design questions and sometimes more technical conundrums. For now this cadence is great for both parties, since it lets us learn from his experiences without significantly distracting him from Dwarf Fortress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds really unlike anything else.</p>

<p>Kitsune Tails from developer Kitsune Games and publisher MidBoss, the gay furry Mario-like, is now going to be released on August 1st.</p>
<p>Jump through mythological matters of the heart as Yuzu, a young half-fox/half-human messenger to the god Inari voiced by Kira Buckland, the voice of NieR: Automata’s 2B.

Help Yuzu move mountains to rescue her love interest Akko from a dire fate, and access an array of mystical moves along the way.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>

<p>It will also support modding too via the open source <a href="https://www.mapeditor.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tiled</a> level editor.</p>
<p>“Kitsune Tails is so much more than just a visual nod to the classic 8-bit platformers,” said Eniko Fox, Founder, Kitsune Games. “We built this from the ground up to offer the community an accessible, diverse game-design experience — in addition to telling our own tale with those very same tools. We can’t wait to see what you all create!”</p>
<p>They do have a demo available right now for Steam Next Fest, but the demo only has a Windows version, although it will likely work fine with Proton. For the full release it will have Native Linux support.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1325260/Kitsune_Tails/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Unpacking and Assault Android Cactus devs announce relaxing musical puzzler Tempopo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tempopo is the next title from Witch Beam, creators of the popular Unpacking and Assault Android Cactus due out sometime in 2024.</p>
<p>Looks like quite a relaxing one, as it seems Witch Beam are sticking to their more casual games following on from Unpacking which was very chilled and quite a departure from the chaos in twin-stick shooter Assault Android Cactus. Here you're dealing with a garden of musical flowers that have been scattered across the sky, and only the magical Tempopo with their unique abilities can rescue them. These creatures are mischievous and uncoordinated by nature, so they'll be relying on your conducting skills to work together to solve the puzzles.</p>
<p>The first trailer, which is a music video masquerading as a trailer, introduces us to "the flow, feel and vibe of Tempopo, where soundscapes act as a heartbeat to synchronise all living elements of the game together while you play". Check it out below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="XuqjFn9P8No"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/30b5a4360fef0a8e1cf351e861efe047.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/XuqjFn9P8No" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guide Tempopo through 60 levels, manoeuvring, smashing, blocking, lifting and pushing your way through spatial puzzles across four seasons.</li>
<li>Experience a bright and joyful world that’s permeated with music, where every living element moves in harmony with the musical heartbeat.</li>
<li>Build your own melodic garden with the flowers you rescue throughout the game and enjoy a unique musical performance.</li>
<li>Find your comfort level with an accessible by design approach to input requirements, gameplay modes, and bonus challenge puzzles.</li>
<li>Soundtrack by BAFTA award-winning composer &amp; audio director Jeff van Dyck.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Streets of Rogue 2 hits Early Access on August 14 - I&#39;m going to need a week off</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>That's it, I'm going to need a holiday for this one. Streets of Rogue 2 from Matt Dabrowski and tinyBuild is due to enter Early Access on August 14th.</p>
<p>Here you'll get to experience unprecedented freedom to topple a corrupt president by any means necessary. With a full open-world, you can even just go and chill in the countryside somewhere, or just cause total chaos in various cities. The choice here is yours.</p>
<p>With loads of unusual playable classes including a dirty mob boss, a hardworking farmer, a genius-level hacker, or even a blood-sucking vampire. How about sneaking around as a ninja? Or having the power to conjure up a horde of flesh-eating zombies? It seems to take everything great about the first and just make it a whole lot bigger. Complete with destructible environments and the ability to play in co-op with friends.</p>
<p>Check out the brand new trailer below and you might even spot a little word from a familiar website in it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="giKX3jFF47A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dbc071a339f5eb4df7e24facd934509f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/giKX3jFF47A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You heard me, it really is one of my absolute most wanted games for this year.</p>

      <title>Pinball Spire is a fresh Pinballvania blending multiple genres with classic ball flipping</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pinballvania? That's actually a new one to me, although Pinball Spire is not the first, it sure does look good.</p>
<p>There's quite a lot of great looking Pinball games out there, plenty that stick quite closely to being just a jazzed-up version of the game, but not too many actually expand on the basic idea and throw in other genres into the mix like Pinball Spire does.</p>
<p>"Conquer the titular spire as a brave, plucky little pinball called Pip, destined to step into the plunger and explore the inner chambers of a mysterious spire that appeared in their world overnight."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="a9ki0eKVk9Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1751726f867cd35de843eec6bfd8e20c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/a9ki0eKVk9Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Inside the Spire there's a big maze of Pinball games, full of various secrets to unlock and enemies to bump into along with various types of contraptions to interact with. You also have some special abilities, that play a role in getting you through this strange building.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pinballvania, a unique blend of genres, mixing classic video game platforming with arcade pinball games.</li>
<li>Elaborate pinball levels to explore, combining traditional pinball tables with atmospheric dungeons and passageways to explore.</li>
<li>Mana-powered pinball abilities enable unorthodox ways to interact with the environment.</li>
<li>Mystery that actually gets resolved conclusively instead of ending up on a cliffhanger!</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2601940/Pinball_Spire/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a> which worked great with Proton 9.</p>

      <title>You may want to avoid NVIDIA driver 550 if you&#39;re on a laptop</title>
      <author>nwildner</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you are a laptop user, you may want to avoid driver version 550 because there is a megathread on the NVIDIA forum where users are reporting that this version is making their distributions randomly crash.</p>
<p>Photos from my personal laptop last night after doing some reboots just for fun and testing (Arch Linux 6.9.1-zen + nvidia-dkms 550):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7030580881718014659gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7030580881718014659gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Crash right after decrypting the disk</em></p>
<p></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/488447431718014681gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/488447431718014681gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Crash right before trying to load sddm</em></p>
<p>It does not follow a pattern. Sometimes the laptop boots, sometimes it crashes. I would say that in 40% of the times that I've tried to boot it crashed during this week.</p>
<p>The way it happens, you can't say for sure where <code class="inline-code">nvidia</code> module is poking around because sometimes the crash is related to <code class="inline-code">vfs</code> sometimes with <code class="inline-code">rcu_schedule</code>. It happened to me right after decrypting my secondary NVMe, but it also happened right before trying to launch <code class="inline-code">sddm</code> so it is pretty random. Some folks reported it happened during upgrades when <code class="inline-code">udev</code> was triggered, but I didn't have that more catastrophic version of this problem (yet), having to deal with the system running and maybe breaking my initrd or package database.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The available options to mitigate this situation are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Revert back to version 545 or 535 with <code class="inline-code">dkms</code></li>
<li>Use the beta version 555. It looks like it is <a href="https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/series-550-freezes-laptop/284772/190" rel="noopener" target="_blank">stable enough</a> from the standpoint of this bug.</li>
<li>Use the <a href="https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/series-550-freezes-laptop/284772/181" rel="noopener" target="_blank">following</a> workaround involving disabling <code class="inline-code">udev</code> triggers and setting some kernel command line related to GSP firmware.</li>
</ol>

      <title>TUXEDO tease an ARM Snapdragon X Elite Linux notebook is coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>TUXEDO Computers have teased that they're working on an ARM notebook with a Snapdragon X Elite SoC from Qualcomm. It's not just Microsoft and Apple making an ARM push, Linux users will be able to get in on the fun officially soon too.</p>
<p>The hardware vendor explained in a <a href="https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en/TUXEDO-on-ARM-is-coming.tuxedo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">news post</a> that they recently presented a prototype of the ARM notebook they're working on at Computex, and they have the specifications of it now finalised. Work is ongoing though, like getting everything ported over and working on ARM fully.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The specs for their first ARM notebook as teased are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite, 12 cores, 20 W TDP (model X1E80100 in the prototype)</li>
<li>14" 16:10 IPS screen at 2560 x 1600</li>
<li>Aluminium body with USB4, HDMI</li>
<li>50Wh battery</li>
<li>32GB LPDDR5X</li>
<li>1x M.2 PCIe Gen 4 SSD slot</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15442724101718013956gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15442724101718013956gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>As Qualcomm themselves explained in a <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/developer/blog/2024/05/upstreaming-linux-kernel-support-for-the-snapdragon-x-elite" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a> they're working on getting full Linux support all sorted, as they said "It’s been our priority not only to support Linux on our premium-tier SoCs, but to support it pronto". And with the Snapdragon X Elite, they had a patchset ready for the Linux kernel the day after announcement back in October last year.</p>
<p>It should be truly ready hopefully in Linux kernel 6.11.</p>
<p>When it comes to the status of the project at TUXEDO, they said their first prototype is about to be replaced by a second, but they're still in the "alpha" stages. However, they said it's "quite conceivable that an ARM notebook from TUXEDO will be under your Christmas tree in 2024".</p>
<p>Exciting times for hardware!</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>All new interface - Our transformational UI redesign is complete! Fully mouseable, fully gamepaddable, and much prettier, but all carefully designed to maintain the essence of what makes Qud Qud. More polish is coming, but everything functional is in.</li>
<li>Support for Steam Cloud saves. Play between PCs or between Steam Deck and PC, at your leisure.</li>
<li>a refresh of the starting town of Joppa, with the same lived-in texture as the rest of the world.</li>

      <title>Gears of War: E-Day announced and it&#39;s coming to Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Showing just how much Microsoft's attitude has changed with Xbox Game Studios, they've announced Gears of War: E-Day and it's coming to Steam. I have to admit, of the games Microsoft would announce during their event, I thought titles like this would remain a console exclusive. Happy to be surprised by the game and the Steam release!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Story of E-Day</strong><br/>
Fourteen years before Gears of War, war heroes Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago return home to face a new nightmare: the Locust Horde. These subterranean monsters, grotesque and relentless, erupt from below, laying siege on humanity itself.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>New Foundations</strong><br/>
Built from the ground up with Unreal Engine 5, Gears of War: E-Day delivers unprecedented graphical fidelity.</p>

<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="12m0bw1W_tk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5e1efcb5092ee04d915a422e25ef7e50.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/12m0bw1W_tk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I played through I believe only the first two in the series many years ago, and did very much enjoy them. Given how long it's been, a prequel actually makes sense to bring a whole new audience to it. From the detailed <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/09/gears-of-war-e-day-interview-details-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a>, you can expect a similar style to the gameplay of the originals with third-person action as you charge between cover.</p>
<p>“It’s going to feel like a new Gears game, because that’s what it is,” Creative Director Matt Searcy says. “It’s us revisiting the tone and the feeling of what makes Gears great, but we’re tapping into new techniques, new processes, and new technology that’s going to make the gameplay feel better than ever. It’s going to be awesome, a game that feels both truly new, and authentically Gears.” </p>
<p>Thanks <em>again</em> to Valve and their work with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>, we should be able to experience this on Linux. Given how quickly we've seen Valve get Proton updates out for major releases, I'm excited!</p>

<p>"Chornobyl Exclusion Zone has changed dramatically after the second massive explosion in year 2006. Violent mutants, deadly anomalies, warring factions have made the Zone a very tough place to survive. Nevertheless, artifacts of unbelievable value attracted many people called S.T.A.L.K.E.R.s, who entered the Zone for their own risk striving to make a fortune out of it or even to find the Truth concealed in the Heart of Chornobyl."</p>

<p>This is the part where I confess to you something terrible, that you're going to rinse me in the comments for…I've put all of maybe 20 minutes into the originals. I just…don't get them. Considering how big they were originally, and still are loved by many even now, I guess I'm really missing something here.</p>
<p>With the previous games all having a pretty good <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating, I'm hopeful this next one won't have too many issues. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> has come such a long way that it's easy to get excited about huge games like this just being playable in a click or two on Linux thanks to Valve.</p>
<p>You can pre-purchase on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Age of Mythology: Retold arrives on Steam on September 4</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Always great to see an RTS classic get revived. Age of Mythology: Retold from publisher Xbox Game Studios will be coming to Steam on September 4th.</p>
<p>From the creators of the award-winning Age of Empires franchise, Age of Mythology: Retold goes beyond history to a mythical age where gods, monsters, and humans collide. As a huge fan of classic RTS games, and someone who actually entirely missed the original (too busy with Age of Empires), I can't wait.</p>

<br/>

<br/>
<strong><u>Better with Friends</u></strong><br/>

      <title>DOOM: The Dark Ages announced for Steam in 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I know this will excite many of you. DOOM: The Dark Ages has been announced today and it will arrive on Steam in 2025. Get ready for more ripping and tearing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vile forces push a kingdom to the brink. Fangs gnashing, their fury is emboldened by the flames of Hell’s own malevolence. No mortal blade cuts their masses down. No bulwark stays their advance. No army dares match them in the battlefield.</p>
<p>But you will. You are the super weapon primed to destroy evil.</p>
<p>For when Hell is at the gates, the DOOM Slayer answers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems like I really need to go and play through DOOM Eternal to the finish now. I know, I'm a bit of a late bloomer on the recent DOOM games after only finishing DOOM in the last year. Although, you don't actually have to play the others, since DOOM: The Dark Ages shows off the Slayer's origin and is actually a <em>prequel</em> to the other two modern DOOM games. Oh, and this time you've got some fun toys to play with like the Atlan, a "daunting skyscraper-sized mech capable of toppling Hell’s behemoths with titanic metal fists" and a Mecha Dragon to fly around on too.</p>

<p>Since it will be on Steam, thanks to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> we shouldn't have much trouble playing it, and we know id Software use Vulkan so it's likely it will run really well.</p>
<p>Hell yeah, this looks awesome!</p>

      <title>Sid Meier&#39;s Civilization VII arrives in 2025 with a teaser</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sid Meier's Civilization VII was officially revealed from Firaxis Games and 2K, due to arrive sometime in 2025. Although we don't exactly know much about it just yet.</p>
<p>The official teaser video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="pygcgE3a_uY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7c7adc504c7ec92083ff16b200977759.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/pygcgE3a_uY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Here's the thing that might excite you perhaps: multiple previous games in the series had Native Linux versions, although they were external ports by Aspyr Media. This time around, it appears Linux (and macOS) will be supported once again but it's not entirely clear who is doing the Linux / macOS versions as it wasn't stated.</p>
<p>The press release made it clear <em>multiple</em> times it will be available across "PlayStation®5 (PS5®), PlayStation®4 (PS4®), Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo™ Switch, and PC, Mac and Linux via Steam".</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>"For more than 30 years, players from around the world have shared their love and support for Civ," stated Sid Meier, Founder and Director of Creative Development at Firaxis Games. "I'm incredibly excited for Civ fans to see Civilization VII, a game that represents the culmination of three decades of strategy innovation and refinement."</p>
<p>“With more than 70 million copies sold-in and over 1 billion hours played, the Civilization franchise is a crown jewel for 2K," stated David Ismailer, President of 2K Games. “What the team is looking to accomplish with Civilization VII is nothing short of breathtaking, and we're confident that Firaxis Games has another hit on their hands with Civilization VII."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam page</a> that's now live does have both Linux and macOS sections in the system requirements too, but they're noted as "TBD" (to be decided).</p>

      <title>Looks like GPU switching tool optimus-manager isn&#39;t abandoned yet</title>
      <author>nwildner</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As we have previously <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/the-state-of-optimus-manager-explained-by-its-developer/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reported here</a>, optimus-manager, the GPU manager for laptop setups was going silent because the main developer didn't have the time or resources to keep that project running on <a href="https://github.com/Askannz/optimus-manager" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Github</a>. Looks like it's coming back!</p>
<p>After I got notified that a long-standing <a href="https://github.com/Askannz/optimus-manager/issues/471#issuecomment-1315628537" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bug</a> I'm participating in related to PCI ID generation missing the Domain ID on Xorg configuration generation was closed as fixed, I've noticed that a bunch of other stale Pull Requests got merged recently too.</p>
<p>Referring back to the main discussion <a href="https://github.com/Askannz/optimus-manager/issues/543" rel="noopener" target="_blank">thread</a>, "The state of optimus-manager", to my surprise someone nicknamed es20490446e is doing all the hard work to get the software active again and asking people to deliberately tag him on pull requests so he can better handle them because he is not (yet) the owner of the software.</p>
<p>It's nice to have such piece of software back into active state. I've switched back to <a href="https://github.com/bayasdev/envycontrol" rel="noopener" target="_blank">envycontrol</a> recently because of optimus-manager being abandoned and crashing a lot on newer kernels but, since this software is more feature rich and also supports some of my VFIO (GPU pass-through) stuff, I would definitively give it a try again when it gets in a better shape again.</p>

      <title>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita&#39;s Rewind announced for 2024</title>
      <author>Pengling</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The original Power Rangers return to fight a robo-reincarnation of the rotten Rita Repulsa in an all-new retro-style beat-'em-up!</p>
<p>Just announced by Digital Eclipse and Hasbro (under a new imprint called "Hasbro Retro Arcade", perhaps suggesting that we'll be seeing more licensed titles in this vein going forward), the game sees new foe Robo-Rita travel back in time to team up with the original Rita Repulsa, in order to bring back plenty of past monsters in an attempt to rewrite history and prevent the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers from ever existing.</p>
<p>As well as side-scrolling brawler action for up to five players (local or online), which is rendered in a 1990s throwback pixel-art style, there are also into-the-screen shooting and driving segments, along with first-person big boss fist fights played from the perspective of the cockpit of the mighty Megazord, all resembling Super Nintendo Entertainment System Mode 7 effects or Sega Super Scaler arcade titles.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="s7wSPJZPqas"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/25f002e4436229e7eb8a339280d65f73.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/s7wSPJZPqas" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The reveal-trailer hits all the right retro notes, and shows a little bit of what you can expect, with plenty of recognisable elements for fans of the classic TV-show to spot.</p>
<p>The Power Rangers' new outing has only been announced for Windows, but it should be an ideal fit for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> on Linux and the Steam Deck!</p>
<p>From the official description;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In <strong>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind</strong>, the team faces off against a robotic reincarnation of the Power Rangers' long-time nemesis.

      <title>So much for preservation, the classic Delta Force games are getting delisted</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A staffer on GOG <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general/delisting_all_delta_force_titles_available_in_our_store" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mentioned</a> that due to legal reasons, the classic Delta Force series is going to be removed from all storefronts.</p>
<p>Here's what the GOG team said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey all, I don’t know what’s wrong with this week, but I have to post another delisting news.<br/>
<br/>
Just now, we’ve received a request that we have to delist all Delta Force titles that are available in our store, due to legal reasons that are beyond our control. Affected titles are:<br/>
<br/>
Delta Force: <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/delta_force" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.gog.com/game/delta_force</a><br/>
Delta Force 2: <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/delta_force_2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.gog.com/game/delta_force_2</a><br/>
Delta Force: Land Warrior: <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/delta_force_land_warrior" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.gog.com/game/delta_force_land_warrior</a><br/>
Delta Force: Task Force Dagger: <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/delta_force_task_force_dagger" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.gog.com/game/delta_force_task_force_dagger</a><br/>
Delta Force Xtreme: <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/delta_force_xtreme" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.gog.com/game/delta_force_xtreme</a><br/>
Delta Force: Black Hawk Down Platinum Pack: <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/delta_force_black_hawk_down_platinum_pack" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.gog.com/game/delta_force_black_hawk_down_platinum_pack</a><br/>
<br/>
The removals will happen today - June 7th, 1 PM UTC.<br/>
<br/>
They will be removed from all storefronts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14262868241717762369gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Delta Force</em></p>
<p>So you have just under an hour from this post until they're gone if you did want to quickly grab them. Delisting means no one can buy them, but they will <em>not</em> vanish from your own library. The notice from GOG does clearly say "all storefronts" so they will presumably vanish from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?franchise=Delta%20Force" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> too.</p>
<p>A shame, this always makes preserving gaming history far more difficult, but that's not to say they won't return at some point in future. </p>
<p>There is a new game coming called Delta Force: Hawk Ops, which will be a free to play shooter. So it will likely have some form of anti-cheat, which means the likelihood of it working on Linux / Steam Deck is pretty slim.</p>

      <title>Fight the devs of Fishards, if you win - it goes open source! Lose and it&#39;s deleted from Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, that's certainly one way to pull in some eyes isn't it? Fight the developers, get it open source or Fishards will be gone from Steam.</p>
<p>More about it: Combine the intense, skill-shot PVP of Magicka or Battlerite with some wacky 2-legged-fish and you've got yourself Fishards! The unique spell combining mechanic creates a brand new type of PvP​ ​arena​ experience that you have to try with friends!</p>
<p>Posted on the Godot Engine <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/1d85n3z/comment/l73xrqd/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, the developers announced a tournament with a twist:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We released Fishards a few years ago and sadly it wasn't able to support us developers financially, so we stopped development.</p>
<p>However, instead of letting the game fade into obscurity we have now decided to make the game open source...</p>
<p><strong>IF!</strong></p>
<p>...the Fishards community can beat us in a tournament taking place in a few weeks! (June 29 19:00 CET*)</p>
<p>If we developers win however... <strong>We are deleting Fishards from Steam!!</strong> &gt;:)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>* That's 5PM UTC on June 29th.</em></p>

<p>Will you be taking part? Sounds like a fun little marketing stunt.</p>
<p>You can check it out and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1637140/Fishards/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">get some practice in on Steam</a>. Join their <a href="https://discord.gg/e2RTjPUGnz" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Discord</a> to sign up.</p>

      <title>Obsidian gave Pillars of Eternity a big patch - Linux and macOS updates being investigated</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Obsidian Entertainment have gone back and upgraded the original Pillars of Eternity with a big update, although it's currently only for the Windows version.</p>
<p>In the patch notes they said "This update is currently unavailable for OSX &amp; Linux. We are investigating bringing these platforms up to speed as part of a future patch.". So I'll be keeping an eye out for if / when that happens, shame to see updates delayed though. But for those who can't wait it should work fine in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>
<p>They use Unity, which does have both Linux and macOS game export support, so it's likely some kind of middleware is holding up updating those versions.</p>

<p>With the patch they've updated to Unity version 2019.4.11, fixed various navigation issues, fixed a whole a bunch of visual and audio issues, improved sound quests and dialogue, tweaked some combat mechanics, fixed up various UI problems and more.</p>
