      <title>Portal: Revolution drops Native Linux support to focus on Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Second Face Software have announced that their incredibly popular Portal: Revolution mod for Portal 2 has dropped the Native Linux build.</p>
<p>They've had a Native Linux build for a long time, but it became quite problematic and they weren't able to solve the issues players kept encountering. So instead, they're going to ensure it works with Proton where the issues didn't happen.</p>
<p>As they mentioned in their <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/601360/announcements/detail/509587556478748640" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Portal: Revolution, from the start, has included a native Linux build. As some players have recently reported, it was broken because of recent Steam updates. To fix this we have decided to remove the native Linux binaries in favour of Proton. Don't panic.</p>
<p>Our native Linux build sucked. You may have experienced frequent hangs and stutters related to gel rendering or other strange bugs. This stems from a bug in our multithreaded rendering code for gel blobs, and despite our best efforts we were not able to fix it. To make matters worse, it only happens on the native Linux build. Windows and Proton are not affected.</p>
<p>Because of these two reasons we'll ditch the native build and run the game through Proton. Performance should be comparable, if not even better at times and stability is definitely improved. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified with the Native Linux version, so this means it will need to be reviewed again with Proton by Valve, otherwise it will cause problems on Steam Deck. For now, you may need to manually opt into using Proton for it in the properties -&gt; Compatibility menu for the game on Steam to run properly.</p>

<p>In related news, earlier this year they also announced Portal: Revolution 2 is in development, so there's more fun to come for Portal fans.</p>

      <title>Dying Light: The Beast looks absolutely brutal in the new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I really hope Techland learned some lessons from Dying Light 2, as I have high hopes for Dying Light: The Beast. The latest trailer certainly makes it look fun, as short as it is.</p>
<p>Dying Light (the original) is still one of the best open-world zombie games, but Dying Light 2 just wasn't even close to being as good. This time around Techland seem to be putting a lot more effort into the overall body-horror aspect to it, with overhauled gore systems that look like a lot of fun to play with.</p>
<p>Check out the brief teaser trailer on some of it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SyhySFnQpmg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/45652f94b3a3be693485df968dc508b6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SyhySFnQpmg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release: "We’ve overhauled the body damage system," explains Nathan Lemaire, Game Director. "We doubled the number of places on enemies - we call them Gore-Nodes - where players can inflict damage and the number of wounds or injuries that are visible on one single enemy. And we improved the precision of melee attacks - so the angle and trajectory of your strike defines what you hit and how your enemies react to it. So you can target and cut off limbs more precisely than ever!"</p>
<p>To have a realistic representation of gore in Dying Light: The Beast, the art team went to some lengths. "We’ve improved all of the visuals of wounds and injuries and match them with all of the body types. The research was extensive - I just hope no one ever looks up my browser history," says Dominik Wasieńko, Lead Character Artist.</p>

      <title>JetBrains now a Platinum sponsor of Godot Engine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Godot Foundation announced that JetBrains have become a Platinum sponsor of Godot Engine development, helping push this cross-platform open source game engine.</p>
<p>Looking at Godot's sponsorship levels, this means JetBrains will be providing at least €36,000 a year. However, it does not give JetBrains any sway at all. Many companies and groups already help to fund Godot including Scorewarrior, The Khronos Group, W4 Games, Megacrit, Robot Gentleman, Re-Logic, Broken Rules, Chasing Carrots and others.</p>
<p>Currently, the Godot team are receiving €35,992 a month in funding from 1,521 members and 18 sponsors in total.</p>
<p>JetBrains said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At JetBrains, we value the diversity of thought and experience in the software industry, such as the many different programming languages and related ecosystems. We can see that there is ample scope for multiple game engines, especially so for a not-for-profit, open-source game engine. Development happens thanks to the dedication of contributors and paid volunteers, and we welcome the chance to support passionate people making a difference with a successful community project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are you still waiting for Godot? Maybe time to try it out if you're a game developer.</p>

      <title>Hunt: Showdown 1896 broken on Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck due to Easy Anti-Cheat</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here we go again? Hunt: Showdown 1896 is a popular extraction shooter from Crytek that's now broken on Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck due to Easy Anti-Cheat.</p>
<p>Just recently the developers put out a small update with version 2.4.0.2 fixing a couple of bugs, but the side-effect is that the Easy Anti-Cheat system seems to now be either disabled for Linux systems or left broken. Quite frustrating to see, with no announcements from the developer.</p>
<p>I've tested with Proton 9 and Proton Experimental and both just give the same issue, the game will load and then eventually give you an error box like this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6486112621754395490gol1.png"/></p>
<p>There's quite a number of posts on their <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/594650/discussions/8/594030422158053461/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> forum about it, and the bug is already logged on Valve's <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/3898#issuecomment-3149923205" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> for Proton. The game is currently rated Steam Deck Playable / SteamOS Compatible by Valve.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20421985221754395417gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I've reached out to Crytek press to see if they have anything to share, will update if they reply.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated anti-cheat page</a> was updated to reflect the current status. Be sure to keep an eye on it for any changes for this and other games on Linux.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA are working on a &#34;general optimization&#34; for VKD3D / DirectX12 games on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For a while now Linux users with NVIDIA GPUs have been reporting performance issues with DirectX12 titles using VKD3D, but a fix may <em>finally</em> be coming.</p>
<p>A post was opened on the NVIDIA forum all the way back in August 2024, with it building up multiple hundreds of replies over time from different users talking about the performance issues. There's many posts about it elsewhere, and you often find the advice to Linux gamers building systems is to use an AMD GPU, with one of the biggest issues (aside from open source drivers) being the performance difference especially for DirectX12 titles.</p>
<p>Sometime soon, that annoying performance problem might be a thing of the past. On August 5th, NVIDIA developer amrits <a href="https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/directx12-performance-is-terrible-on-linux/303207/432" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">replied</a> to note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi All,<br/>
While looking at Horizon Zero Dawn Linux performance we identified a general optimization that benefits multiple titles with VKD3D. It is still in development. We will give an update when it is available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same NVIDIA developer did post back in <a href="https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/directx12-performance-is-terrible-on-linux/303207/279" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">June</a> to note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I really apologize for not communicating earlier.<br/>
Team is currently investigating performance issues, and we do have identified the root cause for Horizon Zero Dawn and are working on a fix.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So no time-frame and no other information, just that something is actually properly in progress and it will now benefit multiple titles.</p>
<p>Really hope to see it arrive soon!</p>

      <title>openSUSE Leap 16.0 will need Steam gamers to install some extras due to no 32-bit</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>openSUSE Leap 16.0 has entered the Release Candidate phase, and for anyone gaming on Steam with openSUSE Leap you'll need some tweaks. openSUSE doesn't actually register in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/steam-survey-for-july-2025-shows-linux-approaching-3/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's data for the top Linux distributions used</a>, but still some might be interested to know about this.</p>
<p>In the RC <a href="https://news.opensuse.org/2025/08/04/leap-16-rc/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release announcement</a>, there's this bit noted for Steam users:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="steam-wine-32-bit-support"><strong>Steam, Wine, 32-bit support</strong></p>
<p>SUSE Linux Enterprise 16.0 does not support 32-bit binary execution.<br/>
Leap users can install <code class="inline-code">grub2-compat-ia32</code>, which enables it by passing <code class="inline-code">ia32_emulation=1</code> to the kernel.<br/>
We’ve recently dropped Steam from the <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Package_repositories#Non-OSS" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Non-OSS repository</a> due to a limited set of 32-bit libraries.<br/>
Steam users will want to install <code class="inline-code">selinux-policy-targeted-gaming</code>, which is not installed by default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We all saw <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/fedora-proposal-to-drop-32-bit-support-has-been-withdrawn/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">what happened with Fedora</a> when a proposal was put to drop 32-bit didn't we? Sounds like another messy situation. <em>I wonder how much backlash this will end up causing for the openSUSE Leap developers.</em></p>
<p>To me, all this says is that openSUSE Leap 16.0 is not going to be a good pick for gaming on Linux. And that's fine, not every Linux distribution out there needs to focus on every possible use case, but this will cause friction for people. Then again, if you're using something like openSUSE Leap, you're probably a seasoned Linux user.</p>

      <title>Oblivion remade in the Skyrim engine, Skyblivion is on the final stretch to release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Skyblivion is a remake of Oblivion in the Skyrim engine, something that has been exciting RPG fans for a while and it's finally coming soon.</p>
<p>More about it from the developers of the mod: "Skyblivion is the ultimate fan-made experience for the Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, bringing the game into the newer engine of the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition. This process combines Oblivion’s impressive award-winning open-world that is renowned for its incredible gameplay, memorable quests, and expansive world space with the advancements in gaming that have been made in the last two decades. Set in the Elder Scroll’s Third Era, during the cataclysmic Oblivion Crisis, you must help to restore the Imperial throne and repel the demonic Daedric invasion."</p>
<p>The developers put up a sixth development diary video going over the progress on August 3rd, the first update since the release of the official Oblivion Remastered. Clearly, this hasn't deterred them for pushing forward on Skyblivion. Answering the question on "what's the point of it now?", in the video they mention how Skyblivion is actually a "full-scale remake that re-imagines Oblivion from the ground up, bringing it in line with modern RPG standards".</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Features planned for it include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The entirety of the Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion’s world space lovingly remade and updated for a new generation of gamers and long-time fans alike.</li>
<li>Classic systems and features such as spell crafting, class and attributes, underwater combat, lockpicking, and NPC disposition implemented into the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition’s engine.</li>
<li>Reimagined and improved cities, homes, caves, dungeons, and forts across Cyrodiil with new and improved layouts and encounters.</li>
<li>Over 223 quests reintegrate for play throughout Cyrodiil.</li>

<li>A collection of beautifully crafted assets and textures for use in the Creation Kit.</li>
<li>7 new region-specific pieces of soundtrack to complement Oblivion’s original soundtrack.</li>
<li>New creatures and monsters implemented into Oblivion featuring lore-friendly additions from other Elder Scrolls entries.</li>
<li>A highly detailed paper map in line with Oblivion’s original map screen paired with a new inventory visual system to match the original game’s aesthetic.</li>
<li>A gorgeous collection of new loading screens, class cards, and attribute art to complement the game’s improved visuals throughout your gameplay.</li>

      <title>Keep a close eye on your kingdom in The King is Watching</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The King is Watching from Hypnohead and tinyBuild is a unique micro-management roguelite kingdom builder that will suck you right in. <em>Note: a key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>It's a strange blend of kingdom building micro-management for the resources and production, along with real-time auto-battle when it comes to the action. You place down building tiles in a small area, and move around your gaze to make the tiles actually activate and run their production. Your gaze tile range is limited, so it's a game of constant micro where you're always watching your resources to build them up, and then move your gaze around again to build up something else. Impressively clever, and very different to other such games and due to this your full attention will be completely absorbed by it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19824855411754390365gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19824855411754390365gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You know, it actually reminded me a little of Tetris in the way you're arranging the kingdom tiles and your gaze together. At least initially that is. It's obviously nothing like it, but I couldn't help but feel that when starting off in it. It's all about making perfect use of the space you've got to maximise your resource income with your limited area of gaze. Getting the tiles in the right place is one of the most difficult things about it, and can easily make you lose if you're not prepared enough. Thankfully, you can move tiles at any time, they just suffer a temporary production penalty for being moved.</p>
<p>While it's an RTS (real time strategy) game, it's more like real time <em>staring</em>. You don't directly interact with your troops, only the kingdom tiles although you do get to interact in certain other ways like spells. Some of the spells will truly save your kingdom too, I <em>completely</em> screwed up on one run and entirely ran out of Wheat so I couldn't produce any troops, but I did have a Tornado spell that mopped the floor with the enemies and saved my kingdom.</p>
<p>Everything is about your watchful eye, like some sort of Eye of Sauron – only you're just a <em>little</em> bit nicer. You can also pause at any time, which you'll end up making great use of to plan ahead a little on your resources.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cjpJH8nYHaY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/73ab9760c962a6dfb9ecd06bcb9fc616.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cjpJH8nYHaY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For the kingdom building, you only get a limited selection of tiles to begin with. To get more, you need to progress through the battles to get them as rewards. Which is interesting on how it works with other systems in the game, like prophecies that let you tweak what enemy waves you'll end up getting, so you can choose to fight tougher enemies for better rewards including better buildings, more money, new spells and so on. But there's also a trader where you can spend some of your built-up cash for buildings, resources and other assorted upgrades.</p>
<p>Quite a few ways to enhance your runs to with meta-progression taken from roguelikes. There's a currency you acquire to unlock special buildings to interact with before you start a run, where you can go through upgrades, there's different kings to unlock and each have their own unique buffs and abilities to unlock and more.</p>
<p>What's the actual goal here? To progress through and survive as many waves as possible, to defeat the bosses that come along. You always know what's coming though, thanks to the timeline bar along the top of the screen that tells you exactly what you'll be facing. Easier said than done though and total efficiency is key here. It's a constant tug of war between ensuring you have enough resources (and the correct resources) to build up your army, as you click around your gaze constantly across your little kingdom to tweak your production.</p>
<p>The only problem with it is that there's currently no mid-run save feature, which feels like an absolutely <em>crazy</em> thing to miss, especially in a strategy game like this. Thankfully, the developers have confirmed it's on the way and the update with it is currently in Beta. Once that's actually released for everyone, it will then get a true double thumbs up from me. Still, it's good without it, but will be actually <em>great</em> with it.</p>

<p>The King is Watching is a complete time sink in all of the best ways with a very satisfying gameplay loop, and it's a surprising challenge to be able to beat it. With the game tested on Kubuntu Linux 25.04 it runs perfectly out of the box with Proton 9.0-4.</p>
<p>From the press release: "We’ve had amazing support from fans and the community throughout this journey, and we’re beyond thrilled to share The King is Watching with the world," said Semyon Itmaniuk, Head of the Hypnohead Studio. "Embrace the monarchy, and craft a kingdom from the ground up into the most fearsome of them all. Huzzah!"</p>

      <title>Physics-based brawler Stick It to the Stickman from Free Lives arrives August 18</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Free Lives, developers of Broforce and Terra Nil, have confirmed their next game Stick It to the Stickman is set to arrive on August 18th. It will enter Early Access first, with a full release due in approximately 12 months.</p>
<p>What is it? Stick it to the Stickman is a physics-based brawler where you fight minimum wage stickmen to become a CEO. Choose from hundreds of unique moves to construct the perfect combat machine, then battle your way to the top of the corporate ladder. The developers say you will "Fight other CEOs for the prestige of employing the CEO with the biggest muscles. Perform dubiously legal tasks critical to expanding the company, including stealing cars, suppressing protestors and kidnapping building inspectors—all in the name of profit".</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>

<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Wild physics-based stickman combat featuring a vast array of brutal weapons and over-the-top special moves, including fireballs, chainsaws and katanas.</li>
<li>Combines multiple gameplay styles including platforming, brawling, autobattling, delivery, car theft, free-running and kicking people out of windows.</li>
<li>Play solo or with a ‘friend’ and defeat hordes of red stickmen to secure your promotion. But be warned: everybody else wants the job too.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems it will have Native Linux support again too as it was just added as "TBC" on Steam. If not, there's always Proton.</p>

      <title>A Portal dating sim? Yep. Aperture Dating Simulator is set to release on August 28</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sometimes I think I've seen it all, and then along comes a Portal dating sim with Aperture Dating Simulator.</p>
<p>Created by Ashleyanna Rivers, this fully-voiced dating sim is set in Valve's popular Portal universe, but not the same one you know and love. And clearly Valve approve of it, since they're letting it release on Steam. The dev says it's not "your average fan-made Portal game" in an alternate universe that will show you a new Aperture.</p>
<p>You take control of a manufacturing employee thrust out of their element and into maintenance, where you'll meet 8 brand-new personality cores, each with their own special little quirks. There's 18 possible endings to find and over 30 cut-scenes with "a lot this little dating sim parody has to offer" (or so they hope).</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

      <title>Check out the demo for Cult of PiN, a pinball roguelike</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cult of PiN has a seriously cool style that merges pinball with roguelikes, and now you can try it out early.</p>
<p>There's a Windows demo you can run via Proton for now on Steam, or play right in the browser on their itch.io page. The developer mentioned Linux and macOS versions are planned too. This is easily one of the absolute coolest takes on mixing up classic pinball into something new.</p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cult of PiN is a roguelike Pinball game requiring sharp reflexes and strategic combos. Collect powerful Glyphs to enhance your damage, and smash your way through as many stages as you can to claim a place on the global leaderboard.</p>
<p>Master the cradled ramp shot, hit hard-to-reach mission targets, and purchase run-altering mystical Glyphs to beat each table stage, destroying all the bumpers to move onto the next one. Discover hidden bonus tables and unlock new Balls and Glyphs for future runs. Perfect your nudge and trick shot skills to reach Act VI on each table to claim victory. After that, continue playing in endless mode to secure your spot on the leaderboards for each table.</p>

      <title>The Drifter is easily my new favourite point and click adventure</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Drifter from Powerhoof has released, and it is something truly special for the point and click adventure genre that's one not to be missed. <em>Note: a key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>I've long been a fan of the point and click genre, growing up playing some classics on the Amiga. I've also played a lot of modern takes on it, but I never quite get the feeling I did from back then. Until now, that is. The Drifter is truly exceptional and just does about everything right to hook you in. Not only does it have some seriously great pixel art, but the voice acting is truly amazing too.</p>
<p>My favourite thing though? The interface. While I'm sure there's some that will get their pitchforks out to stick me with on this, I played it with a gamepad. I know — sacrilege right? But wait! The Drifter was designed for both sides of the fence. The gamepad interface they designed is impressively easy to use and feels so natural that it made sitting back and relaxing with it just a wonderful experience.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2GiHlkE2z8g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3b55ef55113b5e157d6aab5659d6434e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2GiHlkE2z8g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the first few minutes, it will totally absorb you into the world, especially so thanks to the intro. You have absolutely no idea what's going on, but you really will want to know more. You will need to know more. What was that crazy guy on about? Was he actually just crazy or is there something bigger going on? Why were people firing at you and who are they? So many questions will start popping into your head. It certainly sets the scene nicely for the adventure you're about to go through. And that only continues the more you go into it, as things just start getting plain weird like out of some Netflix sci-fi drama, especially with the loops around death.</p>
<p>The voice acting is what really pulls you in though, mainly thanks to the main character Mick voiced by Adrian Vaughan (but they're all good). There's some great dialogue in there and Vaughan really helps to sell it all, especially with some of the complete silliness that goes on. I'm a bit of a sucker for a deep, gruff but soothing voice. I especially liked the way the conversations flow, with it jumping between characters talking and getting little bits of backstory from Vaughan narrating things and even with the flicking between talking and narrating it all feels so smooth.</p>
<p>It's not just the voice acting though, the soundtrack is brilliant too. Really brings out the atmosphere.</p>
<p>If you're after an adventure that will make you scratch your brain with puzzles, this is not the one, the puzzles here are interesting but more like set-pieces to stop it being a constant run through the story. Most of it is pretty obvious, which is not a bad thing, the puzzles are gentle on your brain to make you feel like you're actually doing something. However, the design is interesting with the puzzles often being done across multiple scenes with you needing various items, often combining them together. The result is some fun item hunting and silly events involving the items you're using.</p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A Pulp Adventure Thriller from the minds that brought you Peridium and Crawl.</li>
<li>An engrossing roller-coaster of a story- Drawing on King, Crichton and Carpenter, with a dash of 70s Aussie grindhouse.</li>
<li>Point 'n Click or Controller- Unique twin-stick controls make The Drifter as comfy to play on the couch as at your PC.</li>
<li>Bursting with raw crunchy pixel art and high-impact animation.</li>
<li>Professionally voice acted, with a brooding dark-synth cinematic score.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>All together from the animations to the voice acting and the slick gamepad interface you owe it to yourself to play this one. Seriously impressive, a double thumbs up from me. Do not skip it. It's going to be hard to enjoy another point and click adventure if it's not up to the quality of The Drifter in future.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support and runs great out of the box. Also Steam Deck Verified. No performance issues or special bugs worth noting.</p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher v2.18.1 brings more bug fixes for GOG and Epic Games on Linux / SteamOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Heroic is one of the best ways to run games from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-play-games-from-gog-and-epic-games-on-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Epic Games, GOG and Amazon on Linux, SteamOS / Steam Deck</a>. v2.18.1 brings bug fixes to make it even smoother.</p>
<p>It's a <em>hotfix</em>, so it's mainly to clear up problems from the last major release. One change they've actually <em>reverted</em> for this release was quite controversial, where Heroic was hiding various versions of Proton by default (except GE-Proton). Now, it only hides Proton Experimental and is an opt-in feature. Part of their reasoning was to keep it simple for users, with GE-Proton using a special set of proton fixes to make games outside of Steam work well. Turns out it caused issues though. More can be read about it in the original <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/pull/4254" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub post</a> and comments.</p>
<p>Additionally they mentioned they've "fixed the Environmental variables table and added a few couple of settings for using WoW64 on Linux and several other fixes and improvements".</p>

      <title>x86 on ARM64 emulator FEX gets some huge gaming improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>FEX is one way to run x86 appps and games on ARM64, with the latest release 2508 bringing some pretty striking performance improvements.</p>
<p>Writing in a <a href="https://fex-emu.com/FEX-2508/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> about "Big juicy JIT optimizations", they showed off two charts of the performance difference versus the previous release and in some cases for gaming it's a huge win. Like with Cyberpunk 2077 seeing a 38.9% improvement which is massive.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7428137801754321418gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7428137801754321418gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14722959531754321417gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14722959531754321417gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Explaining some of the improvements the developers said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"></p>
<p>The majority of this performance uplift has come from call-return stack optimizations, where we are now able to take advantage of the ARM CPU’s own call-return prediction hardware, but we have had a variety of optimizations this month that improve both JIT compilation time in addition to execution time! Additionally now we compile significantly less code since we would have combinatorial explosion of JIT compiles when multiblock was enabled. We have now made it so each individual block of JIT code is freestanding and usually only gets compiled once.</p>
<p>Another improvement this month is the WINE wow64/arm64ec libraries can now take advantage of Apple Silicon’s hardware TSO feature. This happened to not be implemented with the wow64/arm64ec code path. This will significantly improve performance on that hardware in the case that someone spent the effort to run a game in that environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More work also went into supporting anti-tamper tech, with some versions of Denuvo potentially now working too but more work is to be done on that.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA Beta driver 580.65.06 released for Linux with bug fixes and expanded Wayland support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA have released the first Beta for the 580 driver series, with NVIDIA Beta driver 580.65.06 bringing mostly bug fixes. There's also an additional bit of Wayland protocol support included.</p>
<p>Since this is a Beta driver, it's not recommended just yet for everyday use. You'll want to be quite up to date though, with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/nvidia-reveal-more-gpu-driver-security-issues-for-july-2025/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NVIDIA recently revealing more security issues</a> in their drivers.</p>
<p>Highlights from the driver:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause Vulkan applications to hang when destroying swapchains after a lost device event.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could allow atomic commit and other DRM operations to return success status despite having failed due to handling an interrupt: <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/issues/832" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/issues/832</a></li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause GTK 4 applications to crash when using the Vulkan backend on Wayland.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could intermittently cause llama.cpp to crash on exit when using the Vulkan backend: <a href="https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/10528" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/10528</a></li>
<li>Added support for the fifo-v1 Wayland protocol on Vulkan.</li>
<li>Updated GPU clock value reporting in nvidia-settings, NVML, and nvidia-smi to show clocks before thermal and idle slowdowns for better consistency with the equivalent functionality on Windows.</li>
<li>Fixed compatibility with Bigscreen Beyond Head Mounted Displays.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could result in a black screen when setting specific modes on HDMI displays.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused blank or frozen screens under the following conditions: nvidia-drm is loaded with the modeset=1 and fbdev=1 parameters, using a Maxwell or Pascal series GPU, and more than one display device of differing resolutions are connected.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused nvidia-suspend.service to fail when available system memory is low.</li>
<li>Enabled RMIntrLockingMode by default. This feature can help reduce stutter especially when using virtual reality. This feature was originally introduced in the r570 series. It can be disabled by loading nvidia.ko with the `NVreg_RegistryDwords=RMIntrLockingMode=0` kernel module parameter.</li>
<li>Implemented another feature that can reduce time spent in the interrupt top half for low latency display interrupts by deferring the work until later. This feature is experimental and disabled by default. This feature can be enabled by loading nvidia.ko with the `NVreg_RegistryDwords=RmEnableAggressiveVblank=1` kernel module parameter.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause blank rendering on some single-buffered GLX applications when running on Xwayland.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause a kernel use-after-free on pre-Turing GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause OpenGL applications and compositors to stall when using NVIDIA as a PRIME Display Offload sink ("Reverse PRIME"), potentially resulting in a black screen.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that led to increasing memory usage in X11 OpenGL and Vulkan applications after suspend/resume cycles.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause 32-bit x86 applications running on recent builds of glibc to crash on dlopen().</li>
</ul>

      <title>Frostliner announced recently is basically Snowpiercer as a survival city-builder</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Okay, now this is cool. Frostliner puts you in charge of a train in this survival city builder on rails that's practically Snowpiercer. <em>I also only just realised today that Snowpiercer's final Season 4 did actually release…last year. </em></p>
<p>This blends a lot of gameplay elements together that seems quite unique. Your city is constantly moving, with combat elements that has a sort-of tower defense style to it. There's also an events system where all sorts of things can happen, and of course lots can go wrong. The developer said they're hoping to run a playtest later this year to get some feedback.</p>
<p>Check out the first trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5yLJ37k6wQo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/444afc35795e2db761f6a3db911683ed.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5yLJ37k6wQo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Construct a massive train called the Frostliner, which is capable of creating its own train carriages which can then be filled with facilities, and utilise adjacency bonuses which make the train more productive the larger it is.</li>
<li>Roam the frozen landscape, frequently stopping to gather much needed supplies, clear debris and recruit new passengers. However, once the train stops the player is on a timer as their reserved batteries powering the trains heaters quickly drain.</li>
<li>The train runs on fuel and the player must do whatever they can to keep it fueled and running.</li>
<li>Research new technologies, facilities and improvements such as the corpse furnace which allows passengers to be “converted” into the much needed fuel that the engine needs. Unlock new tiers of passengers with much greater demands, but more powerful bonuses and facilities.</li>
<li>The train is a treasure trove for the survivors and entities in the wasteland and they will do what they can to take the train. Any of these enemies you don’t manage to destroy will become pursuers, following behind your train until you are inevitably forced to stop. Increase the trains speed to stay one step ahead, or invest in defences to eradicate the threats before they become a problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>Right to the top of my wishlist you go.</p>

      <title>Click through the joy of opening up mystery boxes in Unboxathon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you love your chilled casual clicker games, Unboxathon could be a good one for you with a demo available to try.</p>
<p>What is it? A sweet content-filled game about opening up mysterious boxes. You have no idea what you're going to find. It's a clicker / incremental game, so it's all about collecting things to keep on upgrading to get more shiny new things. Only this one is about opening up boxes. In the demo you get access to 2 out of the 6 unlockable boxes, and 10% of the tech tree unlocks compared to the full version.</p>
<p>Check out their teaser trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="u-lOd6tW2Qo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/76e77eea789f1959070b26811f6a09b2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/u-lOd6tW2Qo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pop ‘Til You Drop: </strong>Pop all manner of bubbles, big, small and with different gameplay effects and bonuses to earn additional mystery boxes.</li>
<li><strong>Literal Boxes Full of Loot: </strong>Open up boxes of different rarities, including “Magical Relics” or “Luxury Goods” to get increasingly valuable loot and shiny, collectible items.</li>
<li><strong>Upgrade, Upgrade, Upgrade: </strong>Sell those items for profit and use those earnings to unlock incremental upgrades affecting your bubble bonuses, special bubbles, box quality, and more.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The demo worked perfectly with Proton 9.</p>

      <title>Dice A Million channels Balatro vibes into game-breaking dice rolling</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a fresh demo released, Dice A Million looks like it will grab a lot of my time in future. It gives off Balatro vibes for the design, as you roll dice and attempt to break the game with all sorts of combinations to watch numbers go up. <em>Delicious.</em></p>
<p>So what exactly is it? As the developer said: "Dice A Million is a roguelike deckbuilder about rolling dice to try and get to a million points. Combine the effects of more than 100 different dice and discover powerful synergies. Get through ever-increasing debts and fearsome bosses that will require a perfect symbiosis in your deck in order to be beaten."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mmJnr785cFk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/155e433ba5dd6fd893ca511bda9f25e3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mmJnr785cFk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Randomly generated runs, roguelike style!</li>
<li>More than 100 dice with unique effects.</li>
<li>More than 50 rings with passive effects to completement your build.</li>
<li>6 different enchantments that could drastically modify the behaviour of your dice.</li>
<li>Many different hands (classes) to choose from.</li>
<li>Hundreds of unlocks and secret achievements.</li>
<li>20 one-time use cards to help you fight RNG.</li>
<li>Millions of points.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer also announced they're working with 2 Left Thumbs to help with publishing. It's due out sometime later this year and should run fine with Proton.</p>

      <title>Gyro through a collection of handcrafted mazes in the Steam Deck exclusive Game With Balls</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The second game from Geert Verhoeff that's only meant to be played on a Steam Deck is Game With Balls, a collection of handcrafted mazes to gyro through. A demo is available for the game right now to get a taste of it.</p>
<p>Check out their teaser below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7svS7yqUZ2o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7b81995aefbc6ad34248a8e14b258650.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7svS7yqUZ2o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Game With Balls! A little collection of handcrafted mazes for the Steam Deck, where you use gyro movement to navigate one of the balls through them. Are you the one with the best time among your friends—or even in the world?!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Over 40 levels handcrafted in the real world using real wood, drawings, and other materials, then converted for your digital pleasure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An additional 10 challenges that not only test you on the time it takes to complete each level but also on other objectives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keeps track of your fastest times using Steam Leaderboards, so you can see if you’re the quickest among your friends—or the fastest in the world!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collect all secrets in every level to not only be the fastest but also the ultimate completist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Original soundtrack to relax to (or maybe not when you’re trying to beat your friends’ times).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting to see, although probably only a small market for such a thing. Previously they released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943100/Better_With_A_Friend/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Better With A Friend</a>, collection of hand drawn mini-games for the Steam Deck which only has 10 user reviews on Steam.</p>

      <title>Queer Games Bundle 2025 is live on itch.io</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>At a time where supporting creators of anything that might be deemed adult content or NSFW is more important than ever, the Queer Games Bundle 2025 is live.</p>
<p>With all the payment processor issues ongoing <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/mastercard-release-a-statement-about-game-stores-payment-processors-and-adult-content/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">across Steam, itch.io</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/zoom-platform-also-had-payment-processor-issues-say-they-have-no-plans-to-remove-any-titles/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ZOOM Platform</a> - it's only a matter of time until the target for having games removing is expanded to include queer-focused games too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16754351881754302323gol1.png"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the bundle page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we had the budget of an AAA game, we could give every solo developer in this bundle a livable wage multiple times over for a year and every single team a massive funding boost. Imagine what the developers and artists in this bundle could create a year from now if they weren’t worried about starving or how to pay their rent this month. </p>
<p>Purchasing the Queer Games Bundle is a direct action that you can take right now to support queer people in a life-changing way, and in exchange, you get over 600 amazing, heartfelt, fun, and radical games and artworks.  In a chaotic, grim time with new attacks daily on queer and especially trans people, queer art is something that does more than simply keep you alive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">There's two options to purchase:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://itch.io/b/3062/queer-games-bundle-2025-with-10-option" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The full $60 option for those than can afford it</a></li>
<li><a href="https://itch.io/b/3063/queer-games-bundle-2025-pay-what-you-can-edition" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">A cheaper $10 pay what you can option </a></li>

      <title>ZOOM Platform also had payment processor issues, say they &#34;have no plans to remove any titles&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ZOOM Platform that sell a lot of retro games, as well as publish upgrades for retro games, announced they've also been a target of payment processors for adult games.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.zoom-platform.com/news/preserving-and-protecting-artistic-freedom" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As you are likely aware, there have been a number of adult title de-listings across the industry. One of our payment processors made us aware that a "fellow member of the industry" was concerned about our content. After we heard from the payment processor, we immediately engaged in lengthy discussions with both PayPal and Stripe. We worked with our contacts at the aforementioned payment processors to develop a tripartite solution to ensure the right to free speech and freedom of expression as well as protect the safety of our valued customers and partners.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They've now added opt-in two-factor authentication, they're looking at alternative payment options and also a wallet system. While also saying they have "no plans" to remove any titles and will "do absolutely everything in our power to prevent such de-listings".</p>
<p>In an email to GamingOnLinux, one of their team said they expect the de-listing situation to expand further and in their discussions titles like "Grand Theft Auto, Duke Nukem, and Saints Row were described as potentially at risk".</p>
<p>As we already expected, NSFW games being a target was only ever going to be a first step. <em>There's always more to it.</em></p>

      <title>Heroes of Might and Magic 2 project fheroes2 version 1.1.10 has been released</title>
      <author>fheroes2</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dear players of Heroes of Might and Magic 2! Today we are happy to announce a new version of the <strong><strong>fheroes2</strong></strong> game engine - <strong><strong>1.1.10</strong></strong> (<a href="https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2/releases/tag/1.1.10" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2/releases/tag/1.1.10</a>)! This update brings several art enhancements, Editor fixes, and more!</p>
<p>This release includes multiple improvements to the <strong><strong>Editor</strong></strong>. First, the team fixed several crashes related to reaching the object placement limit. We also resolved a few passability and rendering issues. Lastly, the Castle’s options window now supports cancelling all changes made there.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10535542011754301309gol1.png"/></p>
<p>The team reworked several in-game dialogs, updated <strong><strong>buttons</strong></strong> for various languages, made buttons resizable in many cases, and fixed font inconsistencies. We also added sorting for save files by name or date, and introduced an icon for the <strong><strong>Virtual Keyboard</strong></strong> button.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19572054401754301331gol1.png"/></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21197202721754301351gol1.png"/></p>
<p>This release features numerous art updates. The <strong><strong>Magic Book</strong></strong> now shows a visual indicator when no pages are available. We fixed white pixels in the <strong><strong>Sorceress castle sky and rainbow</strong></strong>, and added missing bay artwork for the <strong><strong>Wizard castle</strong></strong>. Additionally, we improved the <strong><strong>Swordsman's walking animation</strong></strong> by adding a new frame.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8664132941754301381gol1.png"/><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12623044641754301382gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Alongside these changes, the team updated translations for several languages, resolved more issues on the Adventure Map, and closed over <em><em>40 issues</em></em> since the last release. As a nice bonus, we have included a new community-made map in the fheroes2 bundle: <strong><strong>Good, Bad, Magne</strong></strong>, and we updated the Eruption map in the bundle.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy the updated version of the engine. Thank you so much for supporting the project!</p>
<p>Don't forget, that you also need to grab the data from <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_2_gold_edition" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG.com</a> which it requires to run.</p>

      <title>Steam Survey for July 2025 shows Linux approaching 3%</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released the data for the Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey for July 2025, showing the Linux user share making gains towards hitting 3%.</p>
<p>We continue to see the slow but steady increase in the overall Linux user share on the desktop, good news for the health of the platform as more people realise just how good Linux is now.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's the current operating system share on Steam for July 2025:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 95.23% -0.44%</li>
<li>Linux 2.89% +0.32% </li>
<li>macOS 1.88% +0.12%</li>
</ul>
<p>If you take a look at our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated Steam Tracker page</a> for the charts, we can see that steady increase.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15167707281754127729gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15167707281754127729gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Plus the breakdown of Linux distributions that were popular across July 2025 on Steam. This is possibly the most expansive list Valve has given for the distribution breakdown yet.</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 28.31% -2.73%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 10.82% +0.33%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 22.1 64 bit 7.83% -0.07%</li>

      <title>Mastercard release a statement about game stores, payment processors and adult content</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 23:36 BST</strong> - Valve provided a statement to GamingOnLinux in response:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Mastercard did not communicate with Valve directly, despite our request to do so. Mastercard communicated with payment processors and their acquiring banks. Payment processors communicated this with Valve, and we replied by outlining Steam’s policy since 2018 of attempting to distribute games that are legal for distribution. Payment processors rejected this, and specifically cited Mastercard’s Rule 5.12.7 and risk to the Mastercard brand. See <a href="https://www.mastercard.us/content/dam/public/mastercardcom/na/global-site/documents/mastercard-rules.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.mastercard.us/content/dam/public/mastercardcom/na/global-site/documents/mastercard-rules.pdf</a>.</div>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below…</em></p>
<p>Mastercard have today released a short statement to clarify their position on adult content across game stores.</p>
<p>To bring up to speed on the recent situation — <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/valve-gets-pressured-by-payment-processors-with-a-new-rule-for-game-devs-and-various-adult-games-removed/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on July 16th I reported on Valve removing certain adult content</a> from the Steam store (with a statement from Valve). Later in July, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/game-store-itch-io-has-deindexed-adult-content-due-to-payment-processor-scrutiny/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">itch.io ended up deindexing adult content</a> noting the same pressure from payment processors, with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/itch-io-to-reindex-free-adult-content-as-they-search-for-new-payment-processors/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">itch.io now going through to reindex free adult content</a>.</p>
<p>The pressure on payment providers has come from <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/media-release-payment-gateways" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Collective Shout</a>, that claim they're a "grassroots movement challenging the objectification of women and sexualisation of girls in media, advertising and popular culture".</p>
<p>It wasn't entirely clear exactly which payment processors have been putting the pressure on game stores, with Mastercard now putting out a <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/us/en/news-and-trends/press/2025/august/clarifying-recent-headlines-on-gaming-content.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a> that I've copied below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mastercard has not evaluated any game or required restrictions of any activity on game creator sites and platforms, contrary to media reports and allegations.</p>
<p>Our payment network follows standards based on the rule of law. Put simply, we allow all lawful purchases on our network. At the same time, we require merchants to have appropriate controls to ensure Mastercard cards cannot be used for unlawful purchases, including illegal adult content.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>So this seems like Mastercard are basically saying "it's not us".</em></p>

      <title>itch.io to reindex free adult content as they search for new payment processors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The ongoing saga of payment processors pushing game stores continues, with <a href="http://itch.io" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">itch.io</a> now reindexing free adult content but some issues remain. Previously, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/game-store-itch-io-has-deindexed-adult-content-due-to-payment-processor-scrutiny/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">itch.io announced they were forced</a> to deindex (remove from search results) adult content due to pressure from their payment providers.</p>
<p>In a post on the <a href="https://itch.io/t/5149036/reindexing-adult-nsfw-content" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">itch.io forum</a>, founder Leaf Corcoran noted that discussions with payment processors is ongoing. Paid adult content will be re-introduced much slower "to ensure we can confidently support the widest range of creators in the long term". The itch store is also now getting a new content warning system for pages tagged as "NSFW" (not safe for work).</p>
<p>One payment processor mentioned by Corcoran is Stripe, which itch.io has used for over 10 years. They spoke with Stripe, who mentioned they are not able to support "content designed for sexual gratification" and Stripe provided a further message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stripe is currently unable to support sexually explicit content due to restrictions placed on them by their banking partners, despite card networks generally supporting adult content (with the appropriate registrations). Stripe has indicated that they hope to be able to support adult content in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Corcoran confirmed itch.io are looking at other payment partners for payment Stripe cannot process.</p>

      <title>Valve finally upgraded the Steam trailer video player, re-encoding around 400,000 videos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Steam trailer video player was old and not especially great, but now perhaps it might actually work a lot better with a big upgrade.</p>
<p>It brings an upgraded interface with a UI that adapts to different devices, preview images when seeking through a video, faster seeking / scrubbing and transitioning to full screen, smarter bandwith use and improved handling of different aspect ratios. You can see Valve's example video below of it in action for PEAK:</p>
<div class="ckeditor-html5-video" style="text-align: center;">
<video controls="controls" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14205840121754053334gol1.webm"></video>
</div>
<p>As part of the upgrade, Valve said they had to go back through and re-encode every trailer that could be shown, which they said ended up "being around 400,000 video files". Whew, that's a lot huh? Some videos might be quite a low resolution though, due to being uploaded years ago where Valve don't have the original.</p>
<p>Valve suggest developers that uploaded trailer prior to Summer 2020 may want to re-upload, so it can be sorted into the correct format and give Steam users a better quality version.</p>
<p>At the same time Valve are reminding developers that they may want to hide old trailers, and ensure they actually show gameplay — get to the gameplay as quickly as possible.</p>

      <title>Tycoon strategy game Car Park Capital gets a new trailer and publisher announcement</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Car Park Capital is an absolutely genius idea for a tycoon building sim, getting you to build up the greatest car parks ever.</p>
<p>What is it? A new but old-school styled tycoon game where you turn walkable towns into parking lots and use propaganda to convince people to pay you for it. It's your job to convince the citizens of various towns that they <em>need</em> them, and then make them rather large and silly while making a tidy profit of course.</p>
<p>I showed this off on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/build-the-greatest-car-parks-ever-in-the-retro-tycoon-styled-car-park-capital/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux back in June 2024</a>, and it's coming along nicely. It's doing so well they've pulled in a publisher with MicroProse Software which seems thoroughly fitting, considering it's inspired some of their classics. Check out the brand new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Ae3MtHDfSr4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2141affd4d23f69c3da8a89a237792d1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Ae3MtHDfSr4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer mentioned they've now left their day job to work full time on it with MicroProse handling marketing, localization, funding and more.</p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Real-time simulation with hundreds of vehicles and (bald) citizens, all bustling around your growing parking empire.</li>
<li>Build the dream: Demolish homes, buy land, and design massive parking lots, flat or vertical, with 3D construction tools.</li>
<li>Mind-reading tech: Tap into any citizen’s thoughts. Are they buying in? Or just angry about your oil rig next to their child’s school?</li>
<li>Propaganda tools: Convert skeptics into carbrains with megaphone slogans, billboard campaigns, and majestic car-themed statues.</li>
<li>Appease the people: When traffic hits critical mass, distract them with your glorious Ferris Wheel for cars.</li>
<li>Anti-car resistance: Outsmart protesters before they tank your approval ratings.</li>
<li>Stat-o-matic: Track every number a proper tycoon craves. Higher fees? Bigger oil consumption? That’s progress!</li>
<li>Drill, baby, drill: Because a full tank is a full heart.</li>
<li>Fight public transport: Who needs trains and walkability when every inch of the map can be asphalt?</li>
<li>Moddable: Tinker under the hood with Lua support for content and script modifications.</li>
</ul>

      <title>The new Nexus Mods app adds collections creation, library searching and more improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Work continues to expand the cross-platform open source Nexus Mods app, which will eventually replace Vortex with v0.14.3 out now with new features.</p>
<p>This latest release should make working with modding bigger games easier, as they've added in the ability to create collections. Enabling you to enable / disabled a set quickly. Sounds like a really great feature for quickly changing your games with various downloaded mods.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9243383701754051812gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9243383701754051812gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>And, one of the most requested features is also finally here. You can search your installed mods via the Library, and other sections will be coming "in a future release".</p>
<p>The rest of the info from the GitHub:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>More Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The app will now load the latest game version data every 30 minutes in the background.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technical Changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added validation to app settings to prevent bad values from being saved.</li>
<li>Collection metadata will now refresh each time the page is loaded in the app.</li>
<li>Improve error reporting for the Nexus Mods API requests.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug which prevented the app from properly recognising GOG DLCs.</li>
<li>Fixed an exception that would often appear when viewing External Changes.</li>
<li>Improved the error reporting around "Missing archive" errors to provide more useful information that will help fix it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Known Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Once a collection created by the user is removed from the app, it can no longer be edited, even if it was exported to the website.</li>
<li>Exported collections do not include a valid version number.</li>
<li>The game version is not checked when adding a collection, meaning you can install outdated mods without being warned.</li>
<li>The sort order for some columns does not work as expected.</li>
<li>The table header sorting and active tab states are not saved and are reset each time the view is loaded.</li>
<li>When deleting the second-to-last editable collection, an error message will show. This can be ignored.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Free and open source 2D graphics editor PixiEditor 2.0 out now with Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PixiEditor is a free and open source fully-featured 2D graphics editor, now better than ever with the 2.0 release out that brings Linux support.</p>
<p>The original creator mentioned their mission with it is to "give the world free and open source, offline, Universal 2D Image editor, that can do as much as expensive proprietary creative software such as Adobe's, if not more" and they believe version 2.0 "already outpaces Photoshop in certain areas".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5hmW2ZKO1YY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5be918df8606e6672e8daa308dc9ce30.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5hmW2ZKO1YY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it (from GitHub):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Toolsets for any scenario</strong></p>
<p>PixiEditor 2.0 comes by default with 3 toolsets:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pixel art</strong> - it contains tool suited for pixel-perfect scenarios</li>
<li><strong>Painting</strong> - basic painting tools, soft brushes, anti aliased shapes</li>
<li><strong>Vector</strong> - shapes and paths for creating vectors</li>
</ul>
<p>All <strong>toolsets can be used on one canvas</strong>. Mix vector with raster. Export to png, jpg, svg, gif, mp4 and more!</p>
<p><strong>Animations</strong></p>
<p>Version 2.0 comes with a timeline and animation capabilities. You can create frame by frame animations or use nodes to animate your custom shaders. Key frame animations with vectors are on our roadmap.</p>
<p><strong>Nodes</strong></p>
<p>Node render system is what powers such extensive capabilities. All layers, effects and the layer structure are nodes or a result of its connections. PixiEditor exposes node graph for every document, so you are free to customize your image however you want and create procedural art/animations!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds awesome and looks great! Nice to see it get Linux support.</p>
<p>You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/PixiEditor/PixiEditor" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2218560/PixiEditor/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://pixieditor.net/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Official Site</a>.</p>

      <title>Lossless Scaling Frame Generation for Linux hits 1.0 with a new UI making it easier than ever</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developer of the unofficial Lossless Scaling Frame Generation for Linux project announced the first official release, which comes with a new UI.</p>
<p>It's also easier than ever to actually install it, and thanks to the UI it's simpler to make it actually work now too. However, the UI might seem a little familiar, because it was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/theres-now-an-unofficial-gui-for-lossless-scalings-frame-generation-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">originally a separate project</a> that has been merged into the main lsfg-vk project now. Nice and tidy.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19130422201754050082gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19130422201754050082gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>From the GitHub page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What's new?</strong></p>
<p>This is the first release of lsfg-vk. It contains the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for LSFG 3.1, the latest frame generation model</li>
<li>Performance Mode, a lighter variant of LSFG 3.1</li>
<li>Flow Scale customization</li>
<li>An easy-to-use graphical user interface for customization</li>
<li>One config file to manage all games</li>
<li>Manual environment variables for configuration as well</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Thankfully, the actual release now comes with a few packages for Linux distributions including Ubuntu, Fedora and Arch Linux. Also a Flatpak without the UI is available too, as is installing it manually. As a reminder though, you need to own Lossless Scaling on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/Lossless_Scaling/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking to users in the Lossless Scaling Discord, the developer of the Linux project, "Pancake" said about future plans:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Future updates</strong></p>
<p>The journey does not end here.. far from it actually. I still have a bunch of things I want to add to this project so let's take a moment to talk about those.</p>
<p>Future updates may include Dual GPU support (which will not be as good as on Windows due to some Linux/Vulkan constraints unfortunately!). I may or may not also add older versions of LSFG as those seem to shine on some rare games and especially older systems. I've already mentioned adaptive mode, but fractional multipliers are also something I am considering (Adaptive Mode <em>should</em> also be fixing any framepacing issues and seemingly broken gamescope/handheld titles). There are also some huge performance improvements in the oven which should improve all modes performance by 2x-4x. Finally I will be adding some quality of life features such as specifying a proton game by it's exe file, or having separate names for presets than their activation title. Perhaps we will even see a button or hotkey to activate frame generation similar to Windows (I don't know how feasible that is though).</p>
<p>I will likely be releasing these new features in smaller "test" versions that may or may not be announced here, so keep an eye out!</p>
<p>Once again thank you everyone for your support on this project and I hope I was able to make your Linux gaming experience more enjoyable!</p>

      <title>Valve makes Steam Library customisation a little easier in the latest Steam Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a new Steam Beta Client update for Desktop and SteamOS / Steam Deck, making customising your Steam games a bit easier.</p>
<p>Games now have their own dedicated tab in the properties menu for customisation, giving you a single standard place to change the game artwork. Not only that, but they've also added a special text box for you to add a custom name for sorting your Steam Library differently to the game name. This special name you add is <em>not</em> shown, it's purely for display sorting, something that many have been asking Valve to add. <em>An interesting way to do it.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/780148021754048761gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/780148021754048761gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21106417611754048762gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/21106417611754048762gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>The pictures above are how it looks on Desktop.</p>
<p>The Desktop changelog:</p>
<blockquote>

<li>Store menu - Top Genres should now be more relevant and dynamic.</li>

<li>Fixed context menus showing empty space at some UI scales.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Big Picture Mode</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed UI scale adjustments sometimes resetting scaling back to auto.</li>
<li>Fixed Big Picture Mode window changing size when UI scaling is adjusted.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Game Recording</strong>

<li>Fixed export failing for lower resolution recordings.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Linux</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Steam UI scale not updating with system DPI changes in XWayland.</li>
<li>Fixed a case where steam would freeze and fail to recover after a process crash.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And for SteamOS / Steam Deck:</p>
<blockquote><strong>General</strong>
<ul>

      <title>Here&#39;s the most played games on Steam Deck for July 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A fresh month is here so time to take a look at what has been popular over the last month on Steam Deck, and time for you to tell us what you've been playing.</p>
<p>Personally, I've been playing quite a lot of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">PEAK</a> and it's not surprising to see it so high at number 5. It's a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/co-op-climbing-game-peak-is-a-truly-great-time-with-friends/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">seriously fun time with a few friends</a> and we've been putting lots hours into it and still haven't managed to get through a full run yet, mostly because we're all <em>idiots</em>. Someone always has a habit of wandering off, and we're determined to rescue them and then lots of stupid things happen.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19133399591754047971gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19133399591754047971gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8456864781754047975gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/8456864781754047975gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>If you haven't checked out PEAK yet, make sure you do. Excellent co-op chaos. Double thumbs up from me.</p>
<p>From Valve's official data for Jul 3, 2025 - Aug 1, 2025 here's what's been played the most cut down to the top 50. All links direct to Steam, along with their Steam Deck Verified rating.</p>

      <title>Developer of PlayStation 1 emulator DuckStation threatens &#34;removing Linux support entirely&#34; but not yet</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems the main developer of the PlayStation 1 emulator DuckStation is not happy with Linux packaging, threatening to remove Linux support.</p>
<p>As quick a bit of background - the project was previously under the open source GPL license, but was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/playstation-1-emulator-duckstation-changes-license-for-no-commercial-use-and-no-derivatives/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changed in September last year</a> to a more restrictive license. This was due to people violating the old license, which isn't exactly going to stop anyone violating a new license but anyway…</p>
<p>On the official GitHub a <a href="https://github.com/stenzek/duckstation/commit/30df16cc767297c544e1311a3de4d10da30fe00c" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">change</a> was made by Connor "stenzek" McLaughlin to remove the PKGBUILD for Arch Linux. In the change description stenzek noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I originally provided this an alternative to the broken AUR packages.</p>
<p>However, it seems that Arch users would rather use broken packages and keep complaining to me instead of their packager. I specifically forbid packages for DuckStation (see README.md), and there's no way to request removal of these packages without handing my details over to a distribution I want nothing to do with.</p>
<p>So this is step one. <strong>Next step will be removing Linux support entirely</strong>, because I'm sick of the headaches and hacks for an operating system that only compromises 2% of the userbase, and I don't even use myself. But I'm hoping the Linux community will be reasonable, because as someone giving up my free time and not being compensated in any way, I shouldn't have to deal with this.</p>
<p>Just grep the source for "wayland" and you'll see what I mean.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Emphasis ours.</em></p>
<p>However, despite what clearly looked like a threat to just remove Linux support is not exactly true (not yet anyway). While it certainly reads like that was their plan (there's not really any other way to read into such a thing), in the official Discord they later said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since people seem to be spreading misinformation (yay), let's make some things clear:</p>
<ol>
<li>Linux support is not being removed from DuckStation, I have no immediate plans to do that.,</li>
<li>I've created a deletion request for the AUR package that is causing headaches, if they can remove it, that solves everything and we can go back to business as usual.,</li>
<li>If they don't, then we'll see. I don't really feel like playing a cat and mouse game of making changes that prevent it from building/running in that environment, it's easier to just walk away.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>What a messy situation this emulator has been.</p>

      <title>Battlefield 6 will be a unplayable on Linux systems due to the anti-cheat</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just in case you were curious - no you will not be able to play Battlefield 6 on any Linux powered system including SteamOS.</p>
<p>Why? Anti-cheat strikes again! It was very much expected for this one, since it's an Electronic Arts (EA) title but now it is confirmed. It will be using EA's newer EA Javelin Anticheat which actively blocks Linux platforms from playing.</p>
<p>As per the Steam store page that's now live, it will have Kernel-Level anti-cheat, which in the updated official <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/faq" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ</a> notes it's Javelin. So <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our curated anti-cheat page</a> has been updated to now list it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/157393981754045943gol1.jpg"/><br/>
Pictured - Battlefield 6</p>
<p>In other related news, one interesting point about Battlefield 6 is its use of open source. They're using <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> for their "Portal" system to allow creators to do all sorts of crazy things with the game. As confirmed in their recent video that you can see below. Godot is shown clearly at 3:04.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="92CHDiFW0wA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c4d7c72fdb582e06131725ec6a8d042e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/92CHDiFW0wA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Pretty amazing to see such huge developers now using the cross-platform and open source Godot.</p>

      <title>Atari set to acquire 82% of Thunderful Group AB, as Thunderful announce they&#39;re &#34;restructuring&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Even more game industry consolidation going on. Atari has entered into an agreement with Thunderful Group AB to acquire most of it. As per the press release Atari will pay around €4.5 million (~$5.1M USD) to own approximately 82% of the outstanding shares and votes of Thunderful becoming the major shareholder.</p>
<p>Wade Rosen, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Atari, SA said about the deal: "This Transaction marks another important milestone in Atari's development with the expansion of its publishing and development capabilities in the European region. Thunderful is recognized for publishing and developing critically acclaimed games, and with the announced transformation plan, as well as the quality and commitment of Thunderful's teams, we are confident that Thunderful will be returning to a profitable growth path while helping to further develop Atari operations in Europe."</p>
<p><em>Via <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/07/29/3122984/0/en/Atari-enters-into-an-agreement-to-invest-in-Thunderful-Group-AB.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">globenewswire</a>.</em></p>
<p>On the same day, Thunderful <a href="https://thunderfulgroup.com/news-room/press-releases/2025-07-29-thunderful-group-initiates-restructuring-and-provides-business-update" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> they're "restructuring" to "promptly reduce the cost base with the aim of improving operating cash flow" as they continue to "generate negative cash flow" while building up a net debt of around SEK 85 million (~$8.8M USD). And yes, this does include job losses as they confirmed "workforce reductions within game development studios and the publishing business to adapt operations to the release pipeline, as well as workforce reductions within other group-wide services".</p>
<p>Thunderful are likely best known for the SteamWorld series originally from Image &amp; Form Games, which was folded into Thunderful Development.</p>
<p>This follows on from Atari previously acquiring <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/atari-acquires-transport-tycoon-from-chris-sawyer/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Transport Tycoon from Chris Sawyer</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/infogrames-atari-have-acquired-the-surgeon-simulator-franchise/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Surgeon Simulator franchise</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/atari-acquires-intellivision-brand-and-over-200-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Intellivision brand and over 200 games</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/atari-revives-infogrames-and-acquires-totally-reliable-delivery-service/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Totally Reliable Delivery Service</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/atari-acquires-awesomenauts-swords-soldiers-and-digital-eclipse/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Awesomenauts, Swords &amp; Soldiers and Digital Eclipse</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/atari-are-acquiring-night-dive-studios/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Night Dive Studios</a> over the last two years. </p>

      <title>Sony sues Tencent over Light of Motiram calling it a &#34;slavish clone&#34; of the Horizon Zero Dawn series</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It was only a matter of time really on this one. Sony have now formally begun legal action against Tencent for Light of Motiram.</p>
<p>Filed on July 25th, the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.453426/gov.uscourts.cand.453426.1.0.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">lawsuit</a> certainly doesn't pull any punches jumping right into calling it "a slavish clone of SIE’s immensely popular, award-winning Horizon series of video games". Sony are seeking to prevent the release of the game, along with seeking damages of "up to $150,000 for each separate work in the Horizon Franchise infringed".</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6prk0Jxg7Cw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">recent trailer</a> does look shockingly similar, as does all of their promotional material, as pointed out very clearly by Sony in the lawsuit. In <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/light-of-motiram-takes-horizon-zero-dawn-and-turns-it-into-a-co-op-survival-game/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my original article</a> about the game I even said "The copying here is pretty blatant" and it really is. Everything about it screams they wanted to make a Horizon game.</p>
<p>Reading further into it, representatives from Tencent (a claim from Sony) did actually approach them to discuss licensing the Horizon franchise in March 2024 at GDC. Here Tencent "pitched a project to SIE, wherein they outlined Tencent's desire to license SIE's intellectual property rights in the Horizon Franchise to create a mobile video game set in the Horizon universe" noting that the team involved were "[d]ie-hardfans" of the franchise.</p>

<p>Clones and games inspired directly by popular games are everywhere, they appear every day. However, this looks like it's probably just a bit too close especially with the creature and character designs, even if they're going for a different gameplay style with it being a co-op survival game. So it will be very interesting to see what happens as a result of this one.</p>

      <title>Cerebral psychological horror s.p.l.i.t from the dev of Buckshot Roulette is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Costing less than £3, here's your chance at some cheap thrills with the release of s.p.l.i.t from Buckshot Roulette developer Mike Klubnika. It's properly weird in the best kind of way and it won't take you long to complete either, good for a single run one evening.</p>
<p>What you get is an intense 90-minute or so psychological-horror-hacker game. s.p.l.i.t, plunges you into the dark, sickly world of cybercrime, as you attempt to gain access to an unethical superstructure, and once in - execute a devastating malware attack. One I'm sure plenty of Linux fans will appreciate with the keyboard-driven raw command-line interactions, wrapped up in Klubnika's trademark dystopian, low-fi audiovisual stylings.</p>

<li>An IRC chat where you gain intel, and learn more about the facility.</li>
<li>A terminal where you run software, navigate directories, and execute commands.</li>
<li>Detailed command prompt hacking puzzles with an emphasis on traditional inputs.</li>
<li>Original soundtrack.</li>
</ul>
<p>It has Native Linux support just like their previous game.</p>

      <title>Seriously cool car combat game FUMES has entered Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>FUMES really impressed me with the demo, and now you can jump in and blow some vehicles up in this fast-paced single-player car combat game. The demo was recently updated too and works great with Proton.</p>
<p>The initial release comes with quite a lot of content including 12 cars, 12 weapons, 3 giant bosses, 12 mini bosses, 3 different types of anomalies to discover and more. FUMES is very much a game like the classics both in terms of style and gameplay, reminds me of a lot of similar games I played back in the days of the original PlayStation.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HvQr6nI5mdI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/50a650fe3538e1b1b08337fe3565ec2c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HvQr6nI5mdI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The roadmap they've shared has lots of goodies planned for the game too. More activities and racing modes, melee combat, engine swapping, more exploration, more end-game content, a full proper story and much more. We might also see it get mod support and online co-op but they're not promising those.</p>
<p>It's seriously ace, you should grab it.</p>

      <title>SoulGame Studio release Flash classics in the Swords &amp; Souls Legacy Collection</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The new Swords &amp; Souls Legacy Collection from SoulGame Studio brings five Flash classics back with a Steam release. I'm sure a fair few readers will remember these, I certainly do. Now playable properly on modern systems in full-screen 16:9 for the first time.</p>
<p>Each title in the Swords &amp; Souls Legacy Collection offers a unique spin on action, adventure, and humour, all tied together by SoulGame Studio’s trademark charm and the unifying ‘Souls’ theme. While there isn’t a single overarching storyline across the five titles, each game features its own distinct world, characters and gameplay style.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DPPUsHC-J-c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6b55737ede1fe0877d326821a32d6734.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DPPUsHC-J-c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The games included are:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4><strong>Swords &amp; Souls</strong></h4>
<p>In this iconic RPG-training hybrid, design your Soul from the ground up, train them in skill-based mini-games, and prove your mettle in the deadly Arena. Hone reflexes, level up abilities, and unlock powerful gear as you face increasingly tougher foes and rise through the ranks. With charming animations, quirky humor, and deep character progression, <em>Swords &amp; Souls</em> stands tall as a Flash-era legend, and now it's back, better than ever.</p>
<h4><strong>Rogue Soul</strong></h4>
<p>Become the most wanted rogue in this fast-paced action-runner where style is everything. Sprint, slide, and slash your way through city rooftops and dodge enemy patrols as you collect loot and grow your notoriety. With responsive controls, acrobatic moves, and an ever-expanding list of treasures to uncover, <em>Rogue Soul</em> delivers a thrilling blend of precision and personality. Robbing from the rich has never been this slick.</p>
<h4><strong>Rogue Soul 2</strong></h4>
<p>The rogue returns, bigger, faster, and more dangerous. <em>Rogue Soul 2</em> builds on everything that made the original great with sprawling environments, new enemy types, powerful upgrades, and challenging boss encounters. As you explore vast new areas filled with traps, treasures, and secrets, you’ll unlock cosmetic gear, complete quests, and perfect your rogue’s moveset.</p>
<h4><strong>The Soul Driver</strong></h4>
<p>Buckle up for mayhem in <em>The Soul Driver</em>, a high-octane chase game where you're a fugitive with nothing to lose. Customize your ride, take on daring challenges, and smash through 42 miles of chaos as you flee an increasingly desperate police force. From roadblocks and helicopters to comically intense upgrades, this game delivers nonstop laughs and thrills. Can you make it to the border before the law catches up?</p>
<h4><strong>The Gentleman</strong></h4>
<p>Put your monocle on and prepare for refined platforming. In <em>The Gentleman</em>, gravity is just a suggestion as you gently stroll, leap, and float through clever puzzle-platformer levels using nothing but your umbrella and wit. This elegantly tricky title is packed with head-scratching levels and stylish charm. With its dashing hero and unique mechanics, it’s a love letter to players who like their challenges served with sophistication.</p>

      <title>Stardock Entertainment revealed Elemental: Reforged bringing together multiple games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Stardock Entertainment have announced Elemental: Reforged, which is kinda of like a super remaster of three different games to finally realize their vision.</p>
<p>It brings together the 4x series Elemental that was split into three games across Elemental: War of Magic, Fallen Enchantress, and Sorcerer King. Stardock said their original plan conceived back in 2008 was limited by the technology of the time and so this brings a modernized 64bit game engine to deliver on their original vision. There will be some game mechanics from each in the series, along with entirely new features. Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QHOH_iLe_Z8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d59135d6bec49eb9d610cc2509c1915c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QHOH_iLe_Z8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“With Elemental: Reforged, we’re finally able to deliver the original design we wanted,” said Brad Wardell, CEO of Stardock Entertainment and lead designer of the original Elemental game. “As we developed Elemental, we realized that the design wouldn’t fit in a 32-bit game and pared it down to into Elemental: War of Magic, which still had challenges fitting in 32-bit memory space. So then we made Elemental: Fallen Enchantress, which did much better but was still a shadow of what we had designed. Then we made Elemental: Sorcerer King where we focused on the crafting and quest elements of the original design. Now, thanks to remastering the engine to 64-bit, we can actually make the full game we originally envisioned in 2008.”</p>
<p>Elemental: Reforged Highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unified Elemental Experience. Brings together the strategic depth, smart AI, and rich gameplay from Fallen Enchantress, the immersive crafting and quest systems from Sorcerer King, and the dynasty-building, terraforming, and innovative mechanics first introduced in War of Magic. </li>
<li>Rich, Dynamic Worlds. Enjoy endless replayability through procedurally generated fantasy worlds filled with lore-rich quests, evolving environments that respond to your magic, unique fantasy civilizations, and bustling cities populated with individually simulated characters. </li>
<li>RPG-Infused Unit Design. Customize heroes and armies through an intuitive RPG-style character designer, crafting each unit with their own unique history, stats, equipment, and abilities, growing stronger with experience. </li>
<li>Compelling Tactical Combat. See how your designed units and characters fare in battle in highly refined tactical battles that reward strategic thinking, or leverage a sophisticated auto-resolve system powered by advanced AI for streamlined empire management. </li>
<li>Deep Quest and Story Integration. Embark on rich, narrative-driven quests seamlessly woven into the empire-building experience, influencing diplomacy, unlocking secrets, and offering meaningful rewards.</li>
<li>Modernized UI and Graphics Engine. Explore enhanced visuals powered by DirectX 11, seamless zooming from strategic cloth-map to detailed tactical view.</li>
<li>Integrated Modding tools. A comprehensive built-in modding and map-editing tools, and a fully redesigned user interface optimized for modern PC gaming with Steam workshop integration.</li>

      <title>The Crazy Hyper-Dungeon Chronicles (TCHDC) combines the ideas of Undertale and Dungeon Master</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Due to arrive in October, The Crazy Hyper-Dungeon Chronicles (TCHDC) combines the worlds of Undertale and Dungeon Master.</p>
<p>Here you get to decide exactly what type of adventurer you want to be. You are the hero of this story. You could opt for the goal-oriented Explorer who excels in puzzle-solving and stealth, dive right into the role of the Destroyer if you prefer to fight first and ask questions about the story later, or become the Resolver who seeks to uncover Hyper-Dungeon's lore and talk issues out instead of fighting when possible.</p>
<p>Sounds like a thoroughly odd but unique blend of game mechanics here. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UiTmM3faw-0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a4282a1fdf3dd5cb540420d913058ec4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UiTmM3faw-0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>According to the press release the labyrinthine is filled of traps, brain-scratching puzzles and you'll have to deal with the combat system that "blends traditional turn-based encounters with arcade action elements". As you explore you'll also encounter "a host of whimsical characters and have interactions laden with references to video games, geek culture, and subcultures galore".</p>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Procedurally generated levels ensure every trip into the Hyper-Dungeon is different and full of surprise encounters and opportunities.</li>
<li>Character profiles let you choose how to play: focus on lore and talk your way out of fights with the Resolver, dive right into combat with the Destroyer, or become the Explorer to excel at puzzle solving and stealth.</li>
<li>Combat blends turn-based strategy with real-time interactions, similar to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 or Super Mario RPG.</li>
<li>The Hyper-Dungeon is packed with in-game lore to unearth and pop/game culture references to discover.</li>

      <title>OpenLinkHub is an open source interface to manage iCUE LINK Hub and various Corsair devices on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For people who have Corsair hardware, the OpenLinkHub project might be one you need to take a look at to help you manage it all including iCUE LINK Hub.</p>
<p>It's not an official Corsair project, since like many other big-name brands, they don't provide direct Linux support. So one one Linux user decided to create a project to manage it all. OpenLinkHub supports over 100 devices across iCUE LINK Hub and other Corsair AIOs and Hubs for RGB lighting, fan speeds, system metrics, as well as keyboards, mice and headsets via a web dashboard. </p>
<p>The point is to unify all Corsair devices into a single UI available via the web.</p>

<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Web-based UI accessible at http://localhost:27003</li>
<li>Control AIO coolers, fans, hubs, pumps, LCDs and RGB lighting</li>
<li>Manage keyboards, mice and headsets</li>

      <title>Cattle Country the western styled Stardew gets expanded mining and new features</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cattle Country is a really nice western styled life and farming sim that's a good pick for fans of Stardew Valley. Now with a big content update! <em>ICYMI: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/move-over-stardew-its-time-for-cattle-country/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">See my original thoughts on it</a>.</em></p>
<p>What is it? A cosy frontier life-sim where players can build their dream homestead, raise livestock, craft tools, and carve out a peaceful life beneath the wide Western skies. While you can also romance characters, it's not all sunshine and rainbows - there's bandits that come along too, all part of life on the range.</p>
<p>The developers just released the "Beneath and Beyond" Update and it sounds like a good one. With expanded underground mining, and multiple big new features for all the above ground adventuring you'll be doing.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zeC9Ri9Xlqo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3e950633a9101abee027e80cc94e628f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zeC9Ri9Xlqo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Update Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Expanded Mining System – New mine levels, rarer resources, environmental hazards, and surprises waiting in the dark. Dig deeper than ever before and uncover secrets beneath the soil, from glittering gems to long-forgotten bandit loot. </li>
<li>Hay Dropper – Automatically feeds hay to your livestock, giving you more time to enjoy the open range.</li>
<li>Scratch Post – Place it in your barn or coop to keep animals happy and content.</li>
<li>Aquariums – Show off your prized catches by displaying fish in beautiful tanks right at home.</li>
<li>Horse Whistle Tune – Play a tune and call your trusty steed from afar, perfect for long treks or quick getaways.</li>
<li>Walleye Fish – Now available in lakes during spring and fall. It was previously uncatchable, but no longer out of reach for patient anglers.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's quite a lot more including plenty of bug fixes you can read in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2818150/view/510711823303967018" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>.</p>

      <title>HIPS N NOSES is a cafe management sim with magical twists and great looking game mechanics</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cafe management with a magical twist, plus roguelike combat elements and a pretty cool witchy style. HIPS N NOSES is one to keep on your wishlist.</p>
<p>The developer PepperStones from Korea noted that by day you run a "cozy yet mysterious café that helps customers regain their lost memories" and by night you "dive into surreal dream worlds, battling monsters and gathering rare ingredients to brew memory-restoring drinks".</p>
<p>It's not just the style that grabbed my attention here, it's the pretty surprising game mechanics with the way you serve customers. HIPS N NOSES just oozes style. Check it out in the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uwYtKfG3LPs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c6d2075585cedd0ef1ce7333615f5f0a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uwYtKfG3LPs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Recipe Customization - Each customer visiting the café has unique tastes and preferences. By picking up subtle hints in their conversations, players can adjust and enhance recipes with the best possible ingredients. Successfully satisfying even the most demanding customers leads to greater rewards and increased profits.</li>
<li>Combat in Dream World - The ever-changing dream world offers new experiences with every exploration. Meet various people in reality who also appear in the dream world, and together, defeat numerous monsters to collect special materials that cannot be obtained in reality.</li>
<li>Elements That Provide the Fun of Growth - Players can customize their café with various kitchen tools, interact with diverse customers, and grow stronger by defeating dream monsters. These growth systems enable players to handle more customers more efficiently, adding depth and long-term engagement to the gameplay.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's currently aiming for a 2026 release.</p>

      <title>Mecha fans should keep an eye on Ironwing Valiant: Record of Astera</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A mecha action-JRPG with ranged and melee mechanics, mech customization, companion customization and lots more? Sign me the heck up. The style of Ironwing Valiant: Record of Astera looks awesome, and we definitely have a lack of really good modern mech games like this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ironwing Valiant is a fast-pace, mecha action-JRPG game with shooting and melee mechanics, mech customization, companion customization, real-time with pause command abilities in combat, and a compelling storyline and characters. Taking the guise of a young mecha pilot named Reinhardt, you will battle through sleepy villages, imposing fortress cities, and war-scarred industrial centers, fully customize your Valiant (our term for mecha) to fit your playstyle. The game features full parts customization (Head, Arms, Legs, Core, minor components), a large selection of unique melee, ranged, and axillary weapons, companion and party customization, multiple enemy types (Infantry, armored vehicles, mechs, elite enemies, and more) and a JRPG-style storyline.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like a colourful Armored Core mixed with Valkyria Chronicles. Do you need any more than that? Check out their most recent demo trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yLEaOdIBc38"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6dac87a319f2ab33a6520c13284eb57d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yLEaOdIBc38" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>According to the developer the game world and story is based off of Chinese and Korean mythology and The Romance of The Three Kingdoms novel! So this is definitely one to watch.</p>
<p>There's a very early demo on their itch page and you can follow it on Steam directly too. An upgraded demo is also currently in the works but there's no release date set for the full game yet.</p>

      <title>Theme Hospital game engine CorsixTH 0.69 released - you can now hear patients vomiting</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Audio is part of what makes a game great right? Theme Hospital game engine CorsixTH 0.69 is out now to enhance this absolute classic. A game I very much loved when it was originally released, and I really enjoy going back through it with a free and open source enhancement like this.</p>
<p>The main additions in this release include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Custom level/campaign creators can now use an existing level file as an overlay to copy and extend their level file with the #overlay variable. See the 'Custom Level' Wiki page for more information.</li>
<li>A new machine menu has been added. Now you can view the status of all your hospital machines in one place!</li>
<li>Changing speed in game now happens immediately.</li>
<li>Patient happiness can now be a win/lose factor in custom games.</li>
<li>Transparent walls can now be toggled using Shift + X.</li>
<li>Soda price can now be configured in the level file.</li>
<li>Improvements and fixes for the ChirzmanTV custom campaign.</li>
</ul>

<em>Pictured - CorsixTH on Linux</em></p>
<p>Plenty of smaller but still great changes came in this update too, like finally hearing patients vomiting. Improved AI for idle staff to look for work, VIPs now walk slower to match the original game and a number of bug fixes too.</p>
<p>Check out the full list on <a href="https://github.com/CorsixTH/CorsixTH/releases/tag/v0.69.0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>You need the original game files for it - you can <a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/theme_hospital?as=1636858786" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">buy Theme Hospital on GOG</a>. Then just run the AppImage from the CorsixTH downloads on <a href="https://github.com/CorsixTH/CorsixTH" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, and point it to where you've installed Theme Hospital.</p>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 mod Open Fortress is getting closer to a Steam release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/tf2-mod-open-fortress-is-coming-to-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Back in May</a> we had the announcement that Open Fortress is coming to Steam, and the latest update on their progress sounds great for this Team Fortress 2 mod.</p>
<p>What is it? A full standalone mod of Valve's TF2. The developer said it "builds on Team Fortress 2’s world-famous gunplay to create a smooth, stylish experience inspired by old-school FPS games" to bring all new maps, new game modes, new guns and an original soundtrack along with taking some inspiration from 1970s action flicks.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20850901511753700240gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>In the latest Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3561320/view/515216422280888823" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> the mod team announced that work has completed on porting it to the new official <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/team-fortress-2-major-update-released-and-source-available-for-modders-via-the-source-sdk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TF2 SDK that Valve released back in February</a>. The devs of Open Fortress say they can now upload builds to Steam which will be soon but "not yet". While the "titanic effort of getting Open Fortress SDK-compatible is over" they're still working to bring it up to a fully polished level. This includes improving lots of weapon models, refining maps, remastered sounds and more.</p>

      <title>20 years later, DnD classics Demon Stone and Dragonshard are getting upgraded Steam releases</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Game publisher SNEG recently announced Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dragonshard and Forgotten Realms: Demon Stone are coming to Steam with plenty of upgrades.</p>
<p>There's also a <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/dungeons-dragons-classics-collection" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Dungeons and Dragons Classics Collection Humble Bundle</a> live with the announcement, where you can get 13 classics from SNEG for £7.40 for the whole lot.</p>
<p>More about each of the re-releases below from the press release.</p>
<p><strong>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dragonshard</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Originally released in 2005, Dragonshard returns in a respectful re-release that quietly modernizes the classic: modern-resolution support, localization-friendly saves and profiles, smoother timers and physics, ASLR compatibility, and other under-the-hood fixes for a cleaner experience on today’s PCs.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS® Real-Time Strategy Experience</li>
<li>D&amp;D® game from the Eberron campaign setting</li>
<li>Game design with two levels of interconnected action: RTS war above ground and critical RPG-styled battles in dungeons below</li>
<li>Four ranges of controllable units: powerful champions, heroic captains, trainable henchmen, and nearly unstoppable battlefield juggernauts</li>
<li>Unit development based on 'Experience Points', allowing players to "level up" units - an added RPG twist to the classic RTS gameplay structure</li>
<li>An innovative village grid system - the "Nexus System" - where choice and placement of buildings can specifically affect units' powers</li>
<li>Three warring factions, each with its own history, campaigns, unique strengths... and weaknesses.</li>
<li>Game story by Eberron creator Keith Baker</li>
<li>A variety of threatening environments, all with the "Hyper Terrain" feature, creating real-time terrain deformation in the wake of unit movements</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Update 29/07/25</strong>: as pointed out in the comments, it's not actually the first DnD RTS. Clearing this up with SNEG, here's what they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can add even more, in my opinion, the first RTS in D&amp;D was Stronghold that had real-time city building and was released in 1993.</p>
<p>That said, we are not inventing anything new. That’s how the game was officially positioned - https://www.mobygames.com/game/19289/dungeons-dragons-dragonshard/cover/group-28777/cover-92156/ Check the top of the DVD-box cover. This statement was the main message of the campaign in 2005 and we wanted to keep it in the game description as many gamers remember it this way.</p>
<p>Why was it done? Probably because previous games were using the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons license while this one was the actual D&amp;D one. Previous games wouldn’t be called RTSs at that time either. Stronghold was about managing kingdom in real time and Blood &amp; Magic was about real time tactics without any base building as such.</p>

<p><strong>Forgotten Realms: Demon Stone</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>First released in 2004, Forgotten Realms: Demon Stone returns in a polished re‑release: smoother startup and gameplay, proper widescreen scaling, borderless/windowed modes, optimised shadows, full XInput controller support with rumble and hot‑plugging, adjustable audio, and a new in‑game settings menu for modern PCs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick-up-and-play combat: hand-to-hand battles and melee brawls (the fighter), ranged and projectile power (the sorcerer), sexy stealth attacks (the rogue)</li>
<li>Sprawling story by N.Y. Times - bestselling author R.A. Salvatore</li>

      <title>Super Meat Boy 3D looks fast, tough and enraging in the new gameplay trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The tough-as-nails platformer returns in three dimensions, Super Meat Boy 3D has a fresh gameplay trailer overview you can watch right now. The game will arrive sometime in 2026, and will no doubt work great on Linux platforms with Valve's Proton.</p>
<p>After watching it, I'm sold on it. The style actually looks incredible, and the vertical design of it with all the wall-running really looks like it will grab your full attention. You might want to take out controller insurance on this, it's sure to make you rage.</p>
<p>You can watch the new official developer commentary trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="tsd6an9jJ2s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ef1a8b272ef865e6eb3a304975f02a66.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/tsd6an9jJ2s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Super Meat Boy 3D</strong> is a tough as nails platformer where you play as an animated cube of meat who's trying to save his girlfriend (who happens to be made of bandages) from an evil fetus in a jar wearing a tux – <strong>IN 3D</strong>!<br/>
<br/>
Our meaty hero will leap from walls, over seas of buzz saws, through crumbling caves and pools of old trash sacrificing his own well-being to save his damsel in distress – <strong>IN 3D!</strong><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Super Meat Boy 3D</strong> brings the old school difficulty of classic retro titles we all know and love and streamlines them down to the essential no bull straight forward twitch reflex platforming. Ramping up in difficulty from hard to soul crushing Meat Boy will brave lush (but also on fire) forests, vast dumps filled with the waste of mankind, and high-tech forges producing the very traps that will inevitably kill Meat Boy over and over and over - <strong>IN 3D!</strong><br/>
<br/>
And if a bunch of levels weren't enough, we also have epic boss fights and tons of unlockable secrets – <strong>IN 3D!</strong></p>

      <title>Valve reveal new Steam store menu and enhanced search now in Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're on the Steam Client Beta (Desktops), you might have noticed the Steam store looking a bit different with the latest update. Valve <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/500579345320904591" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> a refresh of the Steam store menu noting it's designed to "provide easier access to the places Steam users most frequently visit".</p>
<p>What's changed? A lot actually. The whole left sidebar of links is entirely gone, combined into the new store bar at the top. It also puts the bar on more pages across on Steam, to give you access to the search and links easily. It will also disappear when you scroll down, just scroll up a bit for it to reappear.</p>
<p>Valve have also enhanced the search bar too. It now offers more options when searching including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Popular Searches</strong>: See what others are searching for right now</li>
<li><strong>Recently Viewed</strong>: An easy way to jump back to games you've previously looked at</li>
<li><strong>More than just games</strong>: Search for categories/tags, publishers, and more</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Search link</strong>: For those who want to refine their game search even further, we’ve made it easier than ever to access the advanced search page with a variety of filters.</li>
</ul>

<p>There's more including recommendations, categories and tags personalised to you and various smaller changes.</p>

      <title>Last Epoch devs Eleventh Hour Games have been acquired by Krafton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Subnautica 2 publisher Krafton have acquired Last Epoch devs Eleventh Hour Games, ahead of the latest season launching next month.</p>
<p>In a post on the Last Epoch forum Judd Cobler, Founder of Eleventh Hour Games, <a href="https://forum.lastepoch.com/t/a-new-chapter-for-eleventh-hour-games/78482" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">wrote</a> "Today I’m excited to announce that Eleventh Hour Games is joining Krafton, the powerhouse behind PUBG, who shares our passion for the action RPG genre and is ready to help fuel our efforts in raising Last Epoch to new heights. With this partnership we will have the opportunity and resources to execute on our goal of creating the very best ARPG in the genre.</p>
<p>After speaking with dozens of potential strategic partners, Krafton clearly demonstrated that they’re aligned in helping us achieve our goals and can both enable and guide us through some of the largest upcoming challenges we’ll face as a studio. This partnership will allow us to deliver things we’ve only dreamed of previously and I’m excited to share details on those at a later date".</p>
<p>Cobler noted how Eleventh Hour Games will be hiring "many" roles in the "near future".</p>
<p>This was announced by Eleventh Hour Games the same day they released a full trailer for Season 3 of Last Epoch.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="TnDnhPqC0BA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5408b28a580d4baa187b9a536f6e6fcb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/TnDnhPqC0BA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>Related: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/last-epoch-drops-the-native-linux-version-devs-tell-players-to-use-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in September 2024</a>, Eleventh Hour Games dropped support for their Native Linux version of Last Epoch telling people to use Proton instead.</em></p>
<p>From the Krafton press release: "We are thrilled to welcome Eleventh Hour Games into the KRAFTON family," said Maria Park, Head of Corporate Development at KRAFTON. "The team’s commitment to the ARPG community and innovative approach to game development resonated strongly with our values. Their rise from a grassroots studio to a globally renowned ARPG developer is nothing short of remarkable. We believe this acquisition lays the groundwork for diversifying KRAFTON’s genre portfolio and expanding distinctive franchise IPs. This acquisition also reaffirms our unwavering passion for great games and the teams that build them. We will always stand behind developers who put players first.”</p>
<p>KRAFTON acquired 100 percent of Eleventh Hour Games’ shares. The acquisition amount includes an initial consideration of USD 96 million.</p>
<p>Krafton are currently involved in a pretty dramatic legal spat with the original Subnautica founders, but that's clearly not putting the brakes on the rest of their publishing. Hopefully this won't one day turn into a sour situation as well. Probably not the best timing to be announcing such a thing though.</p>

      <title>Garry&#39;s Mod now has lots of Counter-Strike: Source and Half-Life 2 content included</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have given special permission to Garry's Mod from Facepunch to include a whole bunch of extra content for the popular physics sandbox.</p>
<p>In the July 2025 update the developers noted "The biggest user-facing change in this update brings most of Counter-Strike: Source and Half-Life 2 Episodic content to Garry's Mod by default, with gracious permission from Valve. This means that you no longer need to own those games and have them installed to play on community maps that expect you to have this content".</p>
<p>However it doesn't come with the maps, voice over files and music. You still need to own and install the games to use that part of each. Still, a thoroughly great change to see that should make jumping into Garry's Mod a whole lot easier going forwards.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7203514311753458878gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Facepunch also said this update means that "Half-Life 2: Episode 2 content is now available in the spawnmenu for every player by default". It won't remove all instances of missing textures, but the majority of them.</p>
<p>The update also contains a lot of smaller changes including crash fixes, optimizations and more. See the <a href="https://gmod.facepunch.com/news/july-2025-update" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">full update notes</a>.</p>
<p>It's actually pretty amazing how open Valve are in many ways with things like this, they're really nothing like certain other big companies.</p>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 adds 10 new maps for a summer event and more bug fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While this is not the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/mann-vs-machine-is-getting-an-upgrade-in-team-fortress-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mann vs Machine update we were previously promised</a>, Team Fortress 2 still has a big update our for the Summer 2025 Event. Still seems like a great time to jump back into the classic free to play FPS from Valve.</p>
<p>As usual for these event updates, Valve pulled in the community for basically all of the actual content that's included. Not something you see from other developers often.</p>
<p>For the Summer 2025 Event this is what was added:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Featuring 10 new community maps: Citadel, Aquarius, Fulgur, Cargo, Conifer, Boardwalk, Blowout, Mannhole, Demolition, and Pressure</li>
<li>Added the Summer 2025 Cosmetic Case
	<ul>
<li>Contains 23 new community-contributed items</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added 4 new community-contributed taunts to the Mann Co. Store
	<ul>
<li>Taunt: The Final Score</li>
<li>Taunt: Bear Hug</li>
<li>Taunt: Texan Trickshot</li>
<li>Taunt: Flying Colors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added 14 new community-created Unusual effects
	<ul>
<li>7 new effects for Unusual hats</li>
<li>7 new effects for Unusual taunts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All cosmetic and taunt cases will grant Summer 2025 Unusual effects instead of their normal Unusual effects during the Summer event. This does not include crates.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The Summer event runs through September 15th, 2025.</p>

      <title>THE FINALS devs confirm (again) continued compatibility for Linux / Steam Deck with Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Embark Studios have reconfirmed their for THE FINALS to continue working with Proton for Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck players.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/the-finals-is-getting-new-kernel-based-anti-cheat-likely-to-break-it-on-linux-steamos-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Back in early July</a> we had Embark Studios detail new anti-cheat plans for THE FINALS, which caused some concern amongst Linux players since it could end up unplayable as we've seen with various other games. They quickly confirmed the game would continue to work though.</p>
<p>The key though, is that THE FINALS is <em>not</em> "supported" but they will ensure it's not intentionally blocked. In the latest Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2073850/view/541112120139317344" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> they've posted the below to reassure Linux platform players:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Steam Deck and Proton Support</strong></p>
<p>We noticed the concern about Linux following our last update. We’re testing everything across all platforms, and have made it very clear to our partners that Proton and Steam Deck are important to our development plans. While we don’t officially support Steam Deck due to our required dependence on Proton Experimental, we are committed to ensuring compatibility, and we work with external partners to fix issues before we ship a patch. The experience of every player is important to us. Despite many factors, we are still dedicated to supporting it because we know it matters. However, general Wine support is not tested, and native Linux support is not planned. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Really great to see, hopefully more Linux players will actually take a look at THE FINALS given their repeated statements on it. Nice that a few bigger games like it aren't blocking us.</p>

It uses Plausible Analytics, which is open source and privacy focused where "All data is 100% anonymous and it serves only to have an idea of the number of users across the different operating systems we support" so they know where to focus for updates.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4044264111753455998gol1.png"/></p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>[Linux] Prioritize GE-Proton Versions and adds a setting to show/hide non-GE version on Wine List.</li>
<li>[UX] Several improvements to Joystick and Keyboard navigation.</li>
<li>[UX] Adds a new option to launch games with or without logs from the game page.</li>
<li>[macOS] Adds Wine-Staging back to Wine Manager and Fix an issue with picking up the wrong wine binary when using GPTK.</li>

</ul>

      <title>GOG Preservation Program adds Heroes of Might and Magic titles and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The <a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> team recently announced another expansion of the GOG Preservation Program, bringing in  Heroes of Might and Magic titles and more.</p>
<p>On top of expanding their support for classics, they also did something quite fancy. They've put <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_3_complete_edition" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Heroes of Might and Magic 3: Complete</a> that's also in the Preservation Program onto a 5D optical crystal. Created in collaboration with SPhotonix, tech that was shown off in a recent Mission Impossible movie. Apparently it can survive "billions of years, extreme conditions, and even a trip through an oven".</p>

<p>They also mentioned that the <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_5_bundle" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Heroes of Might and Magic 5: Bundle</a> received a major language update with Czech, Hungarian, and Simplified Chinese language support.</p>
<p>Nice to see more retro games that should live on for a good few more years on modern systems.</p>

      <title>Game store itch.io has &#34;deindexed&#34; adult content due to payment processor scrutiny</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/valve-gets-pressured-by-payment-processors-with-a-new-rule-for-game-devs-and-various-adult-games-removed/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Steam had issues recently with payment providers</a>, game store itch.io are facing the same problems with certain types of adult content.</p>
<p>Writing in a blog post on the store, itch founder Leaf Corcoran noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have “deindexed” all adult NSFW content from our browse and search pages. We understand this action is sudden and disruptive, and we are truly sorry for the frustration and confusion caused by this change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Corcoran named an organisation called <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/open-letter-to-payment-processors" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Collective Shout</a> that have "launched a campaign against Steam and itch.io, directing concerns to our payment processors about the nature of certain content found on both platforms".  Unfortunately, creators on the platform got no heads up. It was all very abrupt as the "situation developed rapidly".</p>
<p>As a result of this the itch team are doing a "comprehensive audit" of all the content to ensure they meet whatever demands are placed on them from payment providers. This means certain content will be permanently removed from the store.</p>
<p>Initially, there were reports that itch were stopping payouts that spread across social media, but the official itch.io account on BlueSky <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/itch.io/post/3luq77xpjjc2y" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have not denied any payouts to creators as part of yesterday's review. If there are any creators in which we are unable to process a payout for then we'll contact them directly. We do understand that the eligibility message is confusing given the context so we're updating the text on the notices</p>

      <title>NVIDIA reveal more GPU driver security issues for July 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Time to get updating your NVIDIA GPU driver, as more security issues have been revealed in their July 2025 Security Bulletin.</p>
<p>We were wondering why NVIDIA had been incredibly vague on what actually changed in their recent driver releases. With both the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/nvidia-570-172-08-released-for-linux-as-the-main-stable-driver/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">570.172.08</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/nvidia-stable-driver-575-64-03-released/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">575.64.03</a> that I covered here on GamingOnLinux only noting "Minor bug fixes and improvements". NVIDIA did the same again with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/details/251038/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">575.64.05</a> that arrived earlier this week. Now we know why then.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5670" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">security bulletin</a> here's the issues noted that affect Linux systems:</p>
<table border="1" style="width:100%">
<thead>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>There's a few more specific to Windows I'm not including here.</p>
<p>According to NVIDIA you're safe if you're on at least 575.64.05, 570.172.08 or 535.261.03. All prior versions in each series are vulnerable to the issues.</p>

      <title>Oceaneers is a survival-crafting adventure set in a flooded world of sinking islands</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Arriving later in 2026, Oceaneers has a really fun sounding idea. It's a survival-crafting adventure in a flooded world of sinking islands. Can't wait to get my hands on this one, really do love the overall style of it.</p>
<p>It's part colony builder, part survival game that really seems unique. Build up a colony, craft your equipment, train up your survivors and then build a raft to go off scavenging across various islands. You might even find some "lost Float-Tech from an old-world corporation", oooh. The limited space you get to actually build up will make things interesting, as will the resource system while you all try to keep your heads above water.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_ykuHNa_xcw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b43b52f2c91db01dcdda4aecd1cffc02.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_ykuHNa_xcw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"After first concepting the idea back in January 2023, it’s exciting to be launching a second PC title on Steam", shared Oceaneers developer James Thomas. "As huge fans of colony sims and crafting survival games, it’s been a fun challenge figuring out how to smoothly integrate story and objectives into these very sandboxy genres while still keeping replayability high. We grew up in the golden age of Sierra and LucasArts games, and we hope players enjoy this extra layer of quirkiness on top of the mechanics they already love."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Control multiple characters in this single player experience.</li>
<li>Design multiple rafts and send survivors on expeditions.</li>
<li>Haul islands back to your colony to expand your island home.</li>
<li>Improve island buoyancy with contraptions that keep islands afloat.</li>
<li>Research and unlock advanced workstations and upgrades.</li>
<li>Survive against weather events, and threats on both land and sea.</li>
<li>Farm crops, prepare rations and cook meals.</li>
<li>Customize your survivor names, traits, hair styles... including beards &amp; mustaches!</li>
<li>Uncover the deep sea storyline plot alongside the survival journey.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Space Dingus is a spiritual sequel to Death Road to Canada</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Death Road to Canada is a lot of fun and so I have great expectations for the next game from Rocketcat Games, which is a spiritual sequel named Space Dingus.</p>
<p>They actually announced it a couple of weeks ago, which I entirely missed due to the overflowing amount of news lately. So I imagine a lot of readers missed it too. I'm always on the lookout for more online co-op games to play with my crew and this could fit the bill. A co-op horror road trip you say? With ship management? And full modding support? Oh I'm in, sounds awesome.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Giving a little detail on what to expect from it they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're going to be keeping a lot of familiar gameplay compared to Death Road, such as the Choose your own Adventure Events, general structure for picking your locations, and giant swarms of enemies. There will also be a lot of differences from Death Road. Here's a short list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Online multiplayer! This was a huge request from Death Road to Canada, now possible with the new engine we built.</li>
<li>Mouse aiming controls! You can see this and the headshot system in the Teaser Trailer.</li>
<li>Between picking locations, you have a big customizable Spaceship as a hub area.</li>
<li>Multiple enemy factions! A few will be the "slow zombie" archetype, and even those will have new twists that set them apart from both Death Road's zombies, and each other.</li>
<li>Goofy, giant swan dives that will get you killed.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Splitgate 2 is &#34;going back to beta&#34; with the original shutting down as 1047 Games have layoffs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>1047 Games have announced that Splitgate 2 is going to be reworked, and they're shutting down the original Splitgate. The developers have also announced that due to all this they've made the "incredibly difficult decision to reduce certain roles".</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2918300/view/510712444576860070" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> posted on Steam and Reddit notes how they "launched too early" and that they "bit off more than we could chew" with certain parts of it rushed, along with making a number of "boneheaded mistakes". Mistakes like wearing that utterly<em> <a href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/524753701753210187gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">stupid hat</a></em> on stage, which caused a whole lot of controversy. The insanely expensive micro-transactions certainly didn't help at the start either and perhaps launching as <em>yet-another</em> Battle Royale was a poor choice too.</p>
<p>So now they're "going back to beta" and will be "heads down until early next year" as they rebuild the game to try and pull players back in. They said this includes "reworking progression from the ground up, adding more portals to our maps, simplifying monetization, refocusing on classic game modes you've been asking for, and more".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16732194301753210592gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>It's a tough time to be a game developer, especially so if you're insane enough to launch a multiplayer-only title. You're competing against some of the most-played and most-popular games in history. You have to be nuts. 1047 Games better have a good plan for the next attempt, or it could end up being another expensive mistake and the last one for the studio, there's only so many times you can screw-up.</p>
<p>I'm not holding out hope on this one. That said, I do hope they come back stronger with a decent plan, because the basics of it on paper are good, and the original Splitgate at the start was a lot of fun. It has everything that <em>should</em> make for a good game, they just have to get it all together.</p>

      <title>Extreme sports game Descenders Next has released into Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Descenders Next is a fresh extreme sports game from RageSquid / No More Robots and it shadow-dropped on Steam in Early Access. They must be crazy, with little to no build up, the game just sneakily arrived along with an update to the original Descenders to add in a racing mode.</p>
<p>You have be pretty wildly confident in your game to just release it like this, especially after it was delayed previously. The publisher did send over a key, and it has been running beautifully on Desktop Linux with Proton 9.0-4. It's also rated Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="fE11hzKkErQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cbdd447d2453c818e2b86d047305243d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/fE11hzKkErQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The publisher noted that while it's starting off with snowboarding and mountainboarding their aim is for it to "become the only extreme sports game you'll ever need, slowly but surely adding more and more adrenaline-fueled activities over time". It's a pretty crazy goal to have but I appreciate it, we've needed something to come along to provide just good old-fashioned crazy sports like this that other bigger publishers rarely do.</p>
<p>Much like the original Descenders, it's going to change a lot during Early Access and so true thoughts on it will be reserved for the big 1.0 release which isn't for another two years or so. They told me it "already features as much content as the original Descenders", I can't say if that's true or not as I haven't yet had enough time with it - but there is quite a lot there already.</p>
<p>If you played the original Descenders, you'll know what to expect here. It feels very similar in the actual mechanics of the sports on the controls, which isn't surprising of course since this builds on top of what they created with the original. However, each sport that's included feels just about different enough to make it worth playing through each of them.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px">What they have here currently is a wonderful base package to build upon, one that's already a <em>lot</em> of fun. I really enjoy the way you progress through it! With you picking a sport and then you're given a overworld map with various nodes on it like some sort of roguelike, instead of just a basic level list. Gives a really different feeling.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15271420661753192714gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>You get to pick which way you go, with each node giving a different set of tricks you need to pull off in a new environment. There's no real strategy to what you're picking here, as you don't really know what you're going to get apart from the points on the level steepness, curves and stunts.</p>
<p>You have a limited "health" stat to get through a single run, with each time you bail reducing it by one but successfully pulling off the needed tricks in each node will help you increase it. A really interesting choice for how they keep it feeling different and fresh on each run. Plus there's also the big main areas you can just ride around to pull of some tricks to practice too.</p>
<p>The insane speed you can get on some of the courses really gets your heart pumping, as you attempt another death-defying trick and then face-plant the floor. I think the biggest problem is the speed right now, a lot of the time it feels just a bit <em>too</em> fast, it's as if you have a rocket strapped to you. I think if they reduced the feel of the speed a bit, to give just a little more reaction time or more control on your descent it would be more enjoyable.</p>
<p>So far, a great start with obvious rough edges and plenty of room to grow. A much needed injection into the extreme sports genre.</p>

      <title>Hellraiser game announced with Clive Barker&#39;s Hellraiser: Revival</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The first proper Hellraiser game has just been revealed with Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival. Looks like it will be a good one for fans of classic horror blended with modern game design.</p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Experience a new chapter in the legendary horror series like never before. <em>Clive Barker’s Hellraiser: Revival</em> takes first-person action horror survival to the next level.</p>
<p>Play the story of Aidan, who must use the power of a mysterious puzzle box – the Genesis Configuration – to help his girlfriend Sunny’s escape from the otherworldly hellscape of the Labyrinth.</p>
<p>Wield the powers of the box to survive your bargain with the infamous Pinhead and do battle with the horrific cult devoted to the Cenobites.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="E_4kAp6gsZE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d33d1052dfd3a4936b92cb514c468bbd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/E_4kAp6gsZE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release Clive Barker, creator of the Hellraiser franchise, said: "Working on the first true Hellraiser game has been a venture deep into the recesses of my darkest imaginings. The dedication that Saber and Boss Team Games have shown is nothing short of remarkable. They've immersed themselves in the Hellraiser universe, capturing its essence - the seductive pull of suffering, the beauty within the grotesque - and forged a narrative that invites players to step beyond the threshold. I'm eager for both the curious and the damned to experience this new chapter in the Hellraiser mythos, where every moment balances on the brink of nightmare and revelation".</p>
<p>"Hellraiser is the quintessential horror franchise, and lends itself perfectly to a video game," said Matthew Karch, CEO and co-founder of Saber Interactive. "Saber has had success with horror IPs in the past, and working alongside Clive to create tense gameplay and a new story that delves into the twisted depths of pain and pleasure has been a real treat. We look forward to opening up the gates of hell."</p>
<p>It's also been confirmed that actor Doug Bradley will return to voice Pinhead in the game.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A New Story in Hellraiser's Canon</strong> – Unwittingly kickstart Pinhead’s ritual to unleash greater pain and pleasure than ever before.</li>
<li><strong>Harness the Power of the Box</strong> – Combine the unique, hellish abilities of the Configuration with an arsenal of earthly weapons to inflict bone-breaking, flesh-searing pain - or is it pleasure? - upon masochistic enemies.</li>
<li><strong>Fight Against Unholy Enemies</strong> – Take on hell's wretches, deviants, cultists, and even its most infernal priests in a story-driven horror survival game.</li>
</ul>
<p>Will this be one you're going to be picking up? I'm really surprised we haven't seen something like this before for the Hellraiser universe but it sounds like horror fans are in for a real treat.</p>

<p>PEAK is another in the list of quality co-op chaos games to add to your collection. From Landfall and AGGRO CRAB, it's an online co-op climbing game with some floaty silly physics and currently one of the most popular multiplayer games on Steam.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16959092611753186281gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16959092611753186281gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18557220931753186282gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18557220931753186282gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>We've seen a fair amount of cheap and janky chaotic online co-op games releasing over the last year, and this just might be one of the best. I picked up a personal copy recently to add to my list next to R.E.P.O to play with a few friends, and we've ended up really loving the experience. Good for a somewhat younger audience too (teens+) I would say, as I've also been playing it a fair bit with my own smaller human who has also been thoroughly enjoying it with me.</p>
<p>So what's it all about? Climbing. Obviously. You and friends go and board a plane, which unfortunately crashes leaving you all stranded. So you've got nothing to do but recover some luggage and climb.</p>
<p>But it's also a lot more than that. It's about the power of friendship to help each other laugh and struggle through it because it is a real challenge. To help you climb ever-higher through different biomes, there's lots of items to find in all that luggage scattered across the map. From bottles of water to really stupid items, there's a lot of ways to approach how you're going to attempt to reach the peak.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6850057311753186283gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6850057311753186283gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/866843061753186283gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/866843061753186283gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's different types of luggage to find from standard boxes to open that may have some food, rope, a rope cannon and other items to ancient luggage that will contain all sorts of weird treats.</p>
<p>What's really just generally clever about it is how mechanically simple it actually is as a whole. There's not a lot of gameplay elements to it, but the developers have really maximised what they're doing with it. The generation of the island is also one that will keep it feeling fresh for a long time, as you get an entirely new place to climb every 24 hours.</p>
<p>As you progress you'll also earn badges depending on how far you get, or what you manage to discover. These badges then unlock new cosmetics for you to customise your climber and you can make your character look pretty hilarious with the facial features.</p>
<p>One especially interesting feature that's really core to the gameplay is the stamina bar. If you've played the newer open-world Zelda games, you'll be familiar with it. Climbing reduces your stamina the longer you go, until you eventually fall. However, here it's also combined with the health system into one single bar. This bar fills up with hunger, weight from carrying items, poison, sleepiness and more to reduce your overall stamina. But you can fill it back up with various items you find. So it's a constant tossup between using different items at different times to maximise that stamina.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13464666281753186284gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13464666281753186284gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12710303441753186285gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12710303441753186285gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I mentioned this whole power of friendship thing, which is where the fun really begins. Each of you will have a different amount of max stamina depending on your current status, so all those items will come in use. One with more stamina can climb higher and set down a rope for others, or stand at the top to grab you before you fall. Or, be incredibly unhelpful like me and accidentally push people off — woops.</p>
<p>Even with the hours we've played, I still feel like we're only scratching the surface and the developers keep expanding it too with plans for even more to content to come.</p>
<p>You don't actually <em>need</em> friends to play it though, you can climb through it entirely solo, although it's far more interesting to play with others.</p>
<p>It works great on Desktop Linux with Proton, although the controller support is a bit odd at times. Other than that, one of the easiest recommendations I've ever made. Really entertaining.</p>

      <title>Whimsical exploration-trading adventure Townseek gets a big demo refresh</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Townseek is a colourful casual exploration and trading adventure game from developer Whales And Games, with a brand new big upgrade for the demo available.</p>
<p>More about it: "Take to the skies on a whimsical voyage across Explora and uncover the lost legacy of Sir Reginald Sharkingston! Trade, fish, mine, and farm, meeting whimsical characters and exploring vibrant towns along the way. The whole world is your sea now, so set sail and see all it has to offer!"</p>
<p>Check out the original trailer:</p>

<p>The game is going to be presented at the next BitSummit event, so they've gone through and upgraded the demo. If you tried the demo previously, they said there's a lot of new things to discover in it. There's also improved gamepad support, a new photo mode, new cosmetics, new conversations and lots more. Progress will also now carry over to the full game which still does not have a confirmed release date yet.</p>
<p>In the demo you can "Fly at your own pace, trade over 200 items between five different towns, upgrade and customise your airship, discover landmarks, find random events, and much more".</p>

      <title>Dwarf Fortress gets much more powerful modding in the latest update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I can't wait to see what the community cooks up for Dwarf Fortress, with the latest update bringing much more advanced modding capabilities to the game.</p>
<p>While the old way of modding the game will still work, this new way brings a lot more options. The new system uses Lua, with a lot of previously hard-coded options now open for modders to do whatever they like. There's a lot that's open for it including inorganic materials, languages, creatures, interactions, various items, reactions, entities, and plants. The developers said this update also acts as the foundation for the upcoming "procedural magic system which will be added to all modes".</p>
<p>You can see their original video announcing the new modding capabilities from when it went into experimental testing below:</p>

<p>There was also recently another developer update video going over all the work going into the game:</p>

      <title>Valve restores the Steam page for Old School Rally after it got hit with a DMCA</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/old-school-rally-gets-hit-with-a-dmca-and-taken-down-from-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently receiving a DMCA takedown notice</a>, Old School Rally had its Steam store page removed. Valve have now restored it and work on it continues.</p>
<p>In the Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2824660/view/515216044012341117" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> the developer said "We’re happy to share that after a thorough review by Valve's DMCA team, Old School Rally is now back online!" and that "The development team has been hard at work behind the scenes, already replacing two of the affected models, with three more set to return within the next 24 hours. We aim to bring all the missing cars back into the game with entirely new, original models over the next 3–4 weeks, minimizing disruptions to the rally experience".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="62T8hbNBXfo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fdb06debb31eecbe3832d3f42dc0fe46.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/62T8hbNBXfo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Nice to see the situation has been resolved. An annoying and messy situation for all involved from the developer to gamers interested in picking it up. </p>

      <title>Build up a shop and make potions in the cute Penny for Your Potion</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Penny for Your Potion looks like a nice one for fans of casual crafting and management, with you running your own shop and brewing potions for customers. It's due to arrive in Early Access with Linux support later this year.</p>
<p>More about it: "Penny for Your Potion is a medieval potion shop management game where you build, maintain and run your own potion shop! Organise your shop, harvest ingredients and brew powerful potions, and you'll be ready to welcome your first customers! Pay attention to what they want, keep them happy, build your reputation and unlock exciting ways to expand. Stay committed to building your shop, and your business will flourish in no time."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Qx1l4HG1dfY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/44ea83a54ced3c62430215fe300147e0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Qx1l4HG1dfY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>An immersive alchemy shop management.</li>
<li>Customising your own shop.</li>
<li>Managing your garden.</li>
<li>Brewing potions for your customers.</li>
<li>Levelling system and skill tree.</li>
<li>Compete against a greedy old fellow shopkeeper.</li>
<li>Intriguing story including the lives of townfolks and heroes.</li>
<li>Soundtrack featuring medieval tunes.</li>
<li>20-30 hours of playtime.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like even though it's entering Early Access, that a lot of it is already complete so they'll be using that extra time to polish it up and ensure it has a proper ending.</p>

      <title>Fallout: Bakersfield looks like an awesome Doom total conversion with a new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Made with GZDoom, a fresh teaser for Fallout: Bakersfield has been released and now I'm excited all over again for it. Previously it had a teaser back in September 2022 which was a brief 55 seconds.</p>
<p>The new trailer is over 4 minutes long and notes it's a "'non-commercial 1993' Doom total conversion (GZDoom WAD)" in the description. The developer also gives special thanks to Dave Oshry, CEO of New Blood Interactive.</p>
<p>Check it out below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6e8WrmOibpM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/acea239ab911715d9e18717f2d2e498d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6e8WrmOibpM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>No word on a release date, as the trailer has a release date bit at the end that quickly flickers from 2027 and 2025 and then flickers about again. So we really have no clue right now. Overall the trailer suggests it's about 60% done, so clearly a while away yet.</p>
<p>Modders will stop at nothing to make the most crazy things in GZDoom and I love it. Should hopefully be easy enough to get it working on Linux thanks to GZDoom's excellent cross-platform support.</p>

      <title>Mycopunk is a seriously bizarre co-op shooter and a new favourite</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pure chaos, that's what Mycopunk is. It's exceptionally bizarre and now my new favourite first-person shooter because it's so wildly unique. <em>Note: key provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>I was already quite <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/fight-off-a-planet-wide-fungal-catastrophe-in-the-upcoming-co-op-shooter-mycopunk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">impressed with the demo</a> and now after playing more, I'm hooked. It's very much a wonderful combination of elements from the likes of Risk of Rain 2 for the ongoing chaos during missions and Deep Rock Galactic for the structure of it only with the weirdness turned up to maximum level.</p>
<p>You pick a character class, and then go solo or team up with others across various different types of missions in various biomes across a planet. Missions can range from simply crushing as many enemies as possible, to building pipes across the map to connect points up and all sorts in between.</p>
<p>The different classes you get are quite fun but it's the enemy variation that really makes this completely nuts. Enemies are constructed of various parts you blow up and they fall apart, but other enemies might pick up their parts and attach it to themselves. </p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cR6nCcCi01g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cb7840d282ef0d12a685a1267b5f5c62.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cR6nCcCi01g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Half the time I don't entirely know exactly what's going on, because it really does just turn into pure explosive chaos. You have enemies appearing from everywhere, and some of them are massive freakish creations that fire all sorts of weapons at you. Some can be destroyed from afar, some need you to get up-close and personal. So it's good you have your own varied arsenal of weapons too.</p>
<p>There's lots of different weapons but you also get a customisation system. As you level up your character and weapons individually, you get access to various upgrade modules. You can place lots of them on your weapons in a no limits grid-based system, so as long as they fit together you can use them. It makes creating a build very unique with each player potentially being very different even when playing as the same class.</p>
<p>Quite funny that downed team mates need you to piece them back together, as you run from their legs to their torso to bring them back into the game. This will happen a lot if you're on my team, because friendly fire is most definitely a thing here. And with all the action going on, it's a bit too easy to annihilate your friends (sorry!).</p>
<p>Fantastic atmosphere too. The visual style in especially odd but in a good way it all fits together, and it definitely leans into the comedy side of things with some of the interactions and voice-over.</p>
<p>Mycopunk works perfectly on Desktop Linux with Proton 9.0-4. Valve also rated it Steam Deck Playable, the only issue being noted is you need to manually bring up the on-screen keyboard.</p>
<p>It's in Early Access so everything is subject to change and more content is to come, but what's there right now is already a huge amount of fun and an easy recommendation from me. A great choice to run around in with a couple of friends.</p>

      <title>Xenopurge has a great concept and a good start for a tense tactical auto-battler</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Xenopurge puts you in the command chair overseeing marines running around various buildings, as you take down the alien threat. <em>Note: a key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>Here you're not running around with them and you don't directly control them. Instead, you watch on your screen as they engage in the mission automatically, with you being able to give out various orders to redirect them. It's a clever and interesting concept, which is clearly inspired by the Aliens film series and the gameplay style is a bit reminiscent of Duskers.</p>
<p>You start off by picking a squad, and the select to go through various missions on a node-based map. A map type you may be familiar with from the likes of FTL and Slay the Spire. Each node being a different type of encounter from exploring and fighting aliens to upgrading your marines.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="jtVVq-V9Vso"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2021ecdbd1c846c80d47bcfe96fb0316.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/jtVVq-V9Vso" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's surprising just how tense it can become as you progress through it. Especially once you got a few upgrades going, you really don't want to watch your marines fall to the aliens. Hearing their remarks over voice comms really brings it all to life. Especially so, since all you can do is watch, issue orders and basically hope for the best. </p>
<p>Personally, I found the gameplay loop quite satisfying but due to the graphical style it clearly won't be for everyone. It's quite simplistic but in a way I still found to be rather engaging. It's funny how quickly I sit up in my chair as soon as a red dot appears while my marines are off exploring.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">With it now in Early Access its journey has only just begun, and I hope to see a lot more from this one. They've said the current focus is on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full Steam Deck Compatibility</li>
<li>Optimisation</li>
<li>Accessibility options and Settings(Screen effects, Resolutions etc)</li>
<li>Keybindings</li>
<li>Steam Cloud Save</li>
</ul>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tactical game with Sci-fi horror / tension: </strong>A tense, squad-based tactical where you’re leading your troops to hunt and exterminate alien threats in the depths of space. Inspired by the likes of Alien &amp; Space Hulk.</li>
<li><strong>Recruit and equip your squadron: </strong>Through the progression of the mission, take the opportunity to recruit new members and equip them to create a team that matches your command style.</li>
<li><strong>Quick, Engaging Sessions – Playable in Short Bursts: </strong>Designed for fast, intense tactical runs, Xenopurge allows players to jump in and complete a mission in around 20 minutes. This makes it easy to pick up and play, whether you have time for a single mission or an extended session.</li>
<li><strong>Accessible Controls: </strong>Designed to be as intuitive and accessible as possible, with the options to use keyboard, controller or mouse input. Remains smooth and responsive with simple, readable UI.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>"Xenopurge is built around the fantasy of being inside a command room — directing missions, adapting to unpredictable dangers, and feeling the weight of every decision," said Michalis Papagathangelou, designer at Traptics. "Our goal is to simulate that experience as closely and accurately as possible. Launching into Early Access allows us to collaborate directly with our community and evolve the game together."</p>
<p>It runs to perfectly on Desktop Linux with Proton 9.0-4.</p>

      <title>Space Drilling Station looks fun for building and automation fans - with a new Steam Deck compatible demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Space Drilling Station has you manage and automate a drilling station on a distant planet. The developer detailed their Steam Deck work with a new demo.</p>
<p>My first time hearing about this one when finding it today. Here you build your station by making very careful use of space with vertical building. Not only are you building up a facility and automating things, but you also need to address the needs of all your people too.</p>
<p>You'll be dealing with assigning roles to all your workers to achieve the best efficiency, keeping an eye on their health and wellbeing and sorting out various production lines through your big tower. Check out the first trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="PM8XhkycpfM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8b0f434a02ca52a3fd166e700148cf17.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/PM8XhkycpfM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer wrote a Steam <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2134850/announcements/detail/542237641778659375" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> announcing they've managed to get the first playable demo working well even on a Steam Deck, after the developer noted they received one as a gift and dedicated to get it fully working. Part of their work was ensuring the controls for such a game weren't overwhelming, along with sorting out performance issues and making sure text on the smaller screen was readable.</p>
<p>Here's what they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>🎮 Controls: Less Is More!</h4>
<p>At first, I wanted to use all of the Steam Deck's options: trackpads, joysticks, buttons... I thought it was awesome to exploit every possibility. Except, when playing, I quickly realized it was anything but pleasant. My "lazy" side took over, and I got tired of juggling between trackpads and joysticks. So I radically simplified: goodbye trackpads! I streamlined the controls to use only the bare minimum, making the experience much smoother and more intuitive.</p>
<h4>📉 The Performance Wall: Chasing Milliseconds!</h4>
<p>Once the controls were set, I hit the performance wall head-on. I knew my game wasn't an optimization champion, but on the Steam Deck, it was a disaster! I spent a good week tracking every millisecond, juggling parameters to find the right balance between fluidity and visual quality, and most importantly, to avoid draining the battery in less than 30 minutes. A real headache!</p>
<h4>📜 The "Verified" Holy Grail: Valve's Requirements</h4>
<p>Valve has very strict guidelines for the "Verified" badge. I had to face two big challenges: making all text readable from 30 cm away (you almost needed a magnifying glass before!) and removing all mentions of a mouse or keyboard. That meant redoing all the in-game videos and explanations so they were perfectly adapted to the Steam Deck. A huge amount of work!</p>
<h4>🙏 A Month Later, Pride!</h4>
<p>More than a month after receiving my Steam Deck, I'm incredibly proud to have managed to solve all the issues. It's immense satisfaction to see <strong>Space Drilling Station</strong> come to life on this machine.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope you'll enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it compatible. Please don't hesitate to give me your feedback; it's essential for continuing to improve the game!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right onto my personal wishlist it goes.</p>

      <title>Don&#39;t have time for Total War and Crusader Kings? Try the new Bellfortis</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bellfortis is a medieval turn-based strategy game for players who love the genre, but don't have as much time to commit their lives to it.</p>
<p>The developer told me they were directly inspired by the likes of Total War, Centurion, or Crusader Kings 3. Giving you a chance to become a conqueror and build up a new empire, but it won't take you an entire age to finish a game with its faster gameplay. Good for those of you with busy families!</p>
<p>The game features 7 large scenarios, which can be conquered by up to 18 different factions from 9th and 10th century Europe and North Africa. Each campaign can be completed in 2 to 5 hours. In addition to the campaign, you can also play standalone battles, which are scored and timed.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EBo3QjqTwP4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b416257c1cd5a2961ba37d108d739049.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EBo3QjqTwP4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer sent over a key to GamingOnLinux and it appears to work perfectly with Proton 9.0-4, just hit Play in Steam and away you go. Created by developer Rake in Grass, one of the oldest "garage" dev teams from the Czech Republic. They've released more than 20 games across 8 platforms, including the popular Rampage Knights and Jets'n'Guns series.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Build your empire.</li>
<li>Recruit armies and fight exciting battles.</li>
<li>Play as 18 different factions across 7 unique scenarios.</li>
<li>Use politics and intrigue, diplomats and spies.</li>
<li>Face random events that can change the gameplay.</li>
</ul>

      <title>There&#39;s now an unofficial GUI for Lossless Scaling&#39;s Frame Generation on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Keeping up with the excitement about <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/lossless-scalings-frame-generation-for-linux-gets-upgraded-to-the-latest-v3-1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lossless Scaling's Frame Generation on Linux</a> with the lsfg-vk project, there's now an extra unofficial GUI app.</p>
<p>It's quickly getting easier to install and set it all up, with the lsfg-vk project now having a much easier install ready for various Linux distributions too.</p>
<p>We already had a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/lossless-scaling-frame-gen-gets-a-decky-loader-steam-deck-plugin-but-theres-drama/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Decky Loader plugin for Steam Deck</a> to make it easier, although that came with a bit of (now solved) drama attached. And now for Desktop Linux users who want to try it out and don't want to keep diving into a text config file, you can try the new lsfg-vk-ui project.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20631792331753092971gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20631792331753092971gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Check out lsfg-vk-ui on <a href="https://github.com/Caliel666/lsfg-vk-ui" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Give it another month, and the project as a whole will probably be even easier again. Still far from ready for beginners, as you still need to know what you're doing.</p>

      <title>GeForce Infinity is a new app for GeForce NOW on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GeForce Infinity was announced recently as another option for running GeForce NOW on Desktop Linux, since NVIDIA haven't put out an official app.</p>
<p>While NVIDIA do have an official app for Steam Deck, we're currently missing all the extra options and better quality streaming on Desktop Linux. GeForce Infinity is not from NVIDIA directly but made by the community. It's also not the first of its kind, there's also GeForce NOW Electron that's been going for some time.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13793394291753091116gol1.png"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the GitHub the current features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhanced UI</strong>: GeForce Infinity aims to improve the user interface of GeForce NOW, providing a more intuitive and enjoyable experience.</li>
<li><strong>Custom Discord Rich Presence</strong>: Show off your gaming status with personalized Discord Rich Presence. Display game details and status updates directly in your Discord profile.</li>
<li><strong>Instant App Switch</strong>: Automatically switch to GeForce Infinity once your gaming rig is ready for action!</li>
<li><strong>Notifications</strong>: Get notified once your gaming rig is ready for action!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They're also planning to add Discord Rich Presence, account switching and automatic game startup options.</p>
<p>It still has the issues other apps and using GeForce NOW in the browser have, with the options for quality and resolution being limited because NVIDIA don't support a lot of it on Desktop Linux even if you have their highest subscription.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://github.com/AstralVixen/GeForce-Infinity" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the GitHub</a> for more info.</p>

      <title>Steam Beta upgrades the in-game performance monitor for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/steam-gets-a-new-steam-deck-like-performance-monitor-now-in-beta-replacing-the-fps-counter/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Back in June</a>, Valve revealed the new performance monitor for the in-game Steam overlay, and now the Linux version has been upgraded.</p>
<p>Initially, only Windows had all the extra options with Linux stuck with just FPS details. Now we get all the extras too as of the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/545615175941619843?snr=2___" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">July 17th</a> Steam Beta, as long as you have an AMD or NVIDIA GPU. You can select between seeing just FPS value, FPS details, FPS details with CPU and GPU utilisation and then a further option to get everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7456466821753088098gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7456466821753088098gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The screenshot above (click it to enlarge) shows Cyberpunk 2077 on Linux with the new Steam performance monitor (top left), with the most detailed option picked.</p>
<p>While it's good to have options, and this is better than just the FPS value that the in-game overlay had, you can still get far <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-use-mangohud-for-linux-game-performance-monitoring/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">more customization on Linux with MangoHud</a>.</p>
<p>The full changes from the Steam Beta:</p>
<blockquote><strong>General</strong>
<ul>
<li>Added a notification for when a trade is reversed via Trade Protection</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with deleting screenshots from the focused screenshot view briefly showing an error and potentially navigating the user away from their screenshots</li>
<li>Fixed minimum and maximum client window size not updating in some situations.</li>
<li>Fixed friends list window remaining open in Steam overlay when switching between desktop and Big Picture Mode.</li>
<li>Fixed modal dialogs opening behind the window displaying them.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Steam Input</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed gamepad input for browser-based games on Windows</li>
<li>Added support for the PDP REALMz Wireless Controller for Switch</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where editing commands on an input bound to a modeshift could duplicate bindings</li>
<li>No longer open Big Picture Mode on Guide button press when guide button chording is disabled in controller settings</li>
</ul>
<strong>Game Recording</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the player pausing when seeking near the end of a game recording or clip</li>
</ul>
<strong>macOS</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed input on some web views working incorrectly after page loads causing effects like input cursor not displaying and payment dropdown during checkout continuing to have focus after selecting an option.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Linux</strong>
<ul>
<li>Enabled advanced options for the in-game performance overlay for AMD and Nvidia GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare case where the Big Picture update progress UI would disappear.</li>
</ul>

      <title>According to one source Linux hits over 6% desktop user share</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Depending on where you look, Linux on the desktop has somewhere between 4-6% user share on the desktop. Showing it's growing slowly but steadily overall.</p>
<p>A lot of people like to look at Statcounter, which we've covered here at GamingOnLinux quite a few times which currently showings Linux on the desktop at about 4.1% for June 2025 globally. However, there's another pretty big source of data we can use for checking on this – the US government.</p>
<p>Using the US government <a href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">public data</a>, we can see that over the last 30 days the Linux user share hit an all-time high there at 6.1%. Pretty healthy looking percentage there, and if we filter it to the current calendar year overall it's at 5.8%. That's a surprisingly high number, given their data mentions how they've had "1.48 billion sessions in the last 30 days" to pull the data from.</p>
<p>Going back to <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/united-states-of-america" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Statcounter</a> and filtering to the US, it's also showing an all-time high for Linux at 5.1% too. And then there's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our Steam Tracker</a>, showing Linux for gaming has been steadily trending upwards too.</p>
<p>We've all seen the running joke of the "Year of the Linux desktop", and while most celebrations on it are rather premature, we've truly over the last year or two seen quite a seismic shift in how people have been looking at Linux. Not just from data points like these, but the wider consensus when you look at how even bigger influencers have been pouring more time into covering Linux too (and their videos doing well). Look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVI_smLgTY0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">PewDiePie</a> with 110M subscribers telling people to now install Linux, or how about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa8nMiEoti0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">JayzTwoCents</a> too and various others.</p>
<p>Seems like there's never been a better time to try out Linux on the desktop.</p>

      <title>Next-generation brick building sandbox Brickadia is out with Linux / Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Roblox? LEGO? Who needs it. I'm all about Brickadia life now. Out in Early Access, it's a next-generation mixture of LEGO styled block building, a little of Garry's Mod too perhaps and Roblox style mini-games.</p>
<p>A dynamic sandbox where your imagination is (sometimes) the limit, game features allowing of course. There's already a lot you can do with it too with real-time co-op building all directly in-game with no external editors needed. This includes fully functioning vehicles, a wiring system and big open-world environments.</p>
<p>While I was in the middle of writing this up as I previously spoke to the developer and they provided a key, another email entered the GamingOnLinux inbox today and they certainly knew how to get my attention. With a title starting "*LINUX PLAYERS!*" — okay, you got me.</p>
<p>In the email they noted "Brickadia is fully playable on Steam Deck with great performance, and works nicely on other desktops through Proton. The studio is working on being listed as Verified for the Steam Deck. A Linux dedicated server is also available". True to their word, it works great with Proton 9.0-4 on Desktop Linux.</p>
<p>See, it doesn't take much. While the likes of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/game-over-for-roblox-on-linux-steam-deck-as-its-now-blocked/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Roblox continue to just block Linux platforms</a> along with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">various other games with anti-cheat</a>, perhaps something like Brickadia could eventually take its place. Once it's further along of course, there's a lot of work ahead of it that the developers are aware they need to either fix, improve or expand upon.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5XXUGW41jos"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7edbbf106055dce2c789b73ed58b9332.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5XXUGW41jos" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some highlights the developers noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Unleash Your Creativity: Build absolutely anything you can imagine with a powerful, intuitive building system that handles millions of bricks effortlessly. Any brick can be turned into a physics object using the Selector tool.</li>
<li>Build Together, Live: No need for external editors, everything is done in-game. Modify the world in real-time alongside friends, enabling seamless creative collaboration in multiplayer.</li>
<li>Play Your Way: From high-intensity combat gamemodes to laid-back social servers for building and hanging out, Brickadia supports a wide range of play styles.</li>
<li>Vehicle Creation: Design and build your own cars out of bricks, complete with engines, seats, and a variety of wheels to choose from.</li>
<li>Build Boats and Ships: Construct floating vehicles with buoyancy physics, engine bricks, and seats perfect for exploring or racing on water.</li>
<li>Bring Builds to Life with Wires: Use a powerful wiring system to make your creations interactive. With an easy-to-use wiring tool and a wide range of functional gates and components, complex logic is at your fingertips</li>
<li>Advanced Mechanics: Combine physics joints with wire circuits to build intricate, functional machines using an advanced physics engine.</li>
<li>Explore and Share with the Gallery: Instantly access massive player-made worlds and a huge collection of community-built prefabs through the in-game Gallery.</li>
<li>Dynamic Worlds: A fully customizable environment system lets you control stunning visuals and weather effects, with real volumetric clouds!</li>
<li>Lighting That Pops: Add dynamic lights to bricks to enhance the look and feel of your builds with gorgeous detail.</li>
<li>Immersive Audio: Integrate ambient sounds and custom effects into your creations using versatile audio components.</li>
<li>Next-Gen Visuals: Enjoy breathtaking graphics powered by HDR and ray tracing, making your worlds and creations look better than ever.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It is impressive though. Not only does it look great but it performs well too and I do love how accessible it all is to get going, it's really very inviting. This could end up being a great one for all audiences of all ages. There's some clever tools it gives you too that will no doubt be an absolute dream for LEGO building enthusiasts. Being able to warp blocks in various directions, copy and paste and more — there's so much to like about it.</p>
<p>Early indicators are that players have been enjoying it, with a Very Positive rating on Steam. However, games like this that entirely rely on a community can live and die rather quickly, it's a risky bet for game devs. We've seen lots and lots and lots more fail when they can't keep a player count so it will be interesting to see if they manage to do so. It's a tough world out there in game dev land. I'm hoping for the best on this one.</p>

      <title>Kaizen: A Factory Story is a great return from the Zachtronics team</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Reformed under the new studio Coincidence, the team from Zachtronics have now released Kaizen: A Factory Story with Linux / SteamOS support. It's also rated Steam Deck Playable by Valve. <em>Note: key provided by their PR team.</em></p>
<p>One of my favourite automation games is actually from Zachtronics, where I was completely captivated by Opus Magnum when it released back in 2017. And of course, because it's <s>Zachtronics</s>, uh - Coincidence, it comes complete with another solitaire game but this time with a pachinko theme to it. Nice to see them return to their roots a bit more with this one.</p>
<p>So what is it? Well, you might think you know what to expect from an automation puzzle game like it but it will surprise you a bit. Especially the visual novel styled intro, where you have to do a little musical rhythm game that I failed <em>miserably</em> at but it didn't seem to cause any problems. I just wasn't prepared for mashing a few keys like it when going in. You got me there, Coincidence. </p>
<p>For the main part of the game once you get into it your goal is to design production lines to create specific products. You get given a bunch of parts, and then it's up to you how they all fit together to make whatever retro product it is that you're tasked with. What you do is drag and drop pieces of the product around, and then the parts of the factory machines you're going to use onto a board, do a little simple code-block programming and see if it all comes together.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2450833791752840064gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2450833791752840064gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>If it doesn't, move all the pieces around until it will. Using a mixture of welders, arms that push things around and more eventually you'll have lots of moving parts that becomes a joy to watch.</p>
<p>In between you get more little visual novel bits diving into the expanding story of how you, David, were really not meant to be building things in a factory.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Ib8YhZSgb_s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9ee58aa00b0af3a26f62c3679835bebb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Ib8YhZSgb_s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Compared with other similar games from the developers formerly at Zachtronics, it feels a lot less complicated. It's much more inviting and feels a lot more like you're slotting puzzle pieces together with a little automation flair. Still quite puzzling at times though, a few of them really left me scratching my head for a while. The inviting nature of it can certainly hide the challenge.</p>
<p>If you like the sound of some puzzling automation wrapped up in a retro 1980s Japanese theme, it's one for you. It's not perfect though, as story-telling clearly still isn't a strong point for the developers with nothing about the story and dialogue being at all interesting or noteworthy, it's just kind of…there. It breaks up the building a little, but that's exactly why we're all here. Other than that, it still makes me feel like a tiny genius when I solve the later levels so i did really enjoy it.</p>

      <title>If you love Brotato you should check out Noobs Are Coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Noobs Are Coming is a new release that takes the skin of Brotato and puts you in the shoes of a final boss, complete with really weird abilities. <em>Note: key provided by the developer.</em></p>
<p>The developer said they were directly inspired by Brotato and The Binding of Isaac, which you can tell within a few seconds based on the gameplay and some of the visual style. It's an arena-based top-down rogue-lite shooter, where you pick a boss and go through rounds where you get more and more powerful. </p>
<p>You likely already know the drill for these games but if not — you pick a character and some abilities, then run around a small arena fighting off waves of enemies while collecting experience points from little orbs they drop. In between waves you spend orbs to add new weapons to your arsenal, or upgrade existing weapons and add buffs to your character ready to go through the next more challenging wave.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="159Mh6z_YY0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e21a6eec8bd11c502431acc068381669.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/159Mh6z_YY0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Currently in Early Access so it's not a finished game but what it has is good fun though, with lots of weird combinations to try out for all the characters. They're all so different which is nice, with their play-style being thoroughly unique between them on what you can pick to begin with and how you can power up during a run. Like the boss that starts with a mini-me attached to you via an umbilical cord that you can keep upgrading, or the ability to repeatedly plant an angry tomato you need to run over to water and then they will spring up and dash at enemies. It can be pretty funny in a completely ridiculous way.</p>
<p>I'm keen to see how it will evolve during Early Access, as I think it still needs to pull itself apart from the Brotato roots just a little bit more.</p>
<p>Quite an early hit too with it selling over 5,000 copies in a single day. Not a lot for bigger developers but pretty great for a tiny indie with no real marketing behind it. </p>
<p>The developer mentioned they plan to add "more content, such as new playable characters, weapons, items, enemies" and they're looking into "expanding playstyle variety to deepen build options and synergies".</p>
<p>If you love fast-paced arena fights with auto-shooting like Brotato, Vampire Survivors and the like you'll probably get on quite well with this. The Native Linux version tested runs well, although the Steam Overlay didn't work with it for me.</p>

      <title>Handmade stop-motion digging adventure Mashina arrives July 31</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From the team that made Judero, the handmade stop-motion digging adventure Mashina is set to arrive on July 31st.</p>
<p>I really love what they're doing with the art in their games, there's truly not many at all that will go to these lengths to make their games stand out in this way. Every single thing in the game is made out of various materials and animated using traditional stop-motion techniques. The gameplay looks just a weird and wacky as the art-style.</p>
<p>You play as Mashina, a friendly mining robot tasked with finding minerals to help mend, build and nurture her quirky robot community. The gameplay in Mashina is divided into two distinct sections; a deep, mysterious underground full of trinkets and minerals and a vibrant, fully explorable 3d overground.</p>
<p>Check it out below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="XH2zSrOoMgY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3bd3f888daf4b94d21b4a3612758938d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/XH2zSrOoMgY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Traditional Stop-Motion Animation:</strong> Everything in Mashina is handmade out of various materials and animated using traditional stop-motion techniques.</li>
<li><strong>Digging / Mining:</strong> An entire under world to explore and dig around! Dig by hand, use your radar to find precious items and work your way up to a fully automated process with tools and inventions you find along the way!</li>
<li><strong>Inventory Management:</strong> Digging up minerals, trinkets and treasures takes up a lot of space! Make sure you manage your inventory to maximize your time in the under world.</li>
<li><strong>Secret Items and Unlockables:</strong> Excavate rare minerals, find items that help you unlock new inventions and friends that will join you and help you on your adventure!</li>
<li><strong>Equipment Upgrades:</strong> Upgrade your digging and mining equipment to maximize your under world operation!</li>
<li><strong>Exploration and Base Building:</strong> Take the items you find in the under world above ground! Friends around your island help you in all sorts of ways!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Their previous game Judero is Steam Deck Verified and Platinum on ProtonDB, no doubt this will work well too.</p>

      <title>2.5D turn-based strategy game Avante! Atlantis gives off Advance Wars vibes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Avante! Atlantis is an upcoming turn-based strategy game that looks like you're playing a board game with a clever 2.5D style. The developer recently announced full Native Linux and Steam Deck support. There's a demo available right now too which they keep updating for you to get an early taste of what's to come.</p>
<p>More about it: "Amid global conflict and scarce resources, the lost city of Atlantis has mysteriously resurfaced. Rich in natural resources, it quickly becomes the focus of every major nation’s ambitions. But Atlantis didn’t return by chance. As battles rage across its ruins, a deeper mystery begins to unfold...one that could reshape the world."</p>
<p>Getting some Advance Wars vibes from this one for the mixture of the level and battle scene style, but at least unlike other very similar games to Advance Wars, the overall aesthetic is more unique.</p>
<p>Check out their original trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="pwu3zAk393g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/44396f1de752540406f63d13892d60fa.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/pwu3zAk393g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>

<li>Many ways to Play!: Battle solo or compete with friends in exciting matches! Play locally or over LAN for an intense and thrilling experience. Up to 4 Players in a match!</li>
<li>Board Game Experience: Roll the dice for victory! Each roll can slightly boost or reduce your unit’s base power, adding a small layer of unpredictability to your strategy.</li>
<li>Diverse Biomes: Battle across four distinct environments, each featuring unique tiles, like the life-restoring Oasis or the fragile Ice that can shatter beneath your units at any moment!</li>
<li>Commanders: Choose from 8 charming and unique Commanders, each with a special ability to turn the tide of battle in your favor!</li>

      <title>City-building on the back of a giant creature, The Wandering Village 1.0 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Wandering Village from Stray Fawn Studio is a really unique city-builder that takes place on the back of a giant moving creature. It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified / SteamOS Compatible.</p>
<p>It's unlike any other village / city-builder I've played due to the way the game progresses, with you going through different locations with events. A really great idea and visually pleasing too. Nice to see it fully release now with a lot of content enhancements since the initial Early Access release. </p>
<p>As usual for a lot of games now, the 1.0 release is not the end of the road. They're working on addressing feedback and a 1.1 "Quality of Life &amp; UX update" is planned, along with a further 1.2 update to expand the interactions and relationship you have with the giant creature named Onbu.</p>
<p>For the 1.0 release they made a sweet animated trailer:</p>

      <title>Old School Rally gets hit with a DMCA and taken down from Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Showing just how tough game dev can be for smaller teams and solo devs, Old School Rally has been hit with a DMCA and the Steam store page is gone. This is hopefully only a temporary situation, while the developer of the game works through the issue.</p>
<p>Writing in a Steam <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2824660/discussions/0/590651049589629945/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">forum post</a> the developer noted how they sourced certain car models from Sketchfab, a website where people can share and buy 3D models. The game developer said they spoke to the original uploader to verify approval for use in the game. All of that was agreed, so the game developer continued using the models and released the game with them. Unfortunately, a week ago the game developer received a claim of ownership over the car models from someone else. The original uploader of the car models maintained they own them, and the game developer reached out to the claimant to explore solutions. Sadly, "on Monday Old School Rally was abruptly issued with a DMCA takedown notice, prompting Steam to temporarily remove the game from the store as per their policies (which is standard practice)".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="62T8hbNBXfo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fdb06debb31eecbe3832d3f42dc0fe46.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/62T8hbNBXfo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>So for now the game store page is just gone. The game developer is planning to update the game to lock the models and note they will return, as they're working on "all-original car model designs that still show resemblances to the classic legendary rally cars that we all love as replacements in waves".</p>
<p>What a sticky situation. Dev grabs models with the author's permission, and it turns out they might not actually own those models. Just goes to show how difficult it can be for game devs sourcing art from elsewhere. And, with the rise of AI generation, that might only get more troublesome.</p>

      <title>Cyberpunk 2077 2.3 is out with new vehicles, auto drive, AMD FSR 4, Intel XeSS 2 and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>CD PROJEKT RED have released the latest major free update for Cyberpunk 2077 today, bringing with it new content and graphics enhancements. It's quite a big one too, with a lot more than I expected them to add in after the last update. Nice to see them still continue to expand it though.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qPcPBaWhny4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/64a924f4b2cf93127f147f1ca37d22cc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qPcPBaWhny4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The full changelog:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Vehicles</h4>
<ul>
<li>Added 4 new vehicles, including several Side Jobs tied to acquiring them:
	<ul>
<li><strong>Yaiba ARV-Q340 Semimaru</strong> Reward from a new side job (to unlock, complete The Hunt and The Beast In Me). An additional side job unlocks the CrystalCoat™ feature for it.</li>
<li><strong>Rayfield Caliburn "Mordred"</strong> Reward from a new side job (to unlock, complete The Beast in Me: Badlands, The Beast in Me: Santo Domingo, Transmission, and Search and Destroy)."</li>
<li><strong>Yaiba ASM-R250 Muramasa</strong> Reward from a new side job (to unlock, purchase 1 Yaiba vehicle, purchase at least 3 vehicles through AUTOFIXER, and complete Reported Crime: You Play with Fire...). If you fail the side job, the vehicle can later be purchased through AUTOFIXER.</li>
<li><strong>Chevillon Legatus 450 Aquila</strong> Available for purchase on AUTOFIXER.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Introducing AutoDrive! This cutting-edge, autonomous driving feature will take you to your chosen destination (i.e. job objective or placed pin on the map). If you have no set destination, it will take you on a leisurely ride through the streets of Night City. Simply hop in any of your vehicles, make sure you're on a road, and hold H (PC) / Left Stick (consoles) to activate. This feature is disabled when you enter combat or when your vehicle is heavily damaged.</li>
<li>Implemented Cinematic Camera for AutoDrive. Hold Q (PC) / D-Pad Right (consoles) to activate. Sit back and enjoy cinematic views of Night City as you cruise toward your destination.</li>

<li>Rayfield's CrystalCoat™ is now available for vehicles from partner brands, including motorcycles. Additionally, the infamous hacker known as Cosmetic_Troll exploited a vulnerability and created a cracked version of Rayfield's CrystalCoat™ technology for lower-end vehicles.

<li>Fixed an issue where unique color schemes did not work properly on the Mizutani Shion MZ1 and MZ2.</li>

      <title>NVIDIA 570.172.08 released for Linux as the main stable driver</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA are continuing to make us guess what's included in their updates with the NVIDIA driver <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/details/249205/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">570.172.08</a> release today.</p>
<p>This is part of their Recommended/Certified driver series, their main stable series that updates a bit slower with new features compared with the New Feature Branch. Much like NVIDIA did with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/nvidia-stable-driver-575-64-03-released/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent driver 575.64.03 release</a>, they're being rather vague as they channel mobile app store changelog energy with this.</p>
<p>The entire changelog is:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Minor bug fixes and improvements</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep. And unlike the 575.64.03 release, they haven't stealthily added RTX 5050 support to it as that's not currently listed in the supported products for this driver.</p>
<p>At this point I can only speculate, as it's not even listed yet on the NVIDIA open-gpu-kernel-modules GitHub to sleuth through. Perhaps we <em>might</em> see some more security issues get revealed in a few weeks / month, which would make some sense on why they're being repeatedly vague with these latest two driver updates as to not give anything away but get people updated and prepared.

      <title>Extreme sports game Descenders Next is Steam Deck Verified ahead of release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Extreme sports game Descenders Next is set to arrive sometime soon, and they've ensured it works well on Steam Deck as it's Verified ahead of release. They're not giving the release date out for Early Access yet, but the publisher has already sent a key for GamingOnLinux testing.</p>
<p>More about it: "It's time to conquer the world of extreme sports. This is Descenders Next. Grab your snowboard and tackle the steep, snowy slopes, or tear up the harsh, lush terrain with your mountainboard! Feel like taking on the challenge with a squad? Match up with your friends and Descenders players all around the world, and take on the tracks together! The mountain is calling - will you master it?"</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3155816311752758559gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Sharing the Steam Deck news in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2375530/view/535481986904490066" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they said "One of the main things we wanted to make sure is that Descenders Next runs great on Steam Deck, so we're super glad we can give you the ultimate experience!". The status isn't live yet, but developers do get notified before the Steam Deck notice goes live.</p>
<p>It was originally due to launch April 9th, but it was delayed in March to give it a little more time to cook. During Early Access they plan to add in more sports, more game modes - more everything.</p>
<p>They have more news to come on Descenders Day, July 21st.</p>

      <title>Impressive free and open source RTS 0 A.D. gets an essential patch update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>0 A.D. is a free and open source RTS game that saw a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/open-source-rts-0-a-d-alpha-27-released-bringing-a-new-vulkan-renderer-new-maps-amd-fsr-and-lots-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">first release in years back in January</a>, now an important bug fix patch is out now. This aims to clean up the most pressing issues, as part of their new workflow to get releases out much quicker.</p>
<p>The game has often been compared to the likes of Age of Empires, actually starting life as a concept mod for Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings. It's a full free standalone strategy game like the classics.</p>
<p>See the previous update trailer for some footage on it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3MhcRPm7Zhg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6c87fd27136abb6533f05e58d5d13c35.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3MhcRPm7Zhg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here are the changes included in A27.1:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A fix for the large performance issue observed by some players on older hardware.</li>
<li>Several small performance improvements in the calculation of simulation hashes (related to multiplayer stuttering).</li>
<li>Fixed support of Windows 7.</li>
<li>A fix for modifying your lobby password when you have an uppercase letter in your username.</li>
<li>A fix for the distorted 3D models with GPU Skinning.</li>
<li>Fixes for crashes with Vulkan and/or with GPU Skinning.</li>
<li>A fix for changing player perspective in replays.</li>
<li>A fix for an out-of-memory crash in the JS engine when generating random maps.</li>
<li>A fix for the game crash on pressing Fn key.</li>
<li>A fix for a crash in Atlas when the map generation fails.</li>
<li>A fix for a memory leak in the renderer.</li>
<li>Fixes for multiplayer port forwarding.</li>
<li>Package fixes for Linux desktop environments.</li>
<li>Various build fixes for Linux (some sent by package managers).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's compatible with players who do not have the release, as it's just a small essential update while they work on the next major version.</p>
