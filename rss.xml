      <title>Lancer Tactics announced adapting the tabletop roleplaying game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love your mechs? Lancer Tactics was announced recently, as a video game adaption of the popular crowdfunded tabletop roleplaying game.</p>
<p>The original campaign for the TTRPG pulled in a healthy $432K, so it's not a surprise to see this new crowdfunding campaign to turn it into a cross-platform video game (Linux, macOS, Windows) has been a success already at $94K funding with 16 days left to go.</p>
<p>On the campaign the developer mentioned how they "love this system of modular mechs, and I'm sad and furious at our historical and current politics — let's make a game where you can fight imperialist land-stealing goons by being gay and doing crime in giant robots!". Worth noting this is an unofficial adaption, but approved thanks to Lancer's very easy-going <a href="https://massifpress.com/legal" target="_blank">licensing</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="agKmRrReaHo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cc673ff6378aa38a33141709d80d7360.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/agKmRrReaHo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Fun fact: it's being developed with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>. The developer previously created <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/372030/Starship_Rubicon/" target="_blank">Starship Rubicon</a> and <a href="https://crescentloom.com/" target="_blank">Crescent Loom</a>, both of which also support Linux.</p>

      <title>Marble It Up! gets Native Linux support in Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Up for a challenge? Marble-rolling platformer Marble It Up! just recently gained Native Linux support in a Beta.</p>
<p>Announced by game porter and FNA developer Ethan Lee on <a href="https://twitter.com/flibitijibibo/status/1634632058889707520" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, you'll need to force the Steam Linux Runtime on Steam Deck to get it to download after opting into the Beta. On Desktop Linux, just installing it with the Beta selected should be fine.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6vtTBc65ZVc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7de1c7440178d8e1735a64ee9276c625.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6vtTBc65ZVc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Developed by the minds behind the Marble Blast series, if any of you are familiar with that.</p>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Chapters</strong> - Experience the pure joy of rolling in 60 levels filled to the brim with dangerous obstacles, mind-bending paths, brand new hazards, shifting gravity, and flexible power ups - all while taking in the beautifully intricate, geometric visuals!</li>
<li><strong>The Collectibles</strong> - Over 100 unique marbles are just waiting to be collected! Complete chapters, earn medals, find hidden trophies, and play Weekly Challenges to grow your magnificent marble collection! Play for keeps!</li>
<li><strong>The Challenges</strong> - All new game mode: Weekly Challenges. Every week, we break our own rules on a select set of maps. Low gravity? Double jump? No powerups? How about all three? Compete each week for rewards!</li>
<li><strong>The Chase</strong> - Global and friends leaderboards, replays, ghost races, and a rewindable practice mode? Say hello to all the tools you’ll ever need to become the best player in the world and top your friends list!</li>
<li><strong>The Community</strong> - The Steam Workshop is overflowing with fantastic user-made maps from our talented, passionate, and dedicated community! Over 200 levels are roll-ready and available with a few simple clicks!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently noted as Unsupported by Valve on Steam Deck, perhaps this work in the upcoming update and Native Linux port will help bring it up to Verified.</p>
<p>Marble It Up! is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/864060/Marble_It_Up/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Steampunk survival game Volcanoids has been invaded by drones</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I think it might be seriously time to play a whole lot more Volcanoids, with the new Ground Support update adding in special drones you can build and it looks awesome. The update also adds in new achievements, a few performance improvements, Japanese and Dutch translations, audio improvements and lots of bug fixes.</p>
<p>This is the survival game where instead of building up a big sprawling base, you have a steampunk drillship to burrow deep underground with. It's a really clever idea that they keep expanding on during Early Access. These new drones you can build can help with defence, mining and more — you can even build a little fort with them. Check out the new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="x-LrzyT3sAo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2dbc1c3988d1ec2b6e1f74ededbad919.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/x-LrzyT3sAo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Going back to it today, I'm impressed by how far it has come. Even at a 1440p resolution, it's performing so much better than it used to. Some small loading hiccups here and there but other than that, it seems to have progressed nicely. Looks a fair bit better too. If you're after a survival game that you can do in co-op, that's quite different to all the rest, it's worth a look for sure.</p>
<p>The game gets surprisingly spooky at times too. With you always on a timer before a volcano erupts, once it does and you come back up to the smoke seeing all the little lights of various enemies is quite unique.</p>

      <title>Turn-based colony builder on the red planet Terraformers is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a while in Early Access, Terraformers from Asteroid Lab and Goblinz Publishing / IndieArk is officially out now with the 1.0 update. Another great looking game that offers Native Linux support.</p>
<p>You face the challenge of turning the rather barren Mars into a lush thriving planet, capable of supporting a growing number of people. In a way it's similar to Surviving Mars, however it's turn-based instead of real-time and gives you a procedurally generated world to start anew each time.</p>

<li>Found new cities on the nearby moons of Phobos and Deimos.</li>
<li>Construct new buildings, complete new space projects, and research new technologies.</li>
<li>Contend with five new events, including the catastrophic asteroid event.</li>
<li>Two new leaders, each with their own background, skills, and perks.</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Curious about this one, since I'm a big fan of strategy games and I love sci-fi themes like this, I decided to pick it up and see what it was like. I can easily see why so many people like it, it definitely gives off that feeling of needing "just one more turn" so you can keep on expanding. Even though it can be a difficult balancing act on all the resources, the support and happiness of your people and the random events, it always feels pretty chilled out.</p>

      <title>Action-RPG in Early Access &#39;Last Epoch&#39; adds in online multiplayer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A day many players have been waiting for, Last Epoch has finally added in multiplayer amongst a number of other big changes to this action RPG. It's been in Early Access on Steam since April 2019, but also had a Beta outside of Steam back in 2018 so it's been going for some time now but the full release is due later this year and this is a big step towards it.</p>
<p>"Last Epoch combines time travel, exciting dungeon crawling, engrossing character customization and endless replayability to create an Action RPG for veterans and newcomers alike. Travel through the world of Eterra’s past and face dark empires, wrathful gods and untouched wilds – to find a way to save time itself from The Void."</p>

<p>Some of what's in the patch includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Multiplayer!</li>
<li>New 3D models for new and existing Uniques.</li>
<li>New Armor sets for Acolyte, Mage, Primalist, Rogue, and Sentinel.</li>
<li>New Unique Items.</li>
<li>Balance Changes, including almost every skill in the game.</li>
<li>Performance Improvements.</li>
<li>New Music &amp; Sound.</li>
<li>New Player animations, and skill VFX.</li>
<li>New Bone Golem and Manifest Armor models.</li>
<li>New Enemies.</li>
<li>Reworked Zones.</li>
<li>New Monolith Maps.</li>
<li>Bug Fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently, the Native Linux version does suffer from some graphical issues. Like the character classes being pretty much invisible on the character creation screen, aside from that though (which is annoying but not game-breaking) it does seem to work quite well. The bug has been there for over a year, so I sure hope they look to solve it soon…</p>
<p>Looks like the new update has given it quite the surge in popularity too, with it hitting a new all-time high of 40,591 just recently. Before this, it would only see 1-2K players online on an average day.</p>

      <title>Railbound gets Steam Deck Verified with a new update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Railbound looks great, a relaxing puzzle game about fixing train connections and travelling the world and now it's Steam Deck Verified. It released back in September 2022 and it has an Overwhelmingly Positive user score on Steam.</p>
<p>Seems like quite a sweet game overall, although it has less than a thousand user reviews on Steam, so it didn't seem to find a big audience. In the latest patch from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1967510/view/3678916525458877980" target="_blank">March 9th</a> they mentioned these improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Railbound is now Steam Deck verified!</li>
<li>Steam Deck version now supports both gamepad and cursor-based inputs.</li>
<li>Steam Deck version now defaults to Borderless window mode.</li>
<li>&gt; Previously, switching to Fullscreen mode would result in game crashes which is why we left only this option enabled.</li>
<li>Hidden social buttons in the Steam Deck version.</li>
<li>Added commit ID to watermark info in the main menu to help us figure out what was the origin of the current build.</li>
<li>Updated in-game credits.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>200+ puzzles to solve across different parts of the world.</li>
<li>Place, remove and reroute connections so that carriages safely connect to the locomotive.</li>
<li>Various train-inspired mechanics - tunnels, semaphores and more.</li>

      <title>NVIDIA Vulkan Beta driver 525.47.13 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Over the weekend NVIDIA released a fresh small update to their developer-focused <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" target="_blank">Vulkan Beta driver</a>. Primarily meant for those who need all the very latest in the Vulkan API world, to help with game development or work on projects like Proton / DXVK / VKD3D-Proton and so on.</p>
<p>Version 525.47.13 released March 11th has these changes included:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Vulkan Video not working on NVIDIA Ada family of GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed the disk cache to handle UTF-8 paths.</li>
<li>Improved robustness of vkCreatePipelineCache with invalid data.</li>
<li>Fixed corruption that may occur when rendering with a previously resolved depth image.</li>
<li>Fixed rare SPIR-V control flow bug that may result in infinite loop.</li>
<li>Fixed the coherency order not being consistent between atomic loads and atomic stores.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The current latest for normal desktop gamers is still the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/nvidia-5303002-mainline-beta-driver-rolls-out-plus-a-new-vulkan-beta-driver/" target="_blank">530.30.02 Beta</a> from February. Once that releases as stable, I'll be sure to let you know. NVIDIA never really give a roadmap as to when to expect things to move from Beta to stable though.</p>

      <title>Slick tactical space RPG &#39;Relic Space&#39; is out in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Relic Space combines together smooth turn-based movement (think like Jupiter Hell) with tactical combat, RPG mechanics and 4X elements. With Native Linux support, this could be your next game?</p>
<p>Taking place in the year 2612, Relic Space features over 40 distinct regions that you can explore while customizing and upgrading your ships. Beyond grid-based, tactical turn-based combat familiar to fans of traditional roguelikes, Relic Space also features realistic damage (think BattleTech) with status effects for individual items. Each weapon, engine or utility item can catch fire, leak power, and generally be buffed and debuffed. Equipment items also affect the ship in unique ways – including manual adjustments for heat and energy levels.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HjDaroAg0ec"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9663c144bbae75164881425f05852e83.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HjDaroAg0ec" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking about the game, developer Jonah Wilberg said "Relic Space is very much inspired by classic roguelikes like Angband as well as more recent fare like Cogmind and Approaching Infinity. But I really push the boundaries of roguelike tradition by mixing in 3D visuals, the narrative depth of classic RPGs, and Newtonian physics. It’s been the challenge of translating physics-based, starship movement onto a hex-grid that has allowed me to really innovate with respect to the core, turn-based combat loop – creating a system that (as I’ve heard from those who played the demo) feels really fresh while still being intuitive. I can’t wait to build on all this with the growing community after the Early Access release."</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Tactical turn-based space combat: Use your tactical skills on a hex grid with fast-paced ‘one-tile-per-turn’ mechanics – inspired by traditional roguelikes but with a fluid, modern feel.</li>
<li>Deep simulation: Realistic combat mechanics simulate damage to individual ship components. Each weapon, engine or utility item can catch fire, leak power, and acquire many more status effects. You will also need to manage heat, energy and fuel levels by making smart movement and equipment choices.</li>
<li>Non-linear exploration: Freely traverse a procedurally generated solar system with handcrafted elements; 4 main factions and 7 minor factions pursue research, trade, construction projects, and other goals.</li>
<li>Flexible development: Use your growing reputation and influence to acquire more powerful ships and equip them with countless weapon and utility combinations. Acquire new piloting abilities through a flexible skill tree, and research relics to unlock new powers and equipment.</li>
<li>Immersive setting: Uncover a rich, branching narrative threaded with endless procedurally generated stories in a detailed setting inspired by hard sci-fi.</li>
<li>Real space: Movement rules based on actual space physics: motion in a straight line is free – but turning, starting or stopping costs energy.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available now in Early Access with Linux support on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1146420/Relic_Space/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. There's also a demo on <a href="https://logophil.itch.io/relicspace" target="_blank">itch.io</a>.</p>

      <title>No true next-gen Steam Deck for &#39;a few years&#39; Valve say</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As expected really, Valve said they don't really expect to see a true next-gen Steam Deck for a few years yet. Speaking to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-community-continues-to-blow-our-minds-valve-talk-the-steam-deck-one-year-on" target="_blank">Rock Paper Shotgun</a>, it's clear Valve are very happy with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/steam-deck-thoughts-a-year-later/" target="_blank">first year of the Steam Deck</a>.</p>
<p>Talking to Valve's Lawrence Yang and engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais, it seems it has been blowing their minds. Something of a surprise though, even to me, is that Yang mentioned how they've noticed that "of the people who've purchased a Steam Deck, 42% of them end up spending the majority of their Steam gaming time on Steam Deck – preferring it over their other devices".</p>
<p>So not only is it still selling like tasty sugar-coated hot doughnuts, with it being in the top 10 of global sellers (based on revenue from <a href="https://steamdb.info/topsellers/2023W01/" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>) where it's up against games shifting multiple millions, plenty of people are sticking with it and even shifting over to it.</p>
<p>One sticking point is more games coming out that don't perform well, and while the Steam Deck is impressive, it all depends on developers actually optimising for the hardware, as Griffais said "it'll depend on how developers approach it" and that "If high-end current-gen titles are able to scale to Deck and be a great experience, it also enables smoother performance on a wider variety of PCs, and improve the experience for the whole playerbase". Yang also mentioned how they've "seen a number of recently released demanding titles perform well on Steam Deck, due to developers targeting and testing on the device.".</p>
<p>As always, the problem is in numbers. If the Steam Deck continues selling well, developers won't be able to ignore it. I've seen many games perform brilliantly, even surprisingly so, when they've clearly had a lot of optimization done on them. Then I've also seen the opposite myself, with games that you would think would also work well simply don't (often these bigger AAA games that primarily seem to target consoles…).</p>
<p>When it comes to a true Steam Deck 2, we're clearly in for a wait, as Yang said "a true next-gen Deck with a significant bump in horsepower wouldn’t be for a few years".</p>
<p><em>Valve don't exactly need much to make the Steam Deck 2 a success — <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/valve-doesnt-need-much-to-make-a-steam-deck-2-a-huge-success/" target="_blank">or do they</a>?</em></p>

      <title>Aethermancer is a new creature collector rogue-lite from the dev of Monster Sanctuary</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems moi rai games are sticking to what they know, with them moving on from Monster Sanctuary (which is still being updated) to their new announcement with Aethermancer.</p>
<p>They said it will include things from Monster Sanctuary they liked including "strategic choices, deep team-synergies and every monster being truly unique and viable" but it will also blend in "roguelite elements, a unique rebirth-system and a resource-based combat system" along with it being from a top-down perspective instead of a side-scroller.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

Adapt your strategy to each combat, consider your synergies, and plan the actions of your Monsters wisely. Harness and manage the four elements of Aether in order to unleash powerful spells. But whatever you do, make sure you watch the HP of your Monsters...</li>
<li>When your Monsters die in combat, you will lose them. Permanently. But you have the power to defy death by using their souls for rebirth. Their skills will be lost in the process, but they may live again as the same Monsters. Never lose hope! Your Monsters will grow stronger from their previous lives as they gain Worthiness with your help.</li>
<li>Impact combat as the Aethermancer. Unlock player classes that allow you to take on different roles. Each player class has distinguishing features that change how you play the game, allowing you to experience the game in your own way.</li>
<li>Stop the encroaching danger of the Void. Use your Aethermancer abilities and explore, sneak, and fight your way through procedurally generated levels with multiple pathways. Keep going until you lose your Monsters.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2288470/Aethermancer/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a> and it will have Native Linux support just like their first game.</p>
<p>Love the sound of this, exactly the type of game I love. Going right to the top of my wishlist, what do you think?</p>

      <title>Proton Hotfix updated for Resident Evil 4 remake, Steam Deck needs SteamOS 3.4.6 Preview</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais mentioned that they've updated Proton Hotfix, which should allow the new Resident Evil 4 Chainsaw Demo of the remake to run on Linux and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>On Desktop Linux, simply selecting Proton Hotfix should be all you need as Griffais mentioned on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1633978935947169792" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. For Steam Deck players though, Griffais also <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1633968944041312257" target="_blank">clarified</a> you will need to opt into the Preview update. I covered how to do that and what else was in SteamOS 3.4.6 preview in my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/steam-deck-os-346-beta-adds-doom-eternal-ray-tracing-wo-long-fallen-dynasty-fixes/" target="_blank">previous article and video</a>.</p>
<p>Testing out both, I can confirm on Desktop and Steam Deck the Resident Evil 4 Chainsaw Demo does seem to load up and work with Proton Hotfix, which on Steam Deck is now set as the default but you need to do that manually on Desktop in the Properties -&gt; Compatibility menu.</p>
<p><strong>Desktop Linux:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13490304651678448085gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13490304651678448085gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>However, it's not exactly very stable right now. With MangoHUD enabled, it would instantly crash. I spotted various graphical issues too, like your character randomly being stretched across the screen and at one point it completely froze. So it's far from playable there.</p>
<p><strong>Steam Deck</strong> on the other hand, was far more stable with the AMD GPU and the Mesa drivers but performance is quite problematic right now even with lots of settings turned down (and AMD FSR turned on too). No doubt it will improve as a shader cache is built, and as Proton is updated further.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7464804311678448482gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7464804311678448482gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7320776391678448845gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7320776391678448845gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Nice to see Valve continue to work quickly to improve compatibility but seems there's still some ways to go yet on this particular title.</p>
<p>You can pre-order it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/resident-evil-4-remake?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2050650/Resident_Evil_4/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Prepare to see a lot more of Epic Online Services, with Epic&#39;s new self-publishing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While the Epic Games Store doesn't support Linux or Steam Deck officially, this industry news is something we should all know about with Epic now <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-games-store-launches-self-publishing-tools-for-game-developers-and-publishers" target="_blank">opening up self-publishing</a> along with some new rules for their store.</p>
<p>Just like Steam, developers will be able to put their games up on the Epic Store for $100 per-game. However, they have a rather interesting rule when it comes to multiplayer games. In their announcement, they mention how multiplayer titles "must support crossplay across all PC stores" so that "any store can easily connect with other players, regardless of where the game was purchased".</p>
<p>Their reasoning is <em>sound</em>, as there's no good reason to lock online play per-store, and on Linux in the past the problem was even worse, with certain ports from Aspyr Media and Feral Interactive having multiplayer locked to Linux or Linux and macOS with Windows being by itself. I have absolutely no problem with Epic's online play rule at all, as it's actually <em>great</em> for us players.</p>
<p>Developers publishing on the Epic Store are free to use whatever method they wish for this, which is obviously good but rolling your own cross-play can be expensive and difficult. So, this will be another way for Epic Games to push their <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/en-US/services" target="_blank">Epic Online Services</a> which supports Linux, macOS, Windows, consoles and mobiles and provides the likes of voice chat, achievements, matchmaking and more. Compare that to Steamworks from Valve which, while feature-filled, is for Steam directly.</p>
<p>So for developers publishing on multiple stores for online games we're likely to see a lot more of Epic Online Services, or various other launchers and services being used even on Steam directly. We've already begun to see more of that and it will only continue to be a bigger thing now.</p>
<p>In a chat with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/epic-games-store-self-publishing/" target="_blank">PC Gamer</a>, Epic's Tim Sweeney noted: "They have a classic lock-in strategy where they build these services that only work with their store, and they use the fact that they have the majority market share in order to encourage everybody to ship games that have a broken experience in other stores," Sweeney said. "And we were bitten by this early on with a number of multiplayer games coming to the Epic Games Store. Steamworks didn't work on our store, so they had either a reduced set of multiplayer features or none, or they were just limited to a much smaller audience back in the launch days of the Epic Games Store, so you had a lot of multiplayer games that really felt like they were broken. And remember, Call of Duty went through a debacle launching on the Windows Store a while back in which you could only matchmake with other Windows Store players, and that is not how PC should work.".</p>
<p>Not just an issue for Epic, it's a problem GOG have too and they're much smaller so this rule Epic have is likely to benefit GOG releases as well (as long as their Galaxy API plays nicely with others…).</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see if Valve have any plans to expand Steamworks to be more cross-platform. I've reached out to Valve press to see what they have to say, if anything. Will update if I get a reply on that.</p>
<p><em>What are your thoughts?</em></p>

      <title>Transport Fever 2 has a big free upgrade, plus Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Transport Fever 2 is going strong since the release in 2019. They just launched a console version, and upgraded the PC release with some massive improvements too.</p>
<p>Firstly, thanks to the console work, there's now a new controller interface and they worked on dedicated Steam Deck support too. Masses of other changes were added like reworked and improved vehicle models, plus newly added translations for Italian, Brazilian Portuguese and Korean.</p>
<p>Checking it out fresh on Steam Deck and it's looking good. The new interface is set as the default and it works great.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3653869591678377619gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3653869591678377619gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>On top of that there's <em>multiple</em> big performance and loading improvements, crash bug fixes, lots of modding improvements and the list goes on.</p>
<p><em>You can see all the changes <a href="https://www.transportfever2.com/wiki/doku.php?id=releasenotes" target="_blank">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Their latest trailer is below:</p>

<p>They also just launched a Deluxe Edition that has 3 special maps, additional vehicles and more. If you buy the Deluxe Edition (or upgrade to it), they're also throwing in the Early Supporter Pack until March 16th.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/transport-fever-2?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/transport_fever_2?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1066780/Transport_Fever_2/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.

      <title>FOSS strategy game OpenHV gets a release two years in the making</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do any of you remember OpenHV? <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/09/a-cancelled-old-rts-named-hard-vacuum-gets-revived-with-openra/" target="_blank">Back in 2020</a>, it was announced as an OpenRA-based free and open source RTS, based on designs from Daniel Cook that never made it into a game planned to be called Hard Vacuum but now it's here and it has a massive upgrade.</p>
<p>This is the first proper stable release for nearly two years, and the list of changes and upgrades is ridiculously long that you can see on their <a href="https://github.com/OpenHV/OpenHV/releases" target="_blank">GitHub</a> releases page with all the pre-releases over the last couple of years. What they're trying to do is basically create a good and fully free real-time strategy game, for people who loved the classics from Westwood like Command &amp; Conquer and Red Alert.</p>
<p><em>Since it uses the <a href="https://www.openra.net/" target="_blank">OpenRA</a> game engine, it works great cross-platform.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7879114361678373929gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7879114361678373929gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The resource economy in this one is interesting. You have to scout out for resources, to then deploy a mining unit on each individual resource node which then morphs into a mining tower. Over time this tower will gather resources, and then send out a transport with those resources to your main base but these transports can be <em>destroyed</em> so you have to guard them. It's a nice little spin on the gathering found in classic RTS games.</p>
<p>You might recognise some of the art from another 2D RTS called Rusted Warfare, since they both use share some free assets.</p>
<p>I have to admit some of the gameplay here caught me by surprise. There I am building up a little base, sorting out my resources and along comes an enemy aeroplane and suddenly a whole bunch of pods drop across my base containing little nuisance machine gunners. <em>I think I'm going to really enjoy this one.</em></p>

      <title>Free and open source party game Starship Olympics hits Alpha</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need a fresh party game with simple controls and plenty of mini-games to play? Starship Olympics is free, open source and worth a go. They recently released the first Alpha build, which comes with a whole bunch of improvements and overhauls compared to their earlier releases I covered here some time ago. <em>It was originally called SuperStarfighter.</em></p>
<p>The idea is nice and simple and doesn't need much explaining: in local co-op or against the AI, you play through various mini-games in a different random order each time. The new version offers improved graphics, the overall feel of it should be better and they did some user interface improvement too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15504483121678372148gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15504483121678372148gol1.jpg"/></a></p>

      <title>Atari&#39;s 1981 classic revamp Caverns of Mars: Recharged is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Atari teamed up with SneakyBox to revamp another classic, with Caverns of Mars: Recharged officially out now with Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Captaining a fully armed spacecraft, you progress through 30 unique missions set within three primary "depths" of Mars. Featuring both a Challenge and Arcade mode, it sees you furiously blast through swaths of enemies (and even the environment), sinking deeper into the depths of Mars. Be careful though, while the ship’s ammo is limited the foes certainly aren’t. Featuring a unique local co-op mode, players can team up with one partner assigned to navigation while the other player shoots from an indestructible drone.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="L1L9NIcOcNI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4f918fc4906f2c01a7c5e071cf7a4c6c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/L1L9NIcOcNI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fully Destructible Environments:</strong> Blast your way through obstructions, but be mindful of fuel reserves -- each shot also accelerates your limited time to reach the bottom</li>
<li><strong>Arcade:</strong> Traverse the three depths of Mars in a race to reach the bottom and destroy the reactor, strategically accumulating upgrades that’ll make each run unique.</li>
<li><strong>Challenge Mode:</strong> Progress through 30 unique missions that ramp up the difficulty and deliver bite-sized challenges across navigation, combat, and other scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Power Ups:</strong> Collect weapons that will change your strategy on the fly. Carve a new path with the focused railgun shot or leverage the spread of rapid shotgun blasts.</li>
<li><strong>Local Co-op:</strong> In a unique spin on the gameplay, split the responsibilities while one player navigates and the other shoots from a separate drone in tow.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Really great to see Atari publish more of their classics upgraded like this, especially nice to see a whole bunch of them come with full Linux support too.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2213980/Caverns_of_Mars_Recharged/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Ship of Harkinian, a PC port of Ocarina of Time has a feature-filled upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you love the classic The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time? Clearly a lot of people do, and the PC port Ship of Harkinian just recently had a great sounding upgrade.</p>
<p>All unofficial of course, since Nintendo like to keep a close guard on everything but as usual it hasn't stopped people wanting to play it on other platforms with many upgrades. It's just code too, you still need a copy of the actual game to run it, like a lot of game engine remakes they don't provide the copyrighted assets like art and music. They even do their own Ship of Harkinian Direct (a joke about Nintendo Direct videos), although the last is from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRxZ_WlZI4s" target="_blank">five months ago</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16785328781678295540gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I actually wasn't even aware it existed (and supported Linux), because I don't really follow much Zelda or Nintendo stuff, until it was pointed out in the <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux Discord</a>.</p>
<p>The update from March 1st includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>New Enhancements/Features</h4>
<ul>
<li>Enhancement to have Link use the correct ammo types when using bow or slingshot as the wrong age.</li>
<li>Time saver to auto fill new file names as "Link".</li>
<li>Enhancement to disable the automatic first person mode when placing down Bombchus.</li>
<li>The SFX Editor has been renamed to Audio Editor and a new audio shuffle pool management system is added.
<ul>
<li>You can now manage a list of included and excluded sequences.</li>
<li>Easily search, filter and preview for sequences to include/exclude.</li>
</ul>
</li>

      <title>Subnautica gets upgraded and now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Subnautica, the hugely popular watery open-world survival adventure has a fresh update out that notes it's now Steam Deck Verified. It originally launched in 2018 after being in Early Access from 2014. Considering how it was quite a while ago now, it's nice to see this kind of post-release support for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15965073811678294204gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>This isn't just a case of another developer announcing they went through Deck Verified without doing anything, the developer Unknown Worlds Entertainment actually went back and updated some parts to work better including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Steam SDK upgrade.</li>
<li>Steamworks .NET upgraded to 20.1.0.</li>
<li>Virtual Keyboard support for Steam Big Picture mode.</li>
<li>Fixed wrong controller stick dead zones handling (now should be easier to aim using controller).</li>
<li>Fixed occasional black screen on game start.</li>
<li>Refactoring, other fixes and UX improvements (mostly related to controllers).</li>
<li>Fixed black screen in VR after resolution change.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/subnautica?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/264710/Subnautica/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>I'm still yet to play this one, am I missing something big here? Maybe now I might actually jump in and see. It's rated Overwhelmingly Positive on Steam so clearly people love it. Good things come to those who wait then, since I'll now get the best experience huh?</p>

      <title>Free and open source 6DOF flight racer Fly Dangerous has a huge second update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's fast, it gives you six degrees of freedom (6DOF) and it's open source too! Fly Dangerous just had it's second big upgrade since entering Early Access. Eventually, this could be quite something, although it's already pretty impressive. Created originally as a "love letter to the Elite Dangerous racing community".</p>
<p>With this update the developer mentioned they've added in an "enormous amount of new content, bugfixes, quality-of-life updates, new maps, music and game modes and a whole suite of integrations". Just some of what's been added into the game includes a fully rebuilt biome terrain world graph with new biomes, 18 new time trial sprint maps, 5 new time trial circuit maps, 3 new puzzle maps, a new ship collision system, support for OpenTrack head tracking, support for TrackIR head tracking, new camera options, support for ultra-wide displays and lots more.</p>

      <title>Build magical colonies and manage resources with lasers in Scorchlands</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Set in a fantasy world of magic and talking animals, Scorchlands is a peculiar city-builder now in Early Access.</p>
<p>Developed by Ringlab and published by Star Drifters, it's a bit of an odd one that's hard to pin down properly to a genre because it blends quite a few things together but the core of it is building up your colonies for resources. It released into Early Access on February 7th with Native Linux support.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Jneb8Ay66XE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7c239af32f0c65c1f90e12c130fa3244.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Jneb8Ay66XE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Hex grid-based city-building – construct various buildings in your colonies. Each structure's productivity depends on neighboring resources and other constructions.</li>
<li>Complex resource management – it’s not only about extracting materials. Scorchlands takes account of logistics – the movement of resources between colonies and combining them in robust processing chains. And yes, we move resources using LASERS!</li>
<li>Terraforming for the greater good – use magic and technology to change the biomes on procedurally generated maps and exploit the new environment to gain its unique resources.</li>
<li>Technology designed to give fun – there’s no fun in a sandbox if you don’t have the toys to play with. The technology system in Scorchlands is key for player progression and new discoveries open up new ways to play with the game world.</li>
<li>Minimalistic combat system – when you get into a fight, positioning will be the key. Destroy your enemies by surrounding them and placing your forces in optimal locations.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I have a copy and tested it out for a bit to confirm it works great, need more time with it to form a proper opinion but the basic idea behind it seemed quite interesting — certainly not the usual kind of city-builder you're used to. Could be a good one for you to take a look at, although it still has around half a year in Early Access until they think it will be finished.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1090100/Scorchlands/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Currently <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/scorchlands" target="_blank">GOG</a> only has the Windows version.</p>

      <title>Starfield from Bethesda launching September 6</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While we have no idea how well it will work on Linux and Steam Deck with Proton just yet, we at least now have a date. Starfield from Bethesda is releasing September 6th. I'm cautiously optimistic on it, as a massive fan of everything space sci-fi like this, I've wanted to see more games like this for some time.</p>
<p>More about it: "Starfield is the first new universe in 25 years from Bethesda Game Studios, the award-winning creators of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and Fallout 4. In this next generation role-playing game set amongst the stars, create any character you want and explore with unparalleled freedom as you embark on an epic journey to answer humanity’s greatest mystery."</p>
<p>See the new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="raWbElTCea8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9e630b16b71a3b28e6acfe35fadd2eba.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/raWbElTCea8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Naturally, I'll be taking a look at it on release, to let you know how if it works on Linux desktop and Steam Deck. Perhaps it's one of the upcoming titles Valve mentioned in the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/steam-deck-os-346-beta-adds-doom-eternal-ray-tracing-wo-long-fallen-dynasty-fixes/" target="_blank">update notes for SteamOS 3.4.6</a> that they couldn't name directly. It wouldn't surprise me if this is one title Valve are trying to ensure works well before release, given how popular it will no doubt be.</p>
<p><em>Will you be picking it up? </em></p>
<p>You can follow it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1716740/Starfield/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Vangers the open source classic from 1998 continues to be upgraded</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vangers is a thoroughly weird racing role-playing adventure originally released in 1998, and it's still being upgraded.</p>
<p>The developers describe it as: "Mind-altering sandbox game that can be described as a racing role-playing adventure game with a complicated storyline. You’ll find a unique atmosphere, complete freedom and lots of gameplay hours to figure out what’s the game is all about."</p>
<p>Want to see how weird it is? See below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wobNQOl6KHA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7b2530e915c2489f3daf6b736dcc2991.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wobNQOl6KHA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Back in February 2022, it even got a HD revamp to support a higher (by original standards) 1280x720 resolution. This was made possible, as the game's code is open source under the GPL on <a href="https://github.com/KranX/Vangers" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. The HD patch was originally a community effort, and then further refined together with the developers and added to the official game. Nice!</p>
<p>It also just got the first update in quite some time, with a new update going out on March 3rd adding in:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Video fixes for MacOS.</li>
<li>Fixes for memory issues.</li>
<li>Prevented infinite loop when handing out eLeech if Eleerection is the only cycle left.</li>
<li>Prevented "permanent" UI block after using Boot Sector.</li>
<li>Window aspect ratio now calculated dynamically.</li>
<li>Fixed game crash when trying to use Protractor under some circumstances.</li>
<li>Error messages are more informative in certain cases.</li>
<li>Fixed game crash when window height is less than 600.</li>
<li>Prevented unwanted mouse cursor position changes in certain cases.</li>
<li>Fixed texts alignment for game ending screens and items with associated text screens (tabutasks, passengers, poponkas).</li>
<li>Multiple fixes for game chat in multiplayer: init scroll position, alignment, size at different resolutions.</li>
<li>Fixed multiplayer chat closing upon any attempts to type.</li>
<li>Fixed multiple errors in Mechosoma game mode on Necross.</li>
<li>Multiple changes to make working with code easier.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>After trying it out today for the first time, it might be the strangest game I've ever played. Every single part of it is just thoroughly weird.</p>

      <title>Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania is a fresh content expansion for the popular rogue-lite, metroidvania inspired, action-platformer and it's available now.</p>
<p>It features a new main quest, that sees you run through a brief bit of the usual area to find a way into Dracula's Castle. To get there, just look out for a new friend waiting to ask for your help as you run through a fresh game. You'll fight your way several times through both Dracula's Castle and the main island on the way to a final showdown with Dracula in his iconic Throne Room.</p>

<p>Main Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Classic Weapons: </strong>Unlock 14 iconic weapons such as the Vampire Killer, Throwing Axe &amp; Holy Water to decimate Dracula's bestiary of monsters and finally the dark lord himself. Each item has been translated into the fast-paced combat of Dead Cells while keeping their original essence.</li>
<li><strong>Explore Dracula's Castle: </strong>Secret rooms. Flame-lit corridors. Gloomy tombs. Beautiful paintings. Food hidden in the walls. Full of original monsters from the series, such as harpies, werewolves &amp; haunted armors, the character of the iconic castle will transport you into the realms of gothic fantasy.</li>
<li><strong>Classic and Reimagined Music: </strong>We're giving you access to an alternative soundtrack made of 51 of the original Castlevania tunes, that can be heard across the entire game. Yes, 51! On top of this, we've taken the 12 most iconic tracks, such as Vampire Killer, Bloody Tears and Simon Belmont's Theme, and reimagined them in the style of Dead Cells as a soundtrack for this DLC, while preserving the Castlevania ambiance of course.</li>
<li><strong>A New Story:  </strong>Richter Belmont and Alucard will be by your side throughout your quest to vanquish Dracula, helping you to navigate the maze of Dracula’s Castle and providing you with strong weapons (sometimes willingly, sometimes not). However, where there is good there is evil, so watch out for powerful foes who will try everything in their power to stop you from reaching the throne room.</li>
<li><strong>Three Boss Fights: </strong>Fight against the very essence of evil in two intense duels versus Death and Dracula, both set against a majestic backdrop. If you can survive these gauntlets, prepare yourself for our most ambitious boss showdown yet...</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Honestly, I couldn't be happier with this after enjoying then Castlevania Anime on Netflix. I've been playing it, and it's pretty much exactly what I expected it to be. A themed-area content expansion, with all the gameplay you know and love from Dead Cells. No issues with the way it works, as it continues to be supported nicely on Linux too and it's looking perfect on Steam Deck as well. The new music is a very nice touch too, very fitting and they did a really great job on it overall.</p>
<p>So far it seems other players are enjoying it, as it's rated Very Positive on Steam.</p>

      <title>Dota 2 removes OpenGL support, new hero Muerta now live, big update due in April</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest major update to Dota 2 from Valve has landed, bringing with it the removal of OpenGL support and the new hero Muerta.</p>
<p>Valve mentioned multiple times in the past their plans to continue the modernization of the tech behind Dota 2, and so this update is the one to do it. On Linux, it's now Vulkan only requiring at least AMD GCN+, NVIDIA Kepler+, or Intel HD 5000-series. They plan to go further, with a future update planned to upgrade their SIMD to SSE4.1 that will "allow higher performance in physics, particles, and general gameplay code" which shouldn't really affect many people, as they said nearly all "processors released in the past 10 years support SSE4.1".</p>
<p>The new hero, Muerta, is described as: "With her fearsome trickshots, summoned spirits, and a sidearm to spare, Muerta's knack for taking lives was so impressive, Death himself put her on the payroll. A twin-pistoled engine of dead-eyed vengeance, Muerta shepherds wayward souls to the other side, whether they want to get there or not. And if they need more convincing, she’s ready to reveal her true form as a murderous spectral nightmare if it helps them die a little faster."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6pzlZywudlw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2cc953ce1ddd05da1cef2b7141a01669.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6pzlZywudlw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Muerta's abilities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dead Shot - Muerta fires a ghostly bankshot at an enemy unit or tree. When the bullet strikes, it damages and briefly slows, then ricochets in the targeted direction. The ricochet damages all units that it passes through, stopping when it hits a hero. Heroes hit by the ricochet will run in the direction of the shot.</li>
<li>The Calling - Summons a group of revenants that slowly circle the targeted location. Enemies within the area are slowed and have reduced attack speed. Revenants deal damage and silence enemies as they pass through them.</li>
<li>Gunslinger - Muerta's attacks have a chance to fire a second shot at another target, prioritizing Heroes.</li>
<li>Pierce the Veil - Muerta transforms, becoming immune to physical damage. All of her attack damage is dealt as magical damage. Muerta gains bonus attack damage and phased movement. Muerta can attack ethereal units, but deals no damage to Magic Immune targets.</li>
</ul>
<p>This update also comes with a new mini-game that runs until April 4th: "Muerta needs help getting the right warm bodies in the right fresh graves... and that’s where you come in! You’ll get an assigned target before every Dota game during the Dead Reckoning event. Score points for Kills and Assists. But watch out — your opponent’s out for your blood too, and whoever scores more gets twice the reward!".</p>
<p>Additionally Dota 2 version 7.33 is coming in April, which they've been working on "for a while" that they sound will be quite "ambitious". Will be interesting to see what they've been cooking up…it's not just <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/counter-strike-2-is-reportedly-a-real-thing-and-coming-soon/" target="_blank">Counter-Strike</a> having all the fun huh?</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://www.dota2.com/deadreckoning" target="_blank">full update page</a> for all the info.</p>

      <title>Deal with a UFO crashing into a small village in Kujlevka, releasing in April</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kujlevka from developer Callback and publisher Crytivo is a quirky adventure about a flying saucer crash landing into a small distant Russian village. Now, they have a new trailer up and a release date teaser for sometime in April.</p>
<p>"Russia, 1992. The ordinary village of Kujlevka is no stranger to challenging times. In this dark and otherworldly period of Russian history, the current financial crisis and rising crime rates appear bleak in comparison. And when a flying saucer crashes into local chairman's house, it’s up to you to meet the aliens. Of all the locations on Earth, this forgotten settlement becomes a bustling center for science, exploration, and the supernatural; you’re merely the poor chap whose home became the saucer’s crash site."</p>

<p>Gameplay:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This isn’t your stereotypical alien encounter. You will be tasked to learn about these otherworldly beings before they can properly study you.</li>
<li>Kujlevka lets you play a role in charting a course through a financially and politically turbulent time in Russian history.</li>
<li>Beyond static dialog and walls of text, you can explore village life in Kujlevka through a mesmerizing atmosphere of the protagonist’s dreams. </li>
</ul>

      <title>Flathub in 2023, they have some big plans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Robert McQueen, CEO of the Endless OS Foundation and GNOME Board President, has <a href="https://discourse.flathub.org/t/flathub-in-2023/3808" target="_blank">given a big update</a> on what's going on with <a href="https://flathub.org" target="_blank">Flathub</a>. A lot of work has been going in towards updating Flathub from a list of apps, into a full build service and app store complete with payment processing. This includes developer verification, user accounts and more.</p>
<p>You might remember <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/flathub-seeks-funding-to-add-payments-donations-and-subscriptions/" target="_blank">my recent article</a> talking about their funding proposal, where Flathub plans to expand the types of monetization they can offer to developers (amongst many other plans) but they need funding to finish up everything. They were asking the Plaintext Group to help with that but <em>sadly</em> they got turned down. That's not the end of it though, the show must go on and they're currently in discussions with <a href="https://nlnet.nl/" target="_blank">NLnet</a> about funding.</p>
<p>For 2023 so far they've been granted $100K from the <a href="https://www.endlessnetwork.com/" target="_blank">Endless Network</a>, but McQueen said they're hoping to to get at least $250K for this year, which is why they're seeking more funding partners.</p>
<p>So what else have the folks involved in Flathub been up to, and what are they planning together? A lot.</p>
<p>First up, some stats were revealed! They have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over 2,000 apps.</li>
<li>Over 1,500 collaborators.</li>
<li>Averaging 700,000 downloads a day.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the post McQueen believes that Flathub has "solved the largest technical issue which has held back the mainstream growth and acceptance of Linux on the desktop" by providing an easy place for developers to publish their work, and making it easy for users to get it. <em>I'm sure Canonical and Snap will have something to say about that…</em></p>
<p>Direct Uploads are in progress too and close to being ready, helping developers with even more automation mentioning "they enable exciting stuff like allowing Electron apps to be built outside of flatpak-builder, or driving automatic Flathub uploads from GitHub actions or GitLab CI flows".</p>
<p>McQueen believes <em>now</em> the biggest barrier for the Linux desktop is <em>economic</em>, and that's why we have fewer developers and apps doing stuff for Linux, noting that "as a community we continue to have a challenging relationship with money". It's true, everyone needs to eat, and you can only do so much as a hobby while working a paying job elsewhere. And so if there's no proper incentive for developers they "would be forgiven for taking their time and attention elsewhere".</p>
<p>This does touch on another good point, talking about how this is an issue for "diverse and inclusive participation", since without everything in place for developers to earn a living on Linux we end up requiring "that somebody is in a position of privilege and comfort that they have internet, power, time, and income—not to mention childcare, etc.—to spare so that they can take part". It's all about "shared success", giving everyone the opportunity.</p>
<p>They're also looking into creating an Advisory Board, so there's some proper governing of everything. This includes moving the legal side of the operation from the GNOME Foundation, who have been handling it, into an independent legal entity.</p>
<p>On top of that there's plans for a form of Flathub Focus Groups, which will be launching at the Linux App Summit in May 2023, and some form of online participation too for you to have your say.</p>
<p>Will ensuring Flathub has everything in place for developers to actually sell apps make a difference? I think it could. Speaking personally, if I'm looking for an app now, Flathub is usually the first place I look, no matter the Linux distribution I happen to be running. It's a nice feeling too, being able to just tell people to "grab it on Flathub", instead of needing to find their exact distribution, version and then find a package for them. Hopefully that idea will keep growing too, so that more developers put their apps and even games on there.</p>
<p><em>What are you thoughts on everything Flathub?</em></p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer - Part 28: Losing My Marbles</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-27-lost-souls/" target="_blank">Part 27: Lost Souls</a></strong></p>
<p>One of the titles that Loki Software released for Linux was <em>Tribes 2,</em> an online multiplayer shooter which was the first game to be released using the Torque Game Engine. Torque 3D would go on prove to be a favourite of a number of independent developers over the next decade, with the engine's maintainer GarageGames stepping in to distribute several of the games produced with it for Linux themselves. This included a game of their own devising, <em>Marble Blast Gold</em>.</p>
<p><em>Marble Blast </em>was first released in 2002, before being updated to <em>Marble Blast Gold</em> in 2003. A six level playable Linux demo was released through the MarbleBlastGoldDemo-1.4.1.sh.bin installer. The goal of the game is to navigate an autonomous marble through a 3D playing world, collecting all of the gems needed and using the power ups provided to overcome the obstacles preventing you from progressing on to the next level.</p>
<p>Anyone who has ever played the free software title <em>Neverball </em>should be familiar with the basic concept, the main difference being that with <em>Marble Blast</em> you control the marble directly, rather than shifting around the floor to roll a ball. These kinds of high reflex games have a way of trying both my nerves and patience before long, but the appeal sure is there for some. The graphics are bright and colourful, while the music and narration remain jovial.</p>
<p>To its credit <em>Marble Blast Gold</em> and the Torque Game Engine powering it do run rather well, even on a computer which would have been well into its operating life by the time the game came out. <em>Marble Blast Gold</em> stayed performant even when set to display at higher screen resolutions such as 1024x768 or when using 32 bit colour depth; the only exception being enabling Stencil Shadows, which does hammer the frame rate something fierce.</p>
<p>I also find the selection of levels in the demo to be puzzling. I would have just included all of the early beginner levels, which introduce all of the mechanics before letting you tackle your first real challenge. The demo can also be a bit obnoxious, with it showing a begging screen imploring you to buy the full game after completing each and every level. Considering the state of the registered version as it exists now, this can feel more than a bit galling.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17659680751676232867gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17659680751676232867gol6.png"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7656394871676232828gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7656394871676232828gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p><em>Marble Blast Gold</em> never saw a retail release, with it just being sold as a digital download through the GarageGames website. The game has been unavailable for purchase since being removed from their store in 2011, and even if you had purchased the full version back in the day, you can no longer verify your key as the registration server is down. While both Windows and Mac saw versions which had the Ignition DRM stripped out, on Linux the game is left unplayable.</p>
<p>Thankfully the <em>Marble Blast</em> community has provided Linux users with a couple of alternate ways to keep playing the game. Marble Blast Web is a port of both <em>Marble Blast Gold </em>and the community made <em>Marble Blast Platinum</em> that allows both games to launch inside a modern web browser. While appearing almost identical, the physics are actually quite different to those found in the original game, having been optimized instead with a view to reaching a wider audience.</p>
<p>A more faithful web version of the game is the Marble Blast Haxe Port, which boasts 99% identical physics, although it gave me some issues with inputting my name. Either gives you access to what amounts to the full version of the game along with full source code available from GitHub, both being the product of clean room reverse engineering. Some interest has even been shown in using these to make new native Linux binaries, but the web versions are more universal.</p>
<p>GarageGames sold alongside <em>Marble Blast Gold</em> another ten games for Linux on their website, including <em>Bridge Construction Set</em>, <em>Orbz</em>, <em>ThinkTanks</em>, <em>Gish</em>, <em>Dark Horizons: Lore Invasion</em>, <em>Zap!</em>, <em>Tribal Trouble</em>, <em>Toribash</em>, <em>FizzBall</em>, and <em>Kachinko,</em> almost all made with the Torque Game Engine. Following the closure of their store in 2011 GarageGames would at least open up the source code to Torque, allowing the engine to continue to enjoy success in Indie and free gaming circles.</p>
<p>The more I explore these early independent Linux games that were distributed and sold through the internet, the more dismayed I have become at how easily they seem to be succumbing to the digital dark age without a physical release to anchor them. Thanks to a tip from one of my readers however, and the help of the original developer, I can now shine a light on another title which otherwise would appear to have been lost to history.</p>

      <title>Paradox announce Cities: Skylines 2, plus a The Sims-like game and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox Interactive just held their own announcement show, and there will be quite a few interesting upcoming games, so here's a round-up.</p>
<p>First up, no doubt many are excited at the idea of it, <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/949230/Cities_Skylines_II/" target="_blank">Cities: Skylines II</a></strong> is official although they did not show off any gameplay it just had a fancy trailer. So nothing to really show there, and no release date hint yet either. Even the Steam page doesn't have in-game screenshots, just screenshots from their own trailer.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WdD66WGBVHM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2c4091888a52af853ea09f831223f9d9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WdD66WGBVHM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“Cities: Skylines reset the bar for city building games when it launched eight years ago, and we are incredibly proud of its impact. We built a thriving community around Cities and introduced many to city building for the first time,” said Mariina Hallikainen, CEO of Colossal Order. "Now, we’ve brought the years of experience we’ve gained to take a new step forward in the city builder genre, again, for our community and new players".</p>
<p>“The Cities brand has been an important part of Paradox’s catalog of games for over a decade. Cities: Skylines is a profound success, selling millions of copies, welcoming more than 5.5 million new players just last year, and setting the foundation for Cities: Skylines II,” said Fredrik Wester, CEO of Paradox Interactive. “With unprecedented amounts of customization and player control, Cities: Skylines II will continue to push boundaries for the city-building franchise.”</p>
<hr/>
<p>They're also now doing their own game like The Sims called <strong>Life By You</strong>, which is not a big surprise because the studio Paradox Tectonic is working with Rod Humble who previously worked on The Sims 2 &amp; 3.</p>
<p>Life By You also only got a short teaser, because it's going to have its own event on March 20th.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZNhV-Gnjdy8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/616725781bcab584a441a260af08f683.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZNhV-Gnjdy8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<hr/>
<p>Harebrained Schemes, known for BATTLETECH and Shadowrun, announced <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1167750/The_Lamplighters_League/" target="_blank">The Lamplighters League</a></strong>, a tactical turn-based strategy game set in an alternate 1933.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JnTjWoFvmzg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f7267b105aec4dc144a0dd8d4e5780a4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JnTjWoFvmzg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“Harebrained Schemes is all about weaving tactical gameplay that challenges your mind with narrative and characters that engage your heart,” said Christopher Rogers, Game Director of The Lamplighters League at Harebrained Schemes. “For years, we’ve been privileged to tell stories in cherished settings like Shadowrun and BATTLETECH. Because The Lamplighters League is set in a new world, it allows us the creative freedom to simultaneously create narrative that supports gameplay and gameplay that supports narrative. We love these characters and hope that players and fans enjoy getting to know them while exploring each one's unique abilities the way we did. I cannot wait to share everything we’ve been working on.”</p>
<hr/>
<p>Since it's Paradox, there were of course going to be some DLC announcements like…</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2311920/Crusader_Kings_III_Tours__Tournaments/" target="_blank">Crusader Kings III: Tours &amp; Tournaments</a></strong> was announced, releasing in "late Spring":</p>

      <title>Base-building, tower defense and digging — Lumencraft has it all</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lumencraft is a pretty gorgeous top-down blending of base-building, where you need to set up defensive towers and a whole lot of digging. Developed with full Linux and Steam Deck support using <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, it's easily one of my indie favourites from this year and it just left Early Access as a full game.</p>
<p>Imagine a bit of Deep Rock Galactic top-down with base-building, and that sort-of sums up the kind of experience to expect from it. Honestly it's good, and you can end up seemingly just blinking and hours have gone by while you're playing. The new update to the full release also brings with it a full single-player campaign with various missions, a new hub area between missions and lots more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LC29HveHImg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5aa734381af715457c857655d4e251f0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LC29HveHImg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Multiple game modes - a story campaign, custom maps created by the developers and the community or procedurally generated levels. The choice is yours!</li>
<li>Defending the underground settlement by direct combat and the use of diversified turrets.</li>
<li>Highly efficient and satisfying digging mechanics (just listen to the sweet sound of crushed rocks and Lumen).</li>
<li>Explosive weapons. Yes, we have dynamite.</li>
<li>Dynamic lights and pixel-perfect interaction with a fully destructible terrain.</li>
<li>Dread atmosphere created through an impactful sound design and a unique 2Dynamic lighting system.</li>
<li>Realistic simulations. Just look at the lava!</li>
<li>Play with your friends in co-op mode either using Steam Remote Play or locally on a shared screen.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Rhythm mini-game collection Bits &amp; Bops gets Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bits &amp; Bops looks sweet! A fun collection of rhythm mini-games, and the developer has upgraded the demo to include Linux support for this upcoming game.</p>
<p>In the update announcement they said: "This release brings the custom engine to Linux! We've tested it for you on the Steam Deck and built in some tailored settings for the best experience straight out of the box. If you're on Linux and you were previously running the Windows build, you may need to manually disable Proton to get the native Linux build (check your compatibility settings)."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ibijA6QPGn0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/58832a2668effa94c65c8058d24681df.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ibijA6QPGn0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It was crowdfunded on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tempolabgames/bits-and-bops/description" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, where the developer pulled in AU$ 173,833 towards development. Linux support was not a sure thing, as back then they initially mentioned it would be tricky to do with their custom game engine but it seems they managed to do it anyway — nice!</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Over 20 unique rhythm mini-games to entertain and challenge you.</li>
<li>Super fun gameplay with simple controls that anyone can learn.</li>
<li>Catchy, upbeat original tunes sure to have you bopping along.</li>
<li>Gorgeous hand-drawn 2D animation that brings everything to life.</li>
<li>A custom game engine with lightning fast response times.</li>
<li>An adorable dog-bear named Bop to keep you company.</li>

      <title>Counter-Strike 2 is reportedly a real thing and coming soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's been a whole lot of rumours appearing lately that seem quite credible, with Counter-Strike 2 apparently due soon. It's not entirely clear if this is a full new game, or a big upgrade for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive but either way it's pretty exciting for FPS fans.</p>
<p>One thing being <a href="https://twitter.com/gabefollower/status/1631002572881362954" target="_blank">pointed out</a> is how the NVIDIA driver on Windows added profiles for "csgos2.exe" and "cs2.exe", with it even being named directly as Counter-Strike 2. NVIDIA have, in the past, accidentally let slip a number of other upcoming games that ended up being real. Alone, that wouldn't be exactly solid though.</p>
<p>Now we also have Richard Lewis, esports journalist and broadcaster, <a href="https://richardlewis.substack.com/p/sources-yes-counter-strike-2-is-real" target="_blank">writing</a> how it is in fact very real and some sources with knowledge of it came to them to verify it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Speaking under the condition of anonymity sources with a knowledge of the game’s development told us that indeed there was a new version of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive on its way and that had been worked on for some time. The new version is almost certainly set to be released under the working title Counter-Strike 2 and the tentative release date for the beta is in this month of March with April 1st at the outside.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive originally launched in 2012, and it has seen many upgrades since then. Even so, that's still quite a long time for Valve to support it, and it does show its age in many ways.</p>
<p>While nothing is confirmed yet of course, it's still very exciting. Seems like March and April are shaping up to be very interesting months. Once I hear any more, I'll let you know.</p>

      <title>Factorio gets official Wayland support on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Are you a Wayland user? Do you play Factorio? The latest update should make things a lot smoother for you.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/11h3ule/version_1177/" target="_blank">Version 1.1.77</a> was just released and amongst a whole bunch of their usual bug fixes and scripting updates, noted right at the top was "Added support for Wayland on Linux. To enable it, set SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland in your environment. (thanks to raiguard)". It's nice to see developers who really care about their Linux support like this.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/828195341677873165gol1.jpg"/></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Factorio</strong> is a game in which you build and maintain factories. You will be mining resources, researching technologies, building infrastructure, automating production and fighting enemies. In the beginning you will find yourself chopping trees, mining ores and crafting mechanical arms and transport belts by hand, but in short time you can become an industrial powerhouse, with huge solar fields, oil refining and cracking, manufacture and deployment of construction and logistic robots, all for your resource needs. However this heavy exploitation of the planet's resources does not sit nicely with the locals, so you will have to be prepared to defend yourself and your machine empire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you do try it out, be sure to leave a comment and let us know how it runs. I can imagine this making it better on Steam Deck too where it's currently a Steam Deck "Playable" title, verified on the Native Linux build. On Steam Deck, the main Gaming Mode does use Wayland too.</p>

      <title>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is a Vampire Survivors styled spin-off</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ghost Ship Publishing and Funday Games recently announced a Deep Rock Galactic spin-off named Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor and I need it right now.</p>
<p>Designed very much like the smash hit Vampire Survivors, it lets you explore the world of Deep Rock as a single player survivor-like auto-shooter. They sure are a lot of these games now, however this is building upon a well-established name and Deep Rock Galactic is one of my all-time favourite co-op games, and as a big fan of these horde shooters, I'm keen to give it a run on Linux Desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="h6koRh1v3nU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d782d47e492ea1521828fe5723f44714.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/h6koRh1v3nU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>No doubt it will work great with Proton at release. The Early Access release will have these features ready:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>4 playable characters</li>
<li>+30 weapons</li>
<li>+10 enemy types</li>
<li>1-3 bosses</li>
<li>3-5 biomes</li>
<li>Multiple mission types</li>
<li>A deep progression system of perks, artifacts and upgrades</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From what they said, it will remain in Early Access potentially for up to a year. During this time they plan to add in more of basically everything. Gimme.</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2321470/Deep_Rock_Galactic_Survivor/" target="_blank">out on Steam</a>. </p>

      <title>Meg&#39;s Monster is a cute looking unique short JRPG out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Japanese developer Odencat just released Meg's Monster, a cute looking short JRPG with a rather interesting twist.</p>
<p>Most games start you off with nothing, weak as a thin stick, but here as the monster Roy you start off pretty much untouchable. However, when Roy does get hit, Meg might get a little upset. Here you're watching out for the "mental damage" to Meg, who doesn't want to see Roy get hurt. Sounds like a really interesting spin on it all.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="T7rp819leWg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6320f319b972b039cd11812ac18135e4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/T7rp819leWg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it: "What begins as a relatively simple and heartwarming story about two unlikely friends ultimately expands into something much greater, as Roy and Meg slowly begin to unravel the mysteries surrounding the Underworld and themselves. The result is an emotional journey that, like any good storybook, will remain in your heart for years to come.</p>
<p>Meg's Monster’s retro style and simplicity in presentation quickly unfolds into a challenging, amusing and must-play RPG. The narrative quickly pulls the player into the story whilst at the same time giving a real empathy for the main and central characters. Over 50,000 words of dialogue give a rich and compelling narrative to the many battles that will ensue as you venture forth.  Each battle comes with its own unique mechanics and minigames to master as you duke it out while protecting and keeping Meg happy with her favourite toys. Yes, keeping Meg calm and happy is just one underlying factor, and a nice toy will achieve this, but it’s not that simple!"</p>
<p>Out with Native Linux support <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1783360/Megs_Monster/" target="_blank">on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck OS 3.4.6 Beta adds DOOM Eternal Ray Tracing, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has updated the Steam Deck Preview update branch to bring with it Steam Deck OS 3.4.6 Beta and it's quite an exciting one. It brings an update to the open source Mesa graphics drivers with Mesa 23.1, mainly focused on the Vulkan side of things but DXR Ray Tracing is <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1631478719612321792" target="_blank">coming</a> too but not quite ready yet.</p>
<p>Here's what it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3650768394042637389" target="_blank">changes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed graphical corruption issues with Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty.</li>
<li>Ray-Tracing is now available in DOOM Eternal.</li>
<li>Fixed graphical corruption issues and GPU crashes in several upcoming titles.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A video going over the changes and a quick look at DOOM Eternal with Ray Tracing on Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1c89wGH5XOM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/338b0e660126dfb08843b74e9ff42de7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1c89wGH5XOM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Fantastic work from Valve and Mesa developers working on this. Amazing to see it actually working in a game on Steam Deck like this.</p>
<p>ICYMI: there's some issues with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/apex-legends-banning-linux-players-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Apex Legends bans on Linux</a>.

      <title>The Legend of Heroes: Kuro no Kiseki gets a second Steam release, optimised for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is a bit of an odd one. The Legend of Heroes: Kuro no Kiseki has been released on Steam, for the second time and now it has Steam Deck optimizations too.</p>
<p>Originally released for the PlayStation 4, and then PlayStation 5 and Windows. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1811950/The_Legend_of_Heroes_Kuro_no_Kiseki/" target="_blank">first</a> Windows version on Steam came from Nihon Falcom and Clouded Leopard Entertainment that only supports Traditional Chinese and Korean translations, while this <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2138610/The_Legend_of_Heroes_Kuro_no_Kiseki/" target="_blank">newer one</a> comes from PH3 GmbH, Nihon Falcom and NIS America, Inc supports Japanese. They're both still for sale, which can be confusing. This newer port isn't just about publishers and translations though it also has various enhancements and will <a href="https://twitter.com/nihonfalcom/status/1631086556391051264?s=20" target="_blank">officially</a> get an English translation.</p>
<p>Some of the enhancements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for ultrawide resolutions (as well as the 16:10 ratio of the Steam Deck).</li>
<li>High frame rate support.</li>
<li>Field of view customization (and automatic FOV scaling).</li>
<li>Various graphics options including a real-time graphics options preview.</li>
<li>Full support for keyboard and mouse controls.</li>
<li>Steam Deck optimization.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the Steam Deck side they <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2138610/view/3675538191993632884" target="_blank">said</a>: "Before leaving you to enjoy the game, I’d like to note that we also specifically worked on Steam Deck optimization, to eliminate a particular issue that reduced performance significantly in some areas while running via DXVK." and they added a picture too:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15393826231677781260gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15393826231677781260gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Really interesting to see even more developers optimize their games for Steam Deck. Will have to check this out when the English language patch lands for it, looks quite interesting. It's also great to see more games from Asia continue to arrive on Steam, although in future it would be nice if translations weren't split across multiple purchases.</p>

      <title>Hibernaculum is a gross looking retro-inspired sci-fi dungeon crawler</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Currently in development by Victor Pflug and Wormwood Studios, Hibernaculum looks like an absolute disgusting treat.</p>
<p>Designed and inspired by the dungeon crawling from the likes of Eye of the Beholder &amp; Lands of Lore, with design elements taken from Horror Soft's Elvira &amp; Waxworks series, while also sprinkling in elements of older RPGs like Baldur's Gate and Fallout. Plus, a dose of horror-survival elements more like System Shock and Resident Evil. The whole idea is to give you engrossing labyrinths to explore like the classics full of mystery.</p>
<p>Have a look at the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nk7Mbzxad9k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/55027d7f9218def63cd8898fa3ddf6bf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nk7Mbzxad9k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Hibernaculum is a first person sci-fi/horror role playing game with survival horror roots.</li>
<li>Create a unique character to explore the depths of Hibernaculum &amp; have the experience you want to have. Choices only matter, if they matter to you.</li>
<li>Non-linear gameplay allows for exploration at your own pace, and in your own fashion. Forge ahead and risk calamity or riches. Conversely, pace yourself and avoid harm.</li>
<li>Navigate decayed industrial Realms through environmental storytelling and a unique, brooding atmosphere.</li>
<li>Hibernaculum is being developed in C++ for Windows, Mac &amp; Linux with immediate plans for porting to Steam Deck, iOS &amp; Nintendo Switch.</li>
<li>Hibernaculum will initially be available in English, German, French &amp; Spanish.</li>
<li>Hibernaculum will be released DRM-free &amp; available on Steam + GOG.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can help <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hibernaculumgame/hibernaculum-survival-horror-rpg" target="_blank">fund it on Kickstarter</a>, where they have a goal of $70,000 (AU) and currently they have $46,000 (AU) with 27 days left on the campaign so they're well over half the way towards the goal.

      <title>Total War: WARHAMMER III for Linux updated to v2.4 with Immortal Empires</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Feral Interactive have now upgraded their Linux (and macOS) ports of Total War: WARHAMMER III to the latest 2.4 release — which is a big one. It was first released for the Windows version <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/total-war-warhammer-iii-update-gives-everyone-immortal-empires/" target="_blank">earlier in February</a>, so it's nice to see the wait for those sticking to the Native Linux build wasn't particularly long this time.</p>
<p>As a reminder: this update gives all players access to the huge combined Immortal Empires campaign, even if you don't own the previous games. You just won't be able to access everything for your own play-through, but you can buy DLC for older games to unlock other parts if you wish.</p>

<p>Some of the other highlights include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Immortal Empires</strong> is now available to all <em>WARHAMMER III </em>owners!</li>
<li><strong>Karak Eight Peaks</strong> is now a ten-slot settlement for the Skaven… yes-yes…</li>
<li>Malus’s quest battle for the <strong>Warpstone of Khaine</strong> is now in the Chaos Wastes, closer to his starting position.</li>
<li>Fixed a variety of visual/graphical glitches such as clipping capes, snapping models and broken animations.</li>
<li><strong>Garrisons</strong> are no longer reinforcements and now enter the battle from the start.</li>
<li>Fixed a multiplayer desync that could occur when an Empire player chose to <strong>Summon the Elector Counts</strong>.</li>
<li>Coedill will no longer immediately enter the battle instead of reinforcing once the Waystones are destroyed in <strong>Drycha’s quest battle</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Interrogating Grom the Paunch </strong>in Athel Tamarha as Eltharion now correctly gives Mistwalker units the ability to mirror Grom’s Big Waaagh ability.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where <strong>Boris Ursus</strong> wouldn’t gain supporters while the <strong>Invocation of Dazh</strong> is active.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Explore dungeons to help clear a plague in Netherguild on March 27th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After some impressive and fun early Alpha builds, the turn-based tactical roguelite dungeon-crawler Netherguild will hit Early Access on March 27th.</p>
<p>Created by David Vinokurov, a solo indie dev from Israel, in the game you're tasked with commanding expeditions below ground as your people are desperate to cure some strange plague. It's all about managing abilities, combat, inventory and exploration. As you delve deeper you will end up discovering more about some ancient lost civilization. Another interesting thing here is that there's an overworld too, which also changes with time presenting you with new opportunities and challenges.</p>
<p>Have a look at the new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Sn75aKmif1U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/507a358d993150406bf9b3171dbbb22e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Sn75aKmif1U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Roguelite with Persistence and Story:</strong> Keep your characters at the end of each expedition (if they survive), equip them with powerful items and level them up over time. Netherguild's story progresses the more you explore and find out about the secrets of its world.</li>
<li><strong>Dungeon Crawling Resource Management:</strong> Powerful abilities have a limited amount of uses. Your characters have limited inventory space. What is more important? The priceless loot you bring up back to the surface, or the firewood logs that let you descend even deeper?</li>
<li><strong>Original Game World:</strong> Netherguild may be fantasy, but don't expect it to play by genre conventions at all; No Orcs, no Elves, and no wizards casting fireballs. Expect to find strange biospheres and denizens far underground.</li>
<li><strong>Cute Voxel Aesthetics:</strong> Contrasted by a story with serious themes, as you face against plague and conspiracy!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Valve doesn&#39;t need much to make a Steam Deck 2 a huge success</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the Steam Deck recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/steam-deck-thoughts-a-year-later/" target="_blank">having a first anniversary</a>, no doubt many are thinking on what's next — I certainly am. Valve don't exactly need much to make a Steam Deck 2 a success either.</p>
<p>As a gaming device, the Steam Deck clearly isn't perfect. Nothing is. However, it's clearly popular and overall it does the job quite nicely of making the PC as a platform more accessible to a wider audience. And putting Linux in the hands of many who previously didn't care about Linux. We already know Valve are <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/steam-deck-2-is-absolutely-coming-new-booklet-from-valve-confirms/" target="_blank">looking to the future</a> for more Steam Decks too, as they said it's a "multi-generational product line".</p>
<p>Valve need to be careful on the timing of the announcement and the release. We are after all, only one year since the original's release. They need to ensure people feel like their purchase and personal investment into it was worth it, and not do any announcement too soon. How soon is too soon though? Two years? Three years? By three is it too late?</p>
<p>They need to make the upgrade worth it too. Is it just enough to have perhaps a better battery and screen? The more I think on it, I don't believe it is. Don't get me wrong, you can pry my Steam Deck from my cold dead hands but I do want <em>more</em> power in my hands too. Really though, it very much depends on what type of games you're playing for what you'll settle for. People will argue both ends from just wanting a better battery to play longer, to wanting more power to keep those troublesome AAAs at at least a solid 30FPS (or better).</p>
<p>Valve doesn't need much to make the Steam Deck 2 a success, clearly. A little wait for AMD to come out with a fresh APU that's a decent step up, a better screen and battery and job done right?</p>
<p><em>Hold on, this is going the exactly opposite way to what I thought…</em></p>
<p>I'm not asking for much. Well, <em>clearly</em> I am. The Steam Deck 2 is not exactly an <em>easy</em> task. A better higher resolution screen would need more computing power, so a newer APU would end up essential if they ran a higher resolution and then you may not see such a big performance increase (and likely a higher power draw too) — but then you would get better and clearer looking games, a better battery would make it <em>heavier</em> and it can already be uncomfortable for playing longer periods. There's actually ups and downs to anything they could upgrade, then you have to take into account the pricing on it too (even if they stuck with the same resolution, but just had a better looking screen cost is a problem).</p>
<p>That's without even thinking about storage, gosh, the problems continue. The 64GB model is so often just too small, especially with the shader pre-cache system, every single day there's support questions on people confused as to why their 64GB is full. Valve need to go bigger. Games are getting fatter all the time too, have you seen how laughably massive some games now are? This problem will only get worse over time.</p>
<p>Given how <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/steam-deck-hits-over-8000-games-playable/" target="_blank">clearly</a> people are wanting to play some of the latest games, as well as plenty of older titles, I don't think they could just settle without putting in a new more powerful AMD APU. I just don't think it would make a whole lot of sense.</p>
<p>It's a very tricky balancing act, so it really doesn't surprise me when Valve's Gabe Newell said the pricing on the current Steam Deck was "painful" in an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-deck-price-valve-gabe-newell-400-dollars-painful-but-critical" target="_blank">IGN</a>.</p>
<p>One thing we can at least count on, even with the original model, is continued improvements to compatibility thanks to their continued work on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> (or Native Linux ports if the market share became big enough to make it truly worth it), GPU drivers and much more.</p>
<p>So actually, Valve have one heck of a job to improve on what is already a good product. Can they do it? What do you think? What exactly do you want from a Steam Deck 2?</p>

      <title>SCAN UK now selling a WD 1TB SSD compatible with Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In need of a Steam Deck SSD upgrade? SCAN UK have a pretty great looking deal on a Western Digital 1TB SSD.</p>
<p>They seem to have already sold out of the Sabrent Rocket 2230 1TB NVMe that I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/scan-uk-to-offer-ssd-upgrades-compatible-with-steam-deck/" target="_blank">pointed out previously</a>, with it no longer available for purchase on their store. Luckily now they have another.</p>
<p>Even better is that this is even cheaper, the WD PC SN740 1TB M.2 2230 PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD is on a special deal price today at £99.98 (usually £109.99). Compared to the Sabrent that was £159.49 it's quite a nice price for anyone who wants some extra space, while being speedier than an SD Card. It's also fun to see more stores continue to do this, and even state "Perfect for Steam Deck" on their page.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6670364151677754362gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://www.scan.co.uk/products/1tb-wd-pc-sn740-m2-2230-s3-m-pcie-40x4-nvme-ssd-5150mb-s-read-4900mb-s-write-740k-800k-iops-tcg-pyri" target="_blank">SCAN UK</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck and Desktop Steam Beta updated, adds DualSense Edge support on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another fresh Beta is available for both the Steam Deck and Steam Desktop with plenty of bugs being fixed as usual.</p>
<p>This time around Valve seems to be directly adding and splitting what's specific to the Steam Deck in the main Steam Desktop Beta <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053/view/3650767759928418053" target="_blank">changelog</a> too making it a bit easier for people (since the majority of changes are the same between them). Here's all the changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed shortcuts regression in this beta when users or 3rd party utilities add command line parameters to the shortcut exe path.</li>
<li>Fixed crash in the games list when downloading a game.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Big Picture Mode</p>
<ul>
<li>Game invites in the Quick Access Menu will now default to opening a context menu to accept the invite rather than navigating to the chat tab and having to hit "Accept" there.</li>
<li>Fixed crash when in a voice chat.</li>
<li>Fixed crash when authorizing a microtransaction purchase in the overlay.</li>
<li>Fixed the Play button stealing focus when a game is launching.</li>
<li>Fixed "Find games to play with friends" not working in Big Picture Mode.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Logitech F310 controller input on macOS and Linux.</li>
<li>Added mapping for DualSense Edge Wireless Controller on Linux (note that advanced feature support require Steam to be able to access the /dev/hidraw* devices).</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Steam Deck</p>
<ul>
<li>Move advanced HDR options to Developer Settings.</li>
<li>Streamable games are now included in the "Ready to play" game filter, though the default action is still to install them locally.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12590523181677751071gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12590523181677751071gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Currently there's still no fixes for the performance of Steam Big Picture Mode on Linux with NVIDIA, it still performs really badly. There was also a Proton Hotfix update released ~12 hours ago, but currently Valve aren't giving out a changelog for that.</p>

      <title>Godot Engine 4.0 out now plus console porting is coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Today is the big day! <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine 4.0</a> is officially out now, and there's also work happening for developers to port their games to consoles now too.</p>
<p>Godot has been undergoing some absolutely massive overhauls for this release, to help the growing userbase of developers working with it. The result is a much more advanced and powerful free and open source game engine that supports Vulkan and OpenGL, there's a new game-specific physics engine, boosted graphics and VFX, drastically improved 3D, 2D, multiplayer and XR workflows, as well as wider localization, accessibility and platform support.</p>

<p>There's a ridiculous amount more that's new and the list goes on for a long time including AMD FSR support, significant improvements to shadows, a new real-time global illumination technique, volumetric fog, sky shaders, a new tile editor for 2D games, .NET 6 support, huge improvements to their own GDScript, upgrades to the audio systems in Godot 4 with a smart import system and so on.</p>
<p>Additionally, W4 Games, the company created by Godot veterans has <a href="https://w4games.com/2023/02/28/godot-support-for-consoles-is-coming-courtesy-of-w4-games/" target="_blank">announced</a> Godot support for consoles is coming. A private Beta will begin rolling out at GDC. This sounds like it has been quite problematic, due to how closed consoles are compared to other platforms.</p>
<p>You can also see an overview video below from GDQuest who do a lot of Godot courses:</p>

      <title>Linux Mint set to improve Flatpak support and Warpinator security updates</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In the latest <a href="https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=4477" target="_blank">Monthly News post</a>, Linux Mint's Clement Lefebvre detailed some upcoming changes and improvements to the popular Linux distribution.</p>
<p>While news came recently that Canonical were getting their Ubuntu flavours to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/ubuntu-flavours-to-drop-flatpak-by-default-and-stick-to-snaps/" target="_blank">drop Flatpak by default</a>, and Flatpak focusing on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/flathub-seeks-funding-to-add-payments-donations-and-subscriptions/" target="_blank">some big improvements</a>, it seems Linux Mint continue to go with Flatpak too. In the post Lefebvre details they're creating XDG Desktop Portal implementations are being written for Cinnamon, MATE and Xfce. The point is to have better overall compatibility for the likes of Flatpak and libAdwaita apps.</p>
<p>Other changes planned include the Nemo file manager having multi-threaded thumbnails to make it faster, the Cinnamon desktop environment will have some back-end upgrades, and some important notes were included for Warpinator, their tool for sending files between systems. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11739233101677681110gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11739233101677681110gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured - Linux Mint 21.1.</em></p>
<p>Warpinator became quite popular <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/heres-how-to-transfer-files-from-your-pc-to-a-steam-deck/" target="_blank">when I first showcased it</a> for transferring files to a Steam Deck (and then many other content creators followed along…), so it's nice to see some more focus on it. They had the SUSE security team go over it, and highlight some security <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-42725" target="_blank">concerns</a> that needed sorting. They're now working on making it more secure, to isolate Warpinator from the rest of the system to ensure it can only write files where expected.</p>
<p>The most recent release Linux Mint 21.1 was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/linux-mint-211-is-out-now/" target="_blank">back in December</a>.</p>

      <title>LEGO Bricktales to get a free Easter content update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The absolutely charming building-puzzle adventure game LEGO Bricktales is getting a free content update ready for Easter. Quite a lovely game overall, and great for a younger audience too — why should adults get all the fun?</p>
<p>From the email sent to me here's what's coming:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A beautifully crafted Easter diorama.</li>
<li>A storyline where you have to help the Easter bunny save Easter.</li>
<li>5 new construction puzzles. Four with a specific challenges and one being an open area where you can build more freely.</li>
<li>1 collection quest - Easter eggs will be hidden in the other existing worlds that you can find and use to purchase items.</li>
<li>3 new wardrobe items (purchasable with eggs players have found in the world).</li>
<li>1 new music track.</li>
<li>A new menu entry to notify you of ongoing updates.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify">No date is being given for the update just yet but they did additionally explain: "The LEGO® Bricktales free Easter update introduces an egg-cellent new story set in a small Easter world. This world becomes accessible if the player has cleared the first world (Jungle). On completion, an entrance will appear in the park leading you to the new diorama where you’ll meet the friendly Easter bunny who has a problem with making eggs for this year’s Easter celebration. Disgruntled chickens and snow damage keep them from reaching their goals, so you will need to use your quick thinking and puzzle-solving abilities to help them save Easter."</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">You can see my previous video on it below:</p>

      <title>Apex Legends banning some Linux players, keep an eye out Steam Deck players</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It appears that Apex Legends from Respawn and EA has started banning some players on Linux, and while the Steam Deck uses Linux too it seems nearly all the bans were desktop Linux players.</p>
<p>The bans started appearing just before the weekend, and I waited to see what happened here instead of jumping the gun. As we've seen in the past when only a couple mention a ban, it turned out to be actual cheaters. In this case though, more ban reports are gradually appearing on this.</p>
<p>Currently it's <em>not</em> clear what the issue is or what's causing it and the overall number is still really low when talking about the overall Apex player-base, even taking into account the lower amount of players on Linux Desktop and Steam Deck, the number is still pretty small. However, now there's quite a few noting a ban, it's worth perhaps waiting to see what happens if you value your Apex Legends account (especially if you've spent money on it…).</p>
<p>Looking over the reports on the <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/Technical-Issues/Linux-players-getting-banned/m-p/12338557#M166472" target="_blank">EA Forum</a>, at least one person was using a Steam Deck while the rest were on Desktop Linux and on the <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/4350" target="_blank">GitHub</a> post all reports there were seemingly on Desktop Linux too. Seems the players were using a mixture of different Proton versions too including Proton Experimental and GE-Proton so there's not a clear cause.</p>
<p>Apex Legends uses Easy Anti-Cheat, and they have the support turned on for Linux / Steam Deck with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a>, so this shouldn't happen to legitimate players regardless of how many it is but accidentally bans do happen. It is also a Steam Deck Verified title.</p>
<p>EA is at least looking into it as of a few hours ago, as a Community Manager <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/Technical-Issues/Linux-players-getting-banned/m-p/12345698#M166642" target="_blank">replied</a> to say they've passed the information on.</p>
<p><em>I've been playing a good few hours over last night and today with no issue on Steam Deck so far.</em></p>

      <title>Steam Deck hits over 8,000 games Playable or Verified, plus February&#39;s most-played</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve's popular Linux-powered gaming handheld, the Steam Deck, has officially crossed over the 8,000 mark for games noted to be Playable or Verified.</p>
<p>Going by the list on <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified&amp;refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B1%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Playable" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, which includes those titles no longer listed for sale on Steam but still playable if you own them the current count at time of writing is 8,003.

<ul>
<li>Verified: 2980</li>
<li>Playable: 5023</li>
<li>Unsupported: 2571</li>

      <title>JSAUX makes more Steam Deck backplate colours available</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to give your Steam Deck a bit more colour and customization? The new coloured translucent backplates from JSAUX are <a href="https://jsaux.com/products/transparent-back-plate-for-steam-deck-pc0106?variant=43781193269468" target="_blank">available</a> to order.</p>
<p>They're now available in: Brown, Purple, Blue, Green and Red at $29.99 with a Crystal (Clear) version coming sometime later. They're also offering a discount to people who already picked up the original Brown version. All of them come with a set of buttons you can pick from, anti-static finger gloves, screws, a screwdriver and a stick to help you get the backplate off.</p>
<p>This and a whole lot more, including a first-look at the backplate they sent me, is in my below news round-up video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LetMI8G3tcE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/85ee7b5d92dc1e125c7fd7dc1ef271ad.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LetMI8G3tcE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The backplate does look great but the metal pad on it does get very warm. If you want it to properly reduce temperatures other than the real small amount it does by itself, it really would need something additional on top of it to keep pulling the heat away. Still, seems really nice overall. Would be interesting if they eventually did a version without the metal plate on the back and a frontplate too.</p>
<p><em>I've reached out to their PR team to see if I will be getting the other colours to take a look at too.</em></p>

      <title>NVIDIA 530.30.02 mainline Beta driver rolls out, plus a new Vulkan Beta driver</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA has released two new Beta drivers for Linux recently, so here's your usual rundown of what's new and changed.</p>
<p>First up is the <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/download/driverResults.aspx/200095/en-uk" target="_blank">Beta 530.30.02</a>, which is for their normal mainline consumer drivers. Here's all that's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added an application profile to avoid performance problems in Xfce 4 when the OpenGL compositor backend is enabled along with G-SYNC.</li>
<li>Added support for suspend and resume when using GSP firmware.</li>
<li>Moved the nvidia-settings application icon into the 'hicolor' icon theme, which allows it to be customized by other icon themes selected in the desktop environment.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented PRIME render offload from working for Wayland applications when running on a system with an AMD iGPU.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented nvidia-installer from recording kernel log output to the installer log in some module loading failure paths.</li>
<li>Changed nvidia-installer to no longer use the $XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variable. XDG data files are now installed to a path specified by the --xdg-data-dir option, or /usr/share if not specified.<br/>
This fixes a problem when Flatpak is installed that caused the installer to place the nvidia-settings.desktop file in /root/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share/applications.</li>
<li>Changed the behavior of glXGetRefreshRateSGI() for non-integer refresh rates to round to the nearest whole number rather than truncating.</li>
<li>Changed the compression format of the .run installer package from xz to zstd. This results in a smaller compressed package, and faster decompression performance. A fallback zstd decompressor is embedded into the installer package for systems which do not already have a zstd decompression program installed.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused nvidia-installer to mistakenly unload some already loaded non-NVIDIA kernel modules.</li>
<li>Added compatibility for Linux kernels with Indirect Branch Tracking (IBT).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>NVIDIA <em>also</em> just recently released the Vulkan <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" target="_blank">Beta 525.47.11</a> for <em>developers</em> that includes these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_image_sliced_view_of_3d.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_image_sliced_view_of_3d</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixes:
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue with line stipple pattern when line stipple enable is dynamic.</li>
<li>Vulkan Video fixes:
<ul>
<li>Fix an issue where the driver is incorrectly padded in-place the API provided bitstream buffer when the size of the buffer is smaller than 16 bytes.</li>
<li>Fix an h.264 encoder bug with handling IDR pictures when the coded picture resolution changes.</li>
<li>Fix an issue where in some session configuration cases an incorrect size is being reported for the required memory heap for the h.264 encoder session.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That extension noted above was worked on by people from Valve, Igalia, Google and NVIDIA and it's described as allowing "creating 3D views of 3D images such that the views contain a subset of the slices in the image, using a Z offset and range, for the purpose of using the views as storage image descriptors. This matches functionality in D3D12 and is primarily intended to support D3D12 emulation" — so it's another that was created to help the likes of Proton.</p>

<p>After working on it for a while, Collabora developer Moses Turner has <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/monados-mercury-hand-tracking-now-ready-for-use.html" target="_blank">announced</a> that their "Mercury" hand-tracking for Monado, their open source XR runtime, is now ready for use.</p>
<p>Since it's been a while after last talking about Monado: "Monado is an open source XR runtime delivering immersive experiences such as VR and AR on mobile, PC/desktop, and other devices. Monado aims to be a complete and conformant implementation of the OpenXR API made by Khronos. The project is currently being developed for GNU/Linux and aims to support other operating systems such as Windows in the near future."</p>
<p>Work on the hand-tracking system has been going for over a year, and now ready for public use. Currently it works on the Valve Index, Windows Mixed Reality headsets (Reverb G2 v2 video below), Oculus Rift S (early support), and Luxonis cameras (video shows a OAK-D Pro W Dev mounted on a North Star). They said it "estimates hand pose accurately, supports limited hand-over-hand interactions, tracks fast hand movements, and is useable for drawing, typing and UI interaction".</p>

<p>Makes me continue to wonder if Valve will be using Monado for the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/looks-like-valve-are-gearing-up-for-a-new-vr-headset/" target="_blank">long rumoured Deckard VR HMD</a>.</p>

      <title>Paradox plan announcements next week, like a new game from Cities Skylines dev</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox Interactive announced that on Monday, March 6th they will be announcing a whole bunch of new games and expansions.</p>
<p>I'm cautiously excited as they said it will include new games from Harebrained Schemes (Shadowrun / BATTLETECH), Colossal Order (Cities Skylines) and Paradox Tectonic (led by industry veteran Rod Humble). Not just that there will also be new expansions for existing games, free updates and news from their own Paradox Arc publishing initiative.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HCbJZqnuNYg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5ca49cb654a786421aa04c32f81798c4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HCbJZqnuNYg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“I don’t want to say we have too many announcements, but it’s hard to choose which one has me most thrilled,” said Fredrik Wester, CEO of Paradox Interactive. “Talking directly with our players about our games, sharing their excitement for what’s coming next, comparing how many hours we’ve played - it’s something everyone at Paradox profoundly enjoys. I’m also eager not to have to keep these announcements secret for much longer.”</p>
<p>Their show will start at March 6, 2023 at 18:00 CET / 17:00 UTC. You'll be able to watch on their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/paradoxinteractive" target="_blank">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/paradoxinteractive" target="_blank">Twitch</a>.</p>
<p>Will you be tuning in? What are you hoping to see announced?</p>

      <title>Inventory management roguelike Backpack Hero releases 1.0 in May</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Currently in Early Access with Native Linux support and rated Steam Deck Playable, the inventory management roguelike Backpack Hero is releasing in full in May.</p>
<p>This is actually a surprising amount of fun thanks to the inventory sorting mechanic, and something I didn't expect to really like overall originally but it clearly <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/backpack-hero-is-an-inventory-management-roguelike-and-my-new-favourite-game/" target="_blank">won me over easily</a> when I first started with it. The way it's designed really keeps you constantly thinking about all of your equipment, since the position in your bag is key and can really affect your power. Plenty of others agree since it has a Very Positive rating on Steam too.</p>
<p>Now the developer has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1970580/view/3646264166717131984" target="_blank">announced</a> they plan to have a 1.0 release in May along with major upgrades. Some of what's coming to it include a big Town Update adding in some more depth, Twitch integration and more.</p>

<li>The ability to mute other players.</li>
<li>Lots of bug fixes.</li>
<li>It's a <a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/dc394e2f3532e7fe830118716ebdbaaa4e945eaf" target="_blank">long list</a> of improvements.</li>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fury Unleashed, a fast-paced action roguelike from Awesome Games Studio, recently had a rather nice upgrade for Steam Deck players. It has full Linux support with a Native Linux version too, and it is now Steam Deck Verified using that Native build.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/465200/announcements/detail/5663873078633332449" target="_blank">update</a> released February 24th included these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Better controller type detection for the in-game prompts.</li>
<li>Some UI elements, story segments &amp; text were enlarged for better readability.</li>
<li>The UI scaling option now defaults to 200% when the game is launched on Steam Deck.</li>
<li>When playing on Steam Deck in handheld mode, the "Auto" graphics settings no longer reduce the quality of the related options when the game's FPS/refresh rate is locked to a value lower than 60.</li>
<li>Other minor improvements &amp; bug/stability fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer - Part 27: Lost Souls</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-26-coming-to-you-live/" target="_blank">Part 26: Coming to You Live</a></strong></p>
<p>I have mentioned before how I was unable to get Dave Taylor's original port of <em>Doom</em> to work as it was built as an outdated a.out binary rather than ELF. Since then, I stumbled on an article by Jason Heiss that describes how to load the binfmt_aout kernel module to attain a.out binary support, as well as installing the ld.so-1.9.5-13.i386.rpm and aout-libs-1.4-9.i386.rpm packages from earlier Red Hat Linux releases to provide the necessary libraries.</p>
<p>Sure enough, with those in place the primordial Linux port of <em>Doom</em> works, albeit from an XFree86 server configured to run at only 8 bit colour depth. The other expected limitations apply such as the lack of any music, but the strangest issue I had was with the sound effects. On first launch I was hearing <em>Heretic</em> noises, as <em>Doom</em> was using the sndserver binary from the Linux Heretic source port installed in /usr/local/bin rather than its own. Replacing the sndserver solved the issue.</p>
<p>Another spanner in the works is that the X11 version of <em>Doom</em> is in effect keyboard only. A launch parameter does exist to grab the mouse, but this is bugged; I did get my Perixx PERIMICE-209 WP working with SVGALib by modifying the ~/.doomrc file to have mousdev set to "/dev/psaux" and mousetype set to "PS2". Under X11 the game runs in a 320x200 window with no full screen option, but you can double or triple the pixels using the "-2" and "-3" parameters.</p>
<p>The shareware release of <em>Doom</em> is included inside the linux-doom-1.8.tar.gz archive I used to install the xdoom and sdoom binaries. Explicit support is offered for the registered <em>Doom</em> and <em>Doom II</em>, with <em>Final Doom </em>possible as a set of add-on WADs. Demo playback only works with the shareware, producing version errors everywhere else. A mixed bag to be sure, but even before the <em>Doom</em> source code was opened, hackers were making improvements to the Linux version.</p>
<p>A fan patch included in the udoom-1.1.tar.gz archive adds support for <em>The Ultimate Doom</em> and seems to fix the demos, while musserver.tgz even hacks in MIDI music through a separate musserver binary. I had to fake the /dev/sndstat device file, but it works. These changes would be mainlined after Bernd Kreimeier tidied up the Linux code for public release, but thanks to Dave Taylor's other studio Crack dot Com, I have another example of a.out insanity I can try as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7211078341676962040gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7211078341676962040gol6.png"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13113369781676962061gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13113369781676962061gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>Several iterations of the Linux binaries for <em>Abuse</em> are available, but I opted to install the abuse-1.10-5.i386.rpm package as distributed by Red Hat. This provides a few niceties such as custom launch scripts installed into the /usr/games directory, as well as the original <em>Abuse</em> shareware data with the alien ants storyline. The X11 version<em> </em>launches in a 320x200 window also at 8 bit colour depth<em>,</em> but you can stop the cursor leaving the window with the "-grab_pointer" launch parameter.</p>
<p>This is how <em>Abuse</em> was intended to be played, but you can toggle higher resolutions by using the "-size" parameter. This will disable the lighting engine, as well as exposing more of the level to the point of being considered a cheat by the developers. Due to this they also included a pixel doubling mode using the "-2" parameter that preserves the original viewing area and lighting at resolutions of 640x400 or above. I ran with 640x480 so I could hack full screen like I did with <em>Quake</em>.</p>
<p>A few effects will still only flash in the 320x200 area, and I did have some redrawing issues when loading saved games, but these always resolved themselves on the second attempt. The other problem I had was with the sound effects, which only worked when abuse.x11 was launched with root privileges. Speaking of needing root, abuse.svga which uses SVGALib starts fine but then stalls at the cursor; I even tried using an old Mouse Systems serial mouse with it but no dice.</p>
<p>If this sounds insecure, it is because it is. In fact, known privilege escalation exploits exist due to how the SVGALib version of <em>Abuse</em> executes its undrv and sndrv binaries. In some ways we should be grateful for such sloppiness, as it is how we got the SVGALib version of <em>Quake</em>. Dave Taylor only ported the game to X11, but thanks to the <em>Quake</em> source code being stolen from the Crack dot Com server, coder Greg Alexander was able to finish a port to SVGALib in just twenty four hours.</p>
<p>Alexander even had the chutzpah to submit the patches to John Carmack, who graciously accepted them without the threat of legal action. Crack dot Com would show the same community spirit by opening up the <em>Abuse</em> source code and releasing most of the <em>Abuse</em> shareware assets into the public domain. This allowed for the creation of enhanced source ports to Linux such as Abuse-SDL, as well as the fRaBs level set using the shareware assets. If only all games could be as lucky.</p>

<p>The proposal is available on the Plaintext Group <a href="https://github.com/PlaintextGroup/oss-virtual-incubator/blob/main/proposals/flathub-linux-app-store.md" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, which was submitted by Robert McQueen, who is CEO of the Endless OS Foundation and GNOME Board President. For some context here Plaintext Group are "a nonpartisan, technology innovation policy initiative being developed by Schmidt Futures" (Schmidt Futures was founded by ex Google CEO Eric Schmidt).</p>
<p>As per the proposal they're trying to incentivize more "participation in the Linux application ecosystem, and remove financial barriers that prevent diverse participation" and they've already been working on adding in donations and payments on Flathub via Stripe and verify developers too with this year moving onto adding in subscriptions, reoccurring donations, new review tools to prevent abuse, automated security scanning and more to eventually have Flathub become self-sustaining. This is a joint effort between GNOME and KDE.</p>
<p>What they're trying to do is get extra funding to help towards their goal of expanding Flathub, as explained in the proposal they're seeking $100,000 USD from the Plaintext Group to cover the remaining budget needed to enable all this.</p>
<p>To note: this proposal has actually been there since November 2022, when the proposal itself was accepted into the GitHub repository for consideration.</p>
<p>What do you think to this? Especially interesting with Canonical recently going on the opposite direction by having Ubuntu <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/ubuntu-flavours-to-drop-flatpak-by-default-and-stick-to-snaps/" target="_blank">flavours remove Flatpak by default</a>.</p>
<p><em>Flathub is also going through a <a href="https://blog.jimmac.eu/2023/flathub-brand-refresh/" target="_blank">rebranding</a>.</em></p>

      <title>Kubuntu Focus announce the second-gen mini desktop Focus NX</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need some power in a small box with full Linux support? The Kubuntu Focus team recently revealed their second-generation Focus NX. This is a small form factor desktop that comes with Kubuntu (KDE Plasma desktop) 22.04 LTS.</p>
<p>Coming with either a Intel Core i7-1240P or i7-1260P (base model), it can be fitted with up to 64GB 3200Mhz RAM (8GB base model) and 2TB NVMe (250GB base model). Seems overall like a nice unit, and when you take into account pricing on all the parts together with dedicated Linux support. Pricing starts at $795 and it's basically a branded pre-configured Intel Wallstreet Canyon NUC.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20746527091677498438gol1.jpeg"/></p>
<p>It comes filled with these ports:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 x Intel Wi-Fi 6E AX211 Gig+, up to 2.4 Gbit/s 802.11 ax</li>
<li>1 x Bluetooth 5.3</li>
<li>3 x USB-A 3.2 (2 in front, one in rear)</li>
<li>1 x USB-A 2.0 (rear)</li>
<li>1 x Audio Jack 3.5mm Headphone + Mic (front)</li>
<li>2 x Thunderbolt™ 4 / USB-C with DisplayPort 1.4a (rear)</li>
<li>2 x HDMI 2.1 (rear)</li>
<li>1 x RJ-45 Intel i225-V 2.5 GbE LAN (rear)</li>
<li>1 x Kensington Lock Mount</li>
<li>1 x Cable Management Bracket</li>
<li>1 x VESA Monitor-Mount Bracket</li>
</ul>
<p>From their Press Release:</p>
<p>“We feel the NX GEN 2 is a great replacement for 2- or 3-year-old high-performance systems: its CPU performance is excellent, yet it is far quieter and uses much less space and power,” says Michael Mikowski, General Manager. “The second generation improves on the first with better single- and multi-core performance, greater expandability, and updated ports.”</p>
<p>“Of course, the excellent hardware is only half of the story. Like with all our systems, we constantly test and distribute hardware optimizations through regular package upgrades. For example, the hardware-support subsystem for the NX GEN 2 adjusts the iGPU configuration to minimize flicker and maximize performance. We also ensure the system and kernel configuration is eGPU-ready and tested.”</p>
<p>They currently only ship to the US and Canada. </p>

      <title>Wayland driver for Wine is getting closer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Back <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/wine-on-wayland-sounds-like-its-coming-along-nicely/" target="_blank">late last year</a>, Collabora developer Alexandros Frantzis blogged about a whole lot of work going into getting full Wayland support for Wine and now a big first step towards it being included in Wine is happening.</p>
<p>Frantzis has now put up a <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/merge_requests/2275" target="_blank">Merge Request</a>, to have the first of many parts begin to be included in Wine. This first part "introduces the Wayland driver PE and unixlib components with some basic code, and prepares the makedep tool to be able to handle Wayland protocol files".</p>
<p>So right now, it's not too exciting for end-users but a big step in the right direction and will lead to more being included, to then eventually having a full Wayland driver for Wine included. Frantzis mentioned Part 2 will include "basic Wayland wl_output (i.e., display) events and populate the Wine monitor information".</p>
<p>It's being done in parts since it's quite large and their goal is just to make it easier for people to review the code and suggest improvements as they go along. Seems like a sane idea.</p>

      <title>ScummVM 2.7.0 &#39;The Real Slim Shader&#39; supports even more classics</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.scummvm.org/" target="_blank">ScummVM</a> 2.7.0, The Real Slim Shader, is officially out now bringing more compatibility for retro titles to modern platforms so here's what's new. What exactly is ScummVM? To put it simply: it's a whole set of different open source game engines under one roof, with each focusing on a different type of retro games.</p>
<p>First up, there's some fresh titles that had support added in 2.7.0 including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Soldier Boyz</li>
<li>Obsidian</li>
<li>Pink Panther: Passport to Peril</li>
<li>Pink Panther: Hokus Pokus Pink</li>
<li>Adibou 2 "Environment", "Read/Count 4 &amp; 5" and "Read/Count 6 &amp; 7"</li>
<li>Driller/Space Station Oblivion</li>
<li>Halls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II</li>
<li>Chop Suey, Eastern Mind, and 16 other Director 3 and Director 4 titles</li>
</ul>
<p>On top of that they've improved support for the Broken Sword series and there's new translations including support added for: Chinese, Japanese and Korean versions of many games. Portability was also a focus this time around with a bunch of platforms revived to work with it including: RetroMini RS90 (using OpenDingux), 1st generation Miyoo (New BittBoy, Pocket Go and PowKiddy Q90-V90-Q20) with TriForceX MiyooCFW, Miyoo Mini, KolibriOS, 26-bit versions of RISC OS and Nintendo 3DS.</p>
<p>There's new shader-based scalers, going with their codename "The Real Slim Shader", so they say you can now again enjoy the "warm glow of CRTs shining on your face" and they ship with a curated set of shaders taken from LibRetro.</p>
<p>Lastly another highlight is pre-defined random number seeds so people can have reproducible runs in certain games, useful for speedrunners.</p>

      <title>X-Plane 12 now uses the open source Zink driver to help Plugins</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, this is certainly fun to see. X-Plane 12 now makes use of the open source Zink driver, for doing OpenGL over Vulkan.</p>
<p>As Zink developer Mike Blumenkrantz mentioned in their <a href="https://www.supergoodcode.com/monumental/" target="_blank">blog post</a> "Zink has been commercialized" and they sound very happy about that. Zink is now a driver that "runs real games in production for real, existing people". A pretty impressive milestone for the project.</p>
<p>So what's this all about? As per the X-Plane 12 <a href="https://developer.x-plane.com/2023/02/addressing-plugin-flickering/" target="_blank">announcement</a>, the game developers have added Zink into the game. They're using it for their plugin system, which currently has some long-standing issues with native OpenGL drivers at times being rubbish. It's all highly technical stuff, and most normal players probably won't understand a lot of it.</p>
<p>X-Plane nowadays uses the Vulkan API or Metal (on macOS) but the problem is, they have a long history of plugins and plugin developers using OpenGL. So what they're now doing is using Zink as a go-between, having it sit "between plugins and X-Plane and translates plugin OpenGL rendering into native Vulkan commands that get executed by the same Vulkan device that X-Plane is using for rendering" — clever stuff.</p>
<p>The result they're going for is to have their plugin system work better than before, and potential performance improvements. There's the added bonus that they have a lot more control over everything too, and plugin developers also now have more power and better debugging options.</p>
<p>If you're interested in the finer details I suggest reading their <a href="https://developer.x-plane.com/2023/02/addressing-plugin-flickering/" target="_blank">announcement</a>.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Busy weekend? No? How about some fresh games! Humble Bundle has put up a pretty darn good collection in the latest bundle.

      <title>Totally Accurate Battlegrounds now works on Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Totally Accurate Battlegrounds got upgraded recently due to needing to implement new anti-cheat, and thanks to that this free to play game now works on Linux Desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>The issue is that they were using EQU8, which is now exclusive to Splitgate. Instead they've switched to Easy Anti-Cheat, the newer EOS version, which they seem to have fully enabled for Linux too. Thanks to that, it will work just fine on Linux desktop and Steam Deck. I've tested that too and yup — works without issues on Fedora Linux and Steam Deck.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10459493381677166583gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10459493381677166583gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Totally Accurate Battlegrounds on Fedora KDE 37.</em></p>
<p>Probably one of the silliest games around. It's a Battle Royale like Fortnite, but with wobbly-physics characters</p>
<p>Only quirk I noticed is that on Desktop Linux, I needed to restart Steam before it would actually load. Thanks to the new anti-cheat, hopefully there will be less cheaters too since obviously Epic Games have far more resources to put into EAC than EQU8 would have.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Up to 60 players (wobblin' around).</li>
<li>Squad, duo and solo mode (great for first dates).</li>
<li>Physics-based parkour (the wobblier the better).</li>
<li>Fun-sized map (for fun-sized people).</li>
<li>90+ weapons (including a shallow pot with a long handle).</li>
<li>Catchphrases (Speak freely in this game... Using 3 words).</li>
<li>Blessings and curses for those of you who do well (and not so well).</li>
<li>Limbo (u not dead yet mate).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/823130/view/3653017658282026315?l=english" target="_blank">announcement</a> they mentioned how they're also opening up the game for people to host their own servers, so it can continue on potentially forever. This is a great move for a developer to do when they're no longer actively working on a game but I do wish more games just put server binaries out there for everyone but that's an argument and complaint for another day.</p>

      <title>Stellaris: First Contact releasing March 14th with a free update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox have announced that the Stellaris: First Contact Story Pack will be releasing on March 14th, along with the Canis Minor free update for all players.</p>
<p>First Contact is focused on new interactions and game mechanics for pre-FTL civilizations, which should make numerous parts of the game more interesting. Not only that, the new cloaking technology that will become available should enrich some spying and espionage. There's plenty more in it like new civilization origins and other new game mechanics to make it sound quite exciting.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qWzw7CE21gY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/67cce2c7114c9c700f97b35a5bcee9a0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qWzw7CE21gY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Main Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Origins</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Broken Shackles</strong>: You didn’t take to the stars; you were taken to the stars as an alien captive! Now, you and your fellow prisoners have overtaken the ship and found yourselves banding together to survive and thrive as a diverse new community. Can you rise to greatness from this humble origin… and will your former captors take notice?</li>
<li><strong>Payback</strong>: No one would have believed your world was being watched keenly by intelligences greater than your own — until they invaded. But you did not go quietly into the night! Your civilization has repelled a would-be conqueror from space, and with sudden access to their advanced technology, you’re about to discover just what else is out there beyond the stars!</li>
<li><strong>Fear of the Dark</strong>: As you’ve explored your home system, you’ve always suspected you weren’t alone in the galaxy… especially when one of your planets suddenly suffered an “incident” a while back. A very large faction of your own people have long advocated against tempting fate out in the dark abyss of the unknown. What path will you choose as you find yourself needing room to grow?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Pre-FTL</strong>: What will your role be when the next member of the galactic community tells their origin story? New mechanics allow for a broader range of interactions with pre-FTL civilizations, depending on their level of technology and their awareness of your presence. Will your arrival be celebrated, or met with violent panic?</li>
<li><strong>Cloaking</strong>: Nobody saw this feature coming! Equip your ships with cloaking devices to survey in secret or catch a foe unaware; keep subtle tabs on your pre-FTL neighbors with cloaked observation posts. Just be sure your own scanners and intel are strong… you never know which of your neighbors might be lurking in the shadows!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be available March 14th.</p>
<p>As for the free update they mentioned it will contain various gameplay improvements, add new "Archaeotechnologies" to dig up in the Ancient Relics Story Pack and more.</p>

      <title>ChimeraOS 39 released switching to the new Steam Big Picture Mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://chimeraos.org/" target="_blank">ChimeraOS</a>, the Linux distribution designed for couch gaming much like SteamOS, has version 39 out now. This is the first release since Valve swapped to the New Big Picture Mode from the Steam Deck. Designed very much to be just like SteamOS, except with a bunch of added extras, it boots directly into Steam Big Picture Mode.</p>
<p>Release version 39 comes with Linux kernel 6.1.11, Mesa 22.3.4 with ANV patches for Gamescope and NVIDIA 525.89.02.</p>
<p>Here's the main highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Switch to Gamepad/Deck UI by default.</li>
<li>Fully Integrate system updates into the Gamepad/Deck UI.</li>
<li>Preserve non-Steam game shortcuts not created by the Chimera web app.</li>
<li>Added Nintendo DS support.</li>
<li>Updated install media with new system repair/recovery functionality.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where custom launch options and Steam input settings were not being applied.</li>
<li>Stability improvements to Hogwarts Legacy and possibly other games.</li>
<li>Fixed some issues with Flatpak desktop integration.</li>
<li>Added boot/splash animation (by Mark Tolle).</li>
<li>Fixed boot failure with Nvidia + certain Intel CPUs.</li>
<li>Improvements to Intel GPU compatibility.</li>
<li>HandyGCCS: Swapped default mapping for QAM and Guide buttons on OXP and AOKZOE devices. Guide will now. activate on a short press of the "orange/yellow" key.</li>
<li>HandyGCCS: Improved stuttering for gyro controls on supported devices.</li>
<li>Removable media will now be checked for compatibility when formatting.</li>
<li>Some supported Ryzen APU's will have their T-junction temp set to 95C automatically. This solves overheating issues in some handheld consoles.</li>
<li>The split_lock_detect kernel parameter is now set to off by default.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Ubuntu flavours to drop Flatpak by default and stick to Snaps</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Canonical has announced a change in the packaging defaults for the various "flavours" like Kubuntu, Ubuntu MATE, Ubuntu Budgie and so on to exclude Flatpak and stick with Snap. <em>Yes that's <a href="https://ubuntu.com/desktop/flavours" target="_blank">flavours</a>, not flavors but also flavors in the <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-flavor-packaging-defaults/34061" target="_blank">announcement</a>.</em></p>
<p>This is no doubt going to be a hot topic, because name me a more intense argument in the Linux world than <em><strong>packaging</strong></em>. While Flatpak has been gaining many fans lately, partly because it's included as the official way to install extra packages in Desktop Mode on the Steam Deck, Canonical are sticking to their own Snap.</p>
<p>So what's going on? In short: Ubuntu flavours will no longer have Flatpak enabled or setup by default. However, users can still do it themselves as they're not being removed from any repositories. It's all about the out of the box experience, with Canonical and the flavours now sticking to deb and snap to maintain their focus on what is actually properly supported by them and gets the most attention.</p>
<p>Users who have Flatpak installed won't see any changes, it's just the out of the box new-install experience as of April 2023, with the release of Ubuntu Lunar Lobster.</p>
<p>This is, after all, why we have different distributions isn't it? They're free to make whatever decisions they wish, and people who don't like it can go elsewhere, <em>or</em> just change the defaults to their liking — Linux is open and configurable unlike certain other systems. Do what you want.</p>
<p>So while it's going to be controversial, it's not exactly a big deal is it? Sort of. It's still making the desktop Linux experience quite <em>messy</em>, especially for newer users since there's no single way of installing things across different Linux distributions. You can't usually just point people to this thing and say get that, unless you first know the exact distribution they're on.</p>
<p>If you have thoughts you can comment on the announcement and let them know.</p>

      <title>No Man&#39;s Sky Fractal gets a VR overhaul, new Expedition, Gyro update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>No Man's Sky has another big update out now that includes an overhaul of quite a few features like much better VR support, and a new Expedition. The game continues to run nicely on Steam Deck and Linux Desktop with Proton.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://twitter.com/NoMansSky/status/1628400975097520128" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, the official account mentioned "Fractal brings gyroscopic support to Switch, PlayStation and Steam Deck players" but from my own testing, there's <em>no</em> special gyro settings actually in-game for the Windows version run through <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> on Steam Deck. They do have an extra Steam Input configuration specifically for Gyro on Steam Deck though, which just sets the Gyro on the right thumbstick to act as Mouse movement with some settings adjusted for you.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18489076281677149199gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18489076281677149199gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12405602961677149200gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12405602961677149200gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>The official changelog also only mentions PlayStation and Nintendo Switch for Gyro. Still nice to have it all pre-configured though via Steam Input. It at least seems to work the same as their brief clip of it on Nintendo Switch in the previously linked tweet in my testing of it on Steam Deck:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12347708041677149547gol1.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12347708041677149547gol1.gif"/></a></p>
<p>It doesn't work <em>all</em> the time though. Sometimes the Gyro just stops working until I do another random action or two, but it's not clear if that's a game bug or a Steam Input bug on Steam Deck. <em>I've <a href="https://twitter.com/gamingonlinux/status/1628707780939972608" target="_blank">asked</a> for more info.</em></p>
<p>There's also the new Expedition, improved HDR lighting, a new Utopia Speeder starship, clearer game settings when starting a game, new visual affects around ancient portals, plaques, and monoliths, overhauled VR support, new accessibility options and much more.</p>
<p>See their update video below:</p>

      <title>Valve tricks Dota 2 cheaters and then bans 40,000 of them</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In a new post titled "<a href="https://www.dota2.com/newsentry/3677788723152833273" target="_blank">Cheaters Will Never Be Welcome in Dota</a>", Valve mentioned how they managed to get a whole lot of cheaters to show themselves and then gave them a swift boot to the buttocks.</p>
<p>Valve mentioned how they managed to ban 40,000 cheaters that were using third-party software over the last few weeks. How though? It's actually quite clever! They created a honeypot to trap people, and similar to a way you used to be able to fight some spam bots on website registration forms.</p>
<p>This third-party cheating software was able to show people things they weren't supposed to see during normal play, giving them an unfair advantage. So Valve added a bit that no one should see, which this cheating software showed people and so Valve could then have "extremely high confidence that every ban was well-deserved".</p>
<p>Valve make it clear that while the initial ban wave was "particularly large", it's just all part of their ongoing effort to remove cheaters from Dota 2, which is usually done in secret but they wanted a public example of their effort.</p>
<p>Good job Valve.</p>
<p>Dota 2 is free to play on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/570/Dota_2/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>1980s mystery adventure Unusual Findings added Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's one from late last year that I missed, 1980s mystery adventure Unusual Findings gained a Native Linux version. The new support was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1605320/view/3492007864115413981" target="_blank">announced</a> for Linux and macOS back in November 2022 where the developer mentioned they "worked day and night to polish and release versions of Unusual Findings for macOS and Linux".</p>
<p><em>The game launched in October, so that's a pretty good turnaround time to get a Linux version out.</em></p>
<p>More about it: "It’s the 80s and the Christmas is coming, Vinny, Nick and Tony are young and their new cable signal descrambler just arrived. That same night while trying to decrypt a pay per view adult channel, they pick up the distress signal of an alien spaceship crash-landing in the woods near their town… Things only get weirder as they realize that the towering alien is killing very specific members of their community!"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kT9AX_07Rsc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3aed421ec9294063b4514d864ccf58fd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kT9AX_07Rsc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Follow the Sci-Fi coming-of-age story. Three friends fighting together against the unknown… things (maybe against some known things too).</li>
<li>See, Grab and Talk action tokens, an inventory to use and combine items and your wits it’s all you need to play.</li>
<li>Stylized Pixel Art. All the charm of pixel art of the past with more colors and the new effects of the future. Some pixels look so real they can almost jump out of the screen*</li>
<li>Go back to a simpler time where mix tapes were a thing, Commodore 64 was a king, kids could play outside late at night and the only thing to worry about was THE GIANT KILLER ALIEN TRYING TO GET YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS.</li>
<li>The decisions you make affect the relations between characters and thus the puzzles, the game progression and the story.</li>
<li>The most radical music a synthesizer can play. Cool popular Synthwave Music alongside catchy tunes made exclusively for the game to power up the 80s vibes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1605320/Unusual_Findings/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has no Steam Deck rating yet from Valve.</p>

      <title>Environmental strategy game Terra Nil releases March 28th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A game idea I absolutely love and the early demos were impressive, the environmental strategy game Terra Nil releases on March 28th. In this game you're transforming a ruined wasteland, to bring it back to life and get it green. Purify the soil, clean up the oceans, get rivers flowing, plant some trees and make it right.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wpX9MsuUmow"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6b67b7689f3f2b7b6428f5ed631c754d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wpX9MsuUmow" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A reverse city builder - Use advanced eco-technology to purify the soil, creating plains, wetlands, beaches, rainforests, wildflowers, and more—then efficiently recycle everything you've built, leaving the environment pristine for its new animal inhabitants.</li>
<li>Different maps every time - Procedurally generated landscapes mean no two playthroughs of Terra Nil will ever be the same. Plan your build around randomized, challenging, and unpredictable terrain, including snaking rivers, mountains, lowlands, and oceans.</li>
<li>A natural ebb and flow - Each region of Terra Nil progresses through phases, with the ultimate goal being leaving pristine wilderness behind. Levels are not about infinite growth, but rather balancing and nurturing the environment before leaving it in peace.</li>
<li>Experience tranquility - Lush hand-painted environments, relaxing music, and an atmospheric ambient soundscape make Terra Nil a peaceful, meditative experience. When you're done, use Appreciate mode to bask in the natural beauty of the ecosystem you have restored.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For Steam Deck support, the developer said they're "working to get it verified" and for direct Linux support they <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1593030/eventcomments/3776868105349343572/?tscn=1676986768#c3776868105352654673" target="_blank">said</a> it's "something the team will be looking at asap". I'll be happily taking a look at this one, because I really did absolutely love the earlier tech demos before they decided to turn it into a full game, it was wonderful to play even back then.</p>

      <title>Wreckfest is a smashing good time on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Got the need for speed? You should check out Wreckfest! It's a lot of fun and it works amazingly well on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>This isn't a new game, far from it, Wreckfest was released back in 2018. One reason I wanted to try it is that I love these destruction derby style games, and the developer clearly cares about the Steam Deck experience too since they put in a dedicated crash-bug <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/228380/view/3672156687242497774" target="_blank">fix</a>. It's hilarious too, you get to drive a speedy lawn mower and even a motorized sofa — and it's as ridiculous as it sounds.</p>
<p>Performance really is surprising too, with it <em>mostly</em> giving a smooth 60FPS on Medium on Steam Deck with Proton 7.0-6. Check out my Steam Deck video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kJCuxX7SKuQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4de3b6c38b1c417b5d9fe368f130d026.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kJCuxX7SKuQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As for how it runs on Desktop Linux? Trying it there too on Fedora KDE 37 with my Ryzen 5800x and an NVIDIA 2080 Ti and it's a bit different. The Epic and even High settings presets at 1440p did not give a smooth 60FPS, some tracks really struggled. Swapping it down to 1080p, and it <em>didn't</em> make enough of a difference.</p>
<p>The performance on desktop is just odd. At the start of a lot of races, the performance will be a fair amount lower than even 30 seconds into the race, when you're sat with all the other cars. Once you get properly into a race, even on more demanding tracks, the framerate goes up quite a bit sometimes (not always) so it seems directly tied to how many cars you're seeing so turning down the amount of cars on an event will help.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9170485841676979087gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9170485841676979087gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Ignore the big spike on the graph, that's the screenshot being taken. I don't entirely get why, even when making a screenshot without a UI via terminal, that it causes such performance spikes in games. Likely some sort of x11 issue. Wayland still isn't usable enough with NVIDIA for me.</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer - Part 26: Coming to You Live</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-25-quantum-axcess/" target="_blank">Part 25: Quantum Axcess</a></strong></p>
<p>I have referenced a number of times now some of my experiences with Knoppix, which prompted me to see if I could still find the original CD-R disc I used back in the day. It turns out it was Knoppix 3.4 released in May 2004 that obsessed me as a child, providing me with some of my earliest steps into a larger world. Not only that, but the CD-R disc it was burned on still reads even after all of these years. Considering the volatility of such media, this surprised me.</p>
<p>Named for its creator Klaus Knopper of Germany, Knoppix is a derivative of Debian which pioneered the modern Linux live media experience at the turn of the millennium. While the honour of being the first Linux live CD goes to Yggdrasil close to a full decade earlier, it was Knoppix that truly showed how powerful and effective Linux from a CD could be to the masses. In fact, everything that Knoppix manages can best be described as no small miracle.</p>
<p>Operating out of system memory by use of a RAM drive, the fact that Knoppix does not even flinch at my paltry 512 MB of RAM is impressive enough. Adding to this feat, most of my hardware was detected and configured without the need for any prompting from me. The only exception to this was the DRI module for my Rage 128 Pro graphics card not being loaded by default, but this was easily addressed by passing the "knoppix xmodule=r128" boot option during start up. </p>
<p>Lack of disk space forced me to be selective when installing Red Hat Linux 7.3 to my hard drive, meaning I just stuck with the default Gnome 1.4 desktop environment and the applications contained therein. As such, getting myself reacquainted with KDE 3 again proved to be a treat. Included here are versions of <em>KAtomic, KAsteroids</em>, <em>KBattleship, KBounce</em>, <em>KMahjongg</em>, <em>KReversi</em>, and <em>KSokoban</em>. There is also the fun if sometimes off putting <em>Potato Guy</em> software toy.</p>
<p>Alongside the bundled KDE games were a few familiar faces. Included on the CD was <em>The Ace of Penguins</em> card game suite as was also featured in <em>100 Great Linux Games</em>, and I could at long last play and win the final 1.0.0 version of <em>Frozen Bubble</em> that refused to build for me on Red Hat Linux. Level 70 proved its potency once more, although I did spend longer tackling the final level of the game this time. Perhaps Level 70 should be moved to be the penultimate level instead.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1732091021676594965gol6.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1732091021676594965gol6.jpg"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7108996271676539746gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7108996271676539746gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>Another favourite included with Knoppix 3.4 is <em>iMaze</em>, a client/server pseudo-3D deathmatch game inspired by <em>MIDI Maze</em> for the Atari ST. Alongside multiplayer, <em>iMaze</em> even sports support for computer controlled bots called ninjas through the use of a separate application, which go on to show that even smiley faces can be terrifying. There is just something sinister about their sacharine visages stalking the primitive single level landscape, even if they do get stuck on edges.</p>
<p>Other games bundled on the disc include <em>GNU Chess</em>, <em>gTans</em>, <em>Netris</em>, <em>XBattle</em>, <em>XBoard</em>, <em>XBoing II, XGalaga</em>, <em>XKoules</em>, and <em>XSkat</em>. Also present is <em>Falcon's Eye</em>, which runs just about as well I remember it did. In a similar boat is <em>Chromium B.S.U. </em>which produced a black screen on launch. Clearly some games are better suited to running off of live media than others. <em>Enigma</em> meanwhile gave me I/0 errors, but that may just be the CD-R showing its age at last.</p>
<p>Having gotten 3D acceleration to work, I decided to do my usual OpenGL test by loading <em>Quake III Arena</em> from the hard drive, which launched without complaint. I did encounter the same graphical glitches with shadows and marks on walls that I had experienced with Red Hat Linux 9 however, demonstrating beyond a doubt that there was a regression introduced into the driver upstream. Beyond this <em>Quake III Arena</em> ran beautifully from Knoppix.</p>
<p>This qualified success got me wondering if could at long last also play the ultimate 2005 release of <em>Cube</em>, which did indeed also start up just fine. No graphical glitches were apparent, although the performance did seem to suffer in comparison to the earlier <em>Cube</em> release I had been playing. Whether this was due to increased graphical demands in the latest version of the game, or simply the fact I was running it from a live environment, I am unsure.</p>
<p>While my principle interest in playing around with Knoppix was that of nostalgia, having a later Linux distribution on hand with support for applications on the other side of the glibc 2.3 boundary may well come in handy going forward. This is far from the only compatibility issue to have frustrated my attempts to get certain games to work in the past, but after having just previously dismissed the possibility of getting one of them running, I suddenly had a major breakthrough.</p>

      <title>Dead Space got a small update for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In case you missed it in my recent <a href="https://youtu.be/kVfGOsMI1Hs" target="_blank">Steam Deck news video</a>, Motive released an update for the new Dead Space to improve it even more on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>While at release Dead Space did not work well on Steam Deck, it was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/valve-fix-dead-space-steam-deck/" target="_blank">fixed up rather quickly</a> by Valve with Proton and it has become Steam Deck Verified. Now, the actual game developer has taken notice. In their latest patch info they <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1693980/view/3648515515970783142" target="_blank">mentioned</a> "Steam Deck Improvements" which was noted at the top before listing a bunch of gameplay tweaks.</p>
<p>Sadly, they didn't go into <em>any</em> detail at all, so we're back to non-descriptive on-liners like this. I always find it weird that sometimes developers don't actually explain <em>what</em> they did. Reminds me of a lot of mobile app and console updates that list things like "stability improvements" without giving a clue as to what was changed — such secrecy annoys me. Like how <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/the-callisto-protocol-got-a-steam-deck-upgrade/" target="_blank">The Callisto Protocol now hides</a> the benchmark mode on Steam Deck. Still, it's nice to see developers pay attention to a Linux gaming device.</p>
<p>You can see my previous Steam Deck video on Dead Space below where it was already working quite nicely:</p>

      <title>Open source evolution game Thrive adds part upgrades and a benchmark mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Benchmark the cells! Evolve all the things! Thrive 0.6.1 is a fun sounding upgrade to this free and open source scientific evolution sim.</p>
<p>One of the big new features is the ability to actually upgrade parts. While it's early days for the feature with only one part able to use it, they can and will be expanding it across many other parts included in the game. The idea is to give you a bit more freedom in how you play it. Right now you can upgrade the Cilia to pull things in from a distance and the more you have the stronger the pull.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12767321261676898365gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12767321261676898365gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's also the new Benchmark mode to see how your PC will run it over time, which also gives the developers a good way to keep an eye on what they need to optimize in it. </p>
<p>Some of the other changes include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Patch notes are now shown in the main menu first time when playing a new Thrive version.</li>
<li>Added buttons in main menu and the pause menu to open the link for reporting bugs.</li>
<li>Added new auto-evo exploring tool features (exporting data, running multiple worlds in a row + others).</li>
<li>Evolutionary tree now works for freebuild games started with a fossil.</li>
<li>Added day/night cycle tutorial.</li>
<li>It is now possible to rebind and see controller buttons in the options menu.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's becoming quite an impressive game, while a little difficult to get into at the start they've done a pretty good job on expanding the tutorial to give you a good idea on what to do and how to survive. I don't seem to be dying as early and often as I was a few versions ago.</p>

      <title>OpenRA has another test release improving Dune 2000, Red Alert and major bug fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>OpenRA is closing in on another big new release to improve the experience of playing Command &amp; Conquer, Red Alert and Dune 2000.</p>
<p>As a brief reminder: OpenRA is a very flexible RTS game engine, primarily aimed at getting the likes of Command &amp; Conquer, Red Alert and Dune 2000 easily playable cross-platform with a number of enhancements while keeping the core gameplay intact but it's also used for a few other games now too. They're working towards Tiberian Sun support too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6416788991676897242gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6416788991676897242gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured - Red Alert on Fedora KDE Linux.</em></p>
<p>Available now with Playtest 20230218:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Multiple nuisance crash bugs fixed.</li>
<li>Fixed the map editor not being able to resave .oramap files with subfolders.</li>
<li>Red Alert:
<ul>
<li>Fixed the descriptions of the parabomb and paradrop support powers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dune 2000:
<ul>
<li>Fixed Deviators being able to take over friendly vehicles.</li>
<li>Polished the Encyclopedia.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>+ More.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This is all in addition to the previous <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/openra-for-classic-command-a-conquer-dune-2000-red-alert-has-a-new-playtest/" target="_blank">Playtest from late 2022</a> that had lots of big improvements. See more on the <a href="https://www.openra.net/" target="_blank">OpenRA website</a>.</p>
<p>I'll be the first to admit that when OpenRA finally gets Tiberian Sun support, you might not hear from me for a while. I'm far too excited about that.</p>

      <title>Free 2D space exploration sim Endless Sky v0.10.0 adds new factions, gets better AI</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you love free and open source games keep an eye on the 2D space sim Endless Sky, which just got a new Beta release with version 0.10.0 giving some fresh gameplay improvements. Currently in Beta, so it's not quite a full release yet.</p>
<p>As a reminder on what it is: Endless Sky is a 2D space trading and combat game inspired by the classic Escape Velocity series. Work your way up from a relatively wimpy shuttle, cargo ship, or fighter, to a highly upgraded and customized flagship or to a massive fleet of warships or freighters.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19497636901676896048gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Here's an overview of what's new in v0.10.0 Beta:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Breaking changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The accompany objective on mission npcs no longer implicitly sets the save objective. Plugin missions that had "accompany" but not "save" should be changed to include "save" if the intention of the mission is that the npcs live.
<ul>
<li>This is a change that was made in v0.9.16, reverted in v0.9.16.1, and has been reintroduced.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Content and features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two new alien factions, the Gegno and Bunrodea.</li>
<li>A plethora of new conditions and new ways to use them, including the introduction of "global conditions" that can be set and accessed across save files.</li>
<li>Improvements to how ship AI behaves, more intelligently making use of the range of their weapons. More AI improvements will come in the future.</li>
<li>An overhaul to how cargo and outfit scanners function, causing scanning to take overall longer to complete.</li>
<li>The jobs board can now be sorted on various metrics, including how much the job pays or whether it has a deadline.</li>
<li>Improved mouse control while in flight, including the ability to select secondary weapons by clicking on their ammo icons, and a toggle for controlling flagship aiming and firing with the mouse.</li>
<li>Reverted the heat damage change from v0.9.15, and reduced the buffs provided to afterburners from that same update.</li>
<li>Added a deadline to bounty jobs so that they cannot be stacked infinitely and finished passively. In exchange, bounty ships now don't spawn as far away, and bounty job payments are increased.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Minecraft 1.20 adding Archaeology, Cherry Blossom Biome and a Sniffer mob</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's lots to be excited for in the upcoming Minecraft 1.20 update, with many previously announced features finally landing like Archaeology. Yes, it's finally being added. <em>Want to get Minecraft on Steam Deck? <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/minecraft-on-steam-deck-guide-with-prism-launcher-and-gamepad-support/" target="_blank">Check out my guide</a>!</em></p>
<p>Archaeology was originally announced for the Caves &amp; Cliffs Update which got delayed but hooray it's still going to be a thing. Seems like a natural fit for a sandbox digging game like this too. In their official <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/archeology-coming-minecraft-120" target="_blank">blog post</a> the team at Mojang mentioned it's currently enabled for deserts where you can pick a plot inside a desert temple and get digging but they do plan to add more dig site areas over time. Eventually you'll find some suspicious sand, and then get a brush out to extract whatever is hiding inside.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17017700151676892050gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17017700151676892050gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16871071781676892051gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16871071781676892051gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Another big addition is a new rare Cherry Blossom Biome. Mojang <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/cherry-blossom-biome-coming-minecraft-120" target="_blank">say</a> it will be filled with cherry blossom trees, that can be broken down into a full set of wood and a new hanging sign. You'll even get saplings for them, to spread them wherever you want. Sounds sweet.</p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20399670171676892221gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20399670171676892221gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2501530331676892223gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2501530331676892223gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Finally as another big addition the Sniffer mob is <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/sniffer-coming-minecraft-120" target="_blank">coming</a>, this is what won the mob vote at Minecraft Live 2022. They will require some exploring to find as their eggs may be hidden in suspicious sand and apparently the hatching process is a little more interesting so you will need to keep watch. Once a Snifflet grows up into a Sniffer, it will be rather large and also helpful since it will sniff out special kinds of seeds to give you unique decorative plants.</p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5272648291676892490gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5272648291676892490gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I think I really am due for another Minecraft play-through soon. They've added some really great stuff in the last couple of updates, but I think I'll be waiting for this update to really get the most out of my time with it.</p>
<p>Have you built anything fun in it lately?</p>

      <title>CryoUtilities 2.0 helps boost Steam Deck performance</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>CryoUtilities has a big new 2.0 release out now, with plenty of tweaks to help you get the most out of your Steam Deck. Previously it simply offered some Swap sizing tweaks but now it can do more, and makes it easier than ever to use.</p>
<p>I'm hoping that Valve are at least investigating some of these changes, since they can often boost game performance. In fact, some of these tweaks are absolutely essential to stop certain games just hard-crashing and rebooting the Steam Deck like God of War and Horizon Zero Dawn (amongst others — although not everyone encounters the issue).</p>
<p><em>Screenshots, click to enlarge:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1638522751676890796gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1638522751676890796gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1678745421676890798gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1678745421676890798gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Features now available with the 2.0 release includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>One-click set-to-recommended settings.</li>
<li>One-click revert-to-stock settings.</li>
<li>Swap Tuner.
<ul>
<li>Swap File Resizer.</li>
<li>Swappiness Changer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Memory Parameter Tuning.
<ul>
<li>HugePages Toggle.</li>
<li>Compaction Proactiveness Changer.</li>
<li>HugePage Defragmentation Toggle.</li>
<li>Page Lock Unfairness Changer.</li>
<li>Shared Memory (shmem) Toggle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Storage Manager.
<ul>
<li>Sync shadercache and compatdata to the same location the game is installed.</li>
<li>Delete shadercache and compatdata for whichever games you select.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Full CLI mode.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>See their full video below where they explain the changes and show some benchmark comparisons:</p>

<p>Have you used it? What is your experience with it? I think I'm going to look into testing it out and seeing if it can boost a few problematic games soon.</p>
