      <title>Steam Deck SteamOS 3.5.14 Preview - Persona 3 Reload improvements and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released SteamOS 3.5.14 Preview for Steam Deck, which comes with performance improvements for the new Persona 3 Reload amongst other things.</p>
<p>Since it's currently in Preview if you wish to try it you need to go into the System settings, and change the System Update Channel to Preview in the drop-down box. Here's what's changed (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4064004264594106055" target="_blank">changelog</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improved performance of ray-traced reflections in Persona 3 Reload.</li>
<li>Slightly improved corner tracking on Steam Deck OLED trackpads.</li>
<li>Fixed a possible session crash when connecting an HDR display.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare session crash on application exit.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Don't go expecting some kind of miracle though, ray tracing on Steam Deck is pretty tough.</p>
<p>Additionally a Steam Deck Beta update was also released with these changes (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4064004264594243144" target="_blank">changelog</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed misc. regressions in the screenshot manager.</li>
<li>Fixed transparency and blur on header and app details play bar.</li>
<li>Fixed graph height on downloads page.</li>
<li>Fixed wide game images sometimes failing to load.</li>
<li>Fix custom logo positions sometimes not applying on app details pages.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Horde shooter Black Dragon Mage now has a demo, plus developer blog on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Black Dragon Mage is an upcoming dark fantasy, action-roguelite, top-down horde shooter (think like Vampire Survivors) and there's a demo out now. Plus the developer had some words to say on developing with the Steam Deck in mind.</p>
<p>Fans of any of these bullet-heaven horde games will likely enjoy this one, and from my time spent playing the demo it was a lot of fun unlocking various upgrades and weapons to become god-like with power. A little rough around the edges, with some balancing needed to be done but very promising so far!</p>
<p>Writing about developing the game to ensure it works great on Steam Deck, the developer <a href="https://handheld.quest/posts/why-indie-devs-should-get-a-steam-deck/" target="_blank">wrote up a blog post</a> going over it talking about how the "Steam Deck is a Dev Dream come true", and it was interesting to read from a non-dev perspective too, on how they used the performance tools to help emulate lower-performance systems quickly and easy for testing. They even discovered a Proton <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6861" target="_blank">bug</a> which affected even the likes of Starfield. Worth a read!</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="gEwq9Jhulrk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1e317236a365ee0982f65076b6938e0c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/gEwq9Jhulrk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decimate legions of demonic enemies</strong> with magic projectiles and area damage that only grows more powerful. Decipher the weaknesses of <strong>ancient and mysterious boss enemies</strong>, and bring them to their fall.</li>
<li><strong>Grow your might!</strong> Launch increasingly large volleys of fireballs, or icy orbs that leave frosty mines and freeze foes on contact, blast the undead with your arcane beam staff or harness the dark and chaotic power of the void itself! All primary weapons can be modified through stats, but also offer special upgrade paths called <em>Masteries</em> to unlock their full strategic potential and add to build variety.</li>
<li><strong>Forge your own path</strong> by experimenting with your own combinations of your core arsenal &amp; powerful <strong>ARPG-style defensive and offensive abilities</strong> such as the <em>Shield of Frost</em>, <em>Summoned Flameswords</em>, <em>Spiral Strike</em>, <em>Fiery Pentagram!</em> and more!</li>
<li><strong>Level-up</strong> your attributes, weapons and abilities with every character level during a run, customize and tweak your build until it reaches dizzying heights of power; every run marks a new beginning!</li>
<li><strong>Turn the environment to your favor</strong> using your <em>(often outrageously explosive!)</em> strategic genius, outmaneuver your foes by leading them into deadly traps! Laugh as you watch them hurl across the battlefield... <em>Fools!</em></li>
<li><strong>Endure</strong> the relentless waves, or...</li>
<li><strong>Perish</strong> and return stronger by unlocking <strong>meta-upgrades and fresh weaponry</strong> in the <em>Hall of Relics</em> with the gold you've gathered during your tireless runs! Grab a new hat for your mage! One even lets you turn a portion of fallen enemies into bombs that can chain-explode...</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Right now it's being tested worked well in Proton, but it <em>might</em> have a Native Linux build at launch but the developer said right now it runs better with Proton due to input issues.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2207230/Black_Dragon_Mage/" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>They really did it - Valve added Dwarf as an official Steam tag</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a little mini-campaign from the likes of the crew behind Dwarf Fortress and Deep Rock Galactic, Valve added some new official Steam store tags for games.</p>
<p>Releasing a <a href="https://twitter.com/KitfoxGames/status/1752723419500560601" target="_blank">statement</a> on X (formerly Twitter) the Kitfox Games account (who publish Dwarf Fortress) put up an image post on January 30th noting how Valve initially said no to adding a Dwarf tag. However, Valve would add it officially if people started using it on Steam. In the post Kitfox also mentioned how the likes of elf, centaur, wizard and more aren't tags.</p>
<p>Well, fast-forward to February 1st, and Valve did an initial little <a href="https://twitter.com/KitfoxGames/status/1753167600836816941" target="_blank">joke</a> adding <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/tags/en/Elf/" target="_blank">Elf</a> as a full Steam tag and the official Steam account quickly <a href="https://twitter.com/Steam/status/1753194307815920031" target="_blank">replied</a> to joke "Oh whoops, wrong button!" and then linked to the also new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/tags/en/Dwarf/" target="_blank">Dwarf</a> tag.</p>
<p>So there we have it, now as of February 1st have both Dwarf and Elf as official Steam tags.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4159692521706876531gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4159692521706876531gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You can see a list of tags along with the dates they were officially added on <a href="https://steamdb.info/tags/time/" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From the team that gave us Alwa's Awakening and Alwa's Legacy, Elden Pixels have announced the release date for their latest gorgeous looking adventure platformer with A Void Hope launching February 29th.</p>
<p>"A Void Hope takes you on an atmospheric narrative adventure to find a cure for a collapsed city. Follow the story of a tormented couple as they try to decipher reality from nightmares and evade the shadowy threats lurking in the dark."</p>
<p><span style="background-color:var(--article-main-background); color:var(--font-color); font-size:16px">I really enjoyed their first time games, some tightly designed platforming in wonderful looking worlds. And it seems with each new game they've been upping the production values too and this looks like it could be really interesting to run through. </span><span style="background-color:var(--article-main-background); color:var(--font-color); font-size:16px">There's also a new trailer:</span></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HB6M_C-dz4U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7c7636d29cf209aa1b2239433a79b44e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HB6M_C-dz4U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>At release they said it will be available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2438090/A_Void_Hope/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com" target="_blank">GOG</a>. It will have full Native Linux support and there's a demo available on Steam right now too. The developer also said they've already tested it working great on Steam Deck so they're hoping to see it be Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Will you be checking this one out?</p>

      <title>Linux remains above macOS on the Steam Survey for January 2024</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The monthly Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey is here for January 2024, and while there was a drop for both Linux and macOS we're still seeing Linux be firmly in second place on Steam now. Interestingly, this month we saw both English and Simplified Chinese (the two most popular languages on Steam) fall with Russian seeing the biggest language jump (+0.60%).</p>
<p>Here's the operating systems overall:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 96.52% +0.12%</li>
<li>Linux 1.95% -0.02%</li>
<li>macOS 1.54% -0.09%</li>
</ul>
<p>With our updated graph found on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">our Steam Tracker</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12358756561706871202gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12358756561706871202gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Who honestly thought it would happen so soon? A couple of years ago it was thought to be impossible to see Linux overtake macOS. Of course, then we had the Steam Deck come along - which has a full Linux desktop mode, which has been what's pushing the numbers up.</p>
<p>Here's the most popular Linux distributions on Steam:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 42.12% +1.59%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 7.76% -0.09%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS 64 bit 6.80% -0.24%</li>
<li>Freedesktop SDK 23.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 5.82% +0.60%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 21.2 64 bit 3.63% -1.07%</li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 3.48% -0.16%<img src="https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/public/images/trans.gif"/></li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 2.76% -0.27%</li>
<li>Other 27.64% -0.35%</li>
</ul>
<p>From the survey we can also see that 70.49% of people on Linux use an AMD processor, and 42.18% on Linux use the Steam Deck so the majority have stuck with SteamOS but it seems a few are using a different Linux distribution on their Deck.</p>

      <title>Earthbound &amp; Undertale inspired action-adventure Dreamed Away hits Kickstarter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This isn't the first time I've covered Dreamed Away, as I genuinely think it looks like it will be a really interesting game and not only can you try it out with the demo but you can now support it on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1680398230/dreamed-away" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>. Inspired by some classics the developer played and loved like Chrono Trigger, Earthbound and Zelda: A Link To The Past and newer games like Everhood and Undertale — this is their own take on an emotional action-adventure game.</p>
<p>More about it: "Dreamed Away challenges our perception of reality and immerses players in the gripping tale of two siblings irrevocably separated by circumstances beyond their control. It delves into the realms of love, doubt, and fears, exploring the enigmatic legends of the Celtic lands of Brittany, France."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_EzyW0bYuLw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6de077f79b858f95818b64f202f34041.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_EzyW0bYuLw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer is looking to get 20,000 to finish the game. The game will have Native Linux and Steam Deck support. Looks like a great one to support.</p>
<p>Check out the demo available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1919900/Dreamed_Away/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and see the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1680398230/dreamed-away" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> to support development.</p>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Trying it out brought up an interesting issue. Initially it gave an <em>empty</em> download on my desktop, but it did download just fine on Steam Deck. Checking on SteamDB, it turns out the developer accidentally set the Linux content just for Steam Deck, a special feature Valve added before the Steam Deck launch allowing developers to put up specific Steam Deck content. The developer quickly <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2742790/history/?changeid=22133647" target="_blank">solved it</a> and now the demo installs fine on desktop and Steam Deck. The opposite issue happened with the game Demon Gaze Extra, where the developer <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/valve-says-a-few-games-being-blocked-from-installing-on-steam-deck-was-just-a-technical-issue/" target="_blank">accidentally blocked</a> Steam Deck installs.</p>

      <title>Time to blow the dust off your VR headset - Metro Awakening is coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Metro Awakening has been announced from Vertigo Games, and will be the first full VR entry into Metro. So clearly it's time to blow the dust off your VR headset and clean away the spider webs.</p>
<p>I joke – a little, there hasn't been all that many truly great PC VR releases that I've seen recently. I still feel completely spoiled by how exceptionally good Half-Life: Alyx was to play through. Still probably my top 5 gaming experiences ever.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's a bit more about Metro Awakening: "Metro Awakening is a story-driven first person adventure built exclusively for VR that blends atmospheric exploration, stealth and combat in the most immersive Metro experience yet.</p>
<p>The year is 2028</p>
<p>The survivors of nuclear Armageddon cling to existence in the buried subways of the Moscow Metro – civilization’s last refuge and tomb, where ghosts and spirits haunt the living in this man-made purgatory.</p>
<p>You are Serdar, a doctor braving the darkness, crippling radiation and deadly threats of the Metro in the search for your wife and the medication she so desperately needs. As your courage and sanity are pushed to the limit you must learn to walk the line between life and death, the spirit and the material world, and awaken the being you will become…"</p>
<p>Announcement trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="n-wQbO5H5tM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ab8b25a71646386b6ccded9267623eb7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/n-wQbO5H5tM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lose yourself in a journey of spiritual awakening in this chilling, supernatural origins story from Metro creator Dmitry Glukhovsky</li>
<li>Experience Metro’s tense, heart-pounding gameplay in VR for the first time as condensation clouds your mask, ammo and filters run low and your torchlight flickers and dies in the darkness</li>
<li>Wield a signature arsenal of hand-made weapons, don your gas mask, and venture into the depths of the Metro where desperate bandits, mutants, and worse haunt your every step</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2669410/Metro_Awakening/" target="_blank">it on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>VR on Linux still has a number of issues, but with all the rumours around the new Valve VR headset — I'm still hoping Valve will improve it on Linux. If you use VR on Linux, what are your top issues you want to see solved this year?</p>

      <title>Sonic x Shadow Generations announced with a Sonic Generations remaster</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gotta go fast! Sonic x Shadow Generations was just announced by SEGA that is technically two games, so here's all you need to know for the upcoming PC release.</p>
<p>The first part of the game has you play as Shadow the Hedgehog in a brand-new story campaign featuring a host of new abilities and powers: "When Shadow’s old nemesis, Black Doom, reemerges and threatens to take over the world, Shadow must journey into his own past, confront painful memories, face familiar foes, and unlock new powers to save the world and prove why he’s known as the Ultimate Life Form!"</p>
<p>On top of that Sonic x Shadow Generations also comes with a remaster of Sonic Generations that SEGA say has "newly remastered versions of iconic 2D and 3D stages with upgraded visuals and bonus content".</p>
<p>Announcement trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CDmVayEU76w"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ed5d3a54641f295d0a5c5ceb63048651.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CDmVayEU76w" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>No doubt it will be playable on Desktop Linux with Proton, and hopefully perform well enough on Steam Deck but time will tell. </p>
<p>You can wishlist and follow <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2513280/SONIC_X_SHADOW_GENERATIONS/" target="_blank">Sonic x Shadow Generations on Steam</a>. Releasing in Autumn 2024.</p>
<p>Sonic will always have a special place in my gamer heart, and it's actually one of the reasons I'm so into gaming. A quick little personal history lesson for you: when I was younger I was in hospital for a while, and the nurses / doctors (not sure exactly who) that looked after me arranged for a TV with a Sega Mega Drive and surprised me one day by wheeling it in. Safe to say playing through Sonic in hospital left a lasting impression. I didn't get to keep it though, sadly, but then a parent surprised me by taking me to buy it when I left the hospital. Good times.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Palworld continues being an absolutely ridiculous success for developer Pocketpair, as they've announced it's hit 19 million players in less than two weeks.</p>
<p>Going by their post on X (formerly Twitter) they sold 12 million copies on Steam, and saw 7 million players on Xbox where it's available on Game Pass (people can buy it too). Technically, this means it's actually grown a <em>lot</em> faster than even the latest Pokémon games Scarlet and Violet that took <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2023/230207_4e.pdf" target="_blank">7 weeks</a> to hit 18.2 million units. Not a particularly fair comparison though, I will admit, with Palworld being available across multiple platforms.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5025168701706784163gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5025168701706784163gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Palworld post on X</em></p>
<p>Palworld is rated Steam Deck Playable by Valve as it has issues with small text, needing to bring up the keyboard manually, manual graphics configuration is required and some features may not be accessible via controller. It's rated Platinum on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1623730" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> too, and I can confirm it works really nicely on Desktop Linux with Kubuntu 23.10.</p>
<p>A new patch was also just released today, click in below for the patch notes:</p>
<details class="spoiler_container"><summary class="spoiler_header">Patch notes, click me</summary>
<div class="spoiler-content">
<p>▼Major Fixes<br/>
・Fixed an issue where the game would crash under certain conditions<br/>
・Fixed an issue where if another player's pal/base pal had HP 30% or less, it could be captured by using a sphere.<br/>
・Fixed an issue where enemy pals would get stuck in walls due to charge attacks.</p>
<p>・Implemented the first fix for an issue where the game would always crash and save data would be corrupted when the guild's total number of pals captured reached around 7000.<br/>
*The game no longer crashes even if the total number of captured objects exceeds 7000.<br/>
However, save data that has already been in this state (in the case of a server, the server's world data) prior to this update will still be unable to load.<br/>
We are continuing to work on fixing this issue permanently.</p>
<p>▼Key Configuration<br/>
・Added support for mouse side keys and numeric keypad in keyboard key configuration.<br/>
*Further improvements are currently planned, such as support for interact key configuration.</p>
<p>▼Player Issues<br/>
・Fixed an issue where players on dedicated servers and co-op (online) were receiving damage twice.<br/>
・Specifications have been changed so that you can move at extremely low speed even when you have exceeded the weight limit.<br/>
・Players will no longer pass through walls when dismounting.<br/>
・Fixed an issue where capture power strengthened by Lifmunk Effigies was reset when using memory reset drugs.<br/>
・Fixed an issue where armor could be equipped in the wrong slot.<br/>
・Adjusted camera positions of several Pals to make it easier to see when mounted.</p>
<p>▼Base Issues<br/>
・Specifications have been changed so that Pals who are manually assigned to a breeding farm will not become hungry and their manual assignments will not be removed.<br/>
・The key to lift Pals has been changed from F → V (Pad: X → Y) in order to prevent accidents.<br/>
・Reduced the speed and range of fire spreading on wooden buildings.<br/>
・Fixed an issue where manual work assignments could not be set at all under certain circumstances.<br/>
・Fixed an issue where extremely high-level Relaxaurus would attack the base during raids.<br/>
・Added several measures to prevent base Pals from getting stuck.<br/>
・Fixed an issue where Pals would get stuck while transporting items and would drop them on the spot.<br/>
・Fixed an issue where Pals at the base would continue to cut down trees that were already cut.<br/>
・Fixed an issue where Pals at the base were on the verge of death due to unexplained falling damage.<br/>
・Fixed an issue where Pals at the base would float under some conditions.<br/>
・Fixed an issue where if a farm was built on the second floor or above, work pals would be unable to move on the floors below.</p>
<p>▼Other<br/>
・Corrected incorrect text<br/>
・Measures have been added to prevent cheating and stealing other players' Pals.<br/>
・Many other minor fixes such as the addition of a UI key guide.</p>

      <title>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach has a new trailer but no indication of a PC release yet</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Yes, that's the official title now. Death Stranding 2: On The Beach and a generously long new trailer was released during Sony's January State of Play.</p>
<p>As a huge fan of the first game, with it being one of the most memorable gaming experiences I've had in recent years, I can't wait to play through On The Beach. Sadly, that's going to be a good while away. The PlayStation release isn't until 2025, and after that we will still have quite a while to wait before any possible PC release as they'll of course want to stretch out the PS5 game sales of it before moving on.</p>
<p>Trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6cs-A1rNvEE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c9ff724da45e34aa8df1f30daf789eae.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6cs-A1rNvEE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I'm certain it will come to PC at some point, and thanks to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> we should hopefully have a good time with it on Linux. If not, I'm sure Valve will get some fixes in quickly for such a high-profile release like they've done with numerous previous releases.</p>
<p>For reference from the original Death Stranding console release to it arriving on PC it took about 8 months. Let's hope there's no Epic Store exclusive issues with it so we get an easy Steam release.</p>
<p>Are you as excited as I am for Death Stranding 2: On The Beach?</p>

      <title>Godot Engine 4.3 will have official Wayland support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>2024 is clearly the year of Wayland on the desktop, and now Godot Engine will have official Wayland support with an upcoming new release.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/86180" target="_blank">work</a> spearheaded by contributor Riteo was merged into the main code of Godot Engine ~19 hours ago, so it's set for the Godot 4.3 release that will happen later this year. The latest Godot release is 4.2.1, with 4.3 getting a second development snapshot release back in <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-3-dev-2/" target="_blank">early January</a>.</p>
<p>Godot creator Juan Linietsky <a href="https://twitter.com/reduzio/status/1752458561341235543" target="_blank">posted</a> on X (formerly Twitter):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17391785061706703538gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17391785061706703538gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Quote from the picture: "Finally, I'm happy that Godot 4.3 will officially support Wayland! Incredible work by Riteo! The new DisplayServer in Godot 4.0 allows dynamically selecting the backend too!"</p>
<p>Why is this work important? Current Godot games run on Wayland thanks to XWayland, this removes the need for it since the games could run through Wayland directly and it gives Godot access to more Wayland features for advanced window management, and hopefully removing any quirks from games being run via XWayland.</p>

      <title>Celeste gets a 3D makeover in Celeste 64 for the sixth anniversary</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Celeste is easily one of the most popular indie platformers ever made, and it's still going strong six years later. To celebrate, the developers put up a 3D version with Celeste 64: Fragments of the Mountain. The original has an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam from close to 80,000 user reviews.</p>
<p>This new version of the game was made by the original developers in under 2 weeks, which is meant to be considered more like a Game Jam game as they experimented with 3D.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14138656011706700769gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14138656011706700769gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Seems it was mainly designed for gamepad, so make sure you have one ready for the best experience. Just like the original, it's quite challenging to get through and quite nicely brings over the original into 3D. So it will be fun to see what else they come up with in future.</p>
<p>It's available free on <a href="https://maddymakesgamesinc.itch.io/celeste64" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and they even released the source code on <a href="https://github.com/ExOK/Celeste64" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. It's using a mixture of licenses with the content (like art and audio) under a proprietary license, there's FMOD too but the rest seems is open source.</p>
<p>What do you think to this? Let me know in the comments.</p>
<p>Their next upcoming game is Earthblade, a "2D explor-action game in a seamless pixel art world" that's due out sometime this year.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 8-29 and GE-Proton 8-30 released with EAC fix and TEKKEN 8 fix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As usual for a new release of GE-Proton, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/ge-proton-8-28-released-with-ulwgl-support-for-non-steam-games/" target="_blank">GE-Proton 8-28</a> came with some issues, and so some hotfixes are available bringing it up to GE-Proton version 8-30.</p>
<p>This is why I usually remind people to only use GE-Proton when they actually need it for specific games, because it sees far less testing than the official Proton from Valve. It's good when you need it though but generally best to stick to what's official for less unexpected issues.</p>
<p>For GE-Proton 8-29:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>hotfix: updated proton bleeding edge to include tekken 8 online match disconnect fix</li>
<li>updated vkd3d-proton</li>
<li>fix issue with drive_c symlink during prefix creation when using ulwgl (it's now possible to run scripted game installations using ulwgl and proton-ge)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And then GE-Proton 8-30:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>fixed EAC not getting loaded. During my ULWGL changes I accidentally made it so steam games werent running using steam.exe inside the prefix... which of course broke EAC games. The code snippet involved is needed so that non-steam games don't try to run using steam.exe and thus dont create the Steam_API error. woops. fixed now.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Changelogs from the <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases" target="_blank">GE-Proton GitHub page</a>.</p>

      <title>Age of Empires IV gets a fix for Steam Deck / Linux online play desyncs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Age of Empires IV just got a fresh 2024 patch and excitingly, it gets an official fix for Steam Deck / Desktop Linux multiplayer problems.</p>
<p>This has been a long-standing issue. Single-player was fine, but when trying online play the game would desync at some point. So unless you went through some manual <a href="https://gist.github.com/reneklacan/7825b82723bf0534cbd2eae014e121ca#file-aoe4-mp-fix-sh" target="_blank">fixing</a> (which didn't work for everyone), it just wasn't playable online for Steam Deck / Desktop Linux players with Proton.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.ageofempires.com/news/age-of-empires-iv-patch-9-2-628/" target="_blank">patch notes</a> for the update released January 30th it notes clearly "Fixed an issue causing desyncs on Steam Decks when playing online." amongst fixes and improvements across various other areas of the game. Nice to see more Xbox Game Studios published titles getting improvements for us. What a time to be alive.</p>

      <title>Qualys discovers glibc flaw that could enable attackers to gain full root access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, here's another reminder to keep your PC up to date. Despite Linux being known for security, it's not perfect (no software is) and researchers at Qualys have discovered multiple vulnerabilities in the GNU C Library.</p>
<p>They said the issues were confirmed on Debian (versions 12 and 13), Ubuntu (23.04 and 23.10), and Fedora (37 to 39) but that other distributions are also likely affected by it.</p>
<p>What they said sounds a little alarming noting "four significant vulnerabilities" with the first being noted as CVE-2023-6246, which is the most severe as it allows "local privilege escalation, enabling an unprivileged user to gain full root access". Two more issues were discovered during this noted as:</p>
<ul>
<li>CVE-2023-6779 (glibc): This vulnerability involves an off-by-one heap-based buffer overflow in the __vsyslog_internal() function.</li>
<li>CVE-2023-6780 (glibc): This is an integer overflow issue in the __vsyslog_internal() function.</li>
</ul>
<p>But they said actually triggering those "appears more challenging than CVE-2023-6246" and so "exploiting them effectively is likely to be more complex". Another memory corruption issue was also discovered, but they didn't note a CVE number for it.</p>
<p>More about the most severe of the group CVE-2023-6246:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This vulnerability identified is a heap-based buffer overflow within the __vsyslog_internal() function of the GNU C Library, also known as glibc. This critical function underpins the widely-used syslog() and vsyslog() functions. The buffer overflow issue, traced back to the introduction of glibc version 2.37, poses a significant threat as it could allow local privilege escalation, enabling an unprivileged user to gain full root access through crafted inputs to applications that employ these logging functions. Although the vulnerability requires specific conditions to be exploited (such as an unusually long argv[0] or openlog() ident argument), its impact is significant due to the widespread use of the affected library. Interestingly, a similar issue was reported in December 1997 in an older Linux libc version.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See <a href="https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-threat-research/2024/01/30/qualys-tru-discovers-important-vulnerabilities-in-gnu-c-librarys-syslog" target="_blank">their full article</a> on it for more info. Nice to see a responsible disclosure with the researchers sending all the details to the relevant people.</p>

      <title>What to Expect From Wine on Wayland in 2024</title>
      <author>pleasereadthemanual</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Collabora, the company responsible for developing Wine's Wayland driver and getting it into Wine proper, has just published <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/wine-on-wayland-a-year-in-review-and-a-look-ahead.html" target="_blank">Wine on Wayland: A year in review (and a look ahead)</a>.</p>
<p>So far, they've landed support in Wine for Wayland in these areas:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Basic window management (fullscreen, maximization, resize, etc)</li>
<li>Software rendering (i.e., GDI)</li>
<li>Mouse support, including mouselook</li>
<li>Keyboard support, including keymap handling</li>
<li>Vulkan, including Direct3D through WineD3D/Vulkan or DXVK</li>
<li>Basic support for HiDPI</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2024, Collabora wants to focus on upstreaming support in these areas:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Emulation of display mode changes through compositor scaling</li>
<li>OpenGL support</li>
<li>Improved positioning of transient windows (popups, menus, etc)</li>
<li>Even more window management (e.g., minimization)</li>
<li>Clipboard and drag-and-drop</li>
<li>General robustness improvements, bug fixes, code improvements</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And once those are out of the way, these features would be "great to have eventually":</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Support for system DPI auto-detection and, ideally, per-monitor DPI handling in Wine core</li>
<li>Integration with the upcoming Wayland color-management (and hdr) protocol</li>
<li>Cross-process rendering</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's possible to <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/wine#Wayland" target="_blank">enable the still-experimental driver if your Wine build supports it by editing the Wine registry.</a></p>
<p>Either way, the Wayland driver is a big deal. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/xorg-is-dead-long-live-wayland-red-hat-enterprise-linux-rhel-dropping-xorg/" target="_blank">With RHEL going so far as to deprecate X11</a>, we've seen a lot of developments across the Linux space in supporting Wayland recently.</p>
<p>Have you tried the Wayland driver already? What features does it need before you would consider using it in place of the XWayland version? OpenGL support seems like a big one. Or are you sticking with X11 for the foreseeable future?</p>

      <title>Stardew Valley 1.6 bigger than expected - now in bug-fixing and polishing stage</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The next major update to the wonderfully calm Stardew Valley looks like it's coming soon, as the developer noted it's now moved into the "bug-fixing and polishing phase".</p>
<p>Writing on X (formerly Twitter), Eric "Concerned Ape" Barone <a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1750962107682857258" target="_blank">mentioned</a>: "1.6 ended up being a little larger in scope than originally planned. I'm done adding major new content to it now, though, and it's in a bug-fixing and polishing phase until it's ready for release. Thx for your patience. It'll be fun to see everyone play it!" and in a follow-up reply <a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1750963860444749939" target="_blank">noted</a> it's likely to come to PC first.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20630893911706629992gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20630893911706629992gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Should you make a new save for it? Barone also <a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1750967542607487486" target="_blank">mentioned</a>: "it'll be fine to play on an old save, but I'd probably recommend a new save just to experience everything in context, otherwise you'll unlock a bunch of stuff right away when you load up your old save".</p>
<p>Stardew Valley has Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Are you going to be jumping in again when version 1.6 releases? Incredible it has gone on for so long, and still one of the most popular games on Steam with a peak player count in the last day of 41,904. That's nuts. More than the likes of Red Dead Redemption 2, Terraria and many other well-known games.</p>

      <title>Build a powerful character in Into the Necrovale a new Action RPG</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Into the Necrovale is a new Action RPG from Casey Clyde and Tribal Storm that's just hit Early Access, and so far it seems like a really fun time for players that love building up a unique character. <em>Note: key from KeyMailer.</em></p>
<p>Being the work of a solo developer it's pretty impressive! With 5 different zones to battle through, plus an end-game area that gives you runs of increasing difficulty, I could easily see myself spending a lot of hours running through it.</p>
<p>Here you're exploring the dark dungeons, taking down all sorts of enemies and building up a character. It's all about the items — over 300 of them. Instead of building a character through levels and unlocked abilities, you swap around all your items to make a different build. Giving you the option to experiment easily and change your entire build whenever you want.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="PbkJ_F5ovm0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1bf0da79e1257feb744cfee00483b1db.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/PbkJ_F5ovm0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's all about repeating runs, and unlocking more of the game as you go. As you enter the first section you having nothing but your hands, but eventually you'll have a ton of different items. The game keeps expanding too, as you unlock various different vendors at the safe area.</p>
<p>The combat is pretty challenging too, and fast, it really will keep you on your toes in the small rooms as enemy waves spawn and surround you. Certainly got the blood pumping! The Hope mechanic is an interesting one too. You use Hope to unlock things, but if you lose too much Hope your character will suffer so it's a constant balancing act there.</p>
<p>Into the Necrovale has Native Linux support and seems to work great on my Kubuntu 23.10 desktop. The Steam Overlay didn't work unless I ran it with <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope" target="_blank">Gamescope</a> though which was a little odd. If you like dungeon crawling RPGs, this is one to check out!</p>

      <title>Dwarf Fortress Adventure Mode to be more approachable for new players</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Adventure Mode for Dwarf Fortress is approaching and the team has outlined some of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/3973931474165976101" target="_blank">their plans</a> for it, like making it much more approachable for newer players and giving it a fresh coat of paint.</p>
<p>In the post they mention how difficult it is to do such a mode in a game like this, because it's a sandbox game at its core so it has no direction, it's random and cracks will show. So they're continuing to update it to improve the visuals and interface to make it clearer and better for newcomers - just like they're doing with the Fortress Mode.</p>
<p>They're adding in combat animations, various combat icons, new menus, improvements to how towns are handled for places like shops, cleaning up how property is recognised, tightening up the city side of the experience to give new players some grounding, old adventure menus will also be fully converted for mouse + keyboard and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20514821711706612753gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20514821711706612753gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Dwarf Fortress, Fortress Mode</em></p>
<p>One area that will also change is the difficulty modes. In the original there's three modes Demigod, Hero and Peasant. The confusing thing is the harder the naming sounds, the easier it is, as it's supposed to represent your power. They're going to tweak them so that the "Demigod" mode gives players more instructions and ongoing help - more like a tutorial mode. Plus they will also "tweak the Hero level encounters with gods to something that strikes a balance again, leaning toward a more epic feeling", "expand dungeons and temple relic hunting to facilitate more direction for Demigod characters" and "provide more healing options". The Peasant mode will remain as a sandbox, with Hero mode having a mixture and be an in-between difficulty.</p>
<p>Adventure Mode is currently planned to release in April, with a Fortress Mode update due out soon. When the Adventure Mode update released the Fortress Mode will also get some additional benefits like the addition of portraits, a whole new soundtrack and site map visuals on embarking.</p>

      <title>Game Boy homebrew scene alive and well thanks to the open source GB Studio</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GB Studio is a free and open source cross-platform game engine, that allows you to make fully-features games for the classic Nintendo Game Boy. One of the first gaming devices I ever owned, some really fond memories there of staying up late at night with the completely ridiculous magnifier attachment that had lights on it. How far we've come huh?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah — I know. <em>This isn't Linux gaming. </em>But it's open source and it's awesome! And you can run GB Studio on Linux and there's a new version that was just released too!</p>

      <title>Spec Ops: The Line gets delisted on Steam - you can still buy it elsewhere for now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Spec Ops: The Line from YAGER / 2K has been unexpectedly removed from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/50300/Spec_Ops_The_Line/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, as the store page is now delisted so it won't show up in searches and it can no longer be purchased.</p>
<p>It's not clear <em>why</em> it has been done, and no announcement has been made on it anywhere that I can see officially. So we're left to speculate for now. When this usually happens it's often some rights that expired that they don't wish to relicense or update the game to remove it like music, which Spec Ops: The Line had a fair few big names in so that's quite likely. <strong>Update 31/01/24</strong>: as I suspected, it's some licenses not getting renewed as per the statement sent to <a href="https://kotaku.com/spec-ops-the-line-steam-delisted-removed-2k-licenses-1851209947" target="_blank">Kotaku</a> notes - "Spec Ops: The Line will no longer be available on online storefronts, as several partnership licenses related to the game are expiring".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14554433781706610094gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>While the gameplay wasn't exactly all that special, but what many praised it for was the narrative as the developer tried to make it more meaningful than a lot of other shooters. For many it left a lasting impression so it's a shame if it will eventually be removed from other stores too.</p>
<p>For now at least you can still buy it from:</p>
<p><s><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/spec_ops_the_line" target="_blank">GOG</a> (80% off until February 6th)</s> - now delisted as of 31/01/24, 16:30 UTC</p>
<p><s><a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/spec-ops-the-line?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> (keys will likely run out)</s> - Humble have now removed their offer as of 01/02/24.</p>

      <title>Proton Hotfix gets updated for TEKKEN 8 online play on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>TEKKEN 8 is the latest fighting game from Bandai Namco Studios and it worked pretty great on Steam Deck / Linux at release except for online multiplayer - but that should now be solved.</p>
<p>The problem is that online matches would disconnect — every time. Valve looked into it and now a fresh update is available for Proton Hotfix that Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1752165582332739871" target="_blank">mentioned</a> on X (formerly Twitter):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="A Proton Hotfix is now live for the Tekken 8 online disconnect issues and is selected by default for the game." src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17489180311706609358gol1.png"/></p>
<p><em>Image text: "A Proton Hotfix is now live for the Tekken 8 online disconnect issues and is selected by default for the game."</em></p>
<p>Since it's now set by default, you shouldn't need to do anything but run the game. If you previously forced a compatibility option on it, you should uncheck the box and let Valve switch it over for you. If you don't see it happening automatically you can select Proton Hotfix yourself in the compatibility options.</p>
<p>Where to buy TEKKEN 8:</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer Part 38: The Stagnant Demesne</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-37-dashing-through-the-snow/" target="_blank">Part 37: Dashing Through the Snow</a></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>When I first got the original Linux port of <em>Doom</em> working it was done to satisfy my curiosity, as at that point, I had no intention of playing through the whole game yet again. This being <em>Doom</em> though I soon found myself drawn in, and before long I was back facing the Icon of Sin at the end of <em>Doom II</em>. There were some oddities I encountered. I was unable to complete "E4M6: Against Thee Wickedly" without the no clipping cheat, as the bars blocking the exit failed to rise even after defeating the Cyberdemon.</p>
<p><em>The Ultimate Doom</em> was only supported on Linux through the use of a fan patch, but <em>Doom II</em> proved buggier. While perched on a ledge towards the end of "MAP14: The Inmost Dens" I saved, causing me to clip into the floor on reload. Then there was that one area in "MAP24: The Chasm" that segfaulted every time I entered it. Finally the boss battle on "MAP30: Icon of Sin" broke when I loaded my save file, with no new enemies spawning in allowing me to snipe the demon's brain at my leisure.</p>
<p>Most documentation on this bug suggests the game should instead crash, but I was able to continue playing and win the game. Doubtless none of these problems would have happened had I been using LxDoom, which also has proper binary compatibility with <em>Final Doom</em>, but it was more interesting this way. This also made me inclined to try playing all of <em>Heretic</em> and <em>HeXen</em>, a feat I had never managed up to that point. Would I encounter any more issues with these early source ports?</p>
<p>Andre Werthmann's Linux Heretic proved solid with just a couple of exceptions. Every time I reached one of the boss levels the soundscape descended into a cacophony that could not be tamed even by fiddling with the volume slider in the sound settings. The only solution I found was going outside of the game to lower the system volume from Aumix, and then raising the volume slider inside <em>Heretic</em> to compensate as best I could. This did not break the game, but it did make things unpleasant.</p>
<p>The other snag I encountered was with moving platforms that loop the "stnmov" sound effect, as they could also cause all of the other sound effects in the vicinity to break. This only came up a few times during the course of the campaign, but it created a great deal of chaos with the crushers in the starting room of "E4M3: Ambulatory". I notice that the Linux <em>Doom</em> source code has a function that forces the "stnmov" sound among others to play one at a time, but Linux Heretic lacks this.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4763627131706556764gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4763627131706556764gol6.png"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6185772191706556766gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6185772191706556766gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>Beyond that I just have a few gripes with a couple of the changes that Werthmann made, the most irksome being the decision to remap the keys used to scroll through the inventory to "K" and "L" as opposed to the square brackets that are still listed on the help screen. Thankfully this can be reversed by uncommenting the "-DORIG_INVKEYS" flag in the Makefile while building your own Linux Heretic binaries. I also disabled the text blurb on launch by removing it from the d_main.c file.</p>
<p>My abiding observation of <em>Heretic</em> is that it is the rare shareware game where the second and third episodes are in fact greater than the first. It was from here that I was having enough fun to bother looking for all of the marked secrets, which was the right move; getting familiar with how Raven Software likes to hide secret areas and how to read the automap becomes a necessary skill for solving the puzzle hubs in <em>HeXen</em>, but the automap colour scheme does leave something to be desired.</p>
<p>This goodwill sadly does not carry through to the final two retail expansion episodes, which descend into tedium far too quickly. "E4M1: Catafalque" gives "E4M1: Hell Beneath" from Thy Flesh Consumed a run for its money in terms of punishing the player, giving as unwelcoming an introduction as you could ever hope to find. Beyond that the expansion just becomes a slog, having nothing new other than the sheer vastness of the hordes of monsters on offer to bring to the table.</p>
<p>The drawn out Maulotaur fights can at least be subverted by using the Tome of Power and the Gauntlets of the Necromancer to leech off the Maulotaur's health, cushioning his blows to the point you just have to hold down the fire key and wait. You will also develop a special hatred of the Ophidians by the end of the campaign, a role the Slaughtaurs in <em>HeXen</em> are more than happy to fill come the sequel; the Disciples of D'Sparil though are far more aggravating than the Bishops in <em>HeXen</em> could ever aspire.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was just due to my lack of prior exposure, but the <em>Heretic</em> soundtrack also seemed to carry over to "VoxWare Synth" even better than the <em>Doom</em> music did, although this may just be due to the work of composer Kevin Schilder being more blaring and bombastic than what Bobby Prince came up with. Kevin Schilder would return to craft the MIDI soundtrack for <em>HeXen</em>, and thanks to an unassuming tarball on an archived website, I will get to actually experience that under Linux.</p>
<p><strong>Carrying on in Part 39: Beyond Heretic</strong></p>

      <title>Eidos-Montréal cut nearly 100 staff with new Deus Ex reportedly cancelled</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hopes for a new Deus Ex have been dashed, with the Embracer Group owned Eidos-Montréal confirming that they've cut 97 people go as the mass-layoffs continue. This is just another in a long list of developers and publishers cutting staff and cancelling projects, all while the Embracer Group try to reduce their costs. It's also another in a long list of just industry-wide layoffs lately.</p>
<p>Confirming the staff news <a href="https://twitter.com/EidosMontreal/status/1752027685293801632" target="_blank">on X</a> in an image post below:</p>

<p>We are working to support all impacted personnel through this transition. These very talented, highly experienced people are entering the employment market, and we want them to find their next projects and are helping to do so.</p>

      <title>First world war turn-based strategy RPG &#39;All Quiet in the Trenches&#39; hits Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's something a little different for you: All Quiet in the Trenches recently hit Early Access on Steam, blending together a narrative turn-based strategy RPG with a first world war setting. It has Native Linux support but no Steam Deck rating just yet.</p>
<p>More about it: "In the game, you're playing as a German Unteroffizier - a sergeant - on the Western Front of World War One. You're responsible for a handful of soldiers and have to make meaningful decisions. You lead them in battle trying to strike a precarious balance between the ambitions of your superiors and the survival of your men. Your actions will not change the war. They will however change the lives of your soldiers. You cannot win, but maybe they can survive."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mF16Xw-9K3w"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5995696edd96bc3866d9519a15e95a8e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mF16Xw-9K3w" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer, Totally Not Aliens, are based in Bamberg, Germany and say it's meant to be taken as an anti-war game. They plan to keep it in Early Access for 1-2 years as they expand it to cover up to the end of the war in November 1918 with it currently having from early 1915 to early 1916.</p>

      <title>Never Grave from the Palworld developer looks a lot like Hollow Knight</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pocketpair formed another studio called Frontside 180 that are working on Never Grave: The Witch and The Curse, which looks a whole lot like Hollow Knight. This might ease the wait for Silksong huh?</p>
<p>While it may look a lot like Hollow Knight for the style it's actually quite a different game overall. Plenty of elements of it feel like Dead Cells, but there's a hint of Skul: The Hero Slayer with a possession mechanic too and there's even a whole village-building element to it. There's also going to be online co-op support for up to 4 players. Overall it does actually look quite good:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rE6bcrTWOVo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c26f23b9b997193a9fc19ea53e53f26e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rE6bcrTWOVo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Metroidvania x Roguelite with an emphasis on exploration.</li>
<li>Sophisticated and tactilely designed player character controls.</li>
<li>Possession system where hats can possess enemies and use their unique abilities.</li>
<li>Traditional Japanese hand-drawn limited animation is used for character 2D animation.</li>
<li>Thickly painted backgrounds with depth, as if you are travelling through a world of picture books and cut-out pictures.</li>
<li>Learn actions such as double-jump from artefacts to explore new areas.</li>
<li>Constantly changing play style depending on the synergy of "traits" associated with magic and items.</li>
<li>Intense battles with tough bosses. It will take more than just memorizing boss patterns to defeat them without taking damage...</li>
<li>Rebuild your village. Strengthen yourself through building and production to prepare for the next adventure.</li>
<li>Explore different terrain each time you play through procedurally generated dungeons.</li>
<li>Multiplayer support. Up to four players can delve into the dungeon together!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Due to enter Early Access sometime in Q1 2024. This will make Pocketpair's 4th game to be in Early Access following Craftopia, AI: Art Impostor and Palworld that are all currently in development.</p>
<p>There's a demo available now which in my testing seemed to work quite well on Desktop Linux with Proton 8.0-5.</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2395770/Never_Grave_The_Witch_and_The_Curse/" target="_blank">out on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>KONAMI update the METAL GEAR SOLID Steam collection with Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As KONAMI continue to improve the recent releases of METAL GEAR SOLID - Master Collection Version, METAL GEAR SOLID 2: Sons of Liberty - Master Collection Version and METAL GEAR SOLID 3: Snake Eater - Master Collection Version they've now added Steam Deck support.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6001752471706529403gol1.jpg"/><br/>

<p>Currently, only 2 and 3 have been updated to note it, but the 1st may not be far behind.</p>
<p>METAL GEAR SOLID 2: Sons of Liberty - Master Collection Version and METAL GEAR SOLID 3: Snake Eater - Master Collection Version have updates that note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ver.1.4.1/Ver.1.4.1D releases Jan. 29th, 2024.<br/>
The version for users playing on Steam Deck™ will be noted as Ver.1.4.1D in the game.</p>
<p>Ver.1.4.1/Ver.1.4.1D Patch Notes<br/>
Please check the list of changes below for details on the main improvements and fixes in this patch.<br/>
Fixes of previously known issues are marked with an asterisk.</p>
<p>- Added Steam Deck™ support</p>
<p>-  Fixed an issue where inputs via the keyboard were registered for the game even when the Alt key was held down*</p>
<p>- Fixed some other minor issues</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not clear <em>exactly</em> what they've done for Steam Deck support, as annoyingly they don't say. Although we can see on SteamDB (<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2131650/depots/" target="_blank">example</a>) that they now have dedicated content depots for the Steam Deck so they've likely tweaked some in-game resources to work better. Valve has also put them back through verification and they're now showing up as Deck Verified.</p>

<li>controller axis patch added from 8-27 has been removed as it is now properly upstreamed</li>
<li>added ULWGL support for non-steam games (<a href="https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/ULWGL" target="_blank">https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/ULWGL</a>)</li>

      <title>The original SteamOS-like Linux distro HoloISO now dead, replaced with immutable version</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a while of no updates to the actual ISO download of HoloISO, the creator of this SteamOS-like Linux distribution has announced the original is now dead. As it's being replaced by the newer immutable HoloISO.</p>
<p>The developer put up a <a href="https://github.com/HoloISO/holoiso/releases/tag/6-psa" target="_blank">PSA</a> (public service announcement) on the original HoloISO GitHub page, and archived it so it will no longer see any updates at all and you cannot get support for it. They said the new immutable HoloISO is now "ready to be used as a daily-driving distribution".</p>
<p>What is an immutable operating system? Think like SteamOS and Fedora Silverblue. The idea is to give a read-only filesystem that gets replaced on updates. It's supposed to keep things more secure and stable, plus easier updates since it just replaces the main system.</p>
<p>HoloISO itself is designed to give you a close-enough version of SteamOS to use on other systems, and so the new immutable HoloISO should <em>hopefully</em> be more reliable. <em>It's what AYANEO were going to put on the AYANEO NEXT LITE but <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/ayaneo-next-lite-no-longer-ships-with-steamos-like-holoiso-linux-windows-11-instead/" target="_blank">they've since backtracked</a>.</em></p>
<p>There's no current way to upgrade an existing HoloISO system to the new way it's run, but the developer mentioned they're currently figuring out the best approach to it. <strong>Update</strong>: 30/01/24 - version 1.1 now release supports migrating.</p>
<p>New releases will be on <a href="https://github.com/holoiso-staging/releases" target="_blank">this GitHub</a> with issues reporting on a <a href="https://github.com/holoiso-staging/issuetracker" target="_blank">separate GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>SteamOS-like ChimeraOS 45 released with HDR &amp; controller support for many more handhelds</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ChimeraOS is a top choice for people who want a SteamOS-like Linux distribution to run on gaming handhelds, or a couch gaming PC. The latest release is out now with ChimeraOS 45 bringing big changes.</p>
<p>The developer mentioned it took extra long since the Steam Deck OLED had released and that "many changes in gamescope and Steam that caused unexpected behavior in a lot of devices". So they needed time to go through all the issues.</p>
<p>This release comes with Linux kernel 6.6.10, Mesa 23.3.3 and has Open Gamepad UI v0.28.0-3. Some of the other big inclusions in this release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Implemented HDR for supported games.</li>
<li>Kernel carries patches made by our awesome community, thanks everyone!</li>
<li>Redesigned the gamescope-session package to simplify implementing quirks and bug fixes across all sessions. All sessions now use a common session script and device-quirks file. The session names have changed as well, so when downgrading from v45 to v44-1 and below, a chimera-session command is required. Upgrading should have no issues. <code class="inline-code">gamepadui</code> is now <code class="inline-code">steam</code>, <code class="inline-code">gamepadui-with-qam</code> is now <code class="inline-code">steam-plus</code>. The log for each session is now <code class="inline-code">~/.<session-name>-stdout.log</session-name></code>.</li>
<li>Included distrobox for awesome new possibilities.</li>
<li>Removed Feral <code class="inline-code">gamemode</code> daemon.</li>
<li>Added cpupower CLI tool for managing cpu power profiles.</li>
<li>Added controller support for AYANEO Kun, AYANEO Slide, Lenovo Legion Go, OXP OneXFly, OXP 2, OXP2 Pro, AYN Loki MiniPro, and GPD Win Mini.</li>
<li>Added optional event configuration for HandyGCCS that supports putting the controller into "Nintendo" mode. Users will need to manually edit their handygccs.conf to enable this.</li>
<li>Added EDID override for the AIR plus that enables more refresh rates. Enable firmware overrides to use this.</li>
<li>Added equalizer settings for Lenovo Legion Go and ROG Ally that drastically improves the sound stage. For both devices, a new "device" will be present in the audio menu. Ensure the default audio device is at maximum volume before switching for the best performance.</li>
<li>Enabled the hid-steam driver. Steam Deck and Steam Controller users can now use their controllers on the desktop in "Lizard Mode", emulating a keyboard and mouse automatically.</li>
<li>Enabled Vulkan support for some older intel iGPU's. YMMV.</li>
<li>Added PowerStation Daemon to manage power settings and switched OpenGamepadUI to using it as a backend. Changing settings and loading power profiles in OpenGamepadUI should now be much faster and more reliable.</li>
<li>Improved support in OpenGamepadUI for PlayStation controllers. This change may cause duplicate input devices in some situations. If this occurs, manually update to v0.29.2 or above using the settings menu in OpenGamepadUI.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

Steam Big Picture Mode</em></p>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added support for ROG Ally BIOS 330+. The ROG Ally no longer needs firmware overrides for audio to work on any BIOS version.</li>
<li>Removed xpadneo and xone drivers and replaced them with xpad and created xonedo (xone dongle only) for managing xinput devices. This should resolve many of the input related bugs users were experiencing.</li>
<li>Fixed night mode.</li>
<li>Fixed game artwork overrides not being applied in some cases.</li>
<li>Fixed error in the Chimera web app when Epic Games credentials expire.</li>
<li>Fixed multiple crash conditions in HandyGCCS.</li>
<li>Various fixes for devices that don't detect as "card0" have been made.</li>
<li>Fixed some scripting errors in controller-wake. This is still disabled by default. If you have this enabled and are experiencing issues with sleep, try disabling it.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with some network cards.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Relaxing settlement builder with simulated citizens Folklands now has a demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love your city / village building sims? You should take a little look at Folklands, a relaxing settlement builder with simulated citizens that you need to take care of.</p>
<p>The developer, Bromantic Games, recently put up a new demo to get ready for Steam Next Fest. Their previous demo had a lot of placeholders with this new demo having a graphical update, plus tons of other improvements and content additions. Part of what has my interest is that you'll not only be able to play solo, but you'll also be able to play online with or against others. Nice to see more village builders have that in.</p>
<p>A recent trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DlpVomPJStc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4a55645af4f9467098d7fae54ac9b734.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DlpVomPJStc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Collect &amp; Refine Resources - Settle down in uncharted lands, and harvest its resources. Refine raw materials into processed goods to build and expand your settlement. Create production chains that enhance or combine materials to create even more advanced products as the needs of your settlement grows.</li>
<li>Trading &amp; Dimplomacy -  Establish trade routes with the nearby kingdoms to stock up on resources you don't have, or become a trade hub supplying goods and resources. Trade with one of the 3 kingdoms in singleplayer or with other players in multiplayer.</li>
<li>Overcome Adversity - Face different challenges as your settlement grows. Manage the production and distribution of necessary resources to combat and prevent the dangers of fire, sickness and crime.</li>
<li>Never the same twice - A procedurally generated world tuned to your liking, guarantees that you will never play the same game twice. Adapt to the surrounding terrain and the availability or scarcity of resources to ensure a growing and happy settlement!</li>
<li>Build a peaceful thriving settlement or enable the optional disasters or conflict mode for additional challenges.</li>
<li>Planned Steam workshop support will let you create or install new content or modify the game rules to your liking.</li>
<li>Please your citizens to attract different types of people and trade with the neighboring kingdoms.</li>
<li>Play with or against your friends or enjoy a relaxing settlement building experience alone.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2282890/Folklands/" target="_blank">out on Steam with a demo now live</a>. It has Native Linux support.</p>

<p>From developer Mr. Podunkian, who previously worked on Stardew Valley, a new life-sim is coming named Sunkissed City and it looks rather colourful and inviting. It's been teased for a while and only recently actually getting an official name, along with a Q4 2024 release date.</p>
<p>The inspiration from working on Stardew Valley is clear but hopefully it will be different enough to find an audience. The developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2175840/discussions/0/4138312860563712326/#c4138312860565004796" target="_blank">mentioned</a> on Steam they worked on SV from the 1.4 update onwards. There's no trailer yet for Sunkissed City but a few screenshots make it look rather nice.</p>
<p>"Welcome to your new life in Apollo City, a sun-kissed seaside metropolis that's pumping with funky vibes and quirky characters.</p>
<p>As a fresh hire for the monolithic Pico corporation's new "Peco Pioneer" pilot program, you've been tasked with fostering a relationship with Apollo's vibrant community and putting in a good word for Pico's new eco-focused initiatives.</p>
<p>But all is not well in these bustling streets. The local wildlife has begun to behave more aggressively, the waters are devoid of life, monsters are pouring out from the sewers, and that's not to mention the constant migraines everyone's been having lately." — Steam Blurb</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Enjoy a fresh start in Apollo City! - The city is a big place packed with a myriad of opportunities to occupy the days and nights of your new city life! Tend to DIY gardens set up by a local band of "plant-punks", spend a quiet afternoon in the park soaking up a good book, or schmooze it up with the locals over coffee at the Weird Dog Cafe. Snap photos of the wildlife around the city and its surrounds. Try your hand at fishing up "the big one" at Marin Shores. Forage for delicious edibles on a hike at Pinnacle Peak. Or perhaps a daring dive into the city's monster infested sewers is more your speed? You could always take up a gig sorting out shipments at the Pico warehouse for some extra cash.</li>
<li>Reinvent yourself! - With endless, deep customization options, you can be whoever you want to be. Pop into Threads to scope out the next piece of your new favorite fit, or get a complete makeover at Salon Flamingo. Make your clothing items your own with hundreds of different colors, patterns and material combinations. Give your living spaces your personal touch with a variety of fun, functional furniture pieces, or liven up your walls and floors with dozens of wallpaper and flooring types.</li>
<li>Socialize with the cityfolk! - Apollo City is home to a host of kooky characters to get to know (and love!). Build up your relationships with the locals and they'll open up to you with their daily successes and hardships. Brighten their day by gifting them hand-crafted presents (or maybe even some things you found in the trash...), and help them navigate their sometimes-messy lives in Apollo. You never know when they'll repay the favor. And if you're on the market to find that special someone, perhaps you'll find others in the city looking for the same!</li>
<li>Take back Apollo! - Work with the Keby, mysterious, prank-loving forest creatures, to tackle the various maladies afflicting the city and take back Apollo from the forces draining it of its color!</li>
<li>Explore the city with friends! - Sunkissed City features both online and split-screen multiplayer cooperative modes for you to enjoy your new city life alongside friends and family. Customize your experience with per-player difficulty and accessibility options to tailor the experience to groups of any gaming ability!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Flathub now has over one million active users</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ah, Linux, you gotta love it right? There's numerous different ways to do the same thing. One of those that people like to argue about is packaging and how to install things on Linux. <a href="https://flathub.org" target="_blank">Flathub</a> with Flatpaks at least seem to be popular and it keeps growing. </p>
<p>Cassidy James Blaede just wrote up an official <a href="https://docs.flathub.org/blog/over-one-million-active-users-and-growing/" target="_blank">blog post</a> going over some numbers, and it's quite impressive to see. To date it shows that Flathub has served just about 1.6 billion downloads, has over 2,400 apps (850 of which are Verified by the author) and there's now over 1 million active users too. Their <a href="https://flathub.org/statistics" target="_blank">public dashboard</a> has some pretty fun stats.</p>
<p>One of the big reasons for the growth no doubt is the Steam Deck, which has a full KDE Plasma desktop mode in SteamOS, and has Flathub for all the extra apps and games you can install. A point that was touched on in the blog post noting that some of the most popular downloads on Flathub are emulators and game launchers.</p>
<p>It's not just Steam Deck though with Flathub being included out of the box across the likes of Clear Linux, Endless OS, KDE Neon, Linux Mint, Pop!_OS, and Zorin OS and Fedora 38.</p>
<p>I think Flathub is great personally, it's often made it far easier to tell people where to grab something that's actually up to date. Telling people "it's on Flathub, install via GNOME Software or KDE Discover" makes Linux a lot easier.</p>

      <title>THE FINALS freezing on Linux? Here&#39;s ways you can fix it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>THE FINALS has been working on Linux and Steam Deck for a couple of weeks now, and personally I've been having a fantastic time with it. It can crash a fair bit though but luckily here's some possible solutions I've tested working.</p>
<p>No matter the Proton version used, it seems on some Linux systems it will just completely freeze up. There's no specific point it will do it. Sometimes in the menu, sometimes in the middle of a game (annoying when you're doing well).</p>
<p><strong>Issue 1</strong></p>
<p>One way to stop it crashing is to increase your vm.max_map_count setting. For some distributions, it can be quite low by default. For example on Kubuntu 23.10 (upgraded from 23.04) mine was set by default to only <em>65530</em>. You can check your current setting with this terminal command:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">cat /proc/sys/vm/max_map_count</code></p>
<p>It's easy to test a new setting <em>without</em> doing a permanent system change simply by running this command in a terminal:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=2147483642</code></p>
<p><em>That number is just a very high suggestion <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/7317#issuecomment-1896238857" target="_blank">mentioned</a> on GitHub. It's what the Steam Deck has it set at. People playing Star Citizen, as an example, have been setting it to 16777216.</em></p>
<p>After that, you should hopefully no longer see it crashing. You'll need to do that on each reboot.</p>
<p>For a permanent change you can edit the "/etc/sysctl.conf" file, add "vm.max_map_count=2147483642" to the bottom and then run:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">sudo sysctl -p</code></p>
<p>Which should keep the change.</p>
<p><strong>Issue 2</strong></p>
<p>Another problem is that if your CPU supports AVX-512, it may crash for you too. A workaround there is to add "clearcpuid=304" to your kernel boot arguments. This will stop AVX-512 being used.</p>
<p>For systems that use Grub boot loader (Ubuntu / Arch and others): you'll need to edit Grub (usually found as "/etc/default/grub") with your favourite text editor for this. Find the "GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT" line and add clearcpuid=304 into it. Then to ensure it's updated:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg</code></p>
<p><em>Fedora seems to use "grub2-mkconfig".</em></p>
<p>And reboot, and it should then work.</p>
<p><strong>Proton Version</strong></p>
<p>You may also find Proton Hotfix works better, as <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/7317#issuecomment-1897318332" target="_blank">mentioned</a> on GitHub recently it has a fix for voice-chat crashing. To do so go into the Properties -&gt; Compatibility menu for the game in your Steam Library. <em>This is the only change that should needed on Steam Deck.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p>Hopefully that gives you somewhere to start seeing less freezing and crashing issues in THE FINALS on Linux.</p>
<p>I've also been <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">livestreaming it on Twitch</a> with the Movemaster, so give me a follow.</p>

<p>They've confirmed it will have NVIDIA DLSS 3, AMD FSR and Intel XeSS. It will also support "21:9 ultra-wide, 32:9 super ultra-wide and even 48:9 resolutions with compatibility for triple-monitor setups", along with fully customizable controls from keyboard and mouse to controllers.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="XbofnUWolHE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ad19a98194031ad28467f8a21f12d3e2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/XbofnUWolHE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

And that Sony PlayStation titles now release on PC often like this too. Good time to be a gamer for sure.</p>
<p>That said, for Steam Deck players, the first game was really tough on the Steam Deck, I will be very interested to see if this can get anywhere close to at least 30FPS. Desktop Linux players of course have a lot more options.</p>

      <title>Beginner-friendly factory sim shapez 2 now has a demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>shapez 2 is a huge expansion over the original 2D shape-cutting factory sim, now in full 3D with a lot more features and there's now a demo available to try it out.</p>
<p>A top-down factory-building game where you extract and process geometric shapes. Each shape is its own set of building-blocks that your factories can take apart, stack, paint and put back together in unique ways. Build and automate to produce distinct shapes and solve the production challenge of each goal. I must admit, it looks pretty great - love what they've done with the idea. Check out the recent trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0VO_52LJ268"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/95d1a2afb300507942c52c325258bf32.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0VO_52LJ268" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Unlike some other similar factory building games, there's no form of enemies. Just pure factory building and automation here. Designed to be beginner-friendly there's no time-limits and resources are unlimited so the limit is very much your imagination to design and redesign as much as you want.</p>
<p>Some of the features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi-Layer 3D Factories</strong>: Design and optimize your factories in a whole new dimension.</li>
<li><strong>Trains</strong>: Connect distant stations with a network of space trains.</li>
<li><strong>Research System</strong>: Unlock buildings, mechanics &amp; upgrades in the all-new tech tree.</li>
<li><strong>New Shape Mechanics</strong>: Discover new shapes types with unique properties and logic.</li>
<li><strong>Blueprint Library</strong>: Save, load, export and share factory design blueprints with anyone.</li>
<li><strong>All-new Visuals</strong>: Build factories and stations in a stunning immersive space environment.</li>
<li><strong>Fluids</strong>: Use different types of liquids to process shapes or boost production.</li>
<li><strong>Animated Open Buildings</strong>: See exactly what's happening inside buildings in your factory.</li>
<li><strong>Undo/Redo</strong>: Up to 50 undo/redo operations.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The Early Access release is planned for later this year.</p>

      <title>Enshrouded is the latest open-world hit on Steam - how it runs on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Enshrouded is another big Early Access open-world game to arrive on Steam, and it's already doing some big numbers. So how does it run on Steam Deck / Linux? Here's an initial starting report for you.</p>
<p>On both Steam Deck and Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 23.10) it works out of the box with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/proton-80-5-brings-more-hdr-gaming-to-linux-steam-deck-plus-lots-of-fixes/" target="_blank">Proton 8.0-5</a>, and all parts of the game I can tell so far work as expected. So the good news out of the way — yes it does run. This is great, because it's another popular game with currently close to 70,000 people playing it.</p>
<p>For Steam Deck (tested on the Steam Deck OLED), it runs and gamepad input works just fine and the character name input even brings up an on-screen keyboard. The developer also seems to have given it tweaked graphics settings, so it appears some testing was done prior to release. That's where the good news stops. The performance is just — poor. Even on the <em>lowest</em> possible settings, you're not going to get anywhere near a smooth 30FPS even at the basic start of the game with nothing going on. Add some buildings, more action and more players in co-op and it gets worse.</p>
<p>Here's my Steam Deck initial report video:</p>

<p><em>For now, on Steam Deck, I simply won't recommend it at all.</em></p>
<p>As for Desktop Linux testing with an AMD Ryzen 5800X and an AMD Radeon 6800XT, testing on the "Balanced" graphics setting at 2560x1440 its performance seems to be reasonably okay. Ranging between 80FPS to 100FPS depending on what you're doing. Very much playable you would think.</p>
<p>Something still feels <em>off</em> with it though. Even though that should be enough to make it feel smooth, it doesn't feel like it's actually anywhere near that when running around. It's performance is just odd, which I've seen repeated by players on Windows too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12301958881706195062gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12301958881706195062gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11802062471706195063gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11802062471706195063gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's Early Access, so of course that means it's unfinished and will have plenty more time in the oven to fix up issues and add in new content. The developer plans for at least one year in Early Access, so hopefully plenty of performance improvements will come during that time.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203620/Enshrouded/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Roblox now helping fund Blender development</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.blender.org" target="_blank">Blender</a> continues to be a true massive success story for open source, pulling in funding from all sorts of big names and now even Roblox is helping to fund it.</p>
<p>As posted on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7156053005350428672/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> by Stefano Corazza, Head of Roblox Studio, who mentioned "So proud to announce that Roblox joined the Blender Foundation’s Development Fund as a corporate Silver member! Blender is one of the most commonly used tools by the Roblox creator community, and I personally love it. To make the use of Blender and Roblox Studio even more seamless we have released an open source plugin as well."</p>
<p>They also shared a press announcement with <a href="https://www.blendernation.com/2024/01/24/roblox-joins-blender-development-fund/" target="_blank">BlenderNation</a> where Corazza additionally said: "Blender is the most popular external tool used by Roblox’s creator community today. Every day, thousands of creators import vivid and detailed 3D content from tools like Blender into their Roblox experiences.</p>
<p>We are thrilled to be supporting the Blender Foundation’s work delivering world-class 3D tooling and are excited to see closer integration continue to drive high-quality creation on Roblox. Roblox also presents a fantastic opportunity for the Blender Community to find new opportunities for their creativity by creating and selling 3D avatar items for rich immersive 3D experiences."</p>
<p>As a Corporate Silver Member, Roblox will be paying at least €12K a year to Blender to support further development. Joining the ranks of Activision, Google, Adobe, Epic MegaGrants, AMD, AWS, Meta and plenty more also supporting Blender.</p>
<p>The open source plugin info is on the <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/reference-roblox-integration-for-blender/2546753" target="_blank">Roblox Dev forum</a>.</p>

      <title>Earl vs. the Mutants is basically Vampire Survivors with vehicles and it&#39;s hilarious</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you love quick-fire action and the randomised upgrade mechanics made popular by Vampire Survivors, you might want to try out the demo for Earl vs. the Mutants. Tested on Linux with Proton 8, it works great.</p>
<p>While a lot of games inspired by VS don't actually do a lot different — this clearly does. You get to drive and boost yourself around big open maps, mow-down hordes of mutants and gun them down with vehicle-mounted weapons. This is probably going to be quite popular.</p>
<p>"Create unique and powerful builds by combining vehicle-mounted weapons, attack and support drones, level-up based upgrades, and game-changing temporary powerups! If you can survive long enough, go head-to-head against bosses to earn their vehicles."</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>QUICK RUNS:</strong> Enjoy casual gameplay with runs averaging 10 minutes.</li>
<li><strong>DYNAMIC BUILDS:</strong> Each attempt is different, powered by an expanding list of in-run upgrades.</li>
<li><strong>PROGRESSION:</strong> Make progress across runs via unlocked vehicles and stat-based permanent upgrades.</li>
<li><strong>VEHICLE COMBAT:</strong> Move FAST and crash into mutants head on! Colliding with enemies is half the fun, not something to be avoided.</li>
<li><strong>3D ENVIRONMENTS:</strong> Navigate the 3D terrains strategically, using the elevation to jump over enemies and hide behind mountains.</li>
<li><strong>BOSS BATTLES:</strong> Survive an onslaught of mutant waves, then face off against their formidable bosses.</li>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AdventureQuest 8-Bit: Dungeons &amp; DoomKnights is a really properly retro adventure, funded on Kickstarter for the NES back in 2019 it now has a fancy PC release too. The <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/artix/dungeons-and-doomknights-an-8-bit-adventurequest-f/description" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> was pretty popular with $54,715 pledged, clearly people love their retro games. Although it helps that this particular game is also available as an actual NES Cartridge.</p>
<p>The PC release just arrived along with Linux support on Steam: "The young hero Artix, returning from passing the trials to become a Paladin, finds his home destroyed by an army of the undead... its people gone. He swears to save them and destroy the DoomKnight responsible. Will you help Artix defeat the evil undead, or become their new master?</p>
<p>AdventureQuest 8-Bit: Dungeons &amp; DoomKnights is more than just a rom in a shiny wrapper! It's packed with other games and goodies to make it the ultimate version of the game! 3 Games, 3 Chaos mods, several color palettes, a CRT filter, and a dragon in a pear tree!

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released another Steam Beta for both the Steam Deck and for Desktop Steam, containing various fixes and a nice improvement for Linux Remote Play users. The updates were released January 24th, for anyone who opted into the Steam Beta Client.</p>
<p>First up here's the Steam Deck <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3968301974628440766" target="_blank">changes</a>:</p>

<p>Do you stick with the Stable Steam Client or like me do you live on the wild side and basically always stick with the Steam Beta? It's good to see Valve be so dedicated to constantly improving the Steam platform as a whole, they're always tweaking something to try and make it better for players.</p>

      <title>AYANEO NEXT LITE no longer ships with SteamOS-like HoloISO Linux - Windows 11 instead</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We were so close to seeing another gaming handheld ship with Linux out of the box that isn't the Steam Deck, but it seems AYANEO with the AYANEO NEXT LITE weren't convinced enough and so they've changed their minds.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/ayaneo-next-lite-handheld-announced-with-steamos-linux/" target="_blank">Originally announced</a> as shipping with SteamOS, but then clarified later it would be HoloISO, which is a Linux distribution that's pretty close to SteamOS. AYANEO aren't <em>entirely</em> dropping it though, as they will still be offering HoloISO Linux (it's like SteamOS), but the device will now instead ship with Windows 11.</p>
<p>Writing on X (Twitter) they put out a <a href="https://twitter.com/AYANEO__/status/1750393456789430320" target="_blank">statement</a> and here's the relevent bit copied out of the image:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Following the announcement of the operating system for AYANEO NEXT LITE, players and friends have shown great interest and engaged in lively discussions. Some players provided feedback indicating the continued preference for a Windows operating system. "Real Gamers, Know Gamers," and in response to this valuable feedback, we are pleased to announce that AYANEO NEXT LITE will come pre-installed with the genuine Windows 11 64-bit Home Edition operating system. Of course, players can still choose to install HoloISO on their own. AYANEO's official website provides HoloISO system images that are officially adapted and compatible for players to download and experience. The streamlined and efficient HololSO system aims to offer players a more convenient game management, smooth and stable gaming performance, lower overall power consumption, and native compatibility with both controllers and touchscreen operations. This approach aligns with the gaming habits of handheld device users, providing players with a richer selection of operating systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Real Gamers, Know Gamers huh? That's…a peculiar thing to say here.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8879924451706179026gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8879924451706179026gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>This is a shame to see, as this could have helped to continue the Linux push for gaming. At least they will still be offering it up for download, but as we long-timers know, most people don't generally change their operating system on any device. </p>
<p>Hopefully sometime soon Valve will finally properly release SteamOS 3 for other hardware vendors, as SteamOS carries more weight to it than community-rebuilds like HoloISO. A lot of it is in the name, as players and hardware vendors would likely be more confident with SteamOS directly.</p>

      <title>The Pokémon Company confirm investigation into Palworld</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this could be about to get interesting, as The Pokémon Company have actually released a statement in regards to all the speculation about Palworld amid many claims of copying Pokémon's homework.</p>
<p>So far, there's no really solid proof that I can see of any actual direct copying (or of any AI use that people keep claiming too). There's a good few similarities to a few Pokémon, but lots of the examples people keep sharing around don't have me overly convinced. </p>
<p>Here's what The Pokémon Company said (<a href="https://corporate.pokemon.co.jp/media/news/detail/335.html" target="_blank">source</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Inquiries Regarding Other Companies’ Games</strong></p>
<p>We have received many inquiries regarding another company’s game released in January 2024. We have not granted any permission for the use of Pokémon intellectual property or assets in that game. We intend to investigate and take appropriate measures to address any acts that infringe on intellectual property rights related to the Pokémon. We will continue to cherish and nurture each and every Pokémon and its world, and work to bring the world together through Pokémon in the future.</p>
<p>The Pokémon Company</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>They didn't name Palworld directly, likely as that might put them in hot water if nothing comes of it.</em></p>
<p>Really, this reads a bit like a "please stop emailing us" statement. It was obvious they were going to look into it. Nintendo and The Pokémon Company are notoriously tough on taking action and they already started <a href="https://twitter.com/ToastedShoes/status/1749711480050827433" target="_blank">wiping traces</a> of a Pokémon mod for Palworld. Even Nexus Mods have <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/14924" target="_blank">said</a> they will not be hosting any such mods.</p>
<p>Again, they cannot take action just because it's a game that has monster catching in it. Pokémon don't own that idea, they can't. They could only take action for actual plagiarism. And as a whole, Palworld is actually objectively a very different game to anything Pokémon has put out.</p>
<p>In other news, Palworld crossed <a href="https://twitter.com/Palworld_EN/status/1750350702000607389" target="_blank">8 million</a> copies sold now.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA 550.40.07 Beta driver released with fixes for VRR and Wayland</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 24/01/24 20:07 UTC</strong>: An NVIDIA developer messaged me to clarify the changelog oddness:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For this Beta release, we pulled a diff against the current Production release 535.154.05 since that captures everything from the previous production branch R535 to this new production branch R550 including the changes from R545. Enterprise customers are often not tracking the New Feature Branches like R545 so we do it this way to avoid our partners missing release highlights. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've given them feedback that it's not ideal for normal desktop consumers to do it like that, which they're hoping to improve in future. Ideally, giving us a simple way to see just the changes since the <em>last</em> release would suffice.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>NVIDIA has today launched the <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/Download/driverResults.aspx/218153/en-uk" target="_blank">550.40.07</a> Beta driver for Linux which includes numerous important fixes, so you might want to jump in and give this one a thorough gaming test.</p>
<p>I have to be careful checking over NVIDIA driver releases, as <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/nvidia-53515405-for-linux-brings-a-few-bug-fixes/" target="_blank">they keep</a> copy-pasting changelogs from previous versions. In this case, they've again copied over lots of the changes from previous driver releases. So keep that in mind. A fair few notes of what's listed were also in the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/nvidia-driver-5452902-out-for-linux-plus-other-releases-due-to-security-issues/" target="_blank">545.29.02</a> driver released back in October 2023. NVIDIA aren't really making it clear lately exactly what's new in each driver - which is frustrating. I have again tried to reach out to NVIDIA to find out what's happening with the changelogs lately.</p>
<p>Scanning over previous releases, it looks like <em>these</em> specifically <em>may</em> be actually <em>new</em> to this driver:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that sometimes caused Wayland applications to run at less than one frame per second on Maxwell, Volta, and Pascal series GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused an intermittent drop in desktop framerate.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused "Flip event timeout" messages to be printed to the system log when displays are hotplugged when nvidia-drm is loaded with the <code class="inline-code">fbdev=1</code> kernel module parameter.</li>
<li>Fixed intermittent Xid errors on Horizon Zero Dawn, Metro Exodus, Forza Horizon 5, and Halo Infinite.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which prevented the "NoMaxPClkCheck" mode validation token from working on single-link TMDS (e.g. DVI, HDMI) outputs.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that allowed VRR displays to be driven below their minimum refresh rate, resulting in a blank or flickering image.</li>
<li>Added an application profile to improve Kwin performance on hybrid GPU systems by setting OGL_DEDICATED_HW_STATE_PER_CONTEXT=ENABLE_ROBUST.</li>
<li>Updated the build process for NVIDIA kernel modules to honor the INSTALL_MOD_DIR Kbuild environment variable.</li>
<li>Added support for R8, GR88 and YCbCr GBM formats.</li>
<li>Optimized the X driver headless framerate limiter to more closely mimic upstream behavior and prevent it from activating in inconvenient situations. Added a new X config option "LimitFrameRateWhenHeadless" to disable the headless framerate limiter.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented Gamescope from running when using the NVIDIAOpen GPU Kernel modules.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented the installer package from being unpacked on systems where zstd is not installed, when /tmp is mounted noexec.</li>
<li>Use transparent huge pages when available for the .text section. This is done through madvise() calls, and requires CONFIG_READ_ONLY_THP_FOR_FS.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression that prevented setting backlight brightness levels.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could lead to UI corruption in nvidia-installer on systems with more than one initramfs file per kernel.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused games built on the Source 2 engine to hangwhen running under Xwayland.</li>
<li>Changed the name visible in /proc/devices of NVIDIA devices and the NVIDIA control device from "nvidia-frontend" to "nvidia" and "nvidiactl".Scripts which parse /proc/devices (such as udev rules) may need to be updated. Note that the conventional /dev device paths like /dev/nvidia0 and /dev/nvidiactl remain unchanged.</li>
</ul>

<li>Fixed a bug that caused games built on the Source 2 engine to hang when running under Xwayland.</li>
<li>Added experimental HDMI 10 bits per component support; enable by loading nvidia-modeset with `hdmi_deepcolor=1`.</li>
<li>Added support for HDR signaling via the HDR_OUTPUT_METADATA and Colorspace per-connector DRM properties when nvidia-drm is loaded with the`modeset=1` parameter.</li>
<li>Added support for PRIME render offload to Vulkan Wayland WSI.</li>
<li>Added support for the CTM, DEGAMMA_LUT, and GAMMA_LUT DRM-KMS CRTCproperties. These are used by features such as the "Night Light"feature in GNOME and the "Night Color" feature in KDE, when they are used as Wayland compositors.</li>
<li>Added beta-quality support for GeForce and Workstation GPUs to open kernel modules. Please see the "Open Linux Kernel Modules" chapter in the README for details.</li>
<li>Added initial experimental support for runtime D3 (RTD3) power management on Desktop GPUs.  Please see the 'PCI-Express Runtime D3 (RTD3) Power Management' chapter in the README for more details.</li>
<li>Added support for the EGL_ANDROID_native_fence_sync EGL extension and the VK_EXTERNAL_SEMAPHORE_HANDLE_TYPE_SYNC_FD_BIT andVK_EXTERNAL_FENCE_HANDLE_TYPE_SYNC_FD_BIT Vulkan external handle typeswhen the nvidia-drm kernel module is loaded with the modeset=1 parameter.</li>
<li>Added experimental support for framebuffer consoles provided by nvidia-drm. On kernels that implement drm_fbdev_generic_setup anddrm_aperture_remove_conflicting_pci_framebuffers, nvidia-drm will install a framebuffer console when loaded with both `modeset=1` and `fbdev=1`kernel module parameters. This will replace the Linux boot console drivenby a system framebuffer driver such as efifb or vesafb.<br/>
<br/>
Note that when an nvidia-drm framebuffer console is enabled, unloading nvidia-drm will cause the screen to turn off.<br/>
 </li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to allow installing the driver while an existing NVIDIA driver is already loaded.</li>
<li>Added support for virtual reality displays, such as the SteamVR platform,on Wayland compositors that support DRM leasing. Support requires xwayland version 22.1.0 and wayland-protocols version 1.22, or later.Tested on sway, minimum version 1.7 with wlroots version 0.15, and also on Kwin, minimum version 5.24.<br/>
<br/>
Note: Before xwayland 23.2, there is a known issue with HDMI displays where the headset will fail to start a second time after closing SteamVR. This can be worked around by unplugging and replugging in the headset.<br/>
 </li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented VRR (Variable Refresh Rate) from working with Wayland.</li>
<li>Changed the name visible in /proc/devices of NVIDIA devices and the NVIDIA control device from "nvidia-frontend" to "nvidia" and "nvidiactl".Scripts which parse /proc/devices (such as udev rules) may need to be updated. Note that the conventional /dev device paths like /dev/nvidia0and /dev/nvidiactl remain unchanged.</li>
<li>Added support to the NVIDIA VDPAU driver for running in Xwayland. Please refer to the "Xwayland support in VDPAU" section of the README for further details.</li>
<li>Added libnvidia-gpucomp.so to the driver package. This is a helper library used for GPU shader compilation.</li>
<li>Removed libnvidia-vulkan-producer.so from the driver package. This helper library is no longer needed by the Wayland WSI.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 has a 64bit and Vulkan update for Linux in testing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve are still updating Team Fortress 2 (TF2), and a bigger technical update is currently in the works that will bring 64bit and Vulkan support to the Linux version.</p>
<p>Currently, TF2 on Linux uses ToGL, Valve's original DirectX to OpenGL translation layer. Like what Valve did with their other older games, this update will instead use the vastly newer DXVK, which translates DirectX to Vulkan. Together 64bit and Vulkan support should make the game run much smoother. <em>Eventually, the Windows version should be 64bit too.</em></p>
<p>Not only that, it's also bumping up TF2 to use the newer Steam Linux Runtime 3.0 "Sniper", making it work better on modern Linux distributions.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20344173191706099056gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20344173191706099056gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - TF2 on Linux</em></p>
<p>You can try it out right now under the "x64_linux_test" Beta branch on Steam, which is now public, but you will not be able to connect to public servers or do matchmaking. It's purely for local testing and benchmarking. On top of that the Team Fortress 2 Dedicated Server is also being updated to go along with it (Steam App ID: 232250).</p>
<p>Good to see more TF2 updates really are coming.</p>
<p>TF2 is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Palworld hits 7 million sales, smashes Counter-Strike 2&#39;s all-time peak and gets a roadmap</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Palworld has continued to smash records, and it has now become the number 2 on Steam for the record of peak-players as it crosses 7 million sales. There's also now a fancy roadmap.</p>
<p>It only recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/palworld-overtakes-counter-strike-2-for-most-players-on-steam-and-hits-5-million-sales/" target="_blank">jumped over Counter-Strike 2</a> for currently online players, but now it has <em>also</em> rocketed past CS2 on the record of peak-players overall with 1,864,421 versus CS2's all-time peak of 1,818,773 giving it the true number 2 spot on Steam which you can see on <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/?sort=peak" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>. Absolutely incredible numbers for a brand new Early Access game.</p>
<p>A new roadmap has also been <a href="https://twitter.com/Palworld_EN/status/1750103684971987108" target="_blank">shared</a> by the developer on X:</p>

<p>There's also already a Steam Deck performance <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/palworld/mods/27" target="_blank">mod</a> available, although it does reduce the visual quality a <em>lot</em> and it's already not especially great visually on Steam Deck to get it around 30FPS. It currently has a Steam Deck Playable rating and works just fine on Desktop Linux with Proton.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Core Keeper is a rather wonderful game about underground mining, crafting and exploration and it's about to get a big new Lunar New Year event along with some new permanent features to improve the game.</p>
<p>The event itself runs from January 31st - February 13th sending you off on a hunt for lost red envelopes, filled with Lucky Coins that can be traded for a range of new items, including decorative Paper Lanterns, Mystic Knot Tassels, Wall Paper Lanterns, Guardian Beast Statues, and a brand new piece of headgear – the Dragon Mask.</p>
<p>On top of that various new permanent features (non-events) will be added including fan-requested quality of life improvements, including major changes to wall &amp; floor tiles to streamline building and customisation, improvements to chests and planter boxes, additional performance optimisations and more. Even Discord Rich Presence is being added in.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer which teases the event and a brand new boss:</p>

      <title>Godot Engine gets a free Nintendo Switch port for game devs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>Here's one less reason for game developers to skip over using the free and open source <a href="https://godotengine.org" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, as it now has a free port available to bring games over to the Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>You may remember recently that W4 Games, a company set-up by some of the Godot team, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/godot-43-dev-1-brings-major-rendering-changes-plus-w4-games-on-console-suppor/" target="_blank">announced</a> their own console port availability that has a cost attached to it which at a basic minimum would be $800 a year for a single console. Many felt the price was too much but, since it's all open source, anyone else could come up with a porting solution and now they have — for the Nintendo Switch at least.</p>
<p>RAWRLAB Games announced the free Godot Engine port for authorised Nintendo Switch developers, supporting projects made with Godot versions 3.5.x and 4.1.x. Features of the port:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·<strong> Complimentary access</strong>: Available at no cost to all authorised Nintendo Switch developers.<br/>
· <strong>License</strong>: The source code is distributed under the MIT License, offering broad usage and modification rights.<br/>
· <strong>Software provisioning</strong>: The software is provided "as is," without any implied warranty or support of any kind.<br/>
· <strong>Basic functionality included</strong>: This port includes only basic functionality.<br/>
· <strong>No C# or GDNative/GDExtension</strong>: Only GDScript is supported. Native extensions are not supported, but you can try to convert them into internal modules.<br/>
· <strong>Optimization Level</strong>: It is important to note that the port is not highly optimized but is adequately efficient for most small to mid-sized game projects.<br/>
· <strong>Expandability</strong>: Having access to the source code, developers with C++ knowledge have the opportunity to add and integrate additional functionalities as needed.<br/>
· <strong>No support provided</strong>: This port is provided without support. Developers are encouraged to engage with the community on the Nintendo Developer Portal for collaboration and assistance.

      <title>Proposed Windows NT sync driver brings big Wine / Proton performance improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Zeb Figura of CodeWeavers <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240124004028.16826-1-zfigura@codeweavers.com/" target="_blank">has proposed</a> a Windows NT synchronization primitive driver to help performance of running games and applications designed for Windows on Linux with Wine / Proton.</p>
<p>As per the RFC (request for comments) posted onto the Linux kernel mailing list Figura notes: "This patch series introduces a new char misc driver, /dev/ntsync, which is used to implement Windows NT synchronization primitives."</p>
<p>Then giving some background on it: "The Wine project emulates the Windows API in user space. One particular part of<br/>
that API, namely the NT synchronization primitives, have historically been implemented via RPC to a dedicated "kernel" process. However, more recent applications use these APIs more strenuously, and the overhead of RPC has become a bottleneck.</p>
<p>The NT synchronization APIs are too complex to implement on top of existing primitives without sacrificing correctness. Certain operations, such as NtPulseEvent() or the "wait-for-all" mode of NtWaitForMultipleObjects(), require direct control over the underlying wait queue, and implementing a wait queue sufficiently robust for Wine in user space is not possible. This proposed driver, therefore, implements the problematic interfaces directly in the Linux kernel."</p>
<p>Figura did a presentation on it at the Linux Plumbers Conference in 2023 that you can see below:</p>

<p>What kind of performance difference might we see with something like this? The difference depends on your hardware and what you're trying to run but some FPS examples were given from multiple users including:</p>

<p><em>What hardware and software each was tested on was not noted.</em></p>
<p>Some impressive numbers but again it's hardware dependent, but even so any performance uplift would be welcome, so hopefully the patch series gets some good comments and approval after any tweaks are done that may be needed. Looks like we could end up seeing a nice future performance improvement for Linux and Steam Deck gaming with Wine and Proton.</p>

      <title>Railway network designer Rail Route releases February 22nd and over 100K copies sold</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rail Route from developer Bitrich is currently in Early Access and they just announced their plans for the big 1.0 release to happen on February 22nd. Rail Route has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Playable and a demo is available too if you wish to try it first.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1124180/view/3988567539067416013" target="_blank">announcement</a> they also mentioned they've crossed over 100,000 sales! It's been through some pretty huge improvements during Early Access across ~20 major updates. They've also confirmed more updates are planned to come after the 1.0 update.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12460610441706027310gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12460610441706027310gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>With its minimalist design it may look quite simple and inviting, but it's quite a complicated beast once it gets going. Having to manage and automate many different train-lines is no simple task to get right, and you can end up sinking dozens of ours at a time into it. A really interesting building sim overall.</p>
<p>You get a lot of freedom with it too building up from scratch as you gradually unlock new tech and resources to build the ultimate rail network across real-world city maps. There's a lot of different ways to play it too, the choice is yours from getting everything running perfectly on time and just endless tweaking or high-pressure, time-sensitive scenarios.</p>
<p>You can buy it on:</p>

      <title>The Universim god-game city-builder 1.0 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Universim from Crytivo has finally released, what they call a "new breed of God Game" where you guide a civilisation from nothing up to the stars. It comes with Native Linux support and it is rated Steam Deck Playable, although the Steam Deck rating is from 2022.</p>
<p>From a successful Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign in 2014, and then an Early Access on Steam in 2018, it's been a long time coming. A game I've played on and off over the years, always liking what I saw but it was far from complete. The big 1.0 release brings in an absolute <em>ton</em> of content including new buildings, space exploration, new planets, aliens, new quest lines and the list just keeps on going. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7212295931706026458gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7212295931706026458gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>This is a game that will truly suck away endless hours of your time, not just because there's now a lot to it, but even getting a basic civilization going will take quite a few hours. A joy to watch everything grow though, and it's quite a pretty game too. Nothing realistic looking, with Crytivo opting for a much more casual colourful style to it - although the planets themselves look pretty great.</p>
<p>If you want something resembling a city-builder, but you want something a bit different, The Universim is an interesting choice with all the god powers at your disposal. It's a pretty relaxing game, although there's times when it can be a bit intense when you're dealing with different disasters, the overall theme of the game keeps it remaining mostly calm. The narrator is a nice touch too which guides you through the game, giving you quests and hints. There's not really another game quite like it.</p>
<p>Release trailer viewable below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lyWUUHzGyJE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d72f4d80ab0c227f99d76cc6eafdf743.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lyWUUHzGyJE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>God-like Gameplay: Play as a deity guiding the Nuggets, a sentient species, through their evolution from the Stone Age to the Space Era.</li>
<li>Nuggets’ Civilization Dynamics: Observe the Nuggets' daily lives, from eating and drinking to mating and conflicts.</li>
<li>Technological and Era Advancement: Progress through a research tree with over 200 advancements.</li>
<li>Planetary Exploration and Management: Discover and colonize a vast array of procedurally generated planets. Each planet offers unique ecosystems and challenges.</li>
<li>God Powers and Influence: Wield 15 God Powers like tornadoes, earthquakes, lightning strikes, and more. Use these powers to guide, protect, or discipline the Nuggets.</li>
<li>Ecological Impact and Management: Manage the delicate balance of your planet's ecosystems. Your decisions, alongside the Nuggets' actions, have real environmental consequences, influencing global climates.</li>
<li>Mysterious and Humorous Narrative: Engage with a story-rich game narrated with humor. Unravel the layers of a deeper cosmic story that challenges your perception of being a deity, revealing unexpected twists about your true role.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Something I have noticed in the 1.0 release with the Linux version is that the main menu is a bit broken, with lots of ghosting and graphical issues with menus. The actual game itself is fine, just the main menu is graphically messed up and it appears to be the same on macOS. Hopefully they will fix that soon. Performance once actually in game seems pretty good though!</p>

      <title>SteamOS alternative Bazzite v2.2 out now with lots of enhancements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need something similar to SteamOS for your desktop or handhelds like the Steam Deck? The latest release of Bazzite with <a href="https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite/releases/tag/v2.2.0" target="_blank">version 2.2</a> sounds like it just keeps getting better.</p>
<p>Technically <em>not</em> a Linux distribution, and they don't call Bazzite a Linux distro. It's more of a community-rebuild based on Fedora Linux using <a href="https://github.com/ublue-os/main" target="_blank">ublue-os/main</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ublue-os/nvidia" target="_blank">ublue-os/nvidia</a> with <em>lots</em> of extras included. It's still not yet something for beginners, with their install experience gradually improving. But for people who love to tinker, this could be a bit of fun.</p>
<p>The 2.2 release includes some big changes like a new modified fsync kernel with enhanced hardware support, HDR and more. You also get Nintendo HID support, a Webapp Manager, Pods as a default feature which is great for managing distrobox/containers, improvements to Steam Deck support, patches to Gamescope pulled in from ChimeraOS and tons of tweaks to both the GNOME and KDE desktop environments available. Plus lots of bug fixes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4550993641706025228gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4550993641706025228gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>So why use this? As they explain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bazzite started as a project to resolve some of the issues that plague SteamOS, mainly out of date packages (despite an Arch base) and the lack of a functional package manager.</p>
<p>Despite this project also being image-based, you are able to install any Fedora package straight from the command line. These packages will persist across updates (So go ahead and install that obscure VPN software you spent an hour trying to get working in SteamOS). Additionally, Bazzite is updated multiple times a week with packages from upstream Fedora, giving you the best possible performance and latest features - all on a stable base.</p>
<p>Bazzite ships with the latest Linux kernel and SELinux enabled by default with full support for secure boot (Run ujust enroll-secure-boot-key and enter the password ublue-os if prompted to enroll our key) and disk encryption, making this a sensible solution for general computing. (Yes, you can print from Bazzite)</p>

      <title>MONSTER HUNTER RISE gets patched to fix it on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/monster-hunter-rise-adds-new-drm-that-breaks-it-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">As reported previously</a>, Capcom recently updated MONSTER HUNTER RISE with new Enigma DRM and the update ended up breaking it on Steam Deck / Linux Desktop. But it should no longer be an issue no matter the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> version used.</p>
<p>Valve did <em>already</em> work around it, updating Proton Hotfix to enable the game to run again, and Valve has even set Proton Hotfix as the default for now. So even if Capcom didn't patch it, the game was still playable again thanks to quick work from the Proton developers.</p>
<p>Now though, Capcom has updated the game directly and the updated <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1446780/view/3970553140557253784?l=english" target="_blank">recent patch notes</a> on Steam have an addition at the top to now note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have released a patch that addresses the issue of the game not running on Steam Deck after installing update Ver.16.0.2.0.<br/>
We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Testing it myself today it does run just fine once again with Proton 8 and Proton Experimental without issues. <em>ICYMI: <a href="http://Proton 8.0-5 brings more HDR gaming to Linux / Steam Deck plus lots of fixes" target="_blank">Proton 8.0-5 was also just released</a>!</em></p>
<p>It's good to see Capcom actively work to fix up their mess, but it's a shame this happened in the first place. Perhaps in future they will be more careful to not break their Steam Deck Verified rated games. Clearly Capcom don't see the Steam Deck as an important enough platform yet if they're not testing updates before pushing them out.</p>

      <title>Surreal Engine is an open source reimplementation of Unreal Engine for classic games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Originally called UTEngine, <a href="https://github.com/dpjudas/SurrealEngine" target="_blank">Surreal Engine</a> is a community-made attempt to reimplement enough of the original Unreal Engine to get games like the original Unreal Tournament (99) working.</p>
<p>An interesting project that's been around for quite some time now, but it does appear to be progressing nicely. It can currently detect certain versions of Unreal Tournament, Unreal Gold, Deus Ex and Klingon Honor Guard. Although they say currently only Unreal Tournament v436 is in a "relatively playable state".</p>
<p>From the GitHub page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The engine can load and render the maps. The Unrealscript VM is almost feature complete - only arrays and network conditional execution are not implemented yet.</p>
<p>It will attempt to load all level actors and initialize the map. However, while the menus and the HUD will appear, there are still many native functions not implemented yet. It is also quite possible some events aren't firing as they should. You will therefore see exceptions shown if you interact with them and that is where the project is at.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's also <a href="https://github.com/OldUnreal/UnrealTournamentPatches" target="_blank">OldUnreal</a> which patches up the original Unreal Tournament, but it's not open source as it uses the original from Epic whereas Surreal Engine is open source under the zlib license.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that Epic Games don't support their classic games in any way now, they even <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/epic-games-are-killing-off-a-bunch-of-classics-like-unreal-tournament/" target="_blank">entirely removed a whole bunch of them like Unreal Tournament</a> from all storefronts. Not even keeping them to their own store, just killing them off. Oh and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/fortnite-on-linux-steam-deck-not-until-tens-of-millions-of-users/" target="_blank">don't expect Fortnite to run on Linux / Steam Deck</a> any time soon.</p>

      <title>Riot Games cutting 11% of staff (about 530 people)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ouch. Yet another developer is getting rid of staff in a move to cut some costs and this time it's Riot Games, who will be waving goodbye to 11% of their people. That's 530 people who will lose their jobs and "the biggest impact to teams outside of core development".</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/2024-rioter-update" target="_blank">blog post</a> the Riot CEO, Dylan Jadeja, mentioned how they took on too many "big bets across the company" and they have "too many things underway" and some just aren't paying off causing costs to grow and become "unsustainable" leaving Riot "no room for experimentation or failure".</p>
<p>Riot will be supporting staff being cut with a minimum of 6 months salary, a cash bonus based on a performance target, health benefits, a personal laptop if they need one and more. Looks like they have a reasonable support system in place at least.</p>
<p>All of this doesn't mean much for Linux and Steam Deck gaming of course, since Riot Games don't actually support Linux. Still, it's interesting industry news to see just how many developers are cutting back. Because there has been a lot of this across the industry and it appears no one is safe.</p>
<p>Now I'll take this opportunity to remind you that Riot Games will be soon adding <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/league-of-legends-likely-unplayable-on-linux-steam-deck-soon-due-to-vanguard-anti-cheat/" target="_blank">Vanguard into League of Legends</a>, so it will be <em>broken</em> on Linux / Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Proton 8.0-5 brings more HDR gaming to Linux / Steam Deck plus lots of fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Proton 8.0-5 is here marking more games as playable, bringing HDR support to even more games and of course the usual bug fixes aplenty to Steam Deck / Desktop Linux.</p>
<p>Lots of these changes would have already been available in Proton Experimental or Proton Hotfix (which some games had by default), but those change often and can have regressions breaking things. You should stick with the stable Proton unless you have issues. Want to learn more about Proton? Check out the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton beginner's guide</a>.</p>

<li>Simon the Sorcerer: 25th Anniversary Edition.</li>
<li>Assassin's Creed Mirage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though Assassin's Creed Mirage is not available on Steam, people can still attempt to play it using external launchers so Valve will still fix up issues in Proton for such games from time to time.

      <title>Unified Linux Wine Game Launcher aims to improve Windows games on Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oh no! Another launcher! Well, not quite. In fact, Unified Linux Wine Game Launcher (ULWGL) is actually meant to be used by existing game launchers like Heroic Games, Lutris and others on Linux desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>So what does ULWGL actually do? This proof-of-concept idea was put up by Thomas "GloriousEggroll" Crider, who also maintains the popular GE-Proton compatibility layer. ULWGL is designed as a helper to properly run <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> outside of Steam, it's "essentially a copy of the Steam Linux Runtime/Steam Runtime Tools that Valve uses for proton, with some modifications made so that it can be used outside of Steam".</p>
<p>The idea is that other game launchers would use this so that all fixes and compatibility can be properly shared between them, thus making Windows gaming on Linux a whole lot easier with Wine/Proton. Protonfixes would be the same across launchers, anyone would be able to run games through Proton with no Steam required and basically it just unifies everything.</p>
<p>Sounds like a really great idea so all these launchers don't need to keep re-inventing a way to run games in Proton outside of Steam.</p>
<p>See more on <a href="https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/ULWGL-launcher" target="_blank">the GitHub page</a>. There's other parts to it that you can see on the <a href="https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components" target="_blank">GitHub list</a>. </p>

      <title>Palworld overtakes Counter-Strike 2 for most players on Steam and hits 5 million sales</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There seems to be absolutely no stopping Palworld. It just keeps on growing and pulling in more players with its enticing theme of Pokémon with guns and crafting.</p>
<p>Around two hours ago it hit a new record high of 1,582,482, making it jump above Counter-Strike 2 to take the <em>current</em> top spot for most-played on Steam right now. That's incredibly impressive! Thanks to it now hitting 5 million sales in 3 days, this concurrent player count is also the third highest on Steam <em>ever</em>!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14790538241705939634gol1.png"/>Picture credit: SteamDB</em></p>
<p>I wouldn't be surprised if it took second place on highest concurrent players ever in the next 24 hours. At the rate it has been increasing, it's pretty much a given at this point. But dethroning PUBG would take more than double what they have right now but never say never right? </p>
<p>The game was bound to be popular — but as much as this? I didn't have that on my 2024 bingo card.</p>
<p>My Steam Deck video on Palworld is below if you missed the update to the previous article:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UiP56BeG0sk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c371e68af4ddea1e2c9961977b800c04.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UiP56BeG0sk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Have you been playing it? What do you think to Palworld? Let me know in the article comments below. I'm really hoping they add in some UI and Text scaling, it's too small on Steam Deck but just fine on Linux desktop. On Steam Deck it uses Proton Experimental by default and is rated Playable. On Desktop Linux is also works great.</p>
<p>Additionally for people who want to run a Palworld server, the open source tool LinuxGSM (Linux Game Server Manager) just launched version <a href="https://linuxgsm.com/2024/01/release-v24-1-0/" target="_blank">24.1.0</a> with Palworld support.</p>
<p>You can buy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/" target="_blank">Palworld on Steam</a>. </p>

      <title>Last Epoch crosses 1 million Early Access sales, new trailer and pre-order bonuses</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Eleventh Hour Games are ramping up their plans for the 1.0 release of Last Epoch, the popular ARPG with a rather unique sounding item trading system. Now there's a new trailer and details of pre-order bonuses if you pick it up before February 21st.</p>
<p>A big milestone was also hit with an announcement shared with us that they've crossed over 1 million sales. “We’re honored and humbled that the Last Epoch community has grown to one million players,” said Judd Cobler, founder and CEO of EHG, and game director on Last Epoch. “Being fans of the genre first and foremost, we’ve always kept close to our community and tried to reflect the needs and wishes of the players as we craft an action RPG for the ages.”</p>
<p>They also announced three editions of the game for pre-order, but since it's in Early Access you can play right away but the new goodies arrive with the 1.0 release. Here's their new editions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard Edition - $34.99: offering the same outstanding value that has already attracted over 1 million players, the entry-level Standard Edition pre-order comes with the Golden Guppy exclusive pet.</li>
<li>Deluxe Edition - $49.99: As well as the cute Golden Guppy, the Deluxe Edition includes the full game soundtrack as a digital download*, and 50 Epoch Points. On February 21 it will unlock the Adolescent Chronowyrm cosmetic pet, the Fallen Ronin cosmetic armor set, and the Firefly’s Refuge cosmetic portal.</li>
<li>Ultimate Edition - $64.99: As well as the cosmetics and soundtrack* from the Deluxe Edition, the Ultimate Edition includes 100 Epoch Points and from February 21 unlocks the Temporal Guardian cosmetic armor set, the Twilight Fox cosmetic pet, the Adult Chronowyrm cosmetic pet, and the Celestial Way cosmetic portal</li>
</ul>
<p><em>(* May be delivered at a later date following the release of patch 1.0.)</em></p>
<p>Last Epoch also needed a new trailer for a while now, and they certainly delivered. Watch it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="esrO1CocQ9w"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/13a66cfe4a91dda1c397bad4d23b27df.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/esrO1CocQ9w" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It has Native Linux support and is currently rated as Unsupported on Steam Deck, although it does work. Running it through Proton seems to be the best way to play though, as their Native Linux version has various graphical issues reported.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/899770/Last_Epoch/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Edge ISO available for Linux Mint 21.3 with newer Linux kernel</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Linux Mint team have announced the release of the Edge ISO for the latest Linux Mint 21.3, making it easier to use with newer hardware.</p>
<p>With Linux Mint sticking to an Ubuntu base, they generally go with whatever Linux kernel version is shipped in this case version 5.15. However, newer hardware often needs a newer Linux kernel. Sometimes you might not even be able to boot unless the kernel version is recent enough.</p>
<p>So this is why Linux Mint do EDGE ISOs which give you a newer Linux kernel out of the box and with Linux Mint 21.3 this gives you kernel version 6.5</p>
<p>They do say "The Edge ISO image is not as stable as the other ISOs and may not support as many proprietary drivers. Only use it if you cannot boot or install with the other ISOs", but that kernel is already a good while old being released back in August 2023 and in fact it's actually reached <a href="https://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/2311.3/04928.html" target="_blank">end-of-life</a> so it won't see any more point releases.</p>
<p>You can download it on <a href="https://linuxmint-user-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/edge.html" target="_blank">their website</a>.</p>

      <title>31% of devs already using AI and the PC platform looks strong from GDC Survey</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The annual GDC Survey is out now and it's an interesting look into what developers are up to and how the industry is changing, and some of the info this time around is pretty eyebrow raising.</p>
<p>Firstly, to note, this survey ran between Oct. 11 to Oct. 29, 2023 and contains answers polled from over 3,000 developers working in the games industry. As with all surveys, a pinch of salt is needed but it's a great overall look at the state of things.</p>
<p>Scanning through the PDF with my Mark I Eyeball, the first real interesting result is on what platform the developers are developing for with 66% of responses for PC. This is a good showing, and clearly PC gaming is stronger than it ever has been before when you take into account the growth of Steam as well. <em>Remember Valve even said<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/steam-had-83000-new-customers-every-day-in-2022/" target="_blank"> Steam had 83,000 new customers every day in 2022</a>, but we haven't seen a 2023 overview yet.</em></p>
<p>For Linux specifically, only 7% said they were developing for it. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3005878181705926042gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3005878181705926042gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Image credit: GDC, click to enlarge.</em></p>
<p>The really interesting bit though is when it comes to generative AI. The <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/valve-announces-new-rules-for-games-with-ai-content-on-steam/" target="_blank">AI flood gates have been opened by Valve for Steam</a> with their new rules, and no doubt many developers will be looking into using it, and some already are. According to the survey 49% of developers overall are using it or they have colleagues using it. That's split across many departments though from finance to programming and all sorts. But AI generation is <em>clearly</em> already popular.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11520891591705926432gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11520891591705926432gol1.jpg"/> </a><br/>

<em>Image credit: GDC, click to enlarge.</em></p>
<p>The survey also showed that indie developers were more likely to be the ones using AI at 37%, and not the bigger AAA lot at 21%. Although no doubt this will change over time as AI generation continues improving. When asked about how developers think the impact of generative AI will be only 21% were positive about it, with 57% feeling mixed and 18% having a negative opinion of it. Only 1% thought it would have no impact and another 3% didn't know.</p>

      <title>MONSTER HUNTER RISE adds new DRM that breaks it on Steam Deck (UPDATED)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 19:06 UTC</strong> - Valve have now fixed it in Proton Hotfix. To select it go into the game Properties -&gt; Compatibility, tick the box and select Proton Hotfix from the drop-down box. If you do not see Proton Hotfix in the drop-down box, search for Proton Hotfix in your Steam Library and install it. It <em>might</em> sometimes still crash on launch, just try again.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3492013371705955048gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3492013371705955048gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Capcom have rolled out an update to MONSTER HUNTER RISE, and sadly it has broken it on Steam Deck. As they continue attempting to change their DRM in older games.</p>
<p>They're swapping from Denuvo over to Enigma which seems to be the cause of the problems, and it's not the first title they've tried this with. In the patch notes for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1446780/view/3970553140557253784" target="_blank">Ver.16.0.2.0</a> Capcom updated it to note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There have been reports of the game not running on Steam Deck after updating to Ver.16.0.2.0.<br/>
The dev team is currently investigating this issue.<br/>
We will let you know as soon as we find out more, so please hold on for further information.<br/>
<br/>
We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the actual changes list, Capcom didn't even state the change to the DRM, they're clearly trying to keep it quiet. This bugs me. Any form of anti-cheat and DRM should be clearly noted not just on Steam pages - but in update notes too. Consumers should be <em>properly</em> informed.</p>
<p>Shame that Capcom didn't think to test their game considering it's Steam Deck Verified. Although, verification is done by Valve directly, it doesn't actually mean a game developer supports it.</p>
<p>Hopefully Capcom will reverse the change, or Valve will find a solution in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> to get it working again. From reports I've seen it affects Linux desktop too, not just Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Previously, Capcom added Enigma DRM to Resident Evil Revelations (released on Steam in 2013), which caused problems for players and Capcom ended up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/222480/view/3990818705013251073" target="_blank">reversing</a> the update (but said they would fix it and re-release it). This caused players to review-bomb the title with the most recent review score showing as Overwhelmingly Negative.</p>

      <title>Palworld is Steam Deck Playable and runs on Desktop Linux with Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Palworld is a new release on Steam in Early Access from Pocketpair. A fusion of Pokémon with monster catching, farming, building and much more. It is Steam Deck Playable and does work on Desktop Linux too. Note: personal purchase.</p>
<p>What has often been referred to as Pokémon with guns, it's already proving to be a <em>big</em> hit with a current peak player count of <s>250,553</s> <strong>294,826</strong> (it keeps going up every refresh) on Steam and a Very Positive user rating. So it seems like it might be the first big indie hit of 2024. So it's great news that it works right away!</p>
<p>Valve has already put it through Deck Verified and gave it a Steam Deck Playable rating, and Valve set Proton Experimental for it by default on Steam Deck, so for best experience on Desktop Linux make sure you set Proton Experimental in the Properties -&gt; Compatibility menu.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/153125261705670783gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/153125261705670783gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3959857031705670782gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3959857031705670782gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
Pictured: Palworld on Kubuntu 23.10. Click them to enlarge.</em></p>
<p>For Steam Deck the performance does have some issues and Valve noted various problems in their testing including: small text, graphics needing to be configured manually, you need to manually bring up the on-screen keyboard and some functionality may not be accessible with the default controller configuration.</p>
<p>It was designed as a multiplayer game clearly in many ways with support for 4 player co-op and 32 players on dedicated servers. You can play solo without issues though.</p>
<p>In my own testing on a Steam Deck OLED I've been using these settings:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18217485191705673122gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18217485191705673122gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>So far, this has given a somewhat acceptable performance level. It ranges from 25-45 FPS depending on what I am doing which is very playable - most of the time above 30FPS. Some spots in the open world I've seen bring it down to 25FPS, especially during bigger combat sections. However, one clear problem is the menu system. Some of the in-game menus bring the performance down pretty hard to around 20FPS but it will come back up when you close the menus.</p>
<p>Text is definitely small too, I've had to pull the Steam Deck closer to my face to actually read some of the on-screen details, so it's quite annoying. It's going to need some text scaling quite urgently as it's really <em>not</em> comfortable to read a lot of it. The icons are tiny too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16525324941705673400gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16525324941705673400gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13046520741705673720gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13046520741705673720gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Palworld on Steam Deck. Click them to enlarge.</em></p>
<p>For battery life on the Steam Deck OLED, you're looking at around ~2 hours from a full charge with a 60FPS frame limit.</p>
<p>Meanwhile on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 23.10) with an AMD Ryzen 5800X and Radeon 6800XT the experience has been overall pretty great. Testing on the highest possible graphics settings it's always been above 60FPS so far. Most of the time between 80-120FPS depending on where I am in the open world and what I'm doing. For a <em>big</em> open world game in Early Access running through Proton, that's actually pretty good.</p>
<p>This is only an early preliminary test as i haven't had too long with it, so keep that in mind. It's also Early Access, so everything is subject to change but it's an incredibly promising start for Palworld.</p>
<p>One thing I will address directly, since this always comes up in comments whenever there's a new monster catching game, the elephant in the room — Nintendo. They don't (and can't) own the rights to an entire genre, but Pokémon is obviously popular and so there's always comparisons but Nintendo can't just go after developers of other similar games. However, in <em>this</em> case, <em>plenty</em> of the creatures <em>do</em> have a striking similarity to various Pokémon designs and some even look like colour-flips with a few tweaks. So it will be very interesting to see what happens for this one specifically.</p>
<p>Something else that needs noting, is that the developer still has other games in Early Access while launching this also into Early Access. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1307550/Craftopia/" target="_blank">Craftopia</a>, for example, looks largely similar. Like they took their own game, and added these creatures into it to make it a different game.</p>
<p>To sum up what I've seen of it so far it feels very much like a blending of ARK Survival Evolved, Pokémon and Zelda: Breath of the Wild mechanically. One or two sounds even seemed like they were right out of Zelda (very close at least). It's <em>very</em> derivative. But then so are a lot of survival games. The small human of mine is going to <em>freak</em> when they see it. I can definitely see why people are enjoying it so much already and I fear it's going to take over my life for a while.</p>

<p>Update 21/01/24: the article originally said Palworld had an internet requirement for single-player, as <a href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5416795271705868918gol1.jpeg" target="_blank">Valve state it</a> on their Deck Verified rating. Valve's notice is incorrect so the article text was updated. Additionally here's a new Steam Deck video of the game and some quick thoughts:</p>

      <title>Steam Beta adds explainers to Steam Deck performance menu - plus fixes for Desktop too</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released a new Beta for the Steam Deck and Steam Desktop that improved numerous bugs, and for Steam Deck makes the performance menu a little easier to understand.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3944657442696228020" target="_blank">Changes</a> for the Steam Deck:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated embedded Chromium build in Steam to 109.0.5414.120.</li>
<li>Updated the quick access performance menu with descriptions for each setting, including how they affect the system and the expected power/performance/visual quality tradeoffs.</li>
<li>Fixed a case where the sdcard was set as the default install location on reboot.</li>
<li>Fixed a case where the network status icon would fail to render for virtual networks.</li>
<li>Fixed store button on main menu remaining disabled in Family View even if store permissions were granted to the account.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed occasionally creating an extra virtual controller that is non-responsive.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's an example of the new performance menu descriptions:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6371681281705663639gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6371681281705663639gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>This is really great, because the option names by themselves are not easy for a lot of people to understand, and this should just help make the features more accessible. The menu itself also has fancy new icons:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10109357821705663644gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10109357821705663644gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>For Steam Desktop here's the Beta <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053/view/3966049540915750443" target="_blank">changes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Updated embedded Chromium build in Steam to 109.0.5414.120</li>
<li>Fixed issue where clicking on Voice Chat invitation notifications did not open chat</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Big Picture Mode</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved the display in the "Controller Configuration" tab when there are no controllers attached or the active controller is opted out of Steam Input</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remote Play</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Greatly improved performance when using hardware encoding with AMD video cards on Windows</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SteamVR</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improve layout and imagery for some of the dialogs that show up when launching VR games.</li>
<li>Clicking on items in the control bar (e.g. a download in progress) will correctly switch to the Steam tab</li>
<li>Show reloading message when SteamVR quits before reloading the Steam window</li>
<li>Steam now only reloads every fifth time that SteamVR quits</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Linux</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Known issue: when dismissing a dropdown menu, the steam client may incorrectly start blocking mouse input.</li>
</ul>

      <title>GPU Reshape is a fancy new open source tool for developers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A fresh announcement for developers today is GPU Reshape, a free and open source tool that could be really useful for game developers working with Vulkan and DirectX 12 to deal with potentially undefined behaviour. </p>
<p>According to the post it's a collaboration between AMD and Avalanche Studios Group, which then continued externally with Miguel Petersen of Striking Distance Studios (prev at Avalanche) who is the author of GPU Reshape with help from various other developers. Great to see AMD and more game developers value open source.</p>
<p>What is it actually for? If you're not a game developer, it's probably complicated to understand. It's not my expertise either, but I love seeing game developer toolkits like this release as open source. Petersen even clearly states in the post that Linux support is <em>planned</em> for it! For more games to support Linux / Steam Deck well — developers need the tools too. As per the blog post Petersen explained it as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A toolset that leverages on-the-fly instrumentation of GPU operations with instruction-level validation of potentially undefined behavior, supporting both DX12 and Vulkan. A standalone desktop application with no integration required, all open source (MIT), is now available in Beta.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17463430641705595383gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17463430641705595383gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured - GPU Reshape, credit to Miguel Petersen</em></p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GPU Reshape brings powerful features typical of CPU tooling to the GPU, providing validation of dynamic behaviour, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resource Bounds</strong> Validation of resource read / write coordinates against its bounds.</li>
<li><strong>Export Stability</strong> Numeric stability validation of floating point exports (UAV writes, render targets, vertex exports), e.g. NaN / Inf.</li>
<li><strong>Descriptor Validation</strong> Validation of descriptors, potentially dynamically indexed. This includes undefined, mismatched (compile-time to runtime), out of bounds descriptor indexing, and missing table bindings.</li>
<li><strong>Concurrency Validation</strong> Validation of resource concurrency, i.e. single-producer or multiple-consumer, between queues and events.</li>
<li><strong>Resource Initialization</strong> Validation of resource initialization, ensures any read was preceded by a write. (*1)</li>
<li><strong>Infinite Loops</strong> Detection of infinite loops. <em>Experimental</em>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a number of other planned additions, as they hope to see it evolve into a general purpose tool including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Shader debugging, providing the ability to inspect live data as the shader sees it.</li>
<li>Shader assertions, in source assertions typical of CPU code.</li>
<li>Branch hot spots, live hot spot profiling of all branches.</li>
<li>Branch coherence, live coherence analysis of all branches.</li>
<li>And more!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Deep survival game Vintage Story adds cave-ins, improved first-person, lots more animals</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vintage Story is a brutal deep survival game that I just love to watch expand, because it's so filled full of content it's spilling over the sides. The latest release, v1.19.0 Dejank Redux brings in even more content.</p>
<p>When it comes to content additions there's 11 new species of deer, 11 types of goats, you can now catch animals with a basket, antlers and horns you can mount on walls, a rework of ruins, new accessibility settings, snowballs, more character customization options, tule and sedge plants, an overhauled first-person mode, a cave-in system when digging and so much more.</p>
<p>This game is really quite something, and pretty darn challenging too.</p>

      <title>Tomb Raider I-III Remastered gets Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tomb Raider I-III Remastered is releasing from Aspyr and Crystal Dynamics on February 14th, and now Valve have given it the green tick of approval as it is now Steam Deck Verified. It was tested on the latest stable Proton 8 release, so as long as you use that across Steam Deck / Desktop Linux you should be good to go.</p>
<p>With this bundle you'll get Tomb Raider I + Unfinished Business, Tomb Raider II + Golden Mask and Tomb Raider III + The Lost Artifact. Aspyr say it has upgraded graphics, with the option to switch to the original polygon look at any time.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="68hISohBKmI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b5ec2a583843ecf225dac38e2674861b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/68hISohBKmI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can pre-order via:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/tomb_raider_i_to_iii_remastered" target="_blank">GOG</a> (you can use Lutris / Heroic)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/tomb-raider-iiii-remastered?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a></p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2478970/Tomb_Raider_IIII_Remastered_Starring_Lara_Croft/" target="_blank">Steam</a></p>
<p>Will you be picking it up to have a nostalgia blast? Worth pointing out the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/open-source-re-implementation-of-tomb-raider-1-1996-tr1x-gets-a-big-bug-fix-release/" target="_blank">open source re-implementation of Tomb Raider 1 (1996) TR1X</a> also exists. Remasters can be a pretty great thing to bring new audiences to older games, although they don't always hit, so hopefully Aspyr were careful with the Tomb Raider I-III Remastered collection.</p>

      <title>Exiled is a new compact puzzle thriller from the director of My Friendly Neighborhood</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Up for being puzzled and thrilled at the same time in a compact setting? John Szymanski, director of My Friendly Neighborhood, has released a standalone version of Exiled.</p>
<p>The developer said to expect an experience sort-of like Myst and The Room:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A note has been left on her desk talking of "the ancient evil" and "banishment to a different realm." The eldritch tome and an untranslated scrap she had been studying act as the only clues to her disappearance. Use clues found in the book to translate an ancient language, evade the lurking horrors, and solve the mystery of the strange objects around you!</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UNBYgBHS_e0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/82925969cbd0892222bffa3fea01d923.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UNBYgBHS_e0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The original was part of Dread X Collection 2 but now you can buy it standalone, and with Native Linux support too. It's had a few upgrades since then for this version including new voice acting, a re-written narrative, updated visuals, better scares and so on. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2741620/discussions/0/4139437492717265200/#c4139437492723453667" target="_blank">According to the dev</a> it's "significantly more engaging for a new player".</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Solve ancient puzzles, decode an eldritch language, and avoid the lurking horror all while sitting at a single desk.</li>
<li>Tense and foreboding atmosphere where the stillness of the library can be shattered at any moment.</li>
<li>High level of interactivity.</li>
<li>Multiple endings.</li>
<li>Good for a single play session.</li>
<li>Voiceover by Tom Schalk.</li>
</ul>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2741620/Exiled/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Popular mobile puzzle game classic Threes! is launching on PC for its 10th anniversary</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Threes! took the mobile world by storm back in 2014 winning the Apple Design Award, and finally for its 10th anniversary it will be coming to Steam so we can all get in on the fun. Releasing on February 6th, it appears it will have Native Linux support too!</p>
<p>It's been through a few upgrades it seems for the Steam version too with controller support and Steam Cloud support too. Might be a good one to chill out with in your coffee breaks at your desk, or on your Steam Deck too (if mobile is not your thing…). A puzzle game that just keeps on going and going until you get tired of it, ready to pick up again another day.</p>
<p>Original trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rgpJUj7GUFQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dc70115a16cb419fa8a9d7ba39980d84.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rgpJUj7GUFQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The Steam page is light on details, because not much is needed. You slide around numbers to make more numbers. Brilliant in its simplicity.</p>
<p>Much like the more recent hit Wordle, Threes! ended up with a huge amount of games just entirely copying the idea. One that went viral was 2048 (<a href="https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048" target="_blank">open source</a>) although technically a clone of another similar game (it gets complicated), which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22914955/threes-2048-ketchapp-copycats-clones-mobile-games" target="_blank">The Verge</a> wrote a bit of a round-up about back in 2022. This happens a <em>lot</em> on mobile though, as game-farms see an idea and copy it as quickly as they can. Somewhat reminds me of how Vampire Survivors made a few mechanics popular, and now it has a growing amount of similar games.</p>
<p>Have a look and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1818570/Threes/" target="_blank">wishlist Threes! on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Time Survivors is the most completely absurd Vampire Survivors-like yet</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Time Survivors just released on Steam and like many horde survival games it takes the idea of Vampire Survivors, and puts a few little different ideas into the mix and it's probably the most insane one yet. My time has been testing it with Proton 8 where it works great on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 23.10) and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Lunar Chili, the developer, say it is the "most historically inaccurate roguelike ever made", although they're stretching the term roguelike there. Apart from some odd wording (probably translation issues) and some balancing needing to be done, it's actually a whole lot of fun — and really quite challenging, more so than most in the VS knock-off genre. I say knock-off lovingly, because I do enjoy all these games very much, but VS clearly started a whole specific thing here.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10506505891705577572gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10506505891705577572gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The characters of course are completely ridiculous, as are some of their abilities. The enemies make absolutely <em>no</em> sense either. You'll be coming up against flying skulls, giant multi-headed fire-breathing dogs, dinosaurs, big flying golden gargoyles, massive flesh-eating plants and it seems <em>whatever</em> the hell they felt like putting in the game. Don't go into this one expecting anything to make sense, and that's what I love about this one. It's so ridiculous and stupid with the setting it just works, it's fun and that's the important thing.</p>
<p>Not many games you can say you played as Abraham Lincoln fighting off zombies and rats while throwing around a Yo-yo and a Flail. Oh and your special ability as Abe is to throw down some Cherry Blossom trees to block enemies, because yeah - that makes sense? Everything in the game is like that just pure absurdity.</p>
<p>Upgrades for days too, with quite an interesting system. You can upgrade each character, each weapon...and so on. And certain types of upgrades need different resources, so you'll be on the hunt on each map for more than just gold.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18257844401705579642gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18257844401705579642gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You even have map-based mini-events to do as well, like a Time Circle where you have to stay inside a blue zone while a big clock hand moves around it. However, invincible Time Guardians that look suspiciously like butterflies are flying around trying to hit you while you're in the zone. On top of that there's special challenges that you get by finding relics, that will give you a boost if you manage to purge their effects like killing 200 creatures, but each creature death shoots out a bunch of deadly petals. Or survive for 60 seconds while giant snakes made of skulls filling up the screen come after you.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1855596851705578623gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1855596851705578623gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p><em>Total madness.</em></p>
<p>At one point I turned into a giant. Giant Abe! Stomping all over everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7943437171705578479gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7943437171705578479gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Play as epic historic characters, each with their unique ability.</li>
<li>Historically inaccurate stages such as the Stone Age, the Dark Age, Ancient Egypt, and more full of enemies, secrets, mini bosses and end-stage boss.</li>
<li>Skill-tree based meta progression for all elements in the game.</li>
<li>Hundreds of different weapons, buffs, Cursed Relics, Powerups, and unlockables to choose from for a unique experience every run.</li>
<li>Casual quick 20 minute play sessions + plenty of quests and secrets to discover.</li>
<li>A Sandbox mode to test any overpowered build and train against any enemy.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you love these survivor-like horde survival games, it seems Time Survivors is one you need to try.</p>
<p>For desktop Linux everything worked as expected, but for Steam Deck (and gamepads) the experienced needs to be improved. The developers say they test it themselves, and on their Steam forum they <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2211390/discussions/0/3766732914510239086/" target="_blank">claim</a> "Yes, Time Survivors is compatible with Steam Deck." but it only has <em>partial</em> controller support with some parts like the unlock screen not working with gamepad at all. I had to switch Steam Input to keyboard+mouse for it to work well on Steam Deck and be playable. Which is fine, as the controls are incredibly simple. Apart from that though, on Steam Deck (OLED), the only time I saw performance drop was taking down a big enemy where <em>lots</em> of gold spawned, while there were <em>tons</em> of other enemies but that came back up quickly.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2211390/Time_Survivors/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA 535.154.05 for Linux brings a few bug fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update</strong>: it turns out, once again, NVIDIA released a new driver and copy-pasted the changelog from a previous version. This is <em>at least</em> the third time they've done this now. The changelog below is actually from the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/Download/driverResults.aspx/216728/en-uk/" target="_blank">535.146.02</a> driver, that was released in December. I've contacted NVIDIA to find out what's actually in the 535.154.05 driver. The only actual change that can be seen right now is this new driver notes it supports the new GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER in the Supported Products section, but the actual changelog <em>hasn't</em> changed.</p>
<hr/>
<p>NVIDIA released driver version 535.154.05 for Linux on January 16th bringing with it a few useful sounding bug fixes, so here's what's new for the first NVIDIA update of 2024. Quite a small one to start the year!</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/Download/driverResults.aspx/217862/en-uk" target="_blank">release page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause some multi-GPU systems to crash on suspend.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause the system to crash when an application is run with __NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which prevented application profiles from getting applied to PRIME Render Offloaded applications running via Wine.</li>
<li>Disabled PRIME Display Offload Sink support for virtual displays on datacenter GPUs. This prevents unusable desktop layouts from getting automatically configured on systems with a mix of physical and virtual displays.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused high CPU usage during system suspend, which could lead to the system not entering s2idle in some cases.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused the nvidia-settings control panel to crash when running on Wayland with newer versions of libwayland-client.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This release is from their "Production Branch", so anyone should be good to go on upgrading to it as it's a normal stable driver release.</p>
<p>Is there an NVIDIA driver bug that you're currently waiting on being solved? Does this driver cause issues for you? Let me know in the comments.</p>

      <title>Valve seeing increasing bug reports due to Steam Snap - other methods recommended</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Canonical announced some time ago their Steam Snap which was promoted as <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/ubuntu-2304-is-out-now-with-gnome-44-and-a-stable-steam-snap/" target="_blank">stable with Ubuntu 23.04</a>, as they continue to push their own packaging format with Snap but it seems this has been causing problems for Valve.</p>
<p>Writing on Mastodon, developer Timothee "TTimo" Besset, who works on various things for Valve <a href="https://mastodon.social/@TTimo/111772575146054328" target="_blank">posted</a> asking people to consider using the official Valve .deb package or at least consider using the <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/com.valvesoftware.Steam" target="_blank">Flatpak</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Valve is seeing an increasing number of bug reports for issues caused by Canonical's repackaging of the Steam client through snap.</p>
<p>The best way to install Steam on Debian and derivative operating systems is to follow the instructions at <a href="http://repo.steampowered.com/steam/" target="_blank" title="http://repo.steampowered.com/steam/">http://repo.steampowered.com/steam/</a> and use the official .deb</p>
<p>We are not involved with the snap repackaging. It has a lot of issues.</p>
<p>If you don't want the .deb, please at least consider the flatpak version.</p>
<cite>Timothee "TTimo" Besset</cite></blockquote>
<p>So if you've been having various problems with Steam on Ubuntu (or a derivative like Kubuntu), it may be because you've installed it as a Snap. Worth trying out the official .deb or Flatpak to see if it runs better for you. You can also give Canonical feedback in your issues on their <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/tag/gaming" target="_blank">Discourse Forum</a> and report issues to Valve on <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues" target="_blank">GitHub</a> (if you're using their official packages).</p>
<p><em>Hopefully Canonical can look into any issues.</em></p>

      <title>Against the Storm 1.1 (and later hotfixes) bring various Steam Deck improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Against the Storm is a dark fantasy city builder where you must rebuild civilization in the face of apocalyptic rains, and the recent 1.0 release came with it being Steam Deck Verified but the developer hasn't stopped making improvements for Steam Deck in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1336490/view/5797888151160865057" target="_blank">version 1.1</a> out now.</p>
<p>While version 1.1 did bring some new content like unique portraits for all traders, new decorations, new orders, new sound effects, notifications with auto-pause, UI improvements and more it's nice to see them also focus on Steam Deck too. For the v1.1 update the Steam Deck changes are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Changed the way the trackpad works in the Steam Deck version of the game when using the controller layout. Instead of acting like an analog stick, it now behaves like a real mouse trackpad.</li>
<li>When starting fresh on the Steam Deck, the game will now automatically load the medium graphics preset and have uncapped FPS by default for a smoother experience.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>However, they've also subsequently released a couple of hotfixes with more changes including in v1.1.2:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue with the Enter key not committing changes on the Steam Deck's virtual keyboard.</li>
<li>We temporarily reversed the recent changes to the default Steam Deck controller layout to avoid the cursor issues.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Here they also noted they were aware of an issue "that prevents Steam Deck players from starting a new settlement from the World Map" that they were looking into. Following that, version 1.1.4 was released and further noted these Steam Deck improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where the Right Trigger would stop working when using the trackpad (when playing with the official controller layout).</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the controller pointer would disappear in the embarkation panel and citadel.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Really nice to see the developer, Eremite Games, really pay attention to their Steam Deck support and fix issues as they get found. It's one thing to get Steam Deck Verification from Valve's own testing, it's another to directly support it like this.</p>
<p>Against the Storm is Steam Deck Verified and has a Platinum rating on ProtonDB. It also has an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam and has proven to be very popular.</p>

      <title>NonSteamLaunchers for other stores on Steam Deck adds automatic game shortcuts</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NonSteamLaunchers is an application <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/get-battlenet-ea-epic-games-and-more-on-steam-deck-the-easy-way/" target="_blank">I showed off a while ago</a>, that gives you a helping hand in installing other game stores and launchers on Steam Deck. The latest update, version 3.2, adds in some really useful helpful features.</p>
<p>There's a lot of stores and streaming services supported including Amazon Games, Battle.net, EA App, Epic Games, GOG Galaxy, Rockstar, Ubisoft, Minecraft and more.</p>
<p>In the latest update they added a feature to the app the automatically scans and adds your games installed via Epic Games and Ubisoft Connect, with more services planned to be supported on that soon. All you need to do is install a game via one of them, and then you can restart Steam to have them be picked up. They also added in proper artwork for launchers, games and supported streaming services so it all looks neat and tidy.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12094501301705502113gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12094501301705502113gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>They also said it should hopefully now support multiple Steam accounts, they fixed up the SD Card path for the SteamOS 3.5 update, plus various other small fixes and improvements.</p>
<p>Overall it sounds like a great update.</p>

      <title>THE FINALS big 1.5.0 update out with new mode - continues working on Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/the-finals-now-appears-to-work-on-steam-deck-and-desktop-linux/" target="_blank">I recently reported on THE FINALS</a> now working on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux, and it seems even with the latest major update just released with version 1.5.0 bringing a new game mode it continues working.</p>
<p>With it using Easy Anti-Cheat, it's still quite a surprise to see it actually working. Especially since there's been no official word from the developer, and they have not replied to my previous email about it. Easy Anti-Cheat does support Linux both Native Linux and Windows games in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a>, but developers need to enable it manually — so it seems they have. But it's still odd not to see any official word on it around 5 days later.</p>

<p>On Linux Desktop / Steam Deck, just ensure you've set it to Proton Experimental in the Properties -&gt; Compatibility menu in your Steam Library to have it work. There's some issues though like with voice chat (turn it off) and certain graphical options that may cause crashes - but for me it's been smooth sailing.</p>
<p>One issue that has come up is if your CPU support AVX512, you will need to add "clearcpuid=304" to your GRUB boot menu (thanks <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/194yurj/comment/khkscq3/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank">Reddit</a>).</p>
<p>Version 1.5.0 brings with it a new limited-time solo mode "Solo Bank It":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today we are introducing our very first limited-time mode (LTM): Solo Bank It!<br/>
This experimental twist on Bank It pits contestants against each other in a fight for individual glory in a 12-player arena. Just like Bank It, the first to amass 40,000 and deposit in the cash-out station wins. Solo queuers, rejoice!</p>

      <title>PlayStation Remote Play app for Steam Deck &#39;chiaki4deck&#39; can now put the system to sleep</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just recently the open source PlayStation Remote Play app for Steam Deck, chiaki4deck, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/open-source-playstation-remote-play-app-for-steam-deck-chiaki4deck-gets-a-big-upgrade/" target="_blank">got a big update</a> but it came with a few issues that needed solving and a new v1.6.1 is out now. Plus a fun new feature was added.</p>
<p>This is a great app for those of you who have either a PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5 and a Steam Deck, especially when you want to continue gaming but someone else wants the TV it's connected to. This is actually a fork of the original Chiaki, with enhancements to make it work better directly on the Steam Deck along with better documentation.</p>
<p>New features and fixes in v1.6.1:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixes console registration.</li>
<li>Fixes fullscreen double-click and F11 shortcuts.</li>
<li>Don't close main window when closing stream session on MacOS.</li>
<li>Adds option to sleep PlayStation when sleeping Steam Deck.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Ubisoft think gamers need to get comfortable with not owning games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-new-ubisoft-and-getting-gamers-comfortable-with-not-owning-their-games" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a> recently spoke to Ubisoft, and something said during the interview seems to have created some sparks across the industry about game ownership.</p>
<p>What was said is not all that surprising really. Ubisoft, like multiple others, run subscription services with theirs being Ubisoft+ that just had a bit of a change into multiple tiers. These services are everywhere now like Xbox Game Pass, EA Play and others. That, and GI.biz spoke to Philippe Tremblay, director of subscriptions at Ubisoft so obviously they're going to be somewhat biased on what they think — it's their job.</p>
<p>From the interview, the bit in question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the things we saw is that gamers are used to, a little bit like DVD, having and owning their games. That's the consumer shift that needs to happen. They got comfortable not owning their CD collection or DVD collection. That's a transformation that's been a bit slower to happen [in games]. As gamers grow comfortable in that aspect… you don't lose your progress. If you resume your game at another time, your progress file is still there. That's not been deleted. You don't lose what you've built in the game or your engagement with the game. So it's about feeling comfortable with not owning your game.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The GOG team certainly took notice, <a href="https://twitter.com/GOGcom/status/1747335663995818251" target="_blank">mentioning</a> on X (formerly Twitter): "You should feel extremely comfortable with owning your games on GOG (they're DRM-free) :)".</em></p>
<p>It's worth noting that clearly it's going well for Ubisoft, as Tremblay mentioned October 2023 was their biggest month in Ubisoft+ history. So people are clearly buying into game subscriptions more and more. And related, Microsoft said back in 2022 that Xbox Game Pass had 25 million subscribers. Subscriptions are clearly here to stay.</p>
<p>Also worth noting, to be clear, Ubisoft don't plan to force you into one way or another noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The point is not to force users to go down one route or another," he explains. "We offer purchase, we offer subscription, and it's the gamer's preference that is important here. We are seeing some people who buy choosing to subscribe now, but it all works."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given how services can just entirely remove your paid-for content, this whole issue of ownership is a concerning one. Like how Sony were going to just remove previously purchased Discovery content from users, although they've since <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/legal/psvideocontent/" target="_blank">backtracked</a> on that after public outcry.</p>
<p>The thing is, you have to remember, you don't actually own your games on Steam either. This has been well-known for a long time now. As per Steam's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/" target="_blank">Subscriber Agreement</a> under the "A. General Content and Services License" section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] The Content and Services are licensed, not sold. Your license confers no title or ownership in the Content and Services. To make use of the Content and Services, you must have a Steam Account and you may be required to be running the Steam client and maintaining a connection to the Internet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll admit, it's not <em>entirely</em> the same. Valve won't take away your games if you don't pay them every month, it's not a subscription in the same way, and plenty of games on Steam are actually <em>entirely</em> DRM-free and can be run outside of Steam. But still, it's something to remember, ownership has been on the decline for a long time.</p>
<p>A lot of it simply comes down to convenience though right? Plenty of us pay for Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime and so on and so on — so we can just quickly jump into a show or a movie they have available. But then the problem there is, again, everyone wants their own service. There's more popping up all the time, and rights on various shows end up split between them and you end up paying more and more (look at <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/animation/where-to-watch-pokemon-episodes-movies" target="_blank">the mess</a> of Pokémon streaming) and never owning a damn thing.</p>
<p>Over to you in the comments: what are your thoughts? </p>

      <title>Wine 9.0 brings much improved Windows app and game compatibility to Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's here! The official release of Wine 9.0 has now been made available, bringing the next-generation of Windows compatibility to Linux for apps and games. This is the tech that forms a major part of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a>.</p>
<p>This release has been a year in the making, with a new stable Wine release done once a year with many development releases in between bringing over 7,000 individual changes. There's some truly big stuff in this release too and some of the highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>An experimental Wayland graphics driver, not enabled by default yet.</li>
<li>Lots of WoW64 work including the completion of converting modules to PE format to "introduce a proper boundary between the Windows and Unix worlds". They say it's now possible to run 32-bit Windows applications on a purely 64-bit Unix installation but this new WoW64 mode is not yet enabled by default.</li>
<li>The completion of the PE/Unix separation means that it's possible to run existing Windows binaries on ARM64.</li>
<li>The Vulkan driver supports up to version 1.3.272 of the Vulkan spec.</li>
<li>Various optimizations have been made to core WineD3D and the Vulkan backend.</li>
<li>A number of GdiPlus functions are optimized for better graphics performance.</li>
<li>The Windows Media Video (WMV) decoder DirectX Media Object (DMO) is implemented.</li>
<li>DirectInput action maps are implemented, improving compatibility with many old games that use this to map controller inputs to in-game actions.</li>
<li>URL/URI protocol associations are exported as URL handlers to the Linux desktop.</li>
<li>Lots of Internationalization improvements including updates for Unicode and better support for native Windows IME implementations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The list goes on for a while, that's just some cherry-picked big additions.</p>
<p>As a result of all the changes many more applications and games designed for Windows will now run on Linux (and other platforms where Wine can run).</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/releases/wine-9.0" target="_blank">full release notes</a> for all the changes.</p>

      <title>Prison Architect 2 announced from Paradox Interactive and Double Eleven</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As soon as I saw a Prison Architect teaser recently, I knew this was about to come! Prison Architect 2 has now been formally announced from Paradox Interactive with Double Eleven on developer duty.</p>
<p>This was expected anyway, since <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/01/paradox-interactive-have-purchased-the-rights-to-prison-architect-from-introversion/" target="_blank">Paradox purchased the rights to Prison Architect</a> back in early 2019, and then in March 2023 <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/prison-architect-has-a-final-free-update-out-now/" target="_blank">the original had its final upgrade</a>. So of course Paradox weren't going to sit on it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LiymA3jw0fQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5dc737c78cfd0d25e41c759b22357956.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LiymA3jw0fQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>The World’s Greatest Prison Simulation Game - Now in 3D! </strong>Use your resources to build, manage, and control your prison in classic Prison Architect playstyle—now in 3 glorious dimensions! Design every corner of your prison and manage everything from daily schedules to policies, and ensure your prison is safe, self-sustaining, and secure.</li>
<li><strong>Build the Ultimate Penitentiary: </strong>Establish all of your prison infrastructure over multiple floors, and use tons of snazzy new tools that allow you to build a state-of-the-art correctional facility. The design of your prison will affect every aspect of your inmates’ lives, so make your schemes accordingly!</li>
<li><strong>The Smartest Inmates Ever: </strong>Unique inmates have schemes of their own – they now form distinct relationships that influence behavior, make decisions based on wants and needs, and plot their paths better than ever. Watch as they interact and attempt to navigate the daily trials of your prison. Remember that every choice you make might either help or hinder your inmates' correctional journey. What type of relationships will your inmates have with your prison?</li>
<li><strong>The Prison Magnate: </strong>Establish and run a true institution from the top, building up unique correctional facilities in a freshly upgraded Career Mode that will take you across a brand new world map. Will your prisons end up being monuments to rehabilitation or retribution? Most importantly, will they pay the bills?</li>
<li><strong>Every Action has a Reaction: </strong>Choices matter and yours will determine the fate of your prison. More control than ever—over inmates, prison policies, architecture and more—means more ways for things to go well… or not! Plan carefully or you may have to cope with escapes, gang wars, and all sorts of expensive and destructive problems.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From the press release: “In Prison Architect 2, our team set out to create the next level in management gameplay. A greater degree of player freedom, impactful choices, and inmate simulation come together to provide an enhanced presentation of prison management, in a 3D world. Much loved features make a return to help you manage your inmates, quell riots, prevent escapes and share your prisons, but now cross-platform! In addition to a new upgrade system, a new Career Mode, and more.” said Gareth Wright, Game Director at Double Eleven. “We look forward to seeing how players get creative with multiple floors and catwalks to finally construct and expand in 3D. And then optimize and balance their prison’s safety, security and self-betterment.”</p>
<p>Currently, it seems much like Cities: Skylines 2 that Paradox also publishes, that the Native Linux and macOS support has been dropped. I've reached out to Paradox PR to clarify. Hopefully (and quite likely) it will run with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a>, and if not, no doubt future Proton updates could get it running like we've seen with the tens of thousands of games that run on desktop Linux and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>It's due out on March 26th.</p>
<p>You can follow / pre-order on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1257610/Prison_Architect_2/" target="_blank">Steam</a> for $39.99 / £34.99 / €39.99.</p>

      <title>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl releases September 5th, 2024</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GSC Game World announced that S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl has moved from its Q1 2024 release plan, to have a final release date of September 5th, 2024. While we don't know yet how it will run on Steam Deck or desktop Linux with Proton, it's likely to be one of the most popular releases on PC this year so it's worth keeping an eye on.</p>
<p>Speaking about the delay, GSC said "While there is absolutely no way to make another delay sound less dim, we decided to be clear about our reasons to postpone the game for the sake of yet another wave of polishing". Continuing they mentioned showing it off at Gamescom 2023 to a small set of people, but it showed the game needed more time in the oven for technical issues to be solved.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6o6D_a3PAHw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0d7468dd999d2555e011eebbbf571c9d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6o6D_a3PAHw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can also see their previous trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="XNGbS0fY80s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/04af652b1c31e25e03abed950ef42f86.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/XNGbS0fY80s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl is available for pre-order via:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/stalker_2_heart_of_chornobyl_standard_edition" target="_blank">GOG</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a></p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/" target="_blank">Steam</a> </p>
<p>So if you've not played the originals, you've now got a bit of extra time to jump into them and they all work on Linux desktop with Proton. Some work okay on Steam Deck too. Although, for Call of Pripyat, you may get a better experience with OpenXRay.</p>
<p>It's worth noting also that recently the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/stalker-game-engine-openxray-gets-taken-down-on-github/" target="_blank">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game engine OpenXRay got taken down on GitHub</a>, but it was later reinstated since the DMCA was fraudulent and GSC actually gave it their blessing. Nice to see another company look after their players and understand projects like that are actually good for their older games.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you have a system you wish to try out Linux on for gaming be it an Apple Mac, a PC with Windows or anything else - perhaps give winesapOS a little try as you might find this SteamOS-like distribution to your liking. It offers up a portable solution with persistent storage, so you can load it up on a USB drive and take it anywhere</p>

<li>Instead of extracting 3 to 7 parts of a split-up zip file (due to GitHub Release hosting constraints), we now provide a single zip file for each image type. This has been the biggest complaint that they finally addressed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A Recovery console to help you fix boot problems.</li>
<li>+ much more in the <a href="https://github.com/LukeShortCloud/winesapOS/releases/tag/3.4.0" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</li>

      <title>Framework email customers for data breach from accounting partner getting phished</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>No one is safe from data breaches, and at times it won't even be the company you've directly interacted and purchased from but their partners, like what recently happened to Framework. <em>Framework are the company that make the modular Framework laptop, which is really cool!</em></p>
<p>From what I can tell, Framework have not announced this in public but sent it in an email to affected customers which one decided to copy and paste on to the Framework Forum <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/framework-data-breach/43408" target="_blank">in a post</a>.</p>
<p>The email notes how their accounting partner, Keating Consulting, had a staff member fall victim to a "phishing email that utilized social engineering tactics to obtain customer PII (Personal Identifiable Information) associated with outstanding balances for Framework purchases" and anyone getting the email was affected by it. For those hit their full name, email address and balance owed would have been gained by the attackers.</p>
<p>Framework said about the list that it was "primarily of a subset of open pre-orders, but some completed past orders with pending accounting syncs were also included in this list".</p>
<p>One thing that has confused multiple people, is that even people who <em>don't</em> have an outstanding balance were emailed, which was cleared up in a <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/framework-data-breach/43408/5" target="_blank">later post</a> by a moderator forwarding information from the Framework team. There may not be a customer-facing balance, but their system may have a slight difference due to changes in taxes since an order.</p>
<p>It's just another reminder to be seriously careful on clicking links to ensure they really go to where they say, especially in emails, and not entering any information into a form you're not 100% sure on. It can happen to anyone. Always check the full URL.</p>

<hr/>
<p>Something else interesting for you: the Steam Deck has been in Steam's global Top 5 sellers (based on revenue) for the last 10 weeks in a row now. Of those 10 weeks it's spent 6 of them as number 1! While we don't know exact numbers, since Valve don't give any out, it's nice to see it continue to do so well.</p>
<p>What have you been playing recently on Steam Deck or Linux Desktop? What are your latest recommendations that people pick up and play?</p>

      <title>X.Org and Xwayland get new releases due to security issues</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's another reminder that checking regularly for updates is always a good thing, because there's new releases available for both the X.Org X and Xwayland due to multiple reported security issues.</p>
<p>First up, here's the actual listed issues reported and fixed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>CVE-2023-6816 can be triggered by passing an invalid array index to DeviceFocusEvent or ProcXIQueryPointer.</li>
<li>CVE-2024-0229 can be triggered if a device has both a button and a key class and zero buttons.</li>
<li>CVE-2024-21885 can be triggered if a device with a given ID was removed and a new device with the same ID added both in the same operation.</li>
<li>CVE-2024-21886 can be triggered by disabling a master device with disabled slave devices.</li>
<li>CVE-2024-0409 can be triggered by enabling SELinux xserver_object_manager and running a client.</li>
<li>CVE-2024-0408 can be triggered by enabling SELinux xserver_object_manager and creating a GLX PBuffer.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This security advisory went public on the X.Org <a href="https://lists.x.org/archives/xorg/2024-January/061525.html" target="_blank">mailing list</a> this morning.</p>
<p>The issues are present in X.Org X server prior to 21.1.11 and Xwayland prior to 23.2.4, both of which were just announced and released. The <a href="https://lists.x.org/archives/xorg/2024-January/061526.html" target="_blank">xorg-server 21.1.11</a> release additionally "also contains a fix for XRandR to allow for multiple virtual monitors on a physical display" plus <a href="https://lists.x.org/archives/xorg/2024-January/061527.html" target="_blank">xwayland 23.2.4</a> additionally "also contains several other fixes for glamor, libEI support, and FreeBSD".</p>

      <title>Open source re-implementation of Tomb Raider 1 (1996) TR1X gets a big bug-fix release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After adding in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/open-source-re-implementation-of-tomb-raider-1-tr1x-gets-linux-builds/" target="_blank">Linux support in the 3.0 release</a>, the Open source re-implementation of Tomb Raider 1 (1996) project TR1X has a fresh release out with lots of bug fixes.</p>
<p>Offering a huge amount of improvements over the original game from UI improvements to modern adjustments of the gameplay mechanics to feel better, no doubt this is currently the best way to play through the original Tomb Raider. Well, at least until the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/tomb-raider-i-iii-remastered-heads-to-steam-from-aspyr/" target="_blank">remasters of Tomb Raider 1-3 release next month</a>, although we've seen before many remasters aren't particularly great.</p>
