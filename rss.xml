      <title>MSI teasing a handheld gaming PC like the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Begun, the handheld wars have. It seems like every company now wants a piece of the pie doesn't it? Even MSI appear to be jumping into the fold now with an announcement due at CES 2024.</p>
<p>We don't exactly have much to go on right now, other than the teaser they posted up on their <a href="http://www.instagram.com/p/C1rM-oos8JQ/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> page and on <a href="https://twitter.com/msigaming/status/1742856060581331345" target="_blank">X</a> noting "A whole new breed of MSI dragon is coming.⁠ Get a grip and stay tuned.⁠"</p>
<p>Here's some quick stills from their teaser video:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15055753111704389528gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15055753111704389528gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8726892731704389528gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/8726892731704389528gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3615467281704389527gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3615467281704389527gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>No doubt it will be another handheld running Windows though instead of Linux, but it's not like that has stopped people! Linux support for the ROG Ally, the Lenovo Legion Go, plus various units from GPD and AYANEO have been improving pretty quickly with <a href="https://chimeraos.org" target="_blank">ChimeraOS</a> being one of the best options.</p>
<p>It's always good to have options! Naturally I'll be sticking to the Steam Deck OLED since it's the most supported available with Linux out of the box.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: as a small addition, it seems this may be Intel powered given the <a href="https://twitter.com/IntelGaming/status/1742984222821024148" target="_blank">reply</a> on social media site X from the official Intel Gaming account with three thinking emoji. Obviously not a lot to go on, but why else would they reply like that?</p>

      <title>Mobile Suit Baba combines Baba Is You puzzling with Into the Breach strategy</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Indie developer Hempuli Oy has released a follow-up to their incredible puzzle game Baba Is You, this time taking the idea of Into the Breach from Subset Games and putting a new spin on it with Baba Is You word rules. The developer doesn't shy away from the inspiration and clearly states it too.</p>
<p>Here you get the small tiled arenas where you have to complete objectives, but you also have the various word blocks like "Hill Is Stop" that you can push around to change the rules of the level to complete the objectives. A fun idea and it does work quite well!</p>
<p>More: "A mysterious force is out to steal all the Fruit! Help Baba &amp; friends foil their plans by maneuvering gigantic mech suits around. Features tactical puzzling action, heart-wrenching storytelling and extra challenges over a total of 43 missions."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cIaCjtWsaQI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8b2c59c7685f5ce782ec3771289477a3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cIaCjtWsaQI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>If you love a blending of puzzles with turn-based strategy, this is one you'll probably enjoy. This isn't the only spin-off from Baba Is You as there's also <a href="https://hempuli.itch.io/baba-is-you-xtreme" target="_blank">Baba Is You XTREME</a> and <a href="https://hempuli.itch.io/baba-files-taxes" target="_blank">Baba Files Taxes</a> but this is so far the best of the bunch.</p>
<p>Available for <a href="https://hempuli.itch.io/mobile-suit-baba" target="_blank">$4 on itch.io</a>. There's no Linux version like with Baba Is You but my testing showed it working great with the latest Wine 9.0 RC 3.</p>

      <title>Bodycam horror shooter Chasmal Fear looks like a riot</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>MystiveDev emailed in about Chasmal Fear, an upcoming horror shooter you play as if you're viewing it from a bodycam set in an underwater facility.</p>
<p>More about it: "Chasmal Fear is a first-person tactical shooter survival horror game that puts players in a mysteriously empty sci-fi underwater facility where something has gone terribly wrong. Ammo is scarce. The odds are stacked against you. Choose wisely between fighting or sneaking past the monstrosities which once killed might mutate into something even worse. Unlock hidden areas and solve puzzles to uncover the truth of what happened in this top-secret facility. Every decision will impact your gameplay experience, some swarming relentless monsters against you while others offering the chance to employ stealth and cunning to survive."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Bq3RG8mcLZ8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ccd363ba52e8274f6cb8553755c11e34.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Bq3RG8mcLZ8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>When queried about Steam Deck and Linux support the developer mentioned: "Currently, the game is built for Windows, but we're aiming to make it playable both on Mac and Linux before full release."</p>
<p>Main Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>LIMITED RESOURCES - Limited player ammo and scarce ammo boxes will encourage players to think strategically and be cautious while traversing the abandoned steel hallways.</li>
<li>IMMERSIVE BODYCAM - Artistic direction that utilizes the perspective of a bodycam footage. Set in the near future, players are also equipped with an AR Interface to help you through the dark hallways of the Magnus Facility.</li>
<li>MONSTER MUTATION SYSTEM - Some monsters will randomly start to mutate when killed into a stronger form. Do not be surprised when you encounter more dangerous foes in an area you thought you cleaned out. Make sure to end them before the mutation starts.</li>
<li>CHOICES AFFECT YOUR PLAYTHROUGH - Your choices will affect your gameplay experience. Choosing to open one way will close other paths to your next goal. Depending on your choice, you can dive guns blazing or sneak stealthily above a swarm of enemies; hide in the shadows or use your environment to squash the monstrosities.</li>
<li>FULLY RANDOMIZED EVENTS - Randomized events occurring throughout the game that provide replayability from varying sounds, crumbling ceilings, floors and unexpected scares.</li>
<li>ULTRA-REALISTIC ENVIRONMENTS - Ultra-realistic, sci-fi underwater station built underneath the waves and inside a massive ocean cliff. Its hallways seem abandoned. It is up to you to find your way out and survive the things that lurk within.</li>
<li>CO-OP POSSIBILITY - Bring a friend to Chasmal Fear and survive this nightmare together. The difficulty changes procedurally based on whether you play singleplayer or multiplayer co-op.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Looks pretty great so one to keep an eye on!</p>

      <title>dotAGE now Steam Deck Verified and sold over 30K copies</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Showing that the indie dream for some is alive and well, the merciless survival roguelite turn-based city builder dotAGE has managed to sell over 30,000 copies in three months. It's also now Steam Deck Verified!</p>
<p>The solo developer of the game, Michele Pirovano, announced the sales milestone on <a href="https://twitter.com/dotagegame/status/1741048989334814907" target="_blank">X</a> (formerly Twitter) noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the end of the year in sight, I am very happy to announce that dotAGE has now sold more than 30k copies on Steam! This is an indie dream made real! Not even in my wildest dreams I would have thought of reaching such a milestone!! Thank you so much for all your support!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Considering that last year we saw over 14,000 games released (the most ever in one year for Steam), it goes to show that a good game can sell well even with insane competition from developers of all sizes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17042007891704378750gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17042007891704378750gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The other good news is that as of January 3rd, the game has been Steam Deck Verified by Valve! dotAGE has Native Linux support too and there's even a demo.</p>
<p>You can buy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/638510/dotAGE/" target="_blank">dotAGE on Steam</a>. The developer previously sent over a copy, and I fully recommend grabbing a copy — it's great and easily one of my highlights of 2023.</p>

      <title>Linux Mint planning an upgraded EDGE ISO with kernel 6.5</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For people wanting to install Linux Mint on newer devices, the Linux Mint team have announced a plan to update their EDGE ISOs with a later Linux kernel in the latest <a href="https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=4619" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>The blog post goes over recent funding, of which December 2023 was a high-point and the most they've seen donated to the project all year at $24,146 USD but still just below last year's level.</p>
<p>Giving an update on the status of the upcoming Linux Mint 21.3 release, the Beta phase sounds like it's going well with 50 bug reports being sent in and 35 of them already closed. Linux Mint Debian Edition 6 will also be getting all the improvements from the main Linux Mint 21.3 release.</p>
<p>For the 21.3 EDGE ISO, which they provide for people who have issues booting systems with their main downloads, they will be releasing a 21.3 EDGE ISO with Linux kernel 6.5 as they said "During BETA testing we identified compatibility issues between Linux Mint and new hardware devices (recent AMD graphics but also wireless chipsets and SSD controllers used in Acer laptops). These are solved by upgrading the kernel series from 5.15 to 6.5.".</p>
<p>Since they go by what kernels Ubuntu officially provide, since Mint is based on Ubuntu, they're stuck with whatever the latest Ubuntu provides since Mint don't package up their own kernels.</p>

      <title>Marvel&#39;s Midnight Suns and Two Point Campus headline Humble Choice for January 2024</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://humblebundle.com/choice?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Choice for January 2024</a> is a pretty damn good selection of games, so here's a run over what's included and the compatibility for Linux desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>This is the monthly bundle that you can subscribe to allowing you to claim all of the games included each month with a fresh set, and it also gives you a Humble Store discount (bigger discount up to 20% if you stay subscribed to it for longer).

<p>What have you been playing recently on either Steam Deck or desktop Linux?</p>
<p>I am currently going through the original Alan Wake (I have zero idea what's going on…), and after that I plan to finally do a proper Fallout 4 play-through. I decided to actually start going through some of my own library to play through games collecting dust and the Steam Deck is just magic for that.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma 6 hits initial funding goal</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The KDE team are currently running a <a href="https://kde.org/fundraisers/plasma6member/" target="_blank">funding campaign</a> to help bring in more monies to support Plasma desktop development, and thankfully well ahead of the Plasma 6 release they've managed to hit the initial goal.</p>
<p>With the first two goals of getting 550 paying members hit, they've managed to pull in a good amount of funding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks to your generosity, we now have the funds to take on the launch of Plasma 6 and all the challenges that come with it, as well as count on enough funds to commission artwork and designs from professional artists, ensuring new and beautiful wallpapers, websites, logos, and icons for Plasma 6's first year of life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, they're hoping to add another 100 members as their stretch-goal on their funding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our second stretch goal aims to add 100 more members and give us the means to fund the upkeep of all the infrastructure and resources for developers and external communications. This covers a wide range of things, from paying the rent for the servers used for development and internal communication among community members, to designing and maintaining public websites, forums, communication with the media, creating merchandise, promotion at non-FLOSS events, and more. Our deadline for this second stretch goal is the launch date of Plasma 6 on February 28, 2024.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18395821891704289040gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18395821891704289040gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>A reminder on the rest of the Plasma 6 roadmap:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 January 2024: Release Candidate 1</li>
<li>31 January 2024: Release Candidate 2</li>
<li>21 February 2024: Private Tarball Release</li>
<li>28 February 2024: Public Release</li>

      <title>Linux hits nearly 4% desktop user share on Statcounter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>According to Statcounter, which should be taken with a pinch of salt of course like any sampling, the Linux share on the desktop hit nearly 4% in December 2023. Last month was a record too and a clear trend over time, as going back a couple of years, it was rarely coming close to 2% but now it's repeatedly nearing 4% so it's quite a good sign overall.</p>
<p>The latest from Statcounter shows for all of 2023 below:</p>
<ul>
<li>January - 2.91%</li>
<li>February - 2.94%</li>
<li>March - 2.85%</li>
<li>April - 2.83%</li>
<li>May - 2.7%</li>
<li>June - 3.07%</li>
<li>July - 3.12%</li>
<li>August - 3.18%</li>
<li>September - 3.02%</li>
<li>October - 2.92%</li>
<li>November - 3.22%</li>
<li><strong>December - 3.82%</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at December it shows Windows rising too, with macOS dropping down. If we actually take ChromeOS directly into the Linux numbers for December 2023 the overall number would actually be 6.24% (ChromeOS is Linux after all).</p>
<p>Here's how just Linux looks over time on Statcounter since early 2009 until now:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/996456521704281563gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/996456521704281563gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Seems like a pretty clear trend over time don't you think? Nice to see this happening elsewhere, just like we've seen over years <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/linux-use-on-steam-ends-2023-with-a-multi-year-high-thanks-steam-deck/" target="_blank">with the Steam Survey</a>.</p>

      <title>The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall remake Daggerfall Unity 1.0 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another really impressive project that just got a big final release is The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall game engine remake Daggerfall Unity which has hit the 1.0 meaning it's now complete!</p>
<p>With it you get the classic Daggerfall experience plus many enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cross-platform without emulation (Windows/Linux/Mac).</li>
<li>Retro graphics are boosted by modern engine and lighting.</li>
<li>High resolution widescreen with classic style.</li>
<li>Optionally play in retro mode 320×200 or 640×400 with VGA palettes.</li>
<li>Optionally overhaul the graphics and gameplay with mods.</li>
<li>Huge draw distances even without mods.</li>
<li>Smooth first-person controls.</li>
<li>Quality of life enhancements.</li>
<li>Extensive mod support with an active creator community.</li>
<li>Translation support via community mods.</li>
</ul>
<p>It does require a copy of the original DOS Daggerfall to run as that provides all necessary game assets such as textures, 3D models, and sound effects. Thankfully it's a free game nowadays, so you can just pinch it from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812390/The_Elder_Scrolls_II_Daggerfall/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Lots of good mods available for it too like <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/daggerfallunity/mods/5" target="_blank">DREAM</a> that remasters all the game assets including sound, music, videos &amp; all graphics found in the game making it just that little bit more modern:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6404153901704280256gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6404153901704280256gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><em>Note: while the code is open source it does still require the proprietary Unity game engine.</em></p>

      <title>Linux use on Steam ends 2023 with a multi-year high (thanks Steam Deck)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve's latest Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey is out now for December 2023, and it shows that Linux and Steam Deck overall finished 2023 on a very positive note.</p>
<p>Something I continue showing over time on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">our Steam Tracker</a>, we can see that December 2023 is the highest it's been in multiple years. Only <em>just</em> beating the previous high of July 2023 by 0.01%! This is all largely thanks to Valve's Steam Deck that ships with SteamOS Linux, and Proton that continues to help tens of thousands of games be playable on Linux systems.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9032671351704217237gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9032671351704217237gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Here's the December 2023 overall operating system results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 96.40% -0.16%</li>
<li>Linux 1.97% +0.06%</li>
<li>OSX 1.63% +0.10%</li>
</ul>
<p>And just on the Linux side the most popular Linux distributions for gaming on Steam are:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit (Steam Deck) 40.53% -2.46%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 7.85% +0.04%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS 64 bit 7.04% +0.37%</li>
<li>Freedesktop SDK 23.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 5.22% +5.22%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 21.2 64 bit 4.70% +0.45%</li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 3.64% -0.15%</li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 3.03% +0.35%</li>
<li>Other 27.99% +1.51%</li>
</ul>
<p>It's worth noting that the Steam Deck has been a top seller over the last few weeks too. For the week starting Tuesday, November 14th it went back to 1st place globally on Steam (in supported regions obviously) and remained number 1 until Tuesday, December 19th where it dropped to 2nd place and has remained 2nd the following week up until today. So clearly Valve are still shifting plenty of units.</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s the most played Steam Deck games of 2023</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released the annual Best of lists, and so we can see what the most played games are across the whole of 2023 for the Steam Deck so here's what's up.</p>
<p>Measured by Daily Active Players across Platinum: 1st - 12th, Gold: 13th - 24th and  Silver: 25th - 50th these are the most popular games on Steam Deck overall for 2023. However, Valve said they're only including games in the list that have a Deck Verified status of Verified or Playable. Additionally, each list is also randomly sorted, unlike their usual monthly shout-outs which are from highest to lowest.</p>

      <title>Heroes of Might and Magic II game engine fheroes2 v1.0.11 released</title>
      <author>fheroes2</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dear <strong>fheroes2</strong> project supporters and Heroes of Might and Magic II fans!</p>
<p>The team is pleased to present the new version of the fheroes2 engine - <strong><a href="https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2/releases/tag/1.0.11" target="_blank">1.0.11</a></strong> after a month of hard work. As in any other release, we made many changes and are happy to share the news with you.</p>
<p>The "<em><strong>Battle Only</strong></em>" mode has undergone a substantial revamp, boasting an improved user interface and a newfound capability to <strong>save the state of selections</strong> within the dialog. These enhancements promise a more immersive and user-friendly experience for players engaging in battle-centric gameplay.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11754215341703710487gol573.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11754215341703710487gol573.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Continuing our commitment to refining the gaming experience, the <em><strong>AI</strong></em> has received a notable upgrade. The AI makes better decisions during battles while defending its troops.</p>
<p>The work on the <em><strong>Editor</strong></em> continues. The team added <strong>a base file format</strong> for future maps, which will incorporate a greater number of features compared to the original map format.<br/>
Additionally, the Editor has been expanded with <strong>Castle and Town placement logic</strong>, along with the inclusion of <strong>Ocean objects</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4430979271703710487gol573.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4430979271703710487gol573.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>The majority of the work focused on modifying the code for the Editor and preparing the game to support the upcoming map format.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8104803321703710486gol573.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8104803321703710486gol573.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>In this release, the team also polished multiple places in the <em><strong>UI</strong></em>, such as difficulty selection in campaigns, Tree of Knowledge quick info dialog, making AI heroes' animations depend on their speed, and many more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8458767291703710485gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8458767291703710485gol573.png"/></a></p>
<p>Overall, <strong>more than 30 issues</strong> have been fixed in this release, and many translations have been updated.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your invaluable support, and we hope you will enjoy this release!<br/>

      <title>Festive Co-Op Games</title>
      <author>scaine</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p style="text-align:left">Hopefully, like me, you’ll have booked in a bit of premium gaming time around the festive period. And coincidentally, Valve’s Winter Steam Sale kicked off just a couple of days before Christmas. Since so many of us and our friends are off, this marks the perfect time of year to dip your toe into the wonderful world of co-operative games. I have two friends I game with pretty regularly, and as a result, I was surprised to see that my game collection boasts a pretty staggering number of “best played with friends” titles. So I thought I’d share the love, albeit with apologies that the vast bulk of these titles are both Steam-only and non-native.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">The only thing I’m going to exclude from this little round up is MMOs. While they often have compelling co-op elements, I’m just not comfortable recommending any of those, given how long I’ve been out of the MMO scene.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">I’m also going to focus on “Online Co-Op”, although some of these titles also support split-screen local and Steam Remote Play Together options.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<h4 style="text-align:left"><big><strong>Well Known Titles</strong></big></h4>
<p style="text-align:left">Let’s start with some of the better known options. There are honestly too many big names to list, so lets put aside some of the more obvious ones like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/548430/Deep_Rock_Galactic/" target="_blank">Deep Rock Galactic</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/Terraria/" target="_blank">Terraria</a>, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2344520/Diablo_IV/" target="_blank">Diablo</a> series, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/218620/PAYDAY_2/" target="_blank">Payday 2</a>/<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1272080/PAYDAY_3/" target="_blank">3</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/" target="_blank">Team Fortress 2</a> and so on, and focus on the quirkier options.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong><em>Overcooked 2</em></strong> (<s>Proton</s> Native!)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Pure chaos in even just two player mode, this game supports up to four players at once, as you battle to fulfil food orders by chopping ingredients, steaming, frying and boiling, then plating up and serving, then cleaning, all across increasing inventive, often-changing levels. It sounds simple, it starts simple, but over time, the complexity ramps up resulting in an odd combination of pure frustration and chaotic fun. Find it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/728880/Overcooked_2/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong><em>Spelunky 2</em></strong> (Proton)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">The original Spelunky is ten years old now and featured local co-op, but when developer Mossmouth released its sequel in 2020, it had online co-op baked in. Up to four players in a rich, procedurally-generated set of challenging biomes. The opportunity for absolute chaos through emergent gameplay makes this one a co-op gem. Available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/418530/Spelunky_2/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. The <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/spelunky" target="_blank">original is also on GOG</a>, but the follow up never made it.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong><em>Hammerwatch 2</em></strong> (Proton)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">While the original Hammerwatch is still playable and sports a native version, the follow up is a considerable step up in graphics, albeit Windows-only. The combat in this sequel feels much more satisfying and polished, and the game world hints at a much greater depth too. I've not played long yet, but I'm looking forward to more. Only on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1538970/Hammerwatch_II/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, although the original game is available on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/hammerwatch" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong><em>Remnant: From the Ashes</em></strong> (Proton)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">A unique FPS, Remnant combines weak-spot shooting with a souls-like dodge-roll mechanic tied to a stamina-gauge and a diverse set of RPG upgrades. Runs are randomised and you could complete the game without unlocking/finding all the weapons on offer, nor the various magical upgrades you can apply to each. Remnant is on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/617290/Remnant_From_the_Ashes/" target="_blank">Steam</a> only. If you enjoy this one, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1282100/Remnant_II/" target="_blank">its sequel</a> is only a few months old.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10037898301703625657gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10037898301703625657gol573.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong><em>Warhammer 40000: Darktide</em></strong> (Proton)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Developer Fatshark never did get EAC to work reliably in its earlier title, Vermintude 2, so I didn’t have high hopes for Darktide. However, not only is it perfectly playable (including hosting/joining multiplayer), I’m enjoying this far more than I did the fantasy setting of the earlier Vermintude games. Fight for the Emperor as one of four extremely customisable characters classes in multiple L4D2-like mission-based scenarios. If you can look past the obnoxious monetisation model, this is worth a look. It really does a great job of delivering the Warhammer 40K atmosphere with excellent voice acting and brilliantly realised environments. Only on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1361210/Warhammer_40000_Darktide/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong><em>Gunfire Reborn</em></strong> (Proton)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">I won’t go into too much detail except to note that this is amongst the greatest co-op roguelite shooters ever made. If you enjoy an FPS and you haven’t played this yet, then you owe it to yourself to give this one a shot. Only on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1217060/Gunfire_Reborn/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, and the two DLC expansion character packs are well worth picking up if you enjoyed the base game.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong><em>Aliens: Fireteam Elite</em></strong> (Proton)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">A little rough around the edges, but this gem really captures the vibe from the Aliens movie and shoves it right in your face. With an innovative upgrade system for 7 unique classes, you'll need to find two friends (or the somewhat lacklustre bots) to take down aliens and androids across 12 sprawling missions. Available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1549970/Aliens_Fireteam_Elite/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<h4 style="text-align:left"><strong>Less Well Known</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align:left"><em><strong>Inkbound</strong></em> (Proton)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">This incredible roguelite from the creators of Monster Train is my current obsession. Despite being turn-based, all players spend their round in real-time which ensures a snappy pace. There are some fantastic synergies to exploit by playing different characters together - group the enemies with the Weaver's "Stitch" skill, pound the grouped enemies with an AoE "Leaping Strike" from the Magma Miner, then pulse an arena-wide "Seismic Slam" taunt as the Obelisk and tank all the resulting counter-attacks on your shields, thereby protecting your allies. Huge meta progression, a subtle (and ignorable if you wish) plot providing world building, and more challenges and missions than you can shake a stick at, this one is highly recommended. Get it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1062810/Inkbound/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14790961491703635735gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14790961491703635735gol573.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17104611901703635734gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17104611901703635734gol573.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong><em>Ember Knights</em></strong> (Proton)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">A room based roguelite for up to 4 players, you can specialise in any of six unique weapons as you fight and dodge roll your way to the perfect build, choosing from 17 secondary skills and 85 relics as you and your friends progress. Available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1135230/Ember_Knights/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong><em>Helldivers</em></strong> (Proton)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Do you like accidentally killing your friends? Do you enjoy a brutal challenge of near-never ending enemies? Do you like the stress of tapping button combos to radio-in airstrikes, turrets or mech support? If so, go play Helldivers immediately. There’s a reason this game has a button that simply throws your character on the ground. Keeping track of turret or mech fire while trying to disarm a nuke or prime an energy generator is shockingly difficult. But great fun with up to 4 players. Lots of DLC on this one, but the Digital Deluxe edition packages the game and all DLC for around the price of a pint of lager. Available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/394510/HELLDIVERS_Dive_Harder_Edition/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><em><strong>Ravenswatch</strong></em> (Proton)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Challenging, satisfying, beautiful. Three words to sum up Passtech’s co-op follow up to Curse of the Dead Gods. Still in development, the first two missions/bosses are complete and will give you around an hour’s play per attempt. The roguelite upgrades in this one will make or break your build across a variety of deeply varied characters as you and up to three friends race against the clock to level up before the boss showdown. Highly recommended, available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2071280/Ravenswatch/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9155036071703626336gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9155036071703626336gol573.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left"><em><strong>Stolen Realm</strong></em> (Proton)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">What’s this? A real-time turn-based RPG looter with accessible-yet-deep character customisation across 9 skill trees. Real-time, but turn-based? Yep it’s turn-based, but up to 6 players all take their turns in real-time, creating either wonderful harmonies, or friend-losing chaos, before ending their segment and letting the enemies take their go. An event system will also drop permanent relics and the developers have recently launched a roguelike-version of the gameplay loop for those players not willing to sink tens of hours into the world-based campaign. Find this gem on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1330000/Stolen_Realm/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong><em>Spellmasons</em></strong> (Proton)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">A recent addition to my library, I haven’t delved into this much yet, but basically take Noita’s wand-building and throw it into a turn-based top-down map that sees you constructing clever chained take downs of multiple enemies as you move from map to map, collecting new abilities along the way. This one supports up 8 players which must be absolute chaos. Spellmasons is on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1618380/Spellmasons/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><em><strong>Blackout Protocol</strong></em> (Proton)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">With hints of Alien Swarm, Blackout Protocol gives you and up to two more friends the opportunity to choose from a variety of weapons, skills and grenades as you take on its top-down, wonderfully lit, pseudo-3D missions. Early builds were ridiculously challenging, but recent updates have made the game somewhat more accessible. It’s got some nice grindy meta-progression to help out longer-term too. You can grab this one on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2111870/Blackout_Protocol/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong><em>Necesse</em></strong> (Native)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Not one I’ve played a lot of, but from my time in this surprisingly deep world, it’s a curious cross of Terraria-style base-building and Core Keeper dungeon-diving, with a top-down perspective. You can play with up to 4 players as you build a village around your base while hunting for crafting supplies underground. The UI is a little rough around the edges, but it gets regular updates and appears to have something of a cult following, with well over 10 thousand steam reviews, mostly positive. Grab it from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1169040/Necesse/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong><em>Vagante</em></strong> (Native)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Take Spelunky, zoom it out a little, add in RPG-mechanics, focus on combat and hey presto! Vagante has so many Spelunky mechanics, you’ll be right at home switching between them. Cooking chickens for health, spikes that one-shot your character, falling blocks, it’s uncanny. In 50 hours, I’ve never beaten the game, but like Spelunky, it rarely tips over from maddeningly-addictive to actual frustration. Terrible UI, but worth the learning curve as the mechanics are rock solid. Get it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/323220/Vagante/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<h4 style="text-align:left"><strong>All the rest</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align:left">There are just so many. It feels like online-coop has experienced a real surge in the past few years, possibly powered by Steam’s networking stack, as you can see from how few on this list actually make it to GOG. Here’s a few more games for you to take a look at, if the list above didn’t sate your appetite.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">I can recommend <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/258970/Gauntlet_Slayer_Edition/" target="_blank">Gauntlet</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/680420/OUTRIDERS/" target="_blank">Outriders</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/512900/Streets_of_Rogue/" target="_blank">Streets of Rogue</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/322330/Dont_Starve_Together/" target="_blank">Don’t Starve Together</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/239140/Dying_Light/" target="_blank">Dying Light</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1201540/HELLCARD/" target="_blank">Hellcard</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/274190/Broforce/" target="_blank">Broforce</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1968730/Bounty_of_One/" target="_blank">Bounty of One</a>, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/35700/Trine_Enchanted_Edition/" target="_blank">Trine</a> series, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/211820/Starbound/" target="_blank">Starbound</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1649240/Returnal/" target="_blank">Returnal</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/204360/Castle_Crashers/" target="_blank">Castle Crashers</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/465200/Fury_Unleashed/" target="_blank">Fury Unleashed</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/563560/Alien_Swarm_Reactive_Drop/" target="_blank">Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2221490/Tom_Clancys_The_Division_2/" target="_blank">The Division 2</a> and pretty much all the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/49520/Borderlands_2/" target="_blank">Borderlands</a> games.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Steam’s Winter Sale is on until January 4th, so if you fancy anything on this list, check it out before then, as most of these have pretty substantial discounts until then. Happy co-op gaming!</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's coming up on Christmas now, and so GamingOnLinux will be going into it's usual <em>mostly</em> hibernating state to take a little break to recharge. Apart from any sudden big stories that appear, or just plain boredom from me (or guest contributions), you can expect news to be rather quiet over the next week.</p>
<p>A <strong>big</strong> thank you to all supporters, commenters and readers for an absolute knock-out of a year that smashed through pretty much every record I think we've ever had for everything. It continues to be a real pleasure to run GamingOnLinux and follow how Linux gaming continues to evolve.</p>
<p>Just a reminder that if you wish to support me and GamingOnLinux the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/support-us/" target="_blank">links are available here any time</a> which includes the affiliate store links to buy games while also supporting GamingOnLinux.</p>

      <title>Godot 4.3 dev 1 brings major rendering changes - plus W4 Games on console support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The team working on Godot Engine have released the <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-3-dev-1/" target="_blank">first snapshot of Godot 4.3</a> which brings with it some big rendering changes that sound quite exciting overall.</p>
<p>According to the post they've done a "Major refactoring of the rendering system (GH-83452), which paves the way to several big improvements coming soon", one of which <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/collaboration-with-google-forge-2023/" target="_blank">linked</a> in the post is a collaboration with Google and The Forge to further improve Vulkan.</p>
<p>There's also now a new Direct3D 12 rendering driver, multiple controllers can now contribute to input actions, node groups can now be configured project-wide, freed objects are now treated differently from null in comparison operators, loading of scenes with corrupted or missing dependencies will no longer be aborted and an infamous bug causing areas to lose signal connections when pausing/unpausing the game has been fixed.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Meanwhile W4 Games, the company started up by some of the core Godot team, has <a href="https://w4games.com/2023/12/11/w4-games-announces-pricing-model-for-console-ports/" target="_blank">announced</a> their pricing for console port support for Godot. It's good to see a proper option out there now, as console support for Godot was something of a sore point for developers. The pricing may be a bitter pill to swallow for solo developers considering it's $800 just for a single console up to $2,000 for the big three together (and that's <em>every</em> year too), pricier still if you're a bigger team or if you have a publisher.</p>
<p>They did catch a fair bit of flak for it across social media that I saw, with multiple developers believing such console port support should have come from the Godot Foundation, <em>not</em> a separate company set up specifically to turn a profit like W4 Games (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/w4-games-raises-15m-to-help-push-godot-engine/" target="_blank">who have investors now</a>). These developers mentioned the conflict of interest between the Godot Foundation and W4 Games, considering some people work for both. Various sources of developers not happy with it: <a href="https://twitter.com/pawel_developer/status/1734791483541028954" target="_blank">#1</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/epyoncf/status/1734570315097821377" target="_blank">#2</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ScottTRichmond/status/1736777179088961913" target="_blank">#3</a> and so on.</p>
<p>For comparison on the pricing (specifically for console support):</p>
<ul>
<li>Unity: minimum $2,040 per-person per-year, plus the Runtime Fee or or 2.5% of your game’s monthly gross revenue when you hit $1,000,000 (USD) gross revenue on a trailing 12 month basis <em>and</em> 1,000,000 lifetime initial engagements.</li>
<li>Game Maker is $800 a year.</li>
<li>Unreal Engine is free until you hit the 5% revenue share (lifetime gross revenue from that product exceeds $1 million USD).</li>
<li>Defold is completely free.</li>
</ul>
<p>Worth noting as well of course Godot is open source and no one is forced to use W4 Games, and any other company could make cheaper console ports too.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this?</p>

      <title>The Talos Principle 2 gets Steam Deck Verified, plus a big Beta update is out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need a new puzzle game to add to your collection? Good news for you, as The Talos Principle 2 has now been bumped up to Steam Deck Verified status after testing from Valve.</p>
<p>Easily one of the best games of 2023. Much bigger and even more interesting than the first game, with plenty of new puzzle mechanics thrown in giving you a thought-provoking, character-driven interactive story with multiple endings. Initially Valve only gave it a Steam Deck Playable status, but multiple patches later and a re-test and now Valve have given it full seal of Verified approval. Works great on desktop Linux too with Proton 8!</p>
<p>The developers announced the status in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/835960/view/3890611245666460224" target="_blank">news post</a> on Steam, along with giving details on an opt-in Beta that brings with it numerous enhancements like a benchmark mode, water ripples, extra lore content and various visual fixes, gameplay improvements, bug fixes, improvements to their shader system (including a progress bar for shaders precaching) and much more.</p>

      <title>Check out this great overview of NVK, the open source NVIDIA Vulkan driver</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Faith Ekstrand has <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/nvk-holiday-update.html" target="_blank">given a holiday update</a> on the state of NVK, the unofficial open source NVIDIA Vulkan driver and how it's coming along that's worth a read as it's all quite exciting.</p>
<p>The progress on it has been quite ridiculous! At the end of 2022 they had a bare-bones Vulkan 1.0 implementation that only ran a few demos. Now a year later, not only does it have support for around 80 Vulkan extensions and major features but it also support nearly everything needed by DXVK and Zink.</p>
<p>How's performance? Ekstrand mentioned now there's "proper power management and performance improvements in NVK" they can hit around 40-60% of NVIDIA's proprietary driver in "several games". Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais also recently <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1736234565428302200" target="_blank">put up a post</a> on X (formerly Twitter) recently noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Decided to try it.. Hat in Time 1080p, Very High, VSync OFF. NVK is vulkan-nouveau-git gddf2ca4, on kernel 6.7.0-rc5-1-mainline. Blob is 545.29.06. 3995WX+RTX3090. Proton Experimental.<br/>
<br/>
NVK: 210FPS<br/>
Blob: 165FPS<br/>
<br/>
Cpu-bound, but still :-)</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17454386951703169722gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17454386951703169722gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
NVIDIA proprietary driver<br/>
<a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19543556121703169720gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19543556121703169720gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
NVK open source driver</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What's to come in 2024 for the NVK driver? Get it bumped up to Vulkan 1.3 support and eventually pass conformance which should happen in the first part of the year. This involves a rewrite of the pipeline code and implementing the VK_EXT_shader_object extension, which should bring the driver out of Beta so that distributions can ship NVK by default. Sounds like everything it needs will be ready in Linux kernel 6.7 and potentially in the Fedora 40 release.</p>
<p>After that getting everything hooked up to support VKD3D-Proton, more focus on performance. As Ekstrand said "If 2023 was about making games playable, 2024 will be about making games fast.".</p>
<p>And of course more GPU support too as work continues on Maxwell GPUs. Full <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/nvk-holiday-update.html" target="_blank">article here</a>.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma 6.0 Beta 2 is available for testing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Getting exciting now! We're closing in on the final release of KDE Plasma 6.0 with a <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/megarelease/6/beta2/" target="_blank">second Beta</a> now available for testing to ensure it's ready for your Linux desktops and eventually Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>Coming nearly a month after the first Beta, the KDE team have been powering through lots of bug reports to get it ready for release but naturally since it's still in Beta it's not quite ready yet but they could use some more testers to jump in and report across a wide variety of hardware.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5571517121703168574gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5571517121703168574gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>"As with versions <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/megarelease/6/alpha/" target="_blank">Alpha</a> and the <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/megarelease/6/beta1/" target="_blank">first Beta</a>, this is a preview intended for developers and testers. The software in this second beta release is reaching stability fast, but it is still not 100% safe to use in a production environment. We still recommend you continue using stable versions of Plasma, Frameworks and apps for your everyday work. But if you do use this, watch out for bugs and <a href="https://bugs.kde.org" target="_blank">report them</a> promptly, so we can solve them." — KDE Plasma Team.</p>
<p>A reminder on the rest of the roadmap:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 January 2024: Release Candidate 1</li>
<li>31 January 2024: Release Candidate 2</li>
<li>21 February 2024: Private Tarball Release</li>
<li>28 February 2024: Public Release</li>
</ul>
<p>Have you been testing Plasma 6? What are your thoughts on it so far?</p>

      <title>Fedora Asahi Remix 39 brings Linux to Apple Silicon Macs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have one of those fancy Apple Silicon Macs? Want to pop Linux on it? Check out Fedora Asahi Remix 39, the newly released <a href="https://asahilinux.org/" target="_blank">Asahi Linux</a> flagship distribution.</p>
<p>What is Asahi? Asahi Linux is a project and community with the goal of porting Linux to Apple Silicon Macs. Their team announced <a href="https://asahilinux.org/2023/08/fedora-asahi-remix/" target="_blank">back in August</a> their intent to have Fedora as the base for it and now that has been made generally available in a new <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/introducing-fedora-asahi-remix-39/" target="_blank">announcement</a> from Fedora.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17127877131703166770gol1.png"/></p>
<p>From what they said it supports all MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, Mac Mini, Mac Studio and iMac systems with M1 and M2 chips.</p>
<p>Interestingly though, even though Fedora are generally all about GNOME, the Asahi remix by default is KDE Plasma but there is a GNOME version also available. With full Wayland support, non-conformant OpenGL 3.3 support (as well as the world's first and only certified conformant OpenGL ES 3.1 implementation for Apple Silicon), high-quality audio and what should be a pretty great overall experience.</p>
<p>Really good to see Apple Silicon support for Linux continue to improve - stellar work from everyone involved.</p>

      <title>You can finally hide your naughty games on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a Steam Beta update to bring in some tweaks to the shopping cart, and finally allowing you to properly set certain games as private so no one can snoop on your gaming habits.</p>
<p>For the shopping cart there's these new features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">Inline gifting - just in time for the holidays, you can now purchase gifts for multiple friends (and yourself) without having to make multiple purchases. Plus gift messaging has been simplified to speed up the checkout process.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">One cart across all devices - items in your shopping cart will now follow you across all devices where you're signed in to Steam. Note that during the beta, the cart will only be accessible within the beta client.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">Private purchasing - keeping your games private starts before you even make a purchase, so the new cart lets you mark a game as private before you check out.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The private feature isn't just for when purchasing though. You can also, once updated, set individual games as private so they will disappear for everyone else. That includes hiding your ownership, in-game status, playtime, and activity in that game. At last, you can <em>finally</em> enjoy all your <em>naughty</em> games in total peace.</p>
<p>All you have to do is right click -&gt; manage -&gt; mark as private in your Steam Library. Either in the games list, or on the bigger box-art pictures in the main part of your library.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>MineClone2 is a free and open source survival sandbox game built to resemble Minecraft on the Minetest game engine, and their latest release Fire and Stone is out now.</p>
<p>This update includes numerous enhancements to the gameplay including the Stonecutter now actually being usable so you can "cut every kind of stone into slabs, stairs, and decorated variants with unprecedented ease". Campfires can now cook items and you can see it being done too which sounds fun. Fancy a little customization? Armour can now be decorated with colourful gems and metals, there's improvements to the AI of various mobs and various other improvements found in the <a href="https://git.minetest.land/MineClone2/MineClone2/src/branch/master/releasenotes/0_85-the_fire_and_stone_release.md" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>

      <title>Streets of Rogue 2 might be my most anticipated title for 2024</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I spent a ridiculous amount of time running around the small levels in Streets of Rogue, it was absolutely brilliant chaos and Streets of Rogue 2 going open-world is looking mighty fine in this first developer video.</p>
<p>What exactly is it? Streets of Rogue 2 gives you an open-world where practically anything is possible. You'll be able to play solo or with a few friends online to "embark on a wild adventure to take down a corrupt president – any way you want". In the video developer Matt Dabrowski goes over all the inspiration like AAA games from Rockstar, Bethseda and Ubisoft to survival crafting games like Minecraft and Valheim with a sprinkle of the freedom from Dwarf Fortress and Cataclysm Dark Days wrapped up in an interface that's welcoming and accessible so anyone can pick up. It's also more than 10,000 times bigger than a level from the first game with a fully destructible environment.</p>
<p>Developer Dabrowski notes in the video it's clearly still a work in progress, with their chat going over various bits of the game and plenty of footage we've not seen until now.</p>
<p>Check out their video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Mc0r7QddldI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5e9c533189b199497b49554eee1e40b0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Mc0r7QddldI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I absolutely love everything explained in the video, especially as another busy person, jumping into other open-world games is often too time-consuming and Streets of Rogue 2 looks like it will be fun and chaos from the moment you jump in. Exactly what I want to see and I've no doubt this will end up being one of 2024's most popular games — and one I'm certainly hyped to try.</p>
<p>As far as I know it's going to have Native Linux support like the first game.</p>

      <title>Vulkan API update brings Video Extensions for Accelerated H.264 and H.265 Encode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Khronos Group have announced the release of the Vulkan 1.3.274 API, which brings with it the finalized extensions for encoding and decoding of video streams using a variety of video coding standards.</p>
<p>It was back in April 2021 that the provisional extensions were released as "Vulkan Video", and later in December 2022 with Vulkan 1.3.238 they finalized the decode extensions for H.264 and H.265. Now with Vulkan 1.3.274 the counterpart extensions to enable encoding H.264 and H.265 are available.</p>
<p>"Leveraging the Vulkan framework, they provide a standardized, seamless, low-overhead, and highly controllable way to produce H.264 and H.265 video via hardware accelerators, with applications ranging from real-time, low-latency streaming to offline server-scale transcoding."</p>
<p>Details about the Vulkan Video API extensions at the below links::</p>

</ul>
<p>NVIDIA already have <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" target="_blank">Beta driver 535.43.22</a> out with expanded support, while work on AMD / Intel continues.</p>
<p>Read the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/blog/khronos-finalizes-vulkan-video-extensions-for-accelerated-h.264-and-h.265-encode" target="_blank">full blog post here</a>. The ongoing status of Vulkan Video can be seen on <a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Docs/issues/2284" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Nice to see the modern Vulkan API continue to evolve for the needs of modern developers across all industries. Hopefully this will improve video across the Linux desktop and gaming too.</p>

      <title>Enter the mind of a game dev on the brink in The Prisoning: Fletcher&#39;s Quest</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Elden Pixels who previously made Alwa's Awakening and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/06/alwas-legacy-is-an-incredibly-charming-retro-action-adventure-out-now/" target="_blank">Alwa's Legacy</a>, and who are also working on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/a-void-hope-looks-like-a-fun-atmospheric-adventure-with-a-synthwave-soundtrack/" target="_blank">A Void Hope</a> also just announced The Prisoning: Fletcher's Quest.

      <title>4x space strategy game New Stars hits Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Are you a fan of titles like Stellaris and other space strategy games? You may want to take a look at New Stars, which just entered Early Access with Linux support.</p>
<p>"New Stars is a 4X strategy game, on a galactic scale. Explore new worlds, build mega-structures, and found prosperous interstellar colonies. Go head-to-head with alien empires and build the greatest empire to survive the test of time, or be the last remaining in the galaxy to succeed."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1TPh2GLhDgQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e74471b11a2cec659ecd593e850159c2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1TPh2GLhDgQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>When asked on Steam about differences to the likes of Stellaris the developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2231270/discussions/0/6689578676484932301/#c3833171785700971082" target="_blank">gave a little explainer</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1) Relatively fast-paced - Each games last a few hours on average.<br/>
2) Straightforward mechanics - (Should be) Easy to learn with a new tutorial system.<br/>
3) Graphics - galaxy has improved since screenshots, with optimization for low-end devices.<br/>
4) UI - unique with elements inspired from a wide range of games.<br/>
<br/>
There are similarities to Stellaris, such as the fleet management and fleets in general, however the gameplay, mechanics, and pacing is a lot different. Civilization and Stellaris were originally the main inspirations for the game, but New Stars is it's own game.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Explaining more in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2231270/view/3871469509823929285" target="_blank">release post</a> it seems the length of Stellaris games was quite the sticking point for this developer noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One reason I made this game is because Stellaris games took me 100 hours on average, and every time I wanted to start a game, it was a major life decision - do I sacrifice 1-2 weeks just to finish this?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Really sounds like a game designed for me, and anyone else who loves the idea but doesn't have endless hours to dedicate to just one game. Nice to see more like this.</p>

      <title>Dark fantasy city-builder Against the Storm 1.0 out and now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Against the Storm is a city-builder with a sprinkle of rogue-lite, in a dark fantasy setting and now only has it recently left Early Access to hit 1.0 but it's also now Steam Deck Verified!</p>
<p>"You are the Viceroy – a leader charged by the Scorched Queen to reclaim the wilderness and discover lost riches for the Smoldering City, civilization's last bastion against the Blightstorm that destroyed the old world. Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="MtA1BAeeOAE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/eb40ad651ab01566c1da8ae040fb9396.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/MtA1BAeeOAE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For the Steam Deck support, the developer did make numerous changes to make it properly fit and look good including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The Steam Deck version can now read gamepad input and display controller glyphs.</li>
<li>Changed UI elements so the game is more readable in 16:10 resolutions, with maximum supported UI size enabled.</li>
<li>The Steam Deck version of the game now automatically launches with the maximum supported UI size.</li>
<li>Increased the font size in numerous UI panels to help with readability on the Steam Deck.</li>
<li>Adjusted multiple elements on the HUD to reduce instances of overlapping UI when playing with maximum supported UI size and 16:10 resolution (perks, species panel, resources, embarkation panel, etc.).</li>
<li>The virtual keyboard is now automatically invoked when selecting a text box on the Steam Deck.</li>
<li>Added the “Input Auto Focus” setting to the in-game Options. It’s enabled by default and it allows you to start typing values immediately on the PC keyboard and opens a virtual keyboard on Steam Deck. If you don’t like the virtual keyboard appearing automatically when opening panels with text fields (e.g. in the Trading Post panel), you can disable this option.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>However, in the Steam Deck <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1336490/view/3895114845299634789" target="_blank">announcement</a>, they made it clear it's not designed and doesn't look like a console-styled game with only basic controller support but they said they will keep looking to make it work better. Clearly it was enough to play well though being Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>For desktop Linux players, it has a Platinum rating on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1336490" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> and should work just fine with Proton 8.</p>
<p>The publisher, Hooded Horse, previously offered me a key so hopefully I will be able to take a look sometime soon.</p>

      <title>Vibrant fantasy retro magical FPS &#39;Wizordum&#39; is a joy to blast through</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wizordum is a new retro FPS that puts you in the role of a Mage on a quest to track down the source of Chaos. If you adored early first-person shooters, you're going to really enjoy this one. Note: key provided by Stride PR.</p>
<p>My time with it has been spent on Kubuntu using Proton 8, and it has worked great without any issues. It looks awesome, and runs perfectly with my AMD GPU (6800 XT) on Mesa 23.2.1. Valve have also now rated it Steam Deck Playable, as it has a few minor controls issues (only partial controller support).</p>
<p>It's in Early Access, so what I've played is but a slice of things to come but even so it's thoroughly impressive. It has a full episode included, with an additional two episodes to come. Once you've blasted through it though, the level editor with online sharing thanks to mod.io (which is all built-in) gives you access to extra content. The level editor also works perfectly on Linux as far as I can tell after messing around building some test levels.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="jcMhyxqLMOY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8943f8a2b66d324a17fb35190564e4a5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/jcMhyxqLMOY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's an absolute joy to blast through this one. I adore the vibrant visuals and the chunky pixels in it! Blending the 3D environments with the 2D sprites looks fab. Simply a must-play (or a must-watch until it's finished) for any fans of classic shooters with a magical edge to them. It's like a glorious blending of really early shooters and dungeon crawlers but feels and looks modern enough that anyone can enjoy it. The levels are nice and spacious filled with enemies to crush, secrets to find, barrels to smash apart and traps to avoid.</p>
<p>A surprising game that's initially rather simple, but the more you play and go through it, the more it opens up and really shines in the later levels with design and it will take you some time to get through.</p>
<p>The level editor is ridiculously easy to use too! Since it's using mod.io for the integration and sharing you can <a href="https://mod.io/g/wizordum" target="_blank">view it online</a> and while there's not much for it yet, given the clear high quality of the game mixed with how easy it is to make and test levels so smoothly, I've no doubt it will fill up soon.</p>
<p>Really thoroughly looking forward to seeing the additional coming episodes for this.</p>
<p>Main Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A vast arsenal of magic weapons &amp; items.</li>
<li>Search for secret places filled with treasures.</li>
<li>Solve puzzles and avoid traps.</li>
<li>Embark on a single-player campaign to find the source of Chaos, traveling from the Town of Grimbrook through swamps over the snowy mountains and beyond.</li>
<li>Collect bonus items and beat the hardest difficulty levels to climb to the top of the leaderboards.</li>
<li>Beat challenges at each level.</li>
<li>Compete online for the best time.</li>
<li>Create and share custom levels, all from inside the game.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>The gorgeous Tails of Iron just got a free expansion</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tails of Iron is an epic RPG adventure with punishingly brutal combat and a very bold style, and the developers just surprise-dropped a whole new free expansion to the end-game.</p>
<p>"Set after the climactic events of the base campaign (straight after the credits), ‘Bright Fir Forest’, a new free end-game expansion, sees our noble Rat King Redgi invited by the Squirrels to celebrate the Festival of Leaf Fall… However, a new foul and revenge-seeking adversary stands to ruin the celebrations."</p>
<p>With the expansion there's 13 new quests, adds 3 new challengers to the arena mode and add in more character customization with new weapons and armour, includes eight cosmetic upgrades for the Crimson Keep, and more. Seems like quite a nice addition to the game!</p>

      <title>Vampire Survivors: Emergency Meeting is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vampire Survivors: Emergency Meeting is the latest DLC available for the popular bullet-heaven horde survival game thingy from poncle and it's a lot of fun. Giving a cross-over of Among Us in Vampire Survivors was certainly an odd choice though, as two very opposite games but it works.</p>
<p>The DLC adds in a new Among Us inspired map, complete with various Crewmates you can rescue that will give you various bonuses during your run (that you can also upgrade) and you also get to deal with map events that require you to run across the map to press a button which adds another level of panic to Vampire Survivors. The design as a whole is pretty fun!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8169318331702989418gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8169318331702989418gol1.jpeg"/></a>Picture taken on my Steam Deck.</em></p>
<p>I still think it's a bit naughty all the enemies can just phase-through the walls, and we're left to walk around them. At least once you grab the map it's easier to get around.</p>
<p>Main DLC content:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>9 playable characters.</li>
<li>15 new weapons (of which 7 evolutions).</li>
<li>A new large stage.</li>
<li>A new Adventure.</li>
<li>6 brand new music tracks.</li>
<li>20 in-game-only achievements (not Steam Acheivements).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>At only £1.99 (and 20% off until December 25th), it's an easy pick if you're a Vampire Survivors fan itching for more content to blast your way though.</p>

<p>Thanks to the most recent update which developer Lavapotion worked with Bitwave Games on, the game has been expanded and overhauled to work fully on Steam Deck with full gamepad support. As they said it has "a complete overhaul of controls and menus, ensuring native integration with Steam Deck and gamepad controls" and that "A major part of this includes adding a large-font UI, guaranteeing no awesome dialogue or tooltip goes unnoticed".</p>
<p>On top of that there's new tooltips just for the Steam Deck, to go along with the new control scheme making it a natural fit for Steam Deck and gamepad players.</p>

<p>War Thunder, one of my most played games from 2023, had another major free update released with the War Thunder update out now bringing various new top-tier jets into the game. As a reminder first of all: did you know the War Thunder game engine, Dagor Engine, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/war-thunder-game-engine-dagor-engine-from-gaijin-now-open-source/" target="_blank">recently became open source</a>?

      <title>Check out your 2023 Year In Review on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With 2023 coming to a close Valve have refreshed their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/yearinreview" target="_blank">Steam Year In Review page</a>, so you can dive in and see everything you did and how it stacks up against others.</p>
<p>It's a rather fancy page that will list how many games you played, how many achievements you unlocked, your most played games, what platforms you played on, the types of games you mostly played and so much more nerdy details that you all love to go over right?</p>
<p>Valve even put up a clearly big-budget trailer for the event too:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2f_0fx2hAO4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4fb1571bcda5a995ab6b6a65dfbfa704.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2f_0fx2hAO4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can also share your page directly with others, so feel free to drop a link to your own in the comments if that's your sort of thing.</p>
<p>What were your most played games in 2023? Mine very much expectedly were War Thunder and Baldur's Gate 3, although Bloons TD 6 certainly crept up the list for me this year. With a whole lot of my time spent on Steam Deck across various other games like Halls of Torment, Brotato and Dave the Diver.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve are really doing some good stuff with the updates to the Steam Workshop. On top of the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/valve-upgrades-the-steam-workshop-plus-various-steam-deck-improvements-in-new-beta/" target="_blank">new features added recently</a>, they've also now put in Workshop Collections you can switch between and share around.</p>

So you can create, save and load different subscription lists using this new collections feature - giving you the ability to make preset mods lists and swap between them.

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer Part 37: Dashing Through the Snow</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-36-entertainment-for-x-windows/" target="_blank">Part 36: Entertainment for X Windows</a></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>By the end of 2002 things were starting to look bleak when it came to commercial Linux gaming. Both Loki Software and even the smaller porting house Tribsoft had closed their doors for good, while new firms such as Linux Game Publishing born out of the turmoil were struggling to find their feet. Some relief was on the horizon thanks to the work of independent contractors such as Ryan "icculus" Gordon, but he was far from alone in finding creative ways to bring more games to Linux.</p>
<p>A common refrain has always been that if developers would just provide access to their source code, then the Linux community would be happy to step in and do the heavy lifting for them. This has not always proven to be the case in actual fact, but when Slingshot Game Technology decided to call our bluff and released the source code to their snowboarding simulation <em>Soul Ride</em> under the GNU General Public License in 2003, the Linux community did indeed rise to the challenge.</p>
<p>They even provided a professional looking Loki Setup installer for owners of the <em>Soul Ride</em> CD-ROM to download by use of the soulride-1.1a-x86.run install script. This will grab the data right off the disc as well as providing the option of installing a number of Virtual Resorts which were provided for free on the <em>Soul Ride</em> website. That being said, you must ensure your user account has write permissions to the install directory, as otherwise you will be unable to save your player settings.</p>
<p>Not doing so will also cause other weirdness such as not being able to change mountains as well as the game not ceasing to play the CD audio on exit. Besides this I also encountered a graphical error where my shadow would be drawn multiple times in a grid underneath my character; that is, unless the weather was set to be snowing or whiteout conditions. This proved to not be much of a compromise, as obscuring the distance in snow also gives a much needed framerate boost.</p>
<p>The controls also came with a learning curve. <em>Soul Ride</em> was intended to be experienced with Slingshot Game Technology's own proprietary Catapult snowboard game controller, but as next to no one has that, I had to settle for using either the mouse or keyboard. You do not steer so much as shift your weight on the snowboard, with the forward and backward axis not even coming into play unless you are airborne. A full breakdown of the controls can be found on the <em>Soul Ride</em> Support FAQ.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18312333501702928053gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18312333501702928053gol6.png"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16830749341702928054gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16830749341702928054gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>Outside of the Catapult controller, the main selling point of <em>Soul Ride</em> was its recreation of real mountains made possible by the use of satelite topography data. The CD-ROM features simulations of two American ski areas, Mammoth Mountain in California as well as Tuckerman Ravine found on Mount Washington in New Hampshire. The Virtual Resort addons provide recreations of both Stratton and Jay Peak in Vermont, as well as the Breckenridge resort in Colorado.</p>
<p>You can either play through the included trail scenarios or Heli-Drop yourself anywhere on the slopes. <em>Soul Ride</em> also has one more trick up its sleeve, allowing you to record your runs and various stunts on a simulated VCR. This feeds into the final novel mechanic of allowing you to rewind up to three times during a descent, giving you some leeway if you wipe out. I found these to often rewind further than I would like, but they do help stop the game from being too unforgiving.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Soul Ride</em> does show its age in the lack of ragdoll physics, with you often looking as stiff as the snowboard you ride on when getting into trouble; the way you just fall over looking dejected if you run out of momentum is comical. You can also still gain point bonuses while you are wiping out, which does seem to be rubbing in your failure a touch. This is all accompanied by a licensed soundtrack sporting a number of bands provided by Bloodshot Records, Mint Records, and Ringing Ear Records.</p>
<p>Linux Game Publishing would later craft their own packaged Linux release of <em>Soul Ride</em> in 2005, which based on the free demo functioned much the same as the source port outside of a few improvements such as saving player data in your home directory and supporting a few more launch parameters. It still showed the same graphical error with the player's shadow, and just like with the source port, does not allow me to force either the display settings or the weather conditions at launch.</p>
<p>Outside of comparing scores between player profiles there is no competitive aspect to <em>Soul Ride</em>, which is a shame as being able to play hot seat against another player and potentially wipe each other out could have been a lot of fun. Of course with it being released under the GPL nothing is stopping someone from adding these features, and the game built and ran fine for me from source even on my modern Linux computer. By now I am getting to know my way around a compiler.</p>

      <title>Brocula is a life sim with a dark side - grow crops, go fishing, grow a cult as a Vampire</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm all for playing more life-sims but they're all just a bit too cute aren't they? Brocula looks like it's going to be the opposite, with you being a Vampire.</p>
<p>All the usual suspects are here like tending to your crops, building up your farm, selling your wares for a profit and going fishing. But there's a dark side to it. You'll also be managing a cult, restoring a church to gather people for the all important blood you crave. There's also an ever-changing forest to explore with strange creatures and treasures to find.</p>
<p>You can see some brief footage in the demo trailer below:</p>

<p>A much longer look the developer posted up a few days ago:</p>

<p>It's set for release on February 1st, 2024 but there's a demo available on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1364740/Brocula/" target="_blank">Steam page</a>. The demo has a Linux version too, built with Unity. Looks like the developer is going for full Steam Deck support with it mentioned in the Steam page system requirements.</p>

      <title>God-sim city-builder The Universim releases 1.0 on January 22, 2024</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a good few years in Early Access, The Universim from Crytivo is finally set to hit the big 1.0 with some fun new features. This was announced along with a new trailer (below) that the 1.0 release will happen on January 22nd, 2024.</p>
<p>"The Universim 1.0 isn't just a game; it's a living, breathing universe at your fingertips.

This update brings end-game content to life with more technology to unlock in the research tree, new planets to explore (or exploit for resources), and so much more!" — Crytivo</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="o3r2rB3eH2s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/824f661c38c5a06384fb080e243586f4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/o3r2rB3eH2s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of what's coming with the 1.0 release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I've been playing it on and off for years, always intrigued by the setting and every time it sucked me in with quite a few hours so it's going to be fantastic to see it finally finished after waiting so long. The Universim was originally funded on Kickstarter too all the way back in 2014!</p>

      <title>HDR support for KDE Plasma 6 seems to be shaping up nicely</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While it's far from finished, and still needs some manual effort to get properly working, HDR support for KDE Plasma 6 has made great progress. While HDR is already available in SteamOS on Steam Deck, getting it hooked up on traditional Linux desktops is still in-progress.</p>
<p>Developer Xaver Hugl wrote up a <a href="https://zamundaaa.github.io/wayland/2023/12/18/update-on-hdr-and-colormanagement-in-plasma.html" target="_blank">fresh blog post</a> going over the current status for those interested. You're now able to enable HDR in Plasma settings that gives you new options, and it even includes a "SDR Color Intensity" slider inspired by the colour slider on Steam Deck that was introduced in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/steamos-355-rolls-out-to-all-steam-deck-owners-plus-new-steam-client-update/" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.5</a>. The blog post goes over their work, along with all the Gamescope additions done by Joshua Ashton from Valve, to get it into a state where it's reasonably simple to actually get HDR working for games and other media now.</p>
<p>Plasma 6 Beta already has the work in KWin, and after a few additional steps noted in the blog post (like using Gamescope) you can "play most HDR capable games in the Wayland session" as long as you use Proton 8 or newer, with Hugl noting games they've tested working fine include Ori and the Will of the Wisps, Cyberpunk 2077, God of War, Doom Eternal, Jedi: Fallen Order and Quake II RTX. Spider-Man: Remastered and Spider-Man: Miles Morales also work, but don't look particularly good with HDR, which might not actually be a Linux problem specifically.</p>
<p>Ending the blog post to round it up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Obviously there is still a lot to do. Color management is limited to either sRGB or full-blown rec.2020, you shouldn’t have to install stuff from Github yourself, and certainly shouldn’t have to mess around with the command line to play games and watch videos in HDR, HDR screenshots and HDR screen recording aren’t a thing yet, and many other small and big things need implementing or fixing. There’s a lot of work needed to make these things just work™ as they should outside of special cases like the gamescope embedded session.</p>
<p>Things are moving fast though, and I’m pretty happy with the progress we made so far.</p>

      <title>ScummVM expands support for Macromedia Director</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ScummVM is an awesome project bringing new life to absolutely loads of classic games through the power of open source, and now they're expanding support for Macromedia Director games too.</p>
<p>Currently it can open Director titles from 1995 and earlier, but titles released after 1995 use Director versions that aren't yet supported. The team mentioned there's about 1,595 of these games that ScummVM can detect from the original up to Director 11. With the 2.8.0 release adding in preliminary support for Director 5.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Adding support for a new Director version is a tricky process. First we need to check for any changes to the movie file format, then add in any new engine and Lingo features, and finally start working through issues in a bunch of candidate games. Because of the difficulty of keeping track of facts vs. assumptions, we only enable features for an engine version once they have been confirmed with testing. This is why D6 and higher games will not open at all, even if the code we have would somewhat work.</p>
<p>Support for the D2, D3 and D4 versions of Director has steadily improved. We are building up a suite of unit tests, both for Lingo and for the various drawing modes in the renderer. Most of the remaining bugs are related to undefined or incidental behavior: consider how two types in Lingo are compared, or the precise order that events are processed in, or how functions respond when you pass them nonsense data? All of these things are relied upon by thousands of Director products! And ScummVM must support all of them as closely as possible.</p>
<cite>ScummVM Team</cite></blockquote>
<p>Planned to happen in the upcoming ScummVM 2.8.0 release they have these newly supported titles available for testing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alice: An Interactive Museum</li>
<li>Ape Odyssey</li>
<li>Classical Cats</li>
<li>Gadget: Invention, Travel and Adventure</li>
<li>The Cute Machine</li>
<li>The Dark Eye</li>
<li>Wrath of the Gods</li>
</ul>
<p>You do need to have a copy of the original games though.</p>

      <title>Valve hands out lumps of coal to naughty Dota 2 players</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In possibly one of the funniest moves I've seen from Valve recently, they're handing out lumps of coal when banning Dota 2 players. Valve have been fighting off toxic Dota 2 players for a whole mixture of reasons from smurf accounts to general in-game toxic behaviour and they've continued banning a <em>lot</em> of people.</p>
<p><em>To explain: smurf accounts are made by experienced players to play against lower-ranked players, often just stomping all over them and it's just not very fun for competitive games.</em></p>
<p>Back in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/valve-goes-for-the-smurfs-banning-90000-people-in-dota-2/" target="_blank">September Valve banned 90,000 accounts</a> of smurfs and in the <a href="https://www.dota2.com/newsentry/3884981125532748791" target="_blank">latest update</a> for the Frostivus 2023 event for the holidays they mentioned that if you're on the "Naughty List" that it's "gonna be a bloodbath" and mentioned multiple tens of thousands of accounts were banned again on December 14th. In the update post Valve teased what they had in store for naughty people mentioning "Except smurf accounts, who we assume will not enjoy the update as they choke on their richly-deserved coal-flavored just desserts."</p>
<p>One pro player, Mason “mason” Venne, ended up getting this special gift live which was captured on <a href="https://clips.twitch.tv/CheerfulFrozenLaptopMcaT-u70lacgn1Q8z8DzN" target="_blank">Twitch</a>, screenshot:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7161921701702899600gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7161921701702899600gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Hilarious. And fully deserved for anyone making online games miserable for others. Mason did a Reddit post to try and explain themselves, which was deleted, but the internet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231216002137/https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/18isfk7/hey_everyone_mason_here_about_my_ban_and_how_im/" target="_blank">never forgets</a>.</p>
<p>Great to see Valve put in such active effort to continue to make Dota 2 a better game for everyone. Maybe I will jump in again soon…</p>

      <title>AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3 (FSR3) is now open source</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As promised, AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3 is now open source under the MIT license and available for all developers to look into and add into their games. Currently though, this initial open source release only includes support for DirectX 12, as Vulkan support is "in development and will be released in a future version".</p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AMD FidelityFX™ Super Resolution 3 (FSR 3) technology uses a combination of super resolution temporal upscaling technology and frame generation to deliver a massive increase in framerates in supported games.</p>
<p>AMD FSR 3 technology extends upon FSR 2’s upscaling by adding Frame Generation – the ability to generate entirely new game frames and present those to the user to improve FPS. FSR 3 does this by adding two new technologies – Frame Interpolation and Optical Flow enhanced from AMD Fluid Motion Frames.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some nice improvements arrived with FSR3 v3.0.3 including quality improvements and extends support for Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) monitors within the frame pacing logic.</p>
<p>More games are confirmed to be getting FSR3 too with Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora recently released with it. Other games that will get support for it include Eve Online, Farming Simulator 22, Squad, Warhammer Darktide, Space Marine II, Starfield, Starship Troopers Extermination, Cyberpunk 2077, Crimson Desert, Black Myth: Wukong, The Alters, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth and Pax Dei.</p>
<p>See their <a href="https://gpuopen.com/fsr3-source-available/" target="_blank">announcement blog</a>, <a href="https://gpuopen.com/fidelityfx-super-resolution-3/" target="_blank">FSR3 page</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/FidelityFX-SDK" target="_blank">GitHub</a> - currently FSR3 on GitHub is in its own <a href="https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/FidelityFX-SDK/tree/release-FSR3-3.0.3" target="_blank">special branch</a>.</p>

      <title>Death Stranding from Kojima is getting the live-action movie treatment</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Death Stranding from Kojima Productions is being turned into a movie, with A24 (Everything Everywhere All at Once) taking on the job. As one of my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/12/death-stranding-absolutely-sold-me-and-you-should-play-it/" target="_blank">favourite games</a> from the last few years, I can't wait to see!</p>
<p>This is at least the second time an announcement has been made, with the previous report in <a href="https://deadline.com/2022/12/death-stranding-film-from-barbarian-producer-alex-lebovici-in-works-1235200209/" target="_blank">late 2022</a> being from Hammerstone Studios<strong>. </strong>It’s unclear what happened there.</p>
<p>The blurb: "The film promises to delve into the mysteries surrounding the apocalyptic event called the “Death Stranding”, which blurred the lines between life and death, and brought forth nightmarish creatures into a world on the brink of collapse."</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/en/A24-announcement" target="_blank">official announcement</a> Hideo Kojima said: "A24 was born into this world about 10 years ago, their presence is singular within the industry, they are like no other. The films they are delivering to the world are high in quality and very innovative. I have been attracted to their creations and they have even inspired my own work. Their innovative approach to storytelling aligns with what Kojima Productions has been doing for the last 8 years. Now, we are making a Death Stranding movie together. There are a lot of 'game adaptation films' out there but what we are creating is not just a direct translation of the game. The intention is that our audience will not only be fans of the games, but our film will be for anyone who loves cinema. We are creating a Death Stranding universe that has never been seen before, achievable only through the medium of film, it will be born."</p>
<p>Are you excited? I sure am. This will certainly be a memorable experience.</p>

      <title>Mixing ideas from Chess and base-building strategy games, protect your King in Emplacement</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Emplacement is a King versus King turn-based strategy game, all about placing down tiles in a way that's a bit like Chess mixed with ideas from other more traditional turn-based strategy games.</p>
<p>Played on an isometric board, each player takes turns placing down tiles to progress towards taking down the enemy King. So you need to keep thinking and planning ahead on what tiles you want to go where, all while trying to protect your own King while also advancing on your opponent. Place down farms, barracks and more to use their productivity and gather resources and units.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

      <title>FOSS strategy-shooter Unvanquished update brings better bots, improved server browser</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Unvanquished, the free and open source strategy-shooter mix, has released version 0.54.1 bringing with it some much needed improvements to continue building on. In the <a href="https://unvanquished.net/unvanquished-0-54-1-is-here/" target="_blank">announcement</a> the developers noted this technical update was to bring "various much-needed and long-overdue fixes".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6033147951702561980gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6033147951702561980gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>What's changed?</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Some rendering fixes.</li>
<li>Some fixes for memory leaks.</li>
<li>WebP update to address a <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-4863" target="_blank">security issue</a>.</li>
<li>A fix for a bug affecting Windows when display scaling is enabled.</li>
<li>Better bots.</li>
<li>Translations.</li>
<li>Server browser properly displaying and parsing the server tag (things like officials and featured servers).</li>
<li>Messages telling why the user disconnected from the server.</li>
<li>Server browser properly listing servers on some mobile broadband networks which were dropping our serverinfo packets.</li>
<li>Improved performance with the ground fire effect.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They also now have a Fediverse account <a href="https://idtech.space/users/UNVofficial" target="_blank">you can follow</a>. On top of that they also recently put out a <a href="https://unvanquished.net/looking-for-an-opengl-and-cpp-developer/" target="_blank">call for more developers</a> to join in and help modernise it.</p>
<p>If you've not heard of it before: It's a fork of the classic Tremulous. A free and open-source first-person strategy game shooter, pitting technologically advanced human soldiers against hordes of highly adaptable aliens. Players can choose from either team, providing for an entirely different experience on both sides, as humans focus on long-range firepower while aliens rely instead on quick movement and stealth. The goal of each match is to destroy the enemy base, preventing members of the opposing team from spawning. Upgrades for both teams are earned by a combination of individual performance and team map control, unlocking access to more powerful weapons and equipment for the humans, and larger, more ferocious forms for the aliens.</p>

      <title>Necesse a Terraria-Rimworld blend gets big update, graphics overhaul coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Blending together elements of the likes of Terraria and Rimworld, the open world survival craft and colony sim game Necesse has a big update out now. And there's some more exciting stuff to come still.</p>
<p>One of the most requested features is an update to the graphics, and the good news there is that they've now got two full-time artists working on a huge upgrade to that! Their little gif teaser shows what kind of style to expect to come in a future update:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1953945951702559266gol1.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1953945951702559266gol1.gif"/></a></p>
<p>As for this latest released update it's a big one. Characters are now separated from worlds, so you can take your character anywhere to any other player's world in what they're calling the "Necesseverse". So that works a lot more like Terraria, Valheim and other games that do the same. Solo players also get a new survival mode with food spoilage, a refined system for asking NPCs to join player parties, a reworked endgame, and snowballs. On top of that there's also a new biome featuring boss monsters and loot, as well as more fine-tuned difficulty options plus plenty of bug fixes.</p>

      <title>Escape Simulator gets a free Among Us DLC out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pine Studio are doing some great stuff with Escape Simulator. Not only did it get a Portal themed DLC earlier this year, it just got a free Among Us DLC out now. The Among Us crew love their cross-overs it seems, like the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/vampire-survivors-adventures-update-out-now-plus-among-us-collab-dlc-coming/" target="_blank">Vampire Survivors DLC also coming soon</a>.</p>

By teaming up with the Among Us developer Innersloth, Pine Studio — a master in the art of crafting tricky escape rooms — has boarded The Mini Skeld and added its own twist to the game. Although the primary goal in Escape Simulator is solving puzzles together to escape, there is no way for us to stop anybody from playing the impostor and hindering such an attempt."</p>
<p>DLC Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brand new Among Us inspired escape-room packed with original puzzles.</li>
<li>Play solo or online with friends. The DLC plays best with 1-4 players, but it’s playable with up to 10!</li>
<li>New character hats inspired by Among Us crewmates.</li>
<li>Checkpoint system so you can gradually progress through the ship.</li>
<li>Try to escape in under 60 minutes and win the trophy!</li>

<p>Escape Simulator has Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified!</p>

      <title>Tetris Effect: Connected adds HDR for Steam Deck OLED plus optimizations</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>More HDR goodies for you to test with your shiny new Steam Deck OLED, as Tetris Effect: Connected should now work great with it. Even if you only have the original Steam Deck LCD model, this update should still improve things for you too!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1003590/announcements/detail/3896240575563765187" target="_blank">changelog</a> was short and sweet noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>[STEAM] Added an HDR option for the Steam Deck OLED. You can enable this from OPTIONS&gt;GRAPHICS&gt;HDR.</li>
<li>[STEAM] Optimized the GRAPHIC QUALITY settings for Steam Deck for better performance in SCORE ATTACK and CLASSIC SCORE ATTACK game modes. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Great once again to see more developers actually test and improve their games for Steam Deck, which should also ensure they work on desktop Linux quite nicely too with Proton! Currently Tetris Effect: Connected is Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="P2czq3SAbGw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b2c332a4611b8f58e3704c08e16f9fe4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/P2czq3SAbGw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tetris® Effect: Connected is Tetris like you've never seen it, or heard it, or felt it before—an incredibly addictive, unique, and breathtakingly gorgeous reinvention of one of the most popular puzzle games of all time, from the people who brought you the award-winning Rez Infinite and legendary puzzle game Lumines.<br/>
<br/>
Music, backgrounds, sounds, special effects—everything, down to the Tetriminos themselves—pulse, dance, shimmer, and explode in perfect sync with how you're playing, making any of the game's 30+ stages and 10+ modes something you'll want to experience over and over again.<br/>
<br/>
Plus cross-platform multiplayer modes for competitive and cooperative play!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've actually never played this one, am I missing out on something here? It has an Overwhelmingly Positive rating from users on Steam so plenty of people love it. My poor poor backlog of games, is it going to grow again?</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1003590/Tetris_Effect_Connected/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Fortnite on Linux / Steam Deck? Not until &#39;tens of millions of users&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hoping at some point to play Fortnite on Linux / Steam Deck without the use of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/fortnite-added-to-xbox-cloud-gaming-easier-than-ever-to-play-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Cloud Gaming services</a>? Well, it's probably quite some time away, if ever.</p>
<p>While Epic Games could put it on Linux, they're currently just choosing not to. The anti-cheat is supported, and has been for some time. It uses a mixture of Easy Anti-Cheat (which Epic themselves own) and BattlEye, both are actually supported on Linux. Their own game engine, Unreal Engine, does also support Linux too.</p>
<p>Recently The Verge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23996474/epic-tim-sweeney-interview-win-google-antitrust-lawsuit-district-court" target="_blank">did an interview</a> with Epic's CEO Tim Sweeney, and this was mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why is Fortnite still not playable on Steam Deck?</p>
<p>If we only had a few more programmers. It’s the Linux problem. I love the Steam Deck hardware. Valve has done an amazing job there; I wish they would get to tens of millions of users, at which point it would actually make sense to support it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Worth noting <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/epic-games-sheds-830-people-due-to-spending-more-than-they-earn/" target="_blank">back in September 2023</a>, Epic Games let go over 800 people.</em></p>
<p>You may remember that back in 2022, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/epic-games-ceo-says-a-clear-no-to-fortnite-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Sweeney gave a pretty clear "no"</a> to Fortnite support with <a href="http://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> for Linux / Steam Deck, with Sweeney mentioning all the different Linux kernel combinations, especially with the size of Fortnite as a game it's a huge target for cheaters (and it's only gotten a lot bigger since then).</p>
<p>The other side though of course is the Epic Games Store, and how Epic sees Valve as a competitor. The issue claimed is the 30% cut that Valve take, but given how many resources Epic continue pouring into the Epic Games Store, through various exclusivity deals and free games, they're not going to turn around and put Fortnite onto Steam. Remember they actually pulled Rocket League and Fall Guys from Steam after acquiring them.</p>
<p>They wouldn't actually <em>need</em> to put it onto Steam for it to work on Linux / Steam Deck though, there's various ways to get the Epic Games Store on Linux and Fortnite already <em>loads</em> with Proton, it's just the anti-cheat blocking you actually playing it.</p>
<p>Really, the reality is simple and the quote above makes it clear. It's just a question of how much money Fortnite would make, and it would need to make a lot on Linux / Steam Deck. Once a platform is big enough, it won't be ignored. Money is the only priority, as seen when <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/epic-games-are-killing-off-a-bunch-of-classics-like-unreal-tournament/" target="_blank">Epic decided to kill off Unreal Tournament</a>.</p>

<p>What have you been playing recently?

      <title>Valve upgrades the Steam Workshop, plus various Steam Deck improvements in new Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Steam Desktop and Steam Deck have a fresh Beta release out that overhauls some parts of the Steam Workshop. Plus there's some fixes for Linux and Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>For the Steam Workshop, Valve looked over a few parts that hadn't been updated for a while and made them better to use including these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Re-designed the Workshop subscriptions list (accessible from Game Properties). It now includes the ability to sort by subscription date, last updated, size, name, and load order.</li>
<li>Added ability to change the local load order of Workshop item subscriptions.</li>
<li>Added ability to set the local order based on any Workshop item dependencies (must be set on the Workshop items themselves).</li>
<li>Added ability to disable Workshop item subscriptions, which will hide them from the game.</li>
<li>Added the ability to filter the Workshop subscriptions list by tag name. Use the same search field for filtering items by name.</li>
<li>Show the name of the Workshop item being download in the game's tooltip on the Downloads page.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Some more changes in Desktop Steam Beta:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed "Friends who Play" section not refreshing until the client was restarted.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remote Play</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved performance and smoothness when using NVIDIA hardware encoding.</li>
<li>Fixed a video freeze when moving the mouse to a monitor on another video adapter.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Linux</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a crash in "Call of Duty: Black Ops III" when switching maps.</li>
<li>Fixed situations causing the Steam client to only download the Windows version of a title and later attempting to run it without Proton.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And then the changes for Steam Deck:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Reduce the amount of black screen flashes that happen when opening the Steam interface while playing a game with a custom screen refresh rate setting.</li>
<li>Replaced Nearest scaling mode with Pixel, a pseudo-bandlimited filter for upscaling pixel art to non-integer factors without introducing aliasing. Integer scale factors will still be Nearest.</li>
<li>Fixed "Friends who Play" section not refreshing until the client was restarted</li>
<li>Fixed a crash in "Call of Duty: Black Ops III" when switching maps.</li>
<li>Fixed situations causing the Steam client to only download the Windows version of a title and later attempting to run it without Proton.</li>
<li>Reset the HDR Visualization setting to None for all users.</li>
<li>Moved the HDR Visualization setting from Display-&gt;Advanced to Developer settings.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The flashing when opening the Steam UI on Steam Deck when you're running a different refresh rate was quite annoying, so it's great to see some improvements there. Hopefully they can keep improving that!</p>

      <title>Windblown is the next game from the Dead Cells team</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As a huge fan of Dead Cells, I'm keen to see what Motion Twin are cooking up with Windblown, due to release in 2024 in Early Access and it looks pretty wild.</p>
<p>Their description of it is certainly amusing too: "Windblown is what happens when a rogue-like game guzzles a whole lot of energy drinks, hits the gym, and wears treadmills on its feet. It's got combat that zips by at lightning speed, and we've tossed in some eye-popping, shiny clouds and gravity-defying islands for good measure. Think of it as Dead Cells’ hyperactive sibling, spinning in a 3D sugar rush."</p>
<p>In Windblown, players become Leapers – warriors fighting to protect their home, The Ark, from the gigantic and deadly Vortex and its Sentinel minions. Like a bolt of lightning, players will freely dash through stunning open stages where each run is teeming with secrets to uncover. Players will be challenged to overcome the odds in relentless battles against the Vortex's Sentinels, hell-bent on taking them down and starting their run anew. You'll be able to do it solo or online in three-player co-op sessions.</p>
<p>Check out their announcement trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="shPyfu6aP58"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/92aa4b3eca15c27c40708de5808491b8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/shPyfu6aP58" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>If a Native Linux version specifically is important for you, a developer from Motion Twin <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1911610/discussions/0/4030222029797172308/#c4030222382924945322" target="_blank">mentioned</a> on Steam "Linux should come, we don't know when yet.".</p>

      <title>Heroes of Might and Magic III game engine VCMI gets some huge improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While we have fheroes2 for Heroes of Might and Magic II, we also have VCMI for Heroes of Might and Magic III which also continues to advance as a free and open source cross-platform game engine reimplementation.</p>
<p>Recently the team behind VCMI released version 1.4.0 and 1.4.1 shortly after to fix up some issues. The list of what's new is…rather long. Sounds like some pretty necessary additions too including a high score screen, tracking of completed campaigns, VSync support, a tutorial, a video for winning / losing, smaller save files, mod compatibility checking when loading a save, simultaneous turns support for multiplayer, various AI improvements and <a href="https://github.com/vcmi/vcmi/blob/master/ChangeLog.md#132---140" target="_blank">so much more</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3742901841702398116gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3742901841702398116gol1.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://vcmi.eu/" target="_blank">official site</a> and their <a href="https://github.com/vcmi/vcmi" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>You do need the original game for the data files which you can <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_3_complete_edition" target="_blank">grab on GOG.com</a>.</p>

      <title>Open source evolution sim Thrive has a new physics engine and big performance upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Thrive is an in-development Early Access open source evolution sim, much like life itself it continues to evolve and a new release version 0.6.4 brings changes to ensure the foundation is solid.</p>
<p>With the release the developers do say there's not a lot new to show in terms of gameplay, because it was focused on a "massive rework in the functionality of Thrive’s background processes" which includes a "brand new physics engine complete with better performance". So while they can't show much that looks new it should be "smoother sailing from here on out". Given all the changes it should provide better performance too!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="TxSrcFVlqjY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/091c435a9fbf648e2247a6688f972cea.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/TxSrcFVlqjY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of the big changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Refactored the entire microbe gameplay code to use an Entity Component System (ECS) architecture and a different physics engine (Jolt). This took up the vast majority of the time spent on this release. As a result of this many things in the game will feel slightly different and there will definitely be new bugs that have slipped past us. We will attempt to quickly fix any new bugs introduced with this change.</li>
<li>The game performance is now 20-100% better than before thanks to the ECS and physics rework (different benchmark parts have different improvements, and different gameplay conditions also have different performance gains).</li>
<li>Improved auto-evo performance by about 50%.</li>
<li>Added a native C++ library for Thrive that has the physics engine integration for now but we can in the future move computation heavy parts of the game there that might benefit performance.</li>
<li>Added two new context specific microbe tracks that can play instead of the normal microbe ambiance when in those specific patch types.</li>
<li>Added Thriveopedia pages for each of the organelles currently in the game.</li>
<li>Added early multicellular freebuild mode.</li>
<li>Improved the visuals of the organism statistics panel and added / updated related tooltip icons as well.</li>
<li>Added 3D panorama backgrounds for various patch types for the late multicellular underwater part. These were completed a while ago but were never accessible in game until now.</li>
<li>Various AI improvements.</li>
<li>Lots of bug fixes.</li>
<li>+ <a href="https://github.com/Revolutionary-Games/Thrive/releases/tag/v0.6.4" target="_blank">lots more</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>They're also looking to eventually port it from Godot 3 to Godot 4.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1779200/Thrive/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a> to support development or download it <a href="https://revolutionarygamesstudio.com/" target="_blank">direct</a> or via <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.revolutionarygamesstudio.ThriveLauncher" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.</p>

      <title>The Garden Path, a quiet life sim about the joy of gardening releases Spring 2024</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Garden Path was originally due to release earlier this year, but the developer pushed it back to continue improving it and now you can again grab an early copy with a new full release window revealed.</p>
<p>While most of the content is complete, they're working out some performance kinks to ensure the release is great. So now their plan is to have it ready for Spring 2024.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11397467371702384326gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11397467371702384326gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Garden Path is a slice-of-life gardening sim that celebrates small moments. No matter how you decide to play, the garden is a tender world of familiar sights and sounds, mysteries, and friendly faces. A space to call your own, to curate, and to reflect.</p>
<p>Designed to be played in short bursts as and when you wish, time in The Garden Path runs in concert with the outside world. Stop by to wander your garden whenever the mood takes you, and find new travelers, events, activities, and distractions waiting for you each day. Take your time, play for a little while, and experience it all at your own pace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They have a new trailer to mark the occasion:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="IS6Iiz-Bq9A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/647746ca380f00806180420ede1d8761.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/IS6Iiz-Bq9A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Additionally they've opened up a few Beta keys for purchase on their <a href="https://carrotcakestudio.itch.io/thegardenpath" target="_blank">itch.io page</a>. At time of writing there's only 184 left if you wish to support development and check it early. It gives you the full game at release, since they will just continue to update it there.</p>
<p>It will have Native Linux support at release on <a href="https://carrotcakestudio.itch.io/thegardenpath" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1638500/The_Garden_Path/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck and Desktop Steam stable update brings more bug fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released another small stable update for the Steam Client on Steam Deck and Desktop, so here's what's changed for you.</p>
<p>For desktop users the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/3902995340337505817" target="_blank">changes are</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed notifications not firing for completed downloads and roll-ups of pending friend invites.</li>
<li>Fixed some Windows Steam clients getting stuck at network selection screen in Big Picture Mode.</li>
<li>Fixed systray menu not updating when entering/exiting Family View.</li>
<li>Fix for failing to launch games the first time they are launched via the system tray or jump list.</li>
<li>Clarified the dialog message shown when trying to access store while using Steam Link from some devices.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue on Linux that could cause gamepad input to stop in games after a controller disconnect or during suspend on Deck.</li>
<li>The new default PlayStation Controller behavior where Steam Input was enabled in games without PS controller support store tags will now only be active on games that have filled out the survey to say they do not have PS Controller support. This will be revisited when there is better coverage for the PS controller data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SteamVR</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fix for inverted image and mouse input on Linux when displaying non-VR apps in headset.</li>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer Part 36: Entertainment for X Windows</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-35-the-new-stories/" target="_blank">Part 35: The New Stories</a></strong></p>
<p>While still being the most elaborate, <em>100 Great Linux Games</em> was far from the only shovelware set of games released for Linux, with several UNIX CD-ROM vendors such as Walnut Creek CDROM and Omeron Systems also seeking a piece of the action for themselves. These were often more spartan sets of software packages made in line with their other offerings, including not just games but also the libraries and utilities associated with them, as well as emulators, screensavers, and software toys.</p>
<p><em>Linux Games &amp; Entertainment for X Windows</em> by hemming GmbH is another such example. From 1999, it was part of a series of seven Linux software CD-ROMs on topics such as networking, multimedia, science, office, system administration, and one of just general tools. This unassuming disc promises to be easy to use three times on the case spine. This did not prove to be my experience, but in fairness, it was designed with SUSE Linux 6.1 and Red Hat Linux 5.1 in mind.</p>
<p>For some bizarre reason the CD-ROM must be mounted and explored with root permissions in order for the contents to be displayed, something which is not mentioned in the instructions printed on the inside of the jewel case insert. From there you can load either the index_e.htm or index_d.htm files in a web browser for an HTML based menu in either English or German. This takes the form of a table list of entries, with "copy program" links under them bringing up a save file dialogue.</p>
<p>Most of the games are distributed as just the raw source code archives, along with a few binary tarballs and some scant RPM packages. The bulk of these refused to build for me, and given that a great deal of the games had either been packaged with my Linux distribution already, or had superior sources available for them online, I did not feel much need to troubleshoot them. Really the main value of this set today is just as a reference for what games were floating around at the time.</p>
<p>A slew of familiar favourites such as <em>The Ace of Penguins</em>, software from Bill Kendrick's New Breed Software, <em>iMaze</em>, as well as several games from the KDE and GNOME desktop environments are included. There are also early versions of many enduring free software classics such as <em>FreeCiv</em>, <em>FlightGear</em>, and <em>BZFlag</em>. Also of note is <em>Craft: The Vicious Vikings</em>, another game which refused to build but has Linux binaries easily available as part of the craft_l35.tar.Z archive on SourceForge.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9713263161702323547gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9713263161702323547gol6.png"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11382696811702323548gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11382696811702323548gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p><em>Craft</em> is a rudimentary but functional real-time strategy game where you establish and then defend a Viking colony from attacks. Also on the CD-ROM is the multidirectional shooter <em>Maelstrom</em>, which again just ships by default with my Linux distribution, but is notable regardless for being an early port by Simple DirectMedia Layer creator and Loki Software lead coder Sam Lantinga. Honestly, the three games that grabbed my attention the most were three that were never finished.</p>
<p><em>Hatman - The Game of Kings</em> is an impressive but undercooked SVGAlib clone of <em>Pacman</em> which does have an RPM package on the disc but sadly had sound support disabled at compilation. There were a number of other <em>Pacman</em> clones featured, but this one had the most potential. Then there was the scrolling platformer prototype <em>The L.O.S.E.R Corps</em>, which again would not compile, but did from a later release from Tucows, which pleased me by using my MIDI synth hardware.</p>
<p>The third curiosity that I was not aware of before was <em>Tom Bombem: The Invasion of the Inanimate Objects</em> which once had the distinction of being affably rejected by Apogee Software. This would not compile for me as well, but I did discover that the game was later rebuilt using SDL, and this more modern version worked fine for me. First programmed by Vince Weaver back when he was sixteen in 1994, the game has a personality that too many of the other myriad games on the disc lack.</p>
<p>Some early 3D titles worth highlighting on this set are <em>Zarch</em>, although only the X11 variant ran, and <em>BattleBall</em>, both games where you take control of vehicles to battle human or computer players over simplified polygonal environments. An honourable mention also goes out to <em>Spellcast</em>, an X11 recreation of the pen and pencil wizard battler <em>Spellcaster</em>, which I did at long last get to compile by editing the Makefile to point XLIB to "/usr/X11R6/lib" instead of its default path. Small victories.</p>
<p>The ultimate fate of hemming GmbH was a tragic one, as the company faltered not long after the grisly murder of its founder in May 2001 near Andenne in Belgium. I do not feel it is appropriate to delve too much into the sordid details of the case here, but for those of you who are so inclined, you can add the name Olaf Hemming on to your true crime Linux bingo card alongside the likes of Hans Reiser or perhaps Ian Murdock. This is without getting into the white collar crime. Anyway, onto lighter matters.</p>

<p>David Szymanski + New Blood Interactive have released DUSK HD as a free DLC for the retro FPS, but you'll need Proton to play it on Linux Desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>It's been released as a free optional DLC, so you only have to play the remastered version if you want to. From the release <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/519860/view/3887232925348814769" target="_blank">announcement</a> they mentioned that DUSK HD started as "a fun way to beef up the DUSK Steam Workshop soon evolved into a full blown visual remaster thanks to the hard work of a group of very talented developers at New Blood". So now there's DUSK HD, an SDK for modders and Steam Workshop support.</p>
<p>Looks like their original Native Linux version, which is what Valve picked for the Steam Deck Verified badge, has not seen any updates. So, if you want to try out any of the fancy new stuff on Linux / Steam Deck, you'll need to manually swap the game over to use Proton. To do so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go into the game properties.</li>
<li>Pick the Compatibility menu.</li>
<li>Select Proton 8 or Proton Experimental from the drop-down box.</li>
</ul>
<p>New trailer is below:</p>

<p>Their modding support is still being worked on though as they had to "basically rewrite the entire game and engine from scratch" and so the <em>full</em> DUSK DDK (Dusk Development Kit) built on the new DUSK is "still a few weeks away" but once done "you will be able to play all the custom maps with both Classic or HD visuals, replace weapons, models and more". It even supports Quake and Half Life maps.</p>
<p>You can buy DUSK from:</p>

      <title>Build up and higher in Stellar Settlers a colony sim with vertical building</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This one has certainly made me curious, Tinymice Entertainment emailed over info on Stellar Settlers, a space-base colony building sim with a twist - you keep building vertically. While most similar games have you spread out more and more, here you're going higher and higher again!</p>
<p>"With unique vertical and horizontal base-building gameplay, take control of a settlement, build your own thriving colony on 5 hostile planets. Earn profits, buy parts &amp; build a better Starship, colonize even richer planets &amp; REPEAT!"</p>
<p>Have a look at their recent gameplay demo:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4gXWQzu3ihc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2cf3aa13529db58fc706513fc14e5df9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4gXWQzu3ihc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer mentioned clearly they're ensuring all updates to it are thoroughly tested on Linux and Steam Deck. An Early Access release is planned for March, 2024. Initially with 5 planets, they plan to double that to 10 through 1 year of Early Access to provide regular additions to the game's content. That's on top of plans for more structures, building pods, settler characters and more.</p>
<p>Check out the demo and playtest on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2628570/Stellar_Settlers/" target="_blank">Steam page</a>.</p>

      <title>Cassette Beasts gets a new multiplayer feature teaser - update coming early 2024</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cassette Beasts is probably one of the best modern creature collecting games around, and early in 2024 it's getting online multiplayer. This update was due this year but they said it needs a little more time in the oven to get it right.</p>
<p>Not heard of it before? It's a Steam Deck Verified and Native Linux game from developer Bytten Studio. Released in April 2023, it currently has an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam. You collect strange monsters with old cassette tapes, and use the fusion system to combine any two monsters together to make tons of different forms.</p>
<p>After getting a number of questions on the upcoming online update they've released a quick teaser on some of the features that will be added:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5Fw7ElAoyhM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6d1b718a57b27236e46b7b22b1244c43.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5Fw7ElAoyhM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>When playing online, you'll be able to:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Party up with up to 8 friends, all visible in your world!</li>
<li>Battle your friends, and even assign custom rules to your battle such as enabling/disabling sticker attributes!</li>
<li>Trade tapes with each other!</li>
<li>Team up for raid battles against Rogue Fusions!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>Something that's not entirely clear yet is if all features will allow for cross-play between platforms, they're hoping to make that more clear at some point later. Multiplayer is complicated enough for a small team even on a single platform but hopefully they will be able to do cross-play too.</p>

      <title>Tunnet has you dig deep underground while you build and debug a big network</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Build, debug and optimize a computer network in an underground facility. Tunnet is certainly something quite different and it's out now. "Have you ever wanted to be a lonely underpaid network technician who works 24/7 in an underground facility?", the developer asks. Well, I can't say I have and now there's a slightly freaky looking game for it.</p>
<p>Equipped with a drill to let you dig through tunnels to find and connect up various bunkers, you'll need to keep an eye-out for anything. Apparently things like to lurk in the dark. As you progress you'll earn more money, but it will get a bit more complicated over time with all the networking and things can (and probably will) go wrong.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6gxytilYoOM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1a9f7715112a8ac041cda4349430a047.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6gxytilYoOM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Build, optimize and debug a computer network in a first-person 3D environment.</li>
<li>Dig tunnels to access the different bunkers and connect them to the network.</li>
<li>Explore the facilities and unveil the secrets of the underground complex.</li>
<li>Find a way to access the computers guarded by the creepy monsters that haunt the bunkers.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can find it on <a href="https://puzzled-squid.itch.io/tunnet" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2286390/Tunnet/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Linux Mint 21.3 Beta out now with experimental Wayland support for Cinnamon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Linux Mint 21.3 is due to release soon with a first Beta now available, coming with the Cinnamon 6.0 desktop with experimental Wayland support.</p>
<p>Don't expect Wayland with Cinnamon to work all that well right now though, as they said it still lacks various features and has a few limitations but they want to ready it up as soon as possible — although still likely not planned to be default even in Mint 22.x so it's a while away to replace Xorg.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2714829391702302256gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2714829391702302256gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Cinnamon on Wayland</em></p>
<p>Cinnamon 6.0 also has various other improvements including:</p>
<ul>
<li>75% scaling is back.</li>
<li>Window opacity keybinding is back.</li>
<li>Stylus buttons can be disabled.</li>
<li>The monitor used for notifications is now configurable.</li>
<li>Menu apps can be edited with right click -&gt; properties.</li>
<li>Gestures: new desktop zoom action.</li>
<li>Gestures: You can now specify when an action is triggered.</li>
<li>Sound applet: new shift-middle click action.</li>
<li>Grouped window list: new option to not show anything when hovering an app button.</li>
<li>New "Spices" (addons) support for the right-click actions menu in the Nemo file manager.</li>
</ul>
<p>The file-sharing application Warpinator also gained some new tricks like being able to manually connect to another device by its IP or by scanning a QR code. Their Hypnotix TV viewer application also gained new features like favourite channels, create custom channels and it can update its own version of yt-dlp for YouTube changes.</p>
<p>Linux Mint 21.3 will use the kernel 5.15 and Ubuntu 22.04 as a base and receive security updates until 2027.</p>

      <title>Eviternity II is a massive 36-map megawad for DOOM II</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Not enough DOOM in your life? How about trying out the massive release of <a href="https://eviternity.dfdoom.com/" target="_blank">Eviternity II</a>, a full 36-map megawad sequel to Eviternity.</p>
<p>More: "Eviternity II is a full 36-map megawad sequel to Eviternity; comprised of six 5-map Chapters, each with an additional secret level. Making extensive use of a newly updated build of the OTEX texture pack (to be released as a standalone texture pack in the future), Eviternity II’s six chapters explore a series of unique and varied themes, continuing on from where you left off after the Archangelus’ defeat!"</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19773545591702300385gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19773545591702300385gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Key Artwork by Robert Sammelin.</em></p>
<p>You need to play it with the original DOOM II wad file (<a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/doom_ii" target="_blank">GOG</a>) and an installed recent version of GZDoom.</p>
<p>Place your wad file for DOOM II into the gzdoom config folder of a normal install like here:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">~/.config/gzdoom/</code></p>
<p>But for Flatpak / Flathub it would be here:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">~/.var/app/org.zdoom.GZDoom/.config/gzdoom/</code></p>
<p>Download Eviternity II from the <a href="https://eviternity.dfdoom.com/" target="_blank">official site</a>, unzip it, and place the Eviternity II RC1.wad file into the same folder as above. Then you can launch it like so:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">gzdoom -iwad DOOM2.WAD -file 'Eviternity II RC1.wad'</code></p>
<p>And the launch for Flatpak / Flathub:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">flatpak run org.zdoom.GZDoom -iwad ~/.var/app/org.zdoom.GZDoom/.config/gzdoom/DOOM2.WAD -file ~/.var/app/org.zdoom.GZDoom/.config/gzdoom/'Eviternity II RC1.wad'</code></p>

      <title>Voxel Doom II gets updated with Parallax Textures</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Continuing the day of DOOM announcements following the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/sigil-ii-from-john-romero-out-now-for-classic-doom/" target="_blank">release of SIGIL II</a>, we also have a big update to Voxel Doom II.</p>
<p>What is it: Voxel Doom II is the follow up to 2022's award-winning Voxel Doom. This is a new graphics mod that replaces all monsters, weapons, props and items with fully 3d voxel models. It replaces all monsters from both Doom and Doom II.</p>
<p>The latest update version 2.2 released December 9th upgrades it with Parallax Textures and you can see it shown off a bit in their new trailer below:</p>

<p>To play it with either DOOM (<a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/doom_1993" target="_blank">GOG</a>) or DOOM II (<a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/doom_ii" target="_blank">GOG</a>) you need a copy of each game for the main wad file, plus make sure you have at least GZDoom 4.10.0 or later. Place your wad file for the original game into the gzdoom config folder of a normal install like here:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">~/.config/gzdoom/</code></p>
<p>But for Flatpak / Flathub it would be here:</p>

<p>Download the Voxel Doom II mod <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/voxel-doom-ii" target="_blank">from Mod DB</a>, unzip it, and then place the voxel_parallax_doomII.pk3 file into the same folder as above and then you can just run it like so for original DOOM:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">gzdoom -iwad DOOM.WAD -file voxel_parallax_doomII.pk3</code></p>
<p>And the launch for Flatpak / Flathub:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">flatpak run org.zdoom.GZDoom -iwad ~/.var/app/org.zdoom.GZDoom/.config/gzdoom/DOOM.WAD -file ~/.var/app/org.zdoom.GZDoom/.config/gzdoom/voxel_parallax_doomII.pk3</code></p>

      <title>SIGIL II from John Romero out now for classic DOOM</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>To go along with the 30th anniversary of DOOM, John Romero has released SIGIL II, a second megawad to blast through with 9 new levels. Available free from the <a href="https://romero.com/sigil" target="_blank">official site</a>, or you can buy different editions that come with different things.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Embark on a nostalgic nightmare: Immerse yourself in the dark, demonic world of DOOM like never before. John Romero, the original Icon of Sin, takes you on a terrifying journey to commemorate the 30th anniversary of this legendary, first-person shooter. SIGIL II is DOOM's unofficial sixth episode.</p>
<p>Upon breaching the pentagram of invulnerability in the final moments of SIGIL, Episode Five, you find yourself not on a victorious journey back to save Earth, but caught in Baphomet's cunning snare, catapulted into a new, grotesque domain of relentless torment, unending demon hordes, and an onslaught of heavy metal mayhem!</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5162536331702297032gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5162536331702297032gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><em>Will you be giving it a go?</em></p>
<p>To play it on Linux you need a copy of <a href="https://zdoom.org/" target="_blank">GZDoom</a> installed, along with the wad file from DOOM (<a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/doom_1993" target="_blank">GOG</a> / <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2280/DOOM_1993/" target="_blank">Steam</a>). You'll need to make sure your DOOM wad file is in the correct location which for standard installs will be:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">~/.config/gzdoom/</code></p>
<p>And for Flatpak / Flathub installs it will be:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">~/.var/app/org.zdoom.GZDoom/.config/gzdoom/</code></p>
<p>And then place the SIGIL II file into the same folder.</p>
<p>Then to run you via terminal (or with your favourite launcher) with a standard install:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">gzdoom -iwad DOOM.WAD -file SIGIL_II_V1_0.WAD</code></p>
<p>And again for Flatpak / Flathub:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">flatpak run org.zdoom.GZDoom -iwad ~/.var/app/org.zdoom.GZDoom/.config/gzdoom/DOOM.WAD -file ~/.var/app/org.zdoom.GZDoom/.config/gzdoom/SIGIL_II_V1_0.WAD</code></p>

      <title>Wine 9.0 has a first Release Candidate released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The time is approaching for the next major version bump to the Windows compatibility layer Wine, with Wine 9.0 Release Candidate 1 now available.</p>
<p>With this release the yearly code freeze has begun, so no new features will be making it in after this point, only bug fixes until the main Wine 9.0 release to ensure it's as stable as possible.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://www.winehq.org/announce/9.0-rc1" target="_blank">what new</a> in Wine 9.0 RC1:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Bundled vkd3d upgraded to version 1.10.</li>
<li>Support for DH encryption keys with a recent GnuTLS.</li>
<li>Keyboard layouts support in the Wayland driver.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For bug fixes they noted 42 solved as of this release including fixes for: For Honor, STEEP, Far Cry 5, Rockstar Games Launcher, GTA V, and Red Dead Redemption 2, Need for Speed: Most Wanted, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2, Eurobattle, ModOrganizer and more.</p>
<p>vkd3d is their own Direct3D to Vulkan translation layer, not to be confused with VKD3D-Proton from Valve. The 1.10 release also only went up on December 6th with these highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>libvkd3d exposes various newer Direct3D 12 interfaces.</li>
<li>The HLSL compiler supports dynamic indexing of arrays.</li>
<li>libvkd3d-utils implements various helper functions for manipulating DXBC blobs.</li>
<li>Miscellaneous bug fixes.</li>

      <title>World of Goo 2 announced for release in 2024</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>2D Boy and Tomorrow Corporation are coming back for one more run, with World of Goo 2 being announced and it looks glorious. They also note it's the "biggest game we've ever made". The original was one of the earliest full indie games to be given a Native Linux version, and to this day is still one of my favourites.</p>
<p>Not much has actually been said about it yet though only that it's big. The first game came out 15 years ago so a lot has changed in that time but I'm definitely excited to learn more.</p>
<p>Check out the first trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6rGroEFNEpI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d5aea6a9f34c0dc1dcae48e530d3bd22.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6rGroEFNEpI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Now, while no platforms have been announced yet, here's a fun little titbit for you: in the YouTube trailer description, they note "Video edited with Kdenlive on Linux Mint". Just a little fun thing to see developers using free and open source tools and noting it like so.</p>
<p>It's due to release some time in 2024. Follow on the <a href="https://worldofgoo2.com/" target="_blank">official website</a>.</p>

<p>Love a challenge and don't get your brain in a twist easily? GRIDROAD is a fun idea putting you in charge of building roads and optimizing traffic. Imagine something like the popular <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/08/mini-metro-now-lets-you-build-up-one-of-europes-oldest-metro-systems-in-budapest/" target="_blank">Mini Metro</a>, but quite a bit more puzzling as you deal directly with the exact flow of all the traffic.</p>
<p>The developer sent a key to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4218320-GamingOnLinux/" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux Steam Curator</a> and it's been making my brain sweat a bit.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bNHHniPXvCA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/201f1d98b1c222ce2f8e017db26752bf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bNHHniPXvCA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This is the first game from developer RAJACORP, and while simple it does exactly what you expect it to and the design is so clean it's great. If you love puzzle sims this is one you should take a look at and it works perfectly. Currently you'll get a couple of hours out of it but the developer has plans to expand it with a lot more levels, online leaderboards, sharing of level solutions, a custom level editor and browser, Steam features like cards and achievements and more.</p>
<p>Fantastic start for a puzzler.</p>
<p>Available in Early Access with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2677310/GRIDROAD/" target="_blank">Native Linux support on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Cautiously hyped for Light No Fire from the No Man&#39;s Sky team at Hello Games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Light No Fire is another interesting game announcement coming from The Game Awards 2023, coming from Hello Games, the crew that created No Man's Sky.</p>
<p>What is it? A game about adventure, building, survival and exploration together. What makes it interesting, is the claim that the world is literally the size of planet Earth. An open-world survival adventure with "a scale never attempted before". The idea and style of it look pretty great:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="jKQem4Z6ioQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8f9170682fbf849676234d7d36979615.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/jKQem4Z6ioQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I'm excited, but cautiously so. Since we all know by now what happened with No Man's Sky. While it's an objectively good game now, the release state was not what was expected full of over-promise and under-delivering. Hopefully Hello Games learned a valuable lesson on that one. Then again…</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3086742291702035489gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3086742291702035489gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
Source: <a href="https://twitter.com/NoMansSky/status/1732979907314225593" target="_blank">X/Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully like No Man's Sky it will have Vulkan API support, so that playing it on Desktop Linux or Steam Deck with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Valve's Steam Play Proton</a> will give a good experience!</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A Multiplayer Earth - Carve a life together. Meet players from across the globe, build a life, explore and survive together. Construct persistent buildings and communities, or strike out alone to discover the world for others.</li>
<li>A Procedural Earth - A truly open world, with no boundaries at a scale never attempted before. A massively varied and dense planet filled with immersive biomes, unique enemies and valuable resources to discover.</li>
<li>A Fantasy Earth - Light No Fire presents you with an ancient earth to uncover. One where you're not the hero. Thick with lore, mystery and a constant fight for survival. Inspired by the adventure, charm and imagination that we love from classic fantasy.</li>
<li>An Unexplored Earth - Every mountain can be climbed, and below them lie endless vistas, oceans and continents perhaps no others have seen. Who will climb the tallest mountains, who will find the deepest sea? Set sail across vast oceans and rivers, ride wild beasts through fantastical landscapes, fly dragons over undiscovered landscapes.</li>
</ul>

      <title>SEGA tease new Jet Set Radio, Shinobi, Golden Axe, Streets of Rage and Crazy Taxi</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Game Awards 2023 are over and I'm going over some of the interesting bits that were announced, like SEGA deciding to just go nuts.</p>
<p>SEGA decided to come along in style and blow away all expectations announcing not one, not two — but <em>five</em> new games in development and all are modern takes on some true classics including Jet Set Radio, Shinobi, Golden Axe, Streets of Rage, and Crazy Taxi.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0VHYLJR9pNg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1c2042a665d4f8a51fbbda73a58b13cc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0VHYLJR9pNg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“In recent years, Sonic the Hedgehog has forged new paths for SEGA, bringing the franchise to life and reaching new audiences in ways we had only dreamed of in the past. Building off that success, we are digging into our legacy and reimagining several franchises to bring these games to more audiences around the globe,” says Co-COO of SEGA Corporation and CEO of SEGA of America, Shuji Utsumi. “Today's announcement is just the start of our initiative. First and foremost, our ambition will be to create great games with memorable characters and worlds. We hope fans of all ages will look towards our future with anticipation as we release these projects in the coming years.”</p>
<p>Naturally, thanks to Valve's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a>, it's likely all of them will be playable on Linux / Steam Deck on or shortly after release in some form.</p>
<p>Are you as excited as I am?</p>

      <title>DOS_deck brings DOS games to your browser with a Steam Deck interface</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is a fun idea for classic games. DOS_deck is a website where you can go and play some classic DOS games right in the browser with an interface much like the Steam Deck / Steam Big Picture Mode. Clever stuff making use of DOSBox thanks to <a href="https://js-dos.com/" target="_blank">JS-DOS</a>, allowing it to run games in a browser.</p>
<p>DOS_deck takes it a step further though wrapping it up in a cozy interface and brings with it controller support, automatic game saving when you quit, a virtual keyboard when you need it and of course cross-platform support since you can play it almost anywhere.</p>
<p>It's quite limited in the selection of available titles though, since they can only put up games that are verified to be either Shareware, Freeware, Demos or games that were made public domain.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12502984341702031332gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12502984341702031332gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Love ideas like this. Hopefully they will be able to keep on expanding it to include many more games.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck Beta and SteamOS Preview fix up some annoying issues</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve recently put up a fresh Steam Deck Client Beta, along with a new SteamOS Preview release and together they fix some important issues that appeared.</p>
<p>The first was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3880477342183060657" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.5.10 Preview 'More Tangible'</a> which included a fix for "an issue introduced in a previous preview build where touchpad clicks to fail to register in some circumstances".</p>

      <title>W4 Games raises $15M to help push Godot Engine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>W4 Games, the company set up by <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> veterans Juan Linietsky, Rémi Verschelde and Fabio Alessandrelli, along with veteran entrepreneur Nicola Farronato just received a rather large sum of funding.</p>
<p>Announced in a <a href="https://w4games.com/2023/12/07/w4-games-raises-15m-to-drive-video-game-development-inflection-with-godot-engine/" target="_blank">blog post</a> today it mentions they've raised $15M in "Series A funding" from a mixture of sources including "OSS Capital and Naval Ravikant (AngelList and AirChat co-founder). Other investors include Justin Hoffman (Ex Elastic), Larry Augustin (Ex SugarCRM), Alex Atallah (Co-founder of OpenSea), Thomas Dohmke (CEO of GitHub), Diogo Mónica (Founder of Anchorage Digital), Scott Williamson (Ex GitLab) and more notable founders and executives in the commercial open-source ecosystem".</p>
<p>This is a pretty impressive sum to me, but this kind of money actually gets thrown around a lot. It's notable to us here at GamingOnLinux though since this money will go into pushing the free and open source Godot Engine.</p>
<p>What will they be using the funding for? W4 Games plan to more than double their staff over the next 18 months, and they will use all of it to "strengthen our role within the Godot ecosystem by supporting its open-source development and continuing to build products and services to facilitate Godot’s expansion, such as W4 Consoles (an approved middleware console porting solution for Godot games) and W4 Cloud (multi-tenant service to support millions of users)" along with expansion plans across North America, Europe, and Asia and a new Godot education program.</p>
<p>Naturally, these type of investments depend on W4 Games having a business plan for long-term profit, since the people and companies that invest will want a return on it. With W4 Games' work on getting Godot Engine supported fully on consoles (which they can't have in the main open source code due to the secrecy of console companies), and the increasing popularity of Godot — it should be interesting to see what happens.</p>
<p><em>What are your thoughts on this?</em></p>

<p>That's on top of KOMODO also selling them online on their <a href="https://steamdeck.komodo.jp/" target="_blank">official site</a>, where it has been repeatedly sold out. Currently still, the 512GB model is out of stock so demand is clearly there. All great news to get this Linux-powered device into more hands.</p>

      <title>Dig Dig Boom is a charming looking turn-based puzzle mining roguelike</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Turn-based puzzle mining in a highly dynamic destructible world, Dig Dig Boom looks like a charming game you should stick on your wishlist. Coming out sometime in 2024 made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, it looks like a blast.</p>
<p>Making it interesting, time only moves when you move. So you get to plan everything at your own pace, and only have the game progress when you want it to.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16094125261701957161gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16094125261701957161gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>"The world of Dig Dig Boom is planned to contain both handcrafted and procedurally generated content. Alongside this is a fully fledged in-game level editor, enabling player-made content. The handcrafted content functions as a controlled introduction to new mechanics. The procedurally generated caves provide a unique challenge for each run, in the style of a classic roguelike dungeon crawling game. The Roguelike aspect draws inspiration from modern roguelikes like Spelunky, Crypt of the Necrodancer and Noita."</p>
<p>Really sounds and looks rather good, and with the turn-based style to it it should satisfy explorers who like things just that little bit less chaotic.</p>

      <title>Kind Words 2 (lofi city pop) announced - a game about being kind to real people</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Remember the game Kind Words? A tiny little thing that came out in 2019 that let you send letters to real people, along with listening to some chill beats. Well, it's getting an expanded sequel with Kind Words 2 (lofi city pop).</p>
<p>The first game was quite the hit with an Overwhelmingly Positive rating from over 7,000 user reviews on Steam. No doubt this one will be just as popular in the new setting. Especially since Kind Words 2 takes the original, re-makes it with lots of improvements and then expands it quite a lot and you'll be able to swap letter and stickers with players across both games. Now though it adds in getting dressed up, going to a poetry slam at a coffee shop and more.</p>
<p>Check out the reveal trailer:</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Beat 'N' Path sounds like a fun game for the creative mind, that has you design and build various machines to produce music across a career mode and a sandbox to create whatever you want. Coming from the same team that made Balloonatics and Groove Gunner, it looks quite the delight.</p>

      <title>You absolutely need to try Mechabellum during the Steam Free Weekend</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mechabellum has sucked away more of my time than I would care to admit right now, and you too can see what all the fuss is about during the Steam Free Weekend. <em>Disclosure: my key was originally sent by TriplePoint PR.</em></p>
<p>A strategy game that doesn't take a lot of time to get through, since it's focus is the online PvP battles which generally only take a few minutes at a time. It's like a very cut-down version of Supreme Commander, with lots of explosions and varied unit types but for those who don't have hours and hours to spare constantly. It scratches an itch for me, and it really will suck you into "oh go on then, just one more game" as you want to try out a different strategy on another player.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5130095391701953434gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5130095391701953434gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
Pictured - Mechabellum on Linux, from a battle I had today.</em></p>
<p>It's not a traditional strategy game though. It's a round-based auto-battler. You pick your starting units and commander, and then each round you pick new units, upgrade, move things around and more. There's a lot of strategy to it, and it can take quite a while to get good at it. I just love the destruction of all the different unit types going at it. Wonderful stuff.</p>
<p>On Linux with Proton 8, it's pretty much flawless. Works great with good performance and looks awesome.</p>
<p>It will be free to try between December 7th, 6PM UTC - December 11th. They will also be running a discount on the game from December 9th - December 15th. One thing to note, is that eventually it will go free to play though with people who purchase getting some exclusive content.</p>
<p>For all the hours I have in it, I'm really happy with this one. Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/669330/Mechabellum/" target="_blank">out on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Vampire Survivors - Adventures Update out now, plus Among Us collab DLC coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this is quite unexpected. Vampire Survivors is getting a new DLC later this month with an Among Us cross-over. Plus, a big update is also out now.</p>
<p>First up, the free Adventures Update which brings with it self-contained, mini story-modes that remix the game's content. They will keep expanding this but the first initial part out now adds in:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">1 relic, Atlas Gate: Enables base game Adventures. Found in Boss Rash, minute 7.</div>
</li>
<li>1 new achievement for obtaining the Atlas Gate (in-game only. Will be added to the list on Steam together with the next content patch, your 100% is safe for the rest of the year!).</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">2 base game Adventures.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">1 Adventure for the Legacy of the Moonspell DLC.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Developer poncle said part of the point is to "actually to give you an excuse to play VS when you feel like it, but have already unlocked everything the game has to offer" on top of giving you a "feeling of starting fresh, with a different set of weapons, without actually remaining behind with the progression of the base game"</p>
<p>As for the Vampire Survivors: Emergency Meeting DLC, they took some elements of Among Us and "freely re-interpreted them in a Vampire Survivors spin, for some outrageous, ridiculous, and hopefully fun, combinations of characters and weapons". Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1WMUJ_YMPlY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/320934630b023a6dd59bf9080b0708cf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1WMUJ_YMPlY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Vampire Survivors: Emergency Meeting DLC releases December 18th for $2.49 / €2.49 / £1.99. It's pretty content packed too with multiple characters, 15 new weapons, a new stage and new music. I'm totally sold already.</p>
<p>The game has Native Linux support (still not advertised) and it is Steam Deck Verified. It's also <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/heres-the-most-played-steam-deck-games-for-november-2023/" target="_blank">regularly one of the most played games on Steam Deck</a>.</p>
<p>Buy it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/" target="_blank">from Steam</a>.</p>
