      <title>Get a couple treats in the new Linux &amp; Thrills bundle on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hanoi Studios have today put up their second multi-developer bundle on Steam, with a primary focus on highlighting studios that support Linux. Their first bundle was Linux &amp; Chill that went live on Steam <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/07/netflix-and-chill-nah-how-about-some-linux-a-chill/" target="_blank">back in 2021</a> and now we have a new collection.</p>
<p>Giordano Pereira of Hanoi Studios emailed in recently to mention "One of our key initiatives is to develop games for every kind of gamers, that's why we always port our games to every single OS, including Linux."</p>
<p>This new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/26121/Linux__Thrills/" target="_blank">Linux &amp; Thrills bundle</a> includes:</p>
<ul>

      <title>Covert Critter is basically Metal Gear Solid with lizards</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sneaking out at some point, Covert Critter is an upcoming stealth action game that will have Native Linux support. It's also pretty much Metal Gear Solid with animals. No really, it looks exactly like the classic and is obviously something of a homage to it and a demo is available.</p>
<p>"You are special reptile operative Koss. With a unique array of gadgets and stealth-based abilities at your disposal, you must infiltrate the compromised GEKO Facility to disarm a slew of tyrannical terrorists known only as the Red Hawks.</p>
<p>Covert Critter is a top-down sneaking game and retro throwback to stealth titles of the mid to late 90's. As Koss, your goal is to navigate through each of the 10 unique stages, all while remaining silent and out of the enemy's sight. The Red Hawks are vigilant creatures, armed to the beak, and around every corner of the facility."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5394040311660836978gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5394040311660836978gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<ul>
<li>An engaging story of heroism, espionage, and animals. Deriving inspiration from action and spy flicks of a bygone era, Covert Critter will host short but memorable cutscenes to carry a narrative along as you complete each scenario.</li>
<li>An impressive arsenal of bitchin' gadgets. Deployable boomboxes, mystery gift boxes, recon drones, and more are scattered throughout the stages. Each one you find is an invaluable asset for any situation while in the field.</li>
<li>Put your best stealth and evasion skills to the test. Your application of speed, luck, and wits are all graded for a combined rank. Circumvent traps, remain swift, avoid enemy contact, and you may just be rewarded something for future scenarios.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the full version of the game they plan to add in controller support, an expanded story, accessibility options and more. The full game release is planned for next year, with an updated demo appearing at some point.</p>
<p>Just couldn't resist giving this one a quick go.Â Note that the Linux demo worked fine on my desktop, but on Steam Deck the UI did not render correctly. Could be a problem in Unity or a bug in the AMD GPU driver on Steam Deck so there you have to use the Windows version with Proton. Here's some footage from the demo:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FMWxMAd_NJQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ee01b5d0807aa7bda31439862a7bc992.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FMWxMAd_NJQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can follow it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2111370/Covert_Critter/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and try an older demo on <a href="https://sodaraptor.itch.io/covert-critter" target="_blank">itch.io</a>.</p>

      <title>Embracer Group to swallow up Tripwire, Tuxedo Labs, The Lord of the Rings</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Embracer Group are quite terrifying. The amount of power they have in the gaming industry is simply insane and now they're swallowing up more studios and even the full rights to The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit.</p>
<p>Announced across multiple <a href="https://embracer.com/investors/press-releases/" target="_blank">press releases</a> today they've put out their intention to acquire:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limited Run Games - who make physical releases for collectors. This deal will also include something called "Carbon Engine", which is a tech they developed "that allows legacy content and retro games to be effortlessly put out in highly accurate, emulation-based ports for modern platforms".</li>
<li>Singtrix - an award-winning creator of industry leading vocal processing effects technology for karaoke, gaming, and entertainment.</li>
<li>Middle-earth Enterprises - so they will own the full worldwide rights to The Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Hobbit and other Middle-earth-related works across motion pictures, video games, board games, merchandising, theme parks and stage productions. So they won't own the actual literary works, just the IP rights to do basically anything with them.</li>
<li>Tuxedo Labs - they made the pretty awesome game Teardown.</li>
<li>Tripwire Interactive - developed the Killing Floor and Rising Storm games.</li>
</ul>
<p>How long before Embracer Group buy up the rest of the internet? I'm expecting a knock on the door soon, kidding of course.</p>

      <title>SteamOS 3.4 Beta to update the Arch Linux base, new Steam Deck updates out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has announced three things recently including multiple updates that are out now for the Steam Deck, plus a quick tease of what's to come for a Beta of SteamOS 3.4.</p>
<p>Firstly, a new SteamOS update is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3376031059788513870" target="_blank">out now</a> in the Stable and Beta channels that pulls these changes over from Preview:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Temporarily reverted RDR2 VRAM workaround to pre-3.3 behavior</li>
<li>Fixed an issue causing random 0.2s stutter</li>
<li>Fixed an issue causing performance drops when a UI element appeared on screen if the performance HUD was enabled.</li>
<li>Improved performance for Forza Horizon 5</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's also a Steam Deck Client Beta update <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3376031059787746651" target="_blank">out now</a> for those in the Beta and Preview update channels with these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="bbcodes_Header3_KePJs BB_Header3 eventbbcodeparser_Header3_AX80F"><strong>Steam Input</strong></div>
<ul>
<li>Allow users to remove community layouts that they've created. Users who have this config selected won't lose it, but it will no longer be listed in the community layouts.</li>
<li>Removed a check which would only show your layouts in your personal layouts, even when shared with the community - this was causing users to think their configuration has not been exported.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug on saving configurations where the controller type could attempt to use a cached valued which was incorrect, causing the layout controller type to appear to be incorrect.</li>
<li>Changed the OSK chord to be on button release instead of press to resolve some issues with focus on the desktop window.</li>
<li>Added Shared Layout preview of layouts which shows a layout and allows it to be optionally assigned. If the user clicks on a steam url link to a config (via chat for example) while in Game Mode, this will be shown.</li>
<li>Added support for Nintendo Joy-Cons</li>
<li>Improved FlickStick mode</li>
</ul>
<div class="bbcodes_Header3_KePJs BB_Header3 eventbbcodeparser_Header3_AX80F"><strong>Other</strong></div>
<ul>
<li>Added Discovery Queue to Home screen under the Recommended tab</li>
<li>No longer showing a Steam Cloud sync error notification when installing a game</li>
<li>Fixed issue where a 2.9GB read-only library is displayed when the microSD card is unmounted manually</li>
<li>Added game resolution setting to non-Steam app properties</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>On top of that and perhaps even more exciting, is that a Beta version of SteamOS 3.4 is on the way. Confirmed on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1560015983317696514" target="_blank">Twitter</a> by Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais, who mentioned it's being worked on right now and it will "contain an update to the Arch base". SteamOS basically uses a snapshot of Arch Linux, along with tweaks and changes that Valve do, so with SteamOS 3.4 we're likely to see an updated Linux kernel, updated KDE Plasma for desktop mode and a whole lot more updated software.</p>

      <title>Spellbook Demonslayers is the most insane Vampire Survivors-like yet</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You've put 100+ hours into Vampire Survivors and now what? Spellbook Demonslayers is what and there's a free prologue available for you to try out.</p>
<p>For those confused who haven't played anything like it: it's pretty much a reverse bullet-hell with <em>you</em> firing off tons of abilities automatically against tons of waves of enemies. You pick up gems from fallen enemies to level up and pick new skills and upgrades. Boss enemies also drop chests, which you can pick up for ability upgrades too.</p>
<p>It's been creeping up the popular list on Steam, since it's free and Vampire Survivors and anything like it is the current hot indie trend. Easy to see why they're popular though, since half the time you can turn off your brain and all games like it cost next to nothing. Spellbook Demonslayers mixes things up with some wonderful metal tunes, some really great enemy design that feels a lot more alive than others I've played and plenty of meta-progression too.</p>
<p>Here's my footage:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yz4dZTKcYEY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ee12cbe3e34aa30c9910ee1bed1b13c8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yz4dZTKcYEY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With the full release the developer has plans to have many more characters, maps, difficulty options, enemies, bosses, a bigger permanent upgrade system and the list goes on.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2070390/Spellbook_Demonslayers_Prologue/" target="_blank">free prologue on Steam</a>. Works out of the box on Linux and Steam Deck with Proton.</p>

      <title>Blossom Tales 2: The Minotaur Prince out with Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Blossom Tales 2: The Minotaur Prince is a new Native Linux release from Castle Pixel and Playtonic Friends. It hasn't been Steam Deck Verified yet but works great. This is yet another title that developer <a href="https://twitter.com/flibitijibibo" target="_blank">Ethan Lee</a> helped to bring to Linux (like the recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/axiom-verge-2-lands-on-steam-with-linux-support-and-steam-deck-verified/" target="_blank">Axiom Verge 2</a>), with it powered by <a href="https://fna-xna.github.io/" target="_blank">FNA</a> so you can expect a quality port.</p>
<p>A classic and very colourful action-adventure, following on from the 2017 indie hit. However, you don't need to know anything from the first game as it's fully standalone and set hundreds of years later.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="gCYDZ9FhQUY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2a40819319b468d33dfd37896d927b1d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/gCYDZ9FhQUY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Minotaur King has returned...and it's all your fault! Lily's back for a new "classic" action-adventure set hundreds of years after The Sleeping King!</p>
<p>Grandpa's latest tale takes you on a journey through haunted forests, pirate shores, and other mysterious lands across a vast open-world! Charming towns, terrible enemies, tricky puzzles, and powerful weapons await you.</p>
<p>Enjoy a "story within a story" as Grandpa narrates exciting moments throughout Lily's incredible adventure.<br/>
Will you help Lily defeat the Minotaur King and save her brother?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Compelling main story plus engaging side-quests</li>
<li>Classic top-down action-adventure in a retro 2d environment</li>
<li>Dozens of mini-dungeons, caves, and locations to discover</li>
<li>Choices that influence story and events</li>
<li>A wide array of weapons and abilities</li>
<li>15+ hours of gameplay</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The game works great on Steam Deck and will no doubt get a Verified rating whenever Valve get to it. Here's some footage from my Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="O197PbSDNkw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/63c2028409225f91aec4494d97a0faee.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/O197PbSDNkw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

      <title>Fun games for Steam Deck that won&#39;t break the bank</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Looking for some games to play on Steam Deck that are good, work well and don't cost too much? Here's a few choice picks from me to you.</p>
<p>While there's a number of game lists and videos from various websites and creators, a lot only seem to focus on the top "best" games. Usually, they're made up of the latest AA / AAA. As always, I like to be different. So going over my Steam library and picking out some absolute gems, here's some suggestions with a nice varied mix. All tested directly by me.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="--VmLCYSD_0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/56c0ce8462fdc2dbd8e70a46cb5bd014.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/--VmLCYSD_0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The games mentioned and shown are:</p>

      <title>Airships: Conquer the Skies gets co-op and direct ship control</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Airships: Conquer the Skies is a wonderful Native Linux indie game about constructing various vehicles and conquering everything you can with them.</p>
<p>This isn't a simplistic game of just snapping blocks together either. There's a big array of different modules, weapons, armour types, equipment and more to build your perfect craft. Plenty of detail in them too with sailors you see running around doing their little tasks. Honestly it's great.</p>
<p>With the new update out you can now play in co-op with any number of players and / or AIs on each side, with custom multiplayer battles as well. The game also is no longer 100% pure destruction, with a diplomacy system in so you can form all sorts of deals with others. Even the civilization side of it is now has more depth to it with city upgrades and new buildings. One feature that also wasn't known about before is a way to now directly control craft, which sounds pretty fun.</p>
<p>Showing off the new direct control feature, the developer put up a little video on it as it was a secret:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="r94P1LZ8fYI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a85b90eb260792d22cd61a863f654f84.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/r94P1LZ8fYI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A bunch of other features were also added in this update including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Eight new music tracks by renowned musician Curtis Schweitzer.</li>
<li>Unrest and supply mechanics.</li>
<li>Revamped espionage system.</li>
<li>Optional combat autoresolve.</li>
<li>Prettier map.</li>
<li>New fleet designs contributed by the community.</li>
<li>Reactive hint system for conquest.</li>
<li>Many more achievements.</li>
<li>Updated user interface appearance.</li>
<li>Ability to request siege assistance from your allies.</li>
<li>New weather and landscape including deserts.</li>
<li>New technologies and modules.</li>
<li>All translations should be up to date, for once.</li>
<li>In-game manual (English only).</li>
<li>Local defense budgets.</li>
<li>New heraldic charges and abilities.</li>
<li>Tooltip values now describe what influences them.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The dev mentioned this update concludes development of the game, as they move over to bug fixes. However, sounds like a DLC expansion is likely to come to expand it.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck gets a Stable Client update with Offline Mode fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Not long after a bunch of changes rolled out to Preview and Beta, Valve has updated the Steam Deck Client software with various improvements. These are all changes I've covered just recently in other articles.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3401926123937490701" target="_blank">changelog</a> is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Offline Mode Fixes</strong><br/>
We're continuing to look at making the user experience of playing games without an Internet connection a better, more intuitive experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue where rebooting while in Steam Offline Mode would cause games to fail to launch</li>
<li>Fixed the Cloud Sync error notification popping up when offline</li>
<li>Disabled Steam Offline Mode button when not connected to the internet, as trying to do this currently gets Steam Deck into a bad state.
	<ul>
<li>This change disables this button but does not in any way affect your ability to play games without an active Internet connection.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Keyboard</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed styling for CJK keyboard glyphs so everything appears centered correctly on keys</li>
<li>Fixed Recommended Layout not always showing up for the author of controller configuration</li>
<li>Fixed CJK font issues in SteamOS updater when running on Steam Deck</li>
<li>Fixed focus issue when tapping the show/hide password button</li>
<li>Removed the gap between keys on the virtual keyboard for improved typing</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Temporarily disabling hot / cold temperature notifications while we address issues with false positives</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As I mentioned <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/valve-improves-steam-deck-offline-mode/" target="_blank">in the last article</a> about the Offline Mode changes: the problem of course is that Steam is an online store, and until now they haven't really needed to do all that much with offline mode since they largely assumed people were always online. With the Steam Deck though, that's not the case, it's a handheld designed to be taken with you so it's another older area of Steam to need some effort.</p>
<p>Even so, it's actually a little bit surprising that Offline Mode wasn't improved a lot before the Steam Deck released, it's a bit of an odd one for Valve not to focus on previously considering it is a handheld but they're starting to make up for it now.</p>

      <title>Valve dev understandably not happy about glibc breaking Easy Anti-Cheat on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/easy-anti-cheat-not-working-on-linux-seems-a-glibc-update-broke-it/" target="_blank">Recently it was noticed</a> that users on more bleeding-edge Linux distributions that updated saw Easy Anti-Cheat no longer working on Linux, the culprit was glibc and now a Valve developer has spoken out about it.</p>
<p>Writing in a small thread on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1559683905904463873" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunate that upstream glibc discussion on DT_HASH isn't coming out strongly in favor of prioritizing compatibility with pre-existing applications. Every such instance contributes to damaging the idea of desktop Linux as a viable target for third-party developers.</p>
<p>Our thoughts on the topic from this prior compatibility issue in BlueZ apply more than ever: <a href="https://github.com/bluez/bluez/commit/35a2c50437cca4d26ac6537ce3a964bb509c9b62#commitcomment-56028543" target="_blank">https://github.com/bluez/bluez/commit/35a2c50437cca4d26ac6537ce3a964bb509c9b62#commitcomment-56028543</a><br/>
It is unfortunately yet another entry in a growing list over the years.</p>
<p>We understand that working with a focus on compatibility requires more resources and more engineering trade-offs, but strongly believe it is nonetheless the way to go. We are very interested in helping with any underlying resource constraints.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This prompted CodeWeavers (who work on Wine and with Valve on Proton) developerÂ Arek Hiler to write a blog post titled "<a href="https://blog.hiler.eu/win32-the-only-stable-abi/" target="_blank">Win32 Is The Only Stable ABI on Linux</a>" and their ending statement is something people should think on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think this whole situation shows why creating native games for Linux is challenging. Itâs hard to blame developers for targeting Windows and relying on Wine + friends. Itâs just much more stable and much less likely to break and stay broken.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hiler certainly isn't the only one to think like that, with another CodeWeavers developer Andrew Eikum <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22922774" target="_blank">mentioning</a> on Hacker News some time ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a long-time Linux dev (see my profile), I have also found this to be true. Linux userland APIs are unstable and change all the time. Some transitions that come to mind that have affected me personally: ALSA-&gt;pulse; libudev-&gt;libudev2-&gt;systemd; gstreamer 0.10-&gt;1.0. All of those changes required modifications to my software, and the backwards-compat tools that are provided are buggy and insufficient. Meanwhile, you can still write and run winmm[1] applications on Windows 10, and they will work in almost all cases. It's simply the case that the win32 API is more stable than Linux userland APIs, so it's entirely plausible that games will run better in Wine, which shares that stable ABI, than they will on Linux, especially as time goes on and Linux userland shifts yet again.</p>
<p>[1] winmm dates to the Windows 3.x days!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Situations like this can be pretty messy and this is not a case of open source versus secret closed source anti-cheat stuff either, since the glibc issue affected a Native Linux game (Shovel Knight) and Linux software libstrangle. No doubt there are other things yet to be discovered that were broken by the change.</p>
<p>It is of course also a case that Linux distributions need to ensure they do quality assurance testing, especially for gaming which can end up showing up issues quite easily and that bleeding-edge distributions can and clearly do end up breaking things by pulling new software in so quickly.</p>

      <title>Fab deck-builder Across the Obelisk out now under Paradox Arc publishing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Across the Obelisk is a fantastic deck-builder that just left Early Access, as the first game under Paradox Interactive's new publishing label Paradox Arc. You might want to clear your schedule for this one, as it can easily suck away over 100 hours as you constantly want to jump back in for another attempt.</p>
<p>You can play it alone or with up to three others in co-op and it's great either way. One of the most customizable deck-builders I've had the pleasure of playing and it has massive replay value too. Not only due to the characters and the cards but the way you progress through it too, with branching world paths and all the upgrades you can do. Multiplayer is pretty unique too for the genre, with each player controlling a different hero.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="TMs_MVs511w"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/96d8c06ab9550f027962f8271519c223.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/TMs_MVs511w" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dynamic Deckbuilding Roguelite RPG.</li>
<li>Play solo or co-op with up to three friends.</li>
<li>16 unlockable characters to create your party.</li>
<li>+500 cards and items to choose, craft and upgrade.</li>
<li>Procedural generated system intended to be highly replayable.</li>
<li>Events and quests where your decisions affect how the story unfolds.</li>
<li>Face powerful bosses in tactical combat.</li>
</ul>
<p>The big 1.0 release out now adds in new heroes, a new map with new events / enemies / bosses, new items and pets, new music and loads more. So if you've already put plenty of time into it, the game will feel nice and fresh.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>The Paradox Arc publishing initiative is a new program within Paradox Interactive that aims to highlight unique designs and engaging games from small development teams, leveraging the publishing expertise Paradox has built over nearly 20 years of experience. âOur goal with Paradox Arc is to surprise players with games they might not have known they needed to play,â said Sebastian ForsstrÃ¶m, Head of Paradox Arc. âWeâre publishing the kind of games that suddenly appear atop your âMost Playedâ list. I can say from direct experience that Across the Obelisk fits this mold perfectly and I donât think we could have asked for a better game for our premiere. Iâm looking forward to sharing more Paradox Arc titles with everyone soon - and to inviting more developers to work with us.â</p>
<p>You can buy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1385380/Across_the_Obelisk/" target="_blank">Across the Obelisk on Steam</a>. Highly recommended if you like turn-based strategy and deck-building.</p>

      <title>Twin-stick shooter Titan Shell looks intense and will be supported on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Titan Shell is an in-development twin-stick shooter from Meatbag Studio that blends in features from roguelikes / rogue-lites to offer a pretty interesting experience not many such shooters give you.</p>
<p>Instead of being a linear shooter, it takes the randomized approach from other popular games to present you with a slightly different run each time you start a new game with the rooms, enemies, encounters and more being randomized to keep things interesting. Featuring fast-paced run and gun levels with a colourful set of core characters each with their own story, goals and some big boss battles. You'll also get online and local co-op and Native Linux support.</p>
<p>You can see the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="f_kWuaI7KQc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c77de68096460c1e130a2472dd9ff8cf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/f_kWuaI7KQc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/meatbagstudio/titan-zero" target="_blank">currently on Kickstarter</a> with 26 days to go and they have over $45,000 of the $50,000 goal already hit so this seems like it will have no problem hitting 100% funding.</p>
<p>You can also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1964860/Titan_Shell/" target="_blank">follow on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Axiom Verge 2 lands on Steam with Linux support and Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Axiom Verge 2 from Thomas Happ Games has jumped over from the Epic Store to Steam and it comes with Native Linux support and it is also Steam Deck Verified! This was made with Ethan Lee's <a href="https://fna-xna.github.io/" target="_blank">FNA</a>, so it's another quality port too and uses the Vulkan API.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DZG0vU9RYSE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/362c2718cd6beecd8c4f9a46a7629547.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DZG0vU9RYSE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>You may have played Axiom Verge, or heard it referenced as a benchmark for indie action-exploration games. This long awaited sequel expands on the universe with completely new characters, abilities, and gameplay.<br/>
<br/>
Indra, the billionaire behind the worldwide Globe 3 conglomerate, heads to Antarctica to investigate the disappearance of her daughter, but ultimately finds herself in an entirely different reality, infected by parasitic machines that both aid and confound her. Where is she? Who is the mysterious person goading her from the other end of the computer terminal?<br/>
<br/>
Explore an alternate Earth-like world, replete with the ruins of an ancient, high-tech civilization. Hack machines. Battle monsters. Use your remote drone to enter the Breach, a parallel but connected reality that is filled with its own dangers. Youâll want to search every inch for the hidden items and upgrades you need to survive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The game seems to run quite nicely across Linux desktop and Steam Deck, which is not exactly a surprise. Any modern port that uses FNA tends to run great. It's another title that feels like it was made to play on something like the Steam Deck for sure with some tight gamepad controls.</p>
<p>Overall it might not reach the heights of excitement that the original did (not many sequels manage itâ¦), but it's still a pretty great game. If you usually enjoy platformer-metroidvania exploration, this is a lovely indie game to pick up and put a good few hours into.</p>

      <title>Backpack Hero is an inventory management roguelike and my new favourite game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Backpack Hero is a dungeon crawling roguelike where you need to constantly sort out your small backpack and it's absolutely sucked me in. A new Native Linux release from Jaspel and IndieArk, I have no doubt this will be something of a hit on Steam.</p>
<p>It reminds me of the first few times I loaded up Slay the Spire, and in a few ways does feel a little bit like it. You know what enemies are about to do, you can hover over them to see and you travel through a map with various different events. There's no cards here though. You're given a small backpack, which you use to store everything from weapons to armour and all things in between. The key point is your limited space, and certain items need to be placed next to other to give a bonus or get around a weakness.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11395088231660643804gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11395088231660643804gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>As you level up you can expand your backpack so you can fit more in but you're always thinking on how to best sort it, what to take from enemies and chests and what to leave behind. Battles are turn based too, so you get plenty of time to decide what to do with your limited energy as all items have some sort of cost to them (although so also have no cost if you're lucky).</p>
<p>It's in Early Access so it's not finished although there's plenty of content to keep you going for hours already. The developer has said they plan to add in proper controller support (although keyboard and mouse mode in Steam Input works fine for Steam Deck), an overworld with meta-progression, more characters, more events and so on. Right now though when you die it's game over, which they said they will be sorting as a priority to give you something more to work towards other than just that feeling of needing one more run.</p>
<p>Gaming is such an odd thing. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/spider-man-remastered-is-awesome-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Spider Man Remastered</a> just released and runs nicely, but here I am sinking plenty of time and planning a <em>lot</em> more in a small indie game.</p>
<p>Works great on a Linux desktop and Steam Deck. Here's a little video going over it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QN9cl-j9Oh8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/00f4ad117a412de51f33adfc69957cb0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QN9cl-j9Oh8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1970580/Backpack_Hero/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Couch-gaming Linux distro ChimeraOS 34 released </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://chimeraos.org/" target="_blank">ChimeraOS</a> continues to improve the couch-gaming experience for Linux with ChimeraOS 34 out now and there's quite a number of improvements and fixes. Before you had the likes of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/holoiso-brings-valves-steamos-3-from-the-steam-deck-to-everyone/" target="_blank">HoloISO</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/winesapos-is-another-way-to-get-something-like-steamos-on-desktop/" target="_blank">winesapOS</a> there was ChimeraOS, giving you a tailored experience more like SteamOS when Valve wasn't updating it.</p>

<li>fixed games not launching when pre-configured to run with Proton.</li>
<li>fixed bluetooth service failing to start due to a missing directory.</li>

      <title>Steam finally gets easier to grab free stuff</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It seems Valve has made it easier to claim free stuff on the Steam store, so you no longer need to quickly try to install something free and back out of it to claim it. Seems this happened somewhat silently but it's obvious enough that no one is going to miss it.</p>
<p>On Steam store pages, there's now an Add to Library button which works for anything that is currently free on Steam.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14938103071660640929gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14938103071660640929gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Such a small but needed change. Especially useful when there's a game that has a 100% discount for a limited time, you can now just easily claim it so you don't miss it. Seeing games on a free giveaway happens quite often too, and having to do a pretend install to claim it was quite a nuisance, while not always the case often you would need to do that. This is especially useful for free DLC, as you would pretty much always need to go through it. Now it's just a one click â nice.</p>
<p>Quite happy to see this change finally happen!</p>

      <title>Valve improves Steam Deck offline mode with more to come</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has put out a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3401926123934103826" target="_blank">small upgrade</a> for the Steam Deck in the Beta and Preview channels that seeks to improve the offline mode. This is a much needed fix.</p>
<p>We've seen quite a few complaints about issues with offline mode and when the Steam Deck just doesn't have an internet connection, so it's nice to see Valve put out some adjustments.</p>
<p>Here's what's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue where rebooting while in Steam Offline Mode would cause games to fail to launch.</li>
<li>Fixed the Cloud Sync error notification popping up when offline.</li>
<li>Disabled Steam Offline Mode button when not connected to the internet, as trying to do this currently gets Steam Deck into a bad state.
	<ul>
<li>This change disables this button but does not in any way affect your ability to play games without an active Internet connection.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Valve also said they're "continuing to look at making the user experience of playing games without an Internet connection a better, more intuitive experience".</p>
<p>The problem of course is that Steam is an online store, and until now they haven't really needed to do all that much with offline mode since they largely assumed people were always online. With the Steam Deck though, that's not the case, it's a handheld designed to be taken with you so it's another older area of Steam to need some effort.</p>

      <title>Even more Steam Deck purchase invites are going out from now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has confirmed that they are (again) increasing the amount of people that will be invited to purchase a Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Writing on Twitter, the official <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1559224105471078400" target="_blank">OnDeck account</a> mentioned:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>So keep your eyes peeled on your emails around 5-6PM UTC, if you're waiting for that precious invite to come in so you can spend those big bucks on a Steam Deck.</p>
<p>This comes after they mentioned recently that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/valve-speeds-up-steam-deck-production-some-more-all-existing-reservations-this-year/" target="_blank">production has sped up</a>, so all previous reservations would come this year and the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/valve-teams-with-komodo-to-bring-the-steam-deck-to-asia/" target="_blank">expansion into Asia</a>.</p>

      <title>Tempest Rising looks like the RTS I&#39;ve been waiting for</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>THQ Nordic, 3D Realms andÂ  Slipgate Ironworks recently revealed Tempest Rising an upcoming classic RTS and after watching the trailer I absolutely need this.</p>
<p>While it will no doubt only officially support Windows, it doesn't release until 2023 and the Proton compatibility layer is already at a point where a lot of new releases just work. It also claims to have full controller support, so could be a good Steam Deck RTS!</p>
<p>As someone who grew up playing Dune 2, Command &amp; Conquer and Red Alert â Tempest Rising seems like it's ticking all the right boxes for me.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Na6bvEEPCQ0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/44f8dcecdfdd729094dcae3a2d039b5e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Na6bvEEPCQ0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Classic RTS action meets modern production and performance in Tempest Rising. Inspired by RTS greats of the 90s and 2000s, Tempest Rising is a classic, base-building real time strategy game set in a modern day alternative history war scenario. It features 3 unique factions, each with its own approach to combat and economy and offering a variety of strategies for players of all stripes, maps with neutral structures to contest and neutral populations to contend with, deep and rewarding gameplay that keeps a focus on strategy while rewarding skill, and built-in customization options that allow players to approach the game their way in both single player and multiplayer game modes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classic RTS base building with fast and fluid hard-hitting combat.</li>
<li>3 asymmetrical playable factions, each featuring distinct economy and play styles.</li>

      <title>Avorion - Into The Rift is an expansive DLC out now for this great space sim</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Probably one of the best spaceship building sandbox games around, Avorion has just grown tremendously with the Into The Rift DLC out now.</p>
<p>In this hardcore add-on you'll explore the mysterious and dangerous Rift dimension. Thanks to new technology, it is now possible to send smaller amounts of mass (i.e. a few ships) into the Rifts. Scientists are now intensively researching these Rifts - and they need your help. Travel into the Rifts and uncover their secrets. Face their dangers, complete research expeditions, and earn powerful new rewards. This arrives along with a big version 2.2 patch for all players.</p>

<p>DLC Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Discover a new dimension unlike anything you've seen before in the galaxy.</li>
<li>Prepare your ship accordingly to master the dangerous new environments and uncover the secrets surrounding the origins of the Rifts.</li>
<li>Complete Rift Expeditions for the Rift Research Center, and receive new, powerful hybrid subsystems in return - or simply keep everything you find in the Rifts.</li>
<li>Remember, the deeper you venture into the Rifts, the more lucrative and dangerous they become.</li>
<li>New story campaign.</li>
<li>New captain classes.</li>
<li>+ Loads more</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm surprised this one doesn't have a lot more players. With a Very Positive rating on Steam, along with gameplay that offers a good mixture of spaceship building and exploration, there's a lot to enjoy with it. It regularly sees around 2,000 players online at the same time each day and you can play it alone or with others. Native Linux support too and it works really nicely.</p>

      <title>Tim Burton inspired adventure game Whateverland launches September 15</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Following from the successful Kickstarter campaign in 2020, Caligari Games have announced their Burton-style point and click adventure will release on September 15.</p>
<p>Whateverland, a world where morally grey souls are banished and transformed in a darkly comical way into forms befitting their soulsâ selfish desires, ends up being the perfect place for professional thief Vincent. Stranded in this weird place, Vincent must seek an escape out of a makeshift society full of people no one would ever (willingly) get a drink with alongside a newfoundâand not-so-helpfulâsidekick Nick.</p>
<p>This is not your usual point and clicker though. Not only is it non-linear, it will also include a turn-based strategy game. Check out their new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AeMNuysHYis"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dfb36cfd150b04251724446cfff205a3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AeMNuysHYis" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>âWe love the renaissance era of point and click adventures and want to bring back the feeling those games gave us to our audience,â said Eli Mikeladze, Narrative Designer, Producer, and Co-Founder, Caligari Games. âWeâre glad we got such great support from fans of The Great Perhaps and with our Kickstarter and canât wait to welcome them to the weird world of Whateverland.â</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A not so classic point-n-click.</li>
<li>You can steal stuff. Or not â itâs your call.</li>
<li>Your actions define the ending and what people think of you.</li>
<li>The most annoying sidekick in the universe. (We still love you, Nick)</li>
<li>You can talk to people. Not sure theyâre gonna talk to you though.</li>
<li>Turn-based strategy sport simulator included in the game. With magic.</li>
<li>Loads of mini-games. At least 2.</li>
<li>Music recorded with a real sextet. How sexy is that?</li>
<li>Beautiful hand-drawn art style.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be available on <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/whateverland" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1175840/Whateverland/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Kitsune Zero, prequel to upcoming LGBTQ+ platformer Kitsune Tails, releases September 12</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kitsune Zero is being releasedÂ on September 12 as a paid DLC for the free platformer Super Bernie World. This will act as a prequel to the upcoming standalone game Kitsune Tails.</p>
<p>Created by developer Kitsune Games (MidBoss, Ultra Hat Dimension, Super Bernie World) in collaboration with publisher MidBoss (2064: Read Only Memories), you get to revisit the original four worlds of Super Bernie World, now set in the Kitsune Tails universe.</p>
<p>There's a bunch of new story sequences and voice acting from the likes of Michele Knotz, the voice of Misty, May, and Jessie from the English dub of the Pokemon anime. Sean Chiplock, whose credits include The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Genshin Impact, Spider-Man in Marvelâs Avengers, and dozens more beloved anime and video game titles, serves as Kitsune Zeroâs narrator.</p>
<p>âKitsune Zero allows us to give fans an early taste of the Kitsune Tails world and expand on the platforming people loved in Super Bernie World,â said Eniko Fox, co-founder, Kitsune Games. âSpeedrunners, know that we made sure that Kitsune Zero remains compatible with Super Bernie World any% speedruns, so itâs time to lower those times and start submitting to marathons!â</p>

      <title>Wine compatibly layer manager Bottles adds vkBasalt improvements, vmtouch cache</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://usebottles.com/" target="_blank">Bottles</a> is easily the most simple way to manage installing and running Windows games and apps on Linux outside of Steam. A new release is out now with plenty of useful tweaks.</p>
<p>Version 2022.8.14 adds in support of vmtouch, a way to cache certain things. The Bottles devs say it "lends us resources to diagnose and control cache" and that you can enable it to possibly improve performance. Another one is a new UI for managing the Vulkan post-processing layer vkBasalt, along with the ability to configure vkBasalt individually per Bottle which sounds great.</p>
<p>A new dark mode switcher is in. Originally it was removed, but it has been added back as not all distributions are updated to do it properly automatically so now you can switch it yourself to your liking.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4830875361660555320gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4830875361660555320gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10433656761660555319gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10433656761660555319gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Main Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New vkBasalt settings</li>
<li>Support for vmtouch caching</li>
<li>New dark mode switch as fallback for distributions not supporting the freedesktop Dark Mode</li>
<li>Prevent programs from launching when clicking on the entry instead of the play button</li>
<li>Windows can now be closed by pressing Escape</li>
<li>The Library view now supports program settings overrides</li>
<li>âAdd to Steamâ and âAdd Desktop Entryâ now supports integrations (Epic, Ubisoft, etc.)</li>
<li>The bottles-cli âprogramsâ option now list programs from integrations as well</li>
<li>Gamescope is now compatible with FSR</li>
<li>Minor UI improvements</li>
<li>Lots of bug fixes</li>
<li>Translations updated</li>
</ul>

      <title>The first point-release for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS is now available</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Canonical announced the release of Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS which brings together an updated download with all the bug fixes, updated apps, driver upgrades and more. Users will now also be prompted to update from earlier versions of Ubuntu, or automatically as part of update scheduling.</p>
<p><em>Since this is an LTS release (long term support), it will see updates until April 2027.</em></p>
<p>While not a major new distro release, it's worth noting since this is the first proper big update since the release of Ubuntu 22.04. A long list of the changes can be seen on their <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/jammy-jellyfish-point-release-changes/29835" target="_blank">official Discourse forum</a> like NVIDIA driver updates, Mesa driver updates for AMD / Intel, various crash-bug fixes for desktop users, Snap upgrades, kernel and firmware updates and much more.</p>
<p>From the release announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As usual, this point release includes many updates, and updated installation media has been provided so that fewer updates will need to be downloaded after installation.Â  These include security updates and corrections for other high-impact bugs, with a focus on maintaining stability and compatibility with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. 22.04.1 also brings new RISC-V platform support, providing fresh images for the Allwinner Nezha and VisionFive StarFive boards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On top of the new point release, Canonical also put out a new trailer for Ubuntu:</p>

      <title>Easy Anti-Cheat not working on Linux? Seems a glibc update broke it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>News has been doing the rounds for a little bit about Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC) suddenly not working after system updates for some users, turns out it's an issue with glibc.</p>
<p>Reported on <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6051#issue-1326758655" target="_blank">GitHub</a> over a week ago, the issue has been growing as more and more users have been updating their systems. Only certain Linux distributions are affected, mainly those that pull in package updates a lot faster like Arch and derivatives.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14337784741660551688gol1.png"/></p>
<p>EAC is not the only thing broken as there have been reports about the frame limiter libstrangle <a href="https://bugs.gentoo.org/863863" target="_blank">also being broken</a> by it, the game <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6051#issuecomment-1212748397" target="_blank">Shovel Knight</a> and there's probably more too.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=29456" target="_blank">upstream bug report</a> forÂ glibc there's been plenty of back and forth on it. Hopefully a true resolution will be found. Until then, multiple distributions seem to be readying up an update (Arch looks to have it out now) that reverts the change to get EAC games to work once again. So if you haven't updated recently, it might be an idea to hold off for just a little bit until this situation is sorted.</p>

      <title>Spider-Man Remastered is awesome on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With Spider-Man Remastered now available on Steam after previously being PlayStation exclusive, I took it for a spin on Steam Deck and Linux desktop.</p>
<p>Just before release it was Steam Deck Verified and thankfully, the rating is absolutely correct here. With some really good defaults, Spider-Man Remastered is fantastic to play on the Steam Deck. I actually completed it years ago on the PS4, so I know the gameplay and story very well. Getting to play it wherever I want on the Steam Deck though â what absolute joy! This is easily going to be my favourite game of this year to play on Deck.</p>
<p>Check out my video on it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="iV1eLjqn1lE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f584a37fb48812cbd8698fe1abf16903.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/iV1eLjqn1lE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>How about the Linux desktop though? How does it run?</p>
<p>Well, it's a little quirky. It will complain about GPU drivers every time without fail and if you have a controller plugged in, it will <em>crash</em> before the intro video every time. Unplug your controller, and it works 100% of the time. Plug the controller back in at the menu and at least on NVIDIA, it works fine then.</p>
<p>Performance seems reasonable during fights, on the High preset settings at 1080p with an NVIDIA 2080ti it was consistently well above 100FPS. When swinging around though, it drops down below 100FPS quite a lot.</p>

      <title>yuzu the Nintendo Switch Emulator gets an easy Linux installer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news for Linux and Steam Deck fans, the yuzu team <a href="https://yuzu-emu.org/entry/yuzu-linux-installer/" target="_blank">have worked</a> to bring the installer for the Nintendo Switch Emulator over to Linux properly.</p>
<p>This was a bit of a sore spot, while you could still install it relatively easily having the proper installer just puts another tick in the box for making it that bit simpler for everyone. Why have they done it now though? As they said previously it was mostly Windows users playing with it but over time they've seen "consistent growth in the number of our Linux users" and so it was only natural for them to improve their own support of Linux.</p>
<p>This new installer supports Mainline and Early Access builds for Linux users. With Early Access builds being available for their Patreon supporters.</p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18351965881660303163gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18351965881660303163gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>The work was done by a user going by the handle <a href="https://github.com/lat9nq" target="_blank">toastUnlimited</a>. As with any new thing, it might have some issues so be sure to report any you find.</p>

      <title>Retro racer Horizon Chase Turbo gets a big free Adventures game mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Horizon Chase Turbo is a very highly rated retro racing game from developer AQUIRIS and today it sees a huge free upgrade. This is to celebrate the 7th anniversary of the franchise.</p>
<p>If you've not played it before, it's directly inspired by a bunch of different classic racers from the 80s and 90s like Out Run, Lotus Turbo Challenge, Top Gear (SNES), Rush and plenty more. This is a straight to the point arcade racer with no extra fluff, just you and the track.</p>
<p>The Adventure game mode update will bring with it a series of five challenges available for each of the 34 cars in the game, totaling 170 different races to beat. You also get a new skin for each of the cars in the game, as a reward for completing each adventure.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="XGreyhCzTtc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8917da69440cba0f4c2cbb41c383a9a8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/XGreyhCzTtc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Sounds like a pretty sweet free update!</p>
<p>Available on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/horizon-chase-turbo?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/389140/Horizon_Chase_Turbo/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has a Native Linux version and it is Steam Deck Verified!</p>

      <title>Hollow Knight is getting cross-platform Steam Cloud Saves to help Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hollow Knight developer Team Cherry has announced that an update due to go live on Monday, August 15th will bring a much needed change to the saving system.</p>
<p>Mentioned in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/367520/view/3406429723545099871" target="_blank">Steam post</a>, the developer said "Soon we'll be making some changes in order to support cross-platform cloud saves between Windows, MacOS, and Linux (including the Steam Deck)!" with the plan for it to go live on Monday at 5AM UTC. There's a few important notes they also included:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>MacOS and Linux users will need to play the game once for Steam to upload their existing local save files to cloud storage</li>
<li>Windows users should not need to do anything, except:</li>
<li>Cross-platform users who manually migrated their save files between platforms may have conflicting files. When steam prompts you to keep or overwrite your files it is important to choose the correct one carefully (which will depend on your own situation). If in doubt, back up your save files first!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you wish to make a backup of your save here's the locations:</p>
<p>Windows:</p>
<div class="bbcodes_Code_1Aels"><code class="inline-code">%USERPROFILE%/AppData/LocalLow/Team Cherry/Hollow Knight</code></div>
<p><br/>
MacOS:</p>
<div class="bbcodes_Code_1Aels"><code class="inline-code">~/Library/Application Support/unity.Team Cherry.Hollow Knight</code></div>
<p><br/>
Linux:</p>
<div class="bbcodes_Code_1Aels"><code class="inline-code">~/.config/unity3d/Team Cherry/Hollow Knight</code></div>
<hr/>
<p>Not mentioned in their post, but there is currently a rare issue where the graphics might glitch-out completely. To get around this, you can set the game into OpenGL mode by setting this in the game launch options in the Properties of the game in your Steam Library:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">-force-opengl</code></p>

      <title>Valheim gets a small teaser as Iron Gate get back to work on Mistlands</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valheim is due to get a huge upgrade at some point, which most players are now waiting on and Iron Gate have given the smallest of teasers on it again. Their team took a bit of a break recently they mentioned in a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/3401926123918063730" target="_blank">update post</a>, but they said they're now back at their desks working away on the next update.</p>
<p>Firstly though, a fix is on the way for an unfortunate crashing issue, you can find some help on that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/valheim/comments/vssxdi/how_to_restore_most_recent_working_world_save/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>As for the next major update, Mistlands, Iron Gate say it's going to be "quite a chunky update, with a lot of things we havenât shown yet". It will come with new recipes and meals with loads of work on that already done and a sneaky teaser picture was included for people to guess away at:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3369940201660300276gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3369940201660300276gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>They also mentioned again the new Black Marble material that's coming which you'll find in the Mistlands. Players were excited about that so they've shown a fresh preview of something with it:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12429990541660300341gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12429990541660300341gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I honestly haven't touched Valheim in ages, as I don't want to spoil myself before this huge upgrade. Overall the game still seems to be doing well though, with it regularly seeing multiple tens of thousands playing each day. I imagine the player count will rocket upwards once the Mistlands update is out.</p>
<p>Valheim is available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/valheim?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Two Point Campus from the dev of Two Point Hospital out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two Point Campus is the next game from Two Point Studios and SEGA, the same lot that gave us Two Point Hospital. It comes with Native Linux support and works on the Steam Deck right away.</p>
<p>It shares a huge amount with Two Point Hospital, as clearly that was the blueprint they've applied here but of course it's a whole new setting. You're building up your own educational campus environment but it's not as boring as it sounds. Naturally, it has a bunch of fun twists on it where your students will be doing all kinds of ridiculous things including spell-casting wizardry, dragon-slaying knight school or top-secret spy school. Oh, and there's a fun announcer once again that has a number of silly lines to read out.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FnjqPkajRnc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8757ad6f88116df86fff3d6237d03945.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FnjqPkajRnc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I've been testing it across both my Steam Deck and Linux desktop and it seems to work great. The Linux version is using Vulkan, so performance seem to be pretty great even on the Deck at high settings. Gamepad support is basically perfect too, so it will suit many different types of gamers.</p>
<p>Here's some quick footage from the Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zyYPiCZbdaU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e56d55c36cc976ffc5fd83a809ef3756.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zyYPiCZbdaU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I can't wait to put a ton more time into this on the Steam Deck while in bed. Saves worked great between the Steam Deck and my Fedora Linux PC too, so no issues there. Good to see Steam Cloud supported properly out of the box.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/two-point-campus?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1649080/Two_Point_Campus/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>W4 Games formed to help developers using Godot Engine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a very interesting development for the world of the open source Godot Engine, as a new company named <a href="https://w4games.com/" target="_blank">W4 Games</a> has been formed to push it further than ever before. Founded by <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> veterans Juan Linietsky, RÃ©mi Verschelde and Fabio Alessandrelli, and veteran entrepreneur Nicola Farronato the idea is to provide commercial assistance to developers of all sorts using Godot Engine.</p>
<p>One of the goals (there will be a number) is to help developers access console markets, which has been a problem for Godot Engine since it's fully open source and can't just include everything needed to publish on consoles as they've historically been restrictive with things like their SDK. So one goal of W4 Games is to help there, as their FAQ mentions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>W4 was created to satisfy commercial needs of the corporate game industry that are currently unaddressed, by providing products and services to companies that need them in order to move to Godot from other technologies. This includes services offering such as enterprise support plans and the possibility to access markets that were previously unreached by Godot, such as console platforms. Stay tuned for more details!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's just one small part of it though, as their <a href="https://w4games.com/2022/08/09/hello-world-w4-games/" target="_blank">announcement</a> explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>W4 Games was formed to strengthen the Godot ecosystem by providing both enterprise and independent developers with a complementary suite of commercial products and services to successfully develop and publish video games to all existing platforms in the market. Further announcements about these products and services will be made over the coming weeks and months as they become available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For anyone suddenly worried â Godot Engine remains community built, owned and run and will continue to be. This is just a few of their team hoping to keep pushing open source to the masses of developers out there.</p>

      <title>What if Pong had &#39;lore, special moves &amp; gay aliens&#39;? You get ZONERS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developer of ZONERS certainly had an interesting pitch when introducing their new game over email and it turns out it's pretty fun. Scanning over my inbox recently and I come across "What if pong had lore, special moves &amp; gay aliens?" as a title and that's certainly one way to grab my attention.</p>
<p>Coming from developer Paris Stalker / ALL iN who also made a hardcore action platformer called <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2018/02/some-thoughts-on-ersatz-the-speed-focused-hardcore-action-platformer-with-a-musical-twist/" target="_blank">ERSATZ</a>.</p>
<p>The developer mentioned that it features "a diverse cast of atypical aliens, tons of ongoing accessibility and customisation work, bizarre lore, an insane original soundtrack (OK, I did write a couple of the songs myself, so <em>mostly</em> insane), way too much effort put into the menus, and the determination of a stubborn git after like 7 rejections from indie focused publishers, what isn't to love?".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Iioz5JuT1AU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3e978d3c52097832089d725fe03e4d65.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Iioz5JuT1AU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What you essential get here is another take on the style of Windjammers. It's basically a hyper version of Pong for sure and if you love these sorts of fast-paced arcade sports games, you can't really go wrong. A little rough around the edges with it being an Early Access game but so much to love about it already.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1598030/ZONERS/" target="_blank">find it on Steam</a> with Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Justin Wack and the Big Time Hack is another fun looking point and clicker coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you love your point and click adventures? We have another to highlight with Justin Wack and the Big Time Hack that will have Native Linux support.</p>
<p>In Justin Wack and the Big Time Hack, you play three characters trying to unite lost lovers, getting a fun-loving caveman back to his own time, all while steering clear of the scary-looking robots trying to erase you from the timeline. Originally funded on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/warmkitten/justin-wack-and-the-big-time-hack" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> raising $32k due to the support of 469 backers, including Ron Gilbert (of Monkey Island fame). Linux support was a stretch-goal that seemingly wasn't hit but they're doing it now anyway.</p>

      <title>Adventure game Nine Noir Lives seems to let you lick everything</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nine Noir Lives is an upcoming point and click adventure game that follows feline private investigator Cuddles Nutterbutter. A new brief trailer is out, showing off a very important game mechanic.</p>
<p>Licking. Yes, you are a cat after all and who knows â licking something might give you an all important clue.</p>
<p>Shown off yesterday for International Cat Day, a new short teaser trailer showed a bit more of the gameplay and the lick mechanic. A bowl of snacks? Cuddles licks it. A sentient computer? Cuddles licks that too. Another cat dressed as a milk carton? I think you get the idea.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cRIuI23ZWeo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1095f1d85e7c467e3c918dd80f4ed222.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cRIuI23ZWeo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Inspired by the likes of Grim Fandango and Broken Sword along with the works of classic film noir from Shakespeare, and Taika Waititi the two-person team at Silvernode Games are working hard to create a point-and-click adventure game that pays tribute to the past while curling up in its own unique niche.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brought Up on Feline-y Charges: </strong>A charming comedy-noir storyline set in the unique and intriguing city of Meow Meow Furrington, inspired by every cat ever and with fewer cat puns than you might expurrct.</li>
<li><strong>A Point-and-Lick Adventure: </strong>Discover a whole new dimension to everything in the game by using Cuddlesâ tongue. Lick first, and ask questions later. Questions like "what did you expect that to taste like, Cuddles?"</li>
<li><strong>Sâmore Cats Equals Sâmore Fun: </strong>Experience the city from two very different perspectives as you switch between Cuddles and his trusty assistant, Tabby Marshmallow.</li>
<li><strong>Purrfect Voice Acting: </strong>Laugh and learn about the world of Furth with over a hundred thousand words of fully-voiced dialogue performed by an all-star cast including Lucas Gilbertson (<em>Megaman X</em>), Carol-Anne Day (<em>A Hat in Time</em>) and SungWon Cho (<em>Borderlands 3</em>, <em>God of War Ragnarok</em>).</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam Deck gets a performance fix available in Preview</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After the recent SteamOS 3.3 release, it came with some unfortunate performance issues for the Steam Deck that Valve continues to address. The first was a random bit of micro-stutter <a href="https://youtu.be/53aWJrfIkX8" target="_blank">that I highlighted</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/rIU26Tn-UYI" target="_blank">Valve fixed</a>, but it seems there were other problems.</p>
<p>Now you can opt into the Preview update channel on your Steam Deck to get these fixes in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3360267192939212657" target="_blank">new update</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Temporarily reverted Red Dead Redemption 2 VRAM workaround to pre-3.3 behavior</li>
<li>Fixed an issue causing random 0.2s stutter</li>
<li>Fixed an issue causing performance drops when a UI element appeared on screen if the performance HUD was enabled.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>How to do it?</p>
<p>Just hit the Steam button and go into Settings. Then System and find the Steam Update Channel and select Preview there. Then scroll up and check for updates and let it download. Your Steam Deck will reboot after it's finished.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck hits 4,500 games officially Verified or Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After only being available for a few months now officially and with Valve still going through the reservation queue, the Steam Deck has hit 4,500 titles officially marked Verified or Playable.</p>
<p>Five months in, that's pretty good going don't you think? Usual reminder though, this is only the number that has been formally verified by Valve directly. The actual number of titles playable will be far greater. Going by <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified&amp;refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B1%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Playable" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, which includes unlisted titles, these are the current numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verified - 1988</li>
<li>Playable - 2512</li>
<li>Unsupported - 1834</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the recently Verified titles include:</p>

<p>I recently picked up a game called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1919460/Seraphs_Last_Stand/" target="_blank">Seraph's Last Stand</a> to play on Deck and it's surprisingly sweet. Only Â£0.79 too! It sort-of scratches the same itch the likes of Vampire Survivors does, with waves of enemies and tons of upgrades to pick but it's inspired by the classic Heli Attack. Instead of you running around a big area, you're running along the bottom of the screen facing off enemies coming down at you and all the firing ends up looking like fireworks. Worth a go, slow to start but once you get going it's absolutely mental.</p>

      <title>Despot&#39;s Game: Dystopian Army Builder releases September 15</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After currently being in Early Access for around 10 months, Despotâs Game: Dystopian Army Builder is set to fully release for all platforms on September 15.</p>
<p>It's a very unique auto-battling dungeon crawler, where you build up an army of people with classes that you won't really find in any other game. They're hilariously varied! You can have a chef, someone with a laser sword, pretzel-throwers, someone with large bionic arms (think Dr. Otto Octavius from Spider Man), someone with boxing gloves and the list goes on. It's ridiculous â in all the rights ways. The full release will come with some reworked mechanics, new quests, new enemies and mutations, an expanded soundtrack and much more.</p>
<p>A new trailer was also just released:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="q8HxA0fkEBQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/61d16ce711245f1f8ff064e51a1396e5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/q8HxA0fkEBQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>âDespotâs Game represents our childhood and all of our love for gaming wrapped in one,â said Nikolay Kuznetsov, Game Creator, Konfa Games. âThe weapons are filled with easter eggs that represent cult movies, TV shows, games and books we read growing up. Itâs really fun to see playersâ excitement when they recognize and relate to them as well, because without our community, it wouldnât have been possible to create this game.â</p>
<p>If you pick up Despotâs Game before the full release, you will receive a DLC named "Despotâs Game: Challenges" free.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/despots-game?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1227280/Despots_Game_Dystopian_Army_Builder/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Linux Mint 21 is out now and you can easily upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In case you didn't already know Linux Mint 21 is officially out now with editions that come with the Cinnamon, MATE or Xfce desktop environments.</p>
<p>Safe to use on the desktop for gaming and work for many years, as it's a long-term support release that will keep going until 2027 with updates thanks to it being based upon Ubuntu 22.04. You will get Linux Kernel 5.15 and depending on which edition you go for Cinnamon 5.4, MATE 1.26 or Xfce 4.16.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2578861191659967663gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2578861191659967663gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Linux Mint Cinnamon Edition</em></p>
<p>Largely the same as the Beta I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/linux-mint-21-beta-now-available/" target="_blank">previously covered</a>. With major changes to the display manager in Cinnamon, based on a much more modern version of Mutter that was previously rather outdated. They've also ported over the display settings from Gnome, plus plenty of theme tweaks to make applications match with the GTK theme.</p>
<p>Some of the other major changes includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A switch fromÂ Blueberry to Blueman for Bluetooth</li>
<li>New Xapp project called xapp-thumbnailers, providing thumbnails for many more file types</li>
<li>Upgrades to the Sticky Notes application</li>
<li>A process monitor to inform you when automated tasks are happening that might slow your PC down</li>
<li>Webp support was added to xviewer and thumbnailers.</li>
<li>The WebApp manager supports additional browsers and custom browser parameters.</li>
<li>In Software Sources, the repository list, PPA list and key list support multiple selection. This allows several items to be removed at a time.</li>
<li>Mint now uses IPP (Driverless Printing and Scanning)</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus lots more.</p>
<p>How to upgrade? Linux Mint 20.3 to version 21 is reasonably easy and supported. In terminal run these commands:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">sudo apt update<br/>
sudo apt install mintupgrade<br/>
sudo mintupgrade</code></p>
<p>Then you will be greeted by the official UI upgrade tool to follow along. After it's completed you can run these to finish:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">sudo apt remove mintupgrade<br/>
sudo reboot</code></p>
<p>You can download from the <a href="https://linuxmint.com/" target="_blank">official site</a>.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental gets Halo Infinite working plus Airborne Kingdom</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hot on the heels of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/proton-70-4-is-coming-to-bring-more-compatibility-to-linux-and-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Proton 7.0-4 getting a Release Candidate</a>, Valve has put up a new build of Proton Experimental and it's quite an exciting one. This is the special version of Proton you can try, that often pulls in new features and fixes earlier to get more Windows games working on Linux desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Newly playable in Proton Experimental from August 5th include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Airborne Kingdom</li>
<li>ToGather:Island</li>
</ul>
<p>They also note that Halo Infinite is now playable. However, it comes with issues. On desktop you'll need the Mesa git drivers and there's lots of graphical issues with NVIDIA. On Steam Deck and an AMD desktop, you will see see some minor artifacts. Hopefully those won't take too long to solve.</p>
<p>Additional fixes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix recent regression that caused VRChat to intermittently hang.</li>
<li>Fix SCP: Secret Labratory not being playable after a recent game update (again).</li>
</ul>
<p>Seems there might be some issues with the Flatpak version of Steam on desktop (and older distros), as it needs a newer version of Mesa so keep that in mind as Experimental now needs Mesa 22 or NVIDIA 510.47 or newer. Changelog available <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a quick look at how it runs on Steam Deck along with how to switch it over to Proton Experimental:</p>

<p><em>Pretty impressive! Online play works just fine too.</em></p>

      <title>Proton 7.0-4 is coming to bring more compatibility to Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve are preparing to ship the next version of Proton, their compatibility layer that runs Windows games on Steam Deck and Linux desktop with Proton 7.0-4 having a Release Candidate ready to test.</p>
<p>This only went up a few hours ago and you can try it and report feedback to Valve. As usual for testing releases, the current list of changes may be different to when it's out officially. To test it out you need to opt into the Beta on Proton 7 directly. So search for Proton 7 in your Steam Library, go into the Properties, Betas and select the "release-candidate".</p>
<p>Here's what's new / improved:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Now playable:
	<ul>
<li>Aquarist - My First Job</li>
<li>Trove</li>
<li>Chuzzle Deluxe</li>
<li>Zuma's Revange!</li>
<li>Karmaflow The Rock Opera Videogame - Act I &amp; Act II</li>
<li>The Rising of the Shield Hero: Relive The Animation</li>
<li>Disgaea 5</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Support automatically bringing up on screen keyboard on Steam Deck in Final Fantasy XIV launcher.</li>
<li>Fix Final Fantasy XIV launcher exiting silently when there's not enough space to download the update.</li>
<li>Fix The Ball displaying error message on the first launch.</li>
<li>Fix video playback in: POSTAL: Brain Damaged.</li>
<li>Fix Hardspace: Shipbreaker failing to connect to online services.</li>
<li>Fix music in Let's Build a Zoo.</li>
<li>Fix Azur Lane: Crosswave hanging on a black screen for some users.</li>
<li>Fix Dokyusei Bangin' Summer showing only flickering black window.</li>
<li>Fix Bloons TD 6 crashing on touch input.</li>
<li>Fix Sid Meier's Civilization IV crashing on world creation.</li>
<li>Fix Assassin's Creed Origins hanging during gameplay after recent game update.</li>
<li>Fix Call of Duty: Black Ops II - Zombies and Call of Duty: Black Ops II - Multiplayer crashing after connecting online.</li>
<li>Fix graphical glitches in Cossacs 3.</li>
<li>Fix garbled audio in Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak.</li>
<li>Fix Elite Dangerous and other launchers not working properly when cloned displays are present.</li>
<li>Implement Vulkan other process rendering (used by nw.js games).</li>
<li>Improve performance of HROT.</li>
<li>Improve video playback for many games that previously required targeted hacks.</li>
<li>Reduce space used by game prefixes if filesystem supports copy on write.</li>
<li>Update dxvk to <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v1.10.3" target="_blank">v1.10.3</a></li>
<li>Update vkd3d-proton to <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/commits/proton-v2.6-support" target="_blank">v2.6-1-gc05900da</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you wish to try it and give feedback, Valve are mainly interested in issues that are directly new in the release candidate builds. So if you find something is broken between Proton 7.0-3 and Proton 7.0-4, Valve need to know about it. A lot of the changes are coming over from previous builds of Proton Experimental.</p>
<p>You can report issues on <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6062" target="_blank">the GitHub page</a>.</p>

      <title>Top quick Steam Deck tips and tricks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Since Valve are ramping up production and a ton more people than expected will get their Steam Deck this year, plus the expansion into Asia, it was a good time to get some basic quick tips and tricks sorted for you.</p>
<p>I have plenty of guides on here in various articles and on the YouTube channel, although good they're quite spread-out so this is a nice quick reference to jump back to when you need some info. Consider it something of a starter guide for quickly getting up to speed with the Deck.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="59R3k4s1aPo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8dc5ae2c1c41e4f2396c8806c0f263d2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/59R3k4s1aPo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of what's included:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can hold down the Steam or Quick Access button to get a list of shortcuts, these shortcuts work with both buttons, not just the Steam button. An example is Steam+X for opening the keyboard anywhere, and Steam + Right Shoulder button to make a screenshot. You can also hold down the Steam button and then move the right stick to move a mouse cursor any time too. You can even press the Steam and B button together, to force a game to shutdown if you need to. Thereâs many other shortcuts, so donât forget to check back on it.</li>
<li>Plenty of games that arenât verified work great. You can check <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> for reports on unverified games which is a fully crowdsourced collection, anyone can test a game on Steam Deck or Linux and submit an entry on how it runs.</li>
<li>Run the screen at 40Hz and 40FPS from the Quick Access menu available by pressing the three dot button on the Steam Deck and going into the Performance menu which has the battery icon. It gives you a simple way to maximise battery life with good performance.</li>
<li>If youâre going to open up the steam deck, <strong>take the sd card out first</strong>, or you will snap the card. I died a little inside when I killed a 1TB card doing that.</li>
<li>Steam Input is your friend, allowing you to fully customize the controls of every single game. You can access it via the controller icon on the games page in your library, or while playing a game by pressing the Steam button, going to the right and selecting Controller Settings at the bottom. Here you can map all the buttons to anything like a mouse, keyboard, turn on gryo, map the back buttons, change deadzones and so much more.</li>
<li>Use both trackpads for typing with the on-screen keyboard, itâs a lot faster.</li>
<li>If you find the WiFi not working well, especially on 5Ghz networks, try turning on developer mode and then turning off Wifi Power Management. Youâll see more power usage but it might just fix your issues.</li>
<li>To access the full desktop mode, you can hold the power button down for a few seconds and select Switch to Desktop or press the Steam button go down to Power and select it there.</li>
<li>Change the location of where screenshots are saved, so you can access them easier in desktop mode. To do it, in desktop mode go into Steam settings -&gt; in-game menu and change the folder to where you want it to be. You can also select to have higher quality screenshots here too.</li>
<li>If youâre at home a lot, just buy a long <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08J41QTNN/" target="_blank">USB-C cable</a> and keep it plugged in with a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08GSSZGWV/" target="_blank">charger</a> when gaming if you can, it will save your battery life.</li>
<li>If youâre going to be using a newer Xbox controller over Bluetooth, update the firmware otherwise it wonât connect properly.</li>
<li>Desktop mode has the Discover software centre, giving you the option to install a ton of extra software like Discord.</li>
<li>If you have games on GOG or Epic Games, the Heroic Games Launcher available in Discover is your friend. It allows you to login and download games, and then run them through a compatibility layer.</li>
<li>Adding third-party apps and games to Steam is easy enough too. Open desktop mode, load up the Steam client and go to the big add game button to the left or the Games menu at the top of the client. Then they will also be available in the normal Gaming Mode in the Non-Steam section of the Library.</li>

      <title>Open source game development advances with Godot Engine 3.5 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Godot Engine, the free and open source full game development engine has a big new release available with <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/godot-3-5-cant-stop-wont-stop" target="_blank">version 3.5</a>. This is not the version that comes with Vulkan and the big rendering overhaul, that's coming in Godot 4 which is due for a proper Release Candidate sometime soon.</p>
<p>Godot 3.5 brings with it 9 months of development on new features and bug fixes</p>
<ul>
<li>A fully overhauled navigation system</li>
<li>Physics interpolation in 3D</li>
<li>A lot more powerful and flexible Tween system</li>
<li>Long awaited Label3D node out of the box to display text in 3D scenes</li>
<li>Accessing nodes by unique names</li>
<li>Asynchronous shader compilation + caching</li>
<li>A more adaptable and easy way to add basic occlusion culling</li>
<li>+ Lots more</li>
</ul>
<p>For this release they teamed up with the great people of <a href="https://www.gdquest.com/" target="_blank">GDQuest</a> to show it all off:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NjIJm2jax68"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fe59d6b3bc3855038ba4398923260c8b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NjIJm2jax68" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Wonderful to see Godot Engine advance so much, it's quickly becoming one of the absolute best game engines around and since it's free and open source the rug cannot be pulled from beneath the feet of developers. I do hope more teams take a look at it, especially with the top Linux support it offers for both development and game exports.</p>

      <title>PlayStation 3 emulator RPCS3 gets Save States support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A huge advancement for the PlayStation 3 emulator project <a href="https://rpcs3.net/" target="_blank">RPCS3</a> as it now has support for Save States, which is pretty awesome.</p>
<p>For those who don't know: Save States are not like normal Save Data. What it does it take an exact snapshot of what is happening, so you can re-load to that exact state of the game at another time and it could be while you're anywhere and doing anything in any game. A lot of other emulators already support such a feature.</p>
<p>The new feature was announced on <a href="https://twitter.com/rpcs3/status/1555043140461019136" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, with one of their team mentioning on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/wfrcvg/comment/iivig4x/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="_3cjCphgls6DH-irkVaA0GM" data-testid="comment">
<div class="_292iotee39Lmt0MkQZ2hPV RichTextJSON-root" style="color:#D7DADC">
<p>We didn't think it was realistically feasible several years ago, but after a lot of work, it's here!</p>
<p>Some savestates will be of a couple GBs of size depending on the game, and there are still certain limitations, but those are just small issues in the grand scheme of things.</p>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>With it now in, they can continue improving it and there are some limitations to be aware of. Like right now if you do a Save State, the game will close. You can just reboot it to carry on and the Save State will be sorted as it's just a technical hurdle they will overcome at some point. In future, major updates to RPCS3 might be incompatible with older Save States too but you could just continue running an older version for it.</p>

      <title>Valve spoke to IGN Japan about the Steam Deck, here&#39;s a few takeaway points</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As Valve expands the Steam Deck into Asia, they've begun a series of interviews and one on video with IGN Japan was quite interesting so here's the main points. While a lot of it was already known, it's still nice to reiterate just how all-in Valve are on the Steam Deck and during the video it also shows off some rather fun looking prototype devices.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20951893241659705276gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20951893241659705276gol1.jpg"/></a>Picture credit - IGN Japan</em></p>
<p>I hope they're still working on that new controller design. I've said it before and I'll say it againÂ â I will be first in line for a new Steam Controller. One that has both sticks and the trackpads would simply be amazing, just like the Steam Deck has and would make playing it docked so much nicer for a lot of people.</p>
<p>The full IGN Japan interview (round-up below):</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nEFixPrVdhA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/85fe1139193dc01b8ee4e421def9f6ff.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nEFixPrVdhA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Here's a little round-up of some interesting bits:</p>
<ul>
<li>There's plenty of continuity between their previous hardware and the Steam Deck, with lots that helped to complete the Steam Deck like working on the Valve Index helped their production lines. Steam Link helped towards Remote Play and so on. Valve Index controller for example was an important stepping stone in regards to dealing with batteries.</li>
<li>Valve confirmed again that they will "only use Proton when there's no Linux version of a game", however they learned from Steam Machines and working with developers to get Linux ports that it often wasn't worth it and why they worked on Proton. Since the Steam Deck, it's been far easier to get Proton working for new release as they've been working with developers.</li>
<li>Linux is a benefit to them since it's open source, as it means they can work to fix issues and features quicker than reporting it to someone else and keep improving as they don't have to report it to someone else and wait on them.</li>
<li>Japan was on their list to ship the Steam Deck to from day 1 but they had to work out the distribution.</li>
<li>They think the Steam Deck will be a multi-generational product, they expect there to be future iterations and they're finding the right balance to give developers a stable product to target but they wish to follow the PC model of constant improvement. No time span yet.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since you're here, check out my latest video talking about why it <em>won't</em> quickly become obsolete:</p>

      <title>Steam adds support for Nintendo Joy-Con controllers in Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Steam is ever-improving and constantly expanding what is supported by Steam Input. Just recently they added a new <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3387288790681635164" target="_blank">Steam Client Beta</a> with support for the Nintendo Joy-Con controllers.</p>
<p>This follows on from the recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/steam-gets-support-for-nintendo-online-classic-controllers/" target="_blank">stable Steam Client release</a> which added support for the Nintendo Online classic controllers including the NES, SNES, Nintendo 64 and Sega Mega Drive / Genesis controllers.</p>
<p>With the new Beta released on August 4th Valve has now added the official Nintendo Joy-Con controller support, that can be used individually as a mini-gamepad or them both combined. Additionally, support for the Nintendo Online classic controllers has also now been improved.</p>
<p>So a tiny update in terms of what's new but still a very welcome one.</p>
<p>It's actually pretty incredible just how wide the controller support is on Steam now. It's likely you can just pick up close to any controller and it will work.</p>

      <title>Crypt of the Necrodancer: SYNCHRONY DLC released into Early Access</title>
      <author>anewson</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A pleasant surprise for Crypt of the Necrodancer fans! SYNCHRONY, a new DLC for Necrodancer, released today into early access. This surprise content for the pioneering 2015 rythm-roguelike is itself an act of necromancy, as until recently the game had not seen new content since the Amplified DLC in 2017. Today's release of Synchrony into EA follows a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/crypt-of-the-necrodancer-gets-a-big-surprise-update-with-more-to-come/" target="_blank">July update to the base game</a> aimed at making Necrodancer compatible with Steam Deck.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="MX9JlggiCHo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ca65c1a7f4bd3e0396ea5b57c0f6d01d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/MX9JlggiCHo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The biggest addition in Synchrony is co-operative and competitive multiplayer modes, but there is lots of content for solo gamers as well. Here's the feature list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Online multiplayer support for up to 8 players in co-op and vs modes!</li>
<li>New character: Chaunter -- Posesses enemies and fights using their powers!</li>
<li>New character: Suzu -- Speedy character with an invincible dash attack!</li>
<li>New character: Klarinetta -- Does battle with a huge two-handed sword!</li>
<li>Full mod support allowing most aspects of the game to be modded!</li>
<li>An integrated mod portal, and the ability to load multiple mods at once!</li>
<li>New weapons, spells, items, enemies, shrines, traps, and more!</li>
<li>Even more features to come during Early Access!</li>
</ul>
<p>If you've never played Necrodancer it's an easy recommendation. The game is set up like a classic roguelike but the turns happen to the beat of the music rather than waiting for player input. The phenomenal OST was composed by Danny Baranowsky (Super Meatboy, Canabalt, Cortex Command), and you will be banging your fingers (and occasionally your face) into your keyboard to one of the greatest video game soundtracks ever made.</p>
<p>When I read about one of the competitive modes in Synchrony I was reminded of watching a competitive speedrun of Necrodancer at Games Done Quick where two players raced to finish the game - it seemed like a ton of fun. Here's the video if you'd like to take a look. To be clear, this is not the Synchrony DLC, it's just two very good Necrodancers playing the base game with the Amplified DLC.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="X3a3EcSZeZs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/273f541977f47db3cd3d2d9cb0945830.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/X3a3EcSZeZs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Synchrony is released natively for Linux into Early Access with an expected full release in late 2022.</p>
<p>You can buy it from <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/crypt_of_the_necrodancer_synchrony" target="_blank">GOG</a> (soon) and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/247080/Crypt_of_the_NecroDancer/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Claim the fun and challenging Frick, Inc. from Kenney FREE for 24 hours</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Frick, Inc. is an amusing game with a name that's slightly silly because it's fricking frustrating too. The developer, Kenney, has made it free to <a href="https://kenney.itch.io/frick-inc" target="_blank">grab on itch.io</a> for 24 hours.</p>
<p>In the game you control a little vehicle and have to move it around a small course. However, the controls are what make it interesting. Instead of using traditional mouse, keyboard or gamepad â you have to flick buttons and switches on the screen to direct the vehicle around. It can be surprisingly challenging and a good bit of fun. Each vehicle has a different controls setup too, meaning you need to keep learning. It's a little gem.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EPNE9hMSrVw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/df31ea8529fa7d5995b6b1662b402063.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EPNE9hMSrVw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Easy to learn, hard to masterÂ </strong>â<strong>Â </strong>You'll be switching between trucks (and control methods) in 40 levels to perform variousÂ tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Extra challenge in each level</strong>Â â Each of the levels contains an extra challenge, only for those daring enough to go the extra mile.</li>
<li><strong>Includes game assets</strong>Â â Ready to get into game development? Use the included 3D models to create your own game inspired by Frick, Inc.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Nara: Facing Fire inspired by Hollow Knight is live on Kickstarter with Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for another beautiful and engaging looking metroidvania? Loved Hollow Knight? You should keep an eye on Nara: Facing Fire that's live on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/glowing-glade/nara-facing-fire-a-hand-drawn-fantasy-metroidvania/description" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>. A game I briefly covered <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/fantasy-metroidvania-nara-facing-fire-blends-hollow-knight-and-ori/" target="_blank">last month</a>, the developer plans to offer full Native Linux support.</p>
<p>It's directly inspired by Hollow Knight, Ori and Celeste with challenging bosses and a focus on the fluid and responsive movement mechanics. Those are some big names to live up to but the early footage in the trailer (that's a work in progress) definitely looks the part. The Kickstarter has a â¬90,000 goal and 29 days to hit it with over â¬11,000 pledged already.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CK0vfKd-OwI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/de949b061a1a3c4518c805f17e687fd1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CK0vfKd-OwI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developers mention you will be exploring a vast open world full of secrets, lots of different characters to meet and plenty of creatures to befriend or fight. It's non-linear too and it sounds like there's multiple endings to it too. Since there's a big focus on the combat, they said their main goal was "for the player to have complete control over Nara's actions at all times while handcrafting the animation transitions to be as smooth as possible" with there being no special acceleration added to the character and abilities have a short "windup time", so you get smooth movement and combat that gives you "the ability to truly express their skill and mechanics which allows for very clean and epic looking speedruns".</p>
<p>All looks and sounds pretty good. I'm honestly surprised it's not funded already.</p>

      <title>Fantasy city-builder Songs of Syx adds diseases, makes you care for the elderly</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Songs of Syx is a fantasy city-builder that made a bit of a splash at release selling a few thousand copies pretty quickly, but as always many more games appear and some fall off the radar but Songs of Syx continues expanding.</p>
<p>This Native Linux game had a lot going for it at release, so many put quite a lot of hours into it. Since the initial Early Access build in September 2020 they've added in new military units, a much smarter AI, entertainment, religion, reproduction, riots, cannibals, big war mechanics and the list goes on.</p>
<p>A new update just released adding even more mechanics to the game now including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Personal homes</li>
<li>New tech tree</li>
<li>Elderly care</li>
<li>Disease &amp; health</li>
<li>World camps</li>
<li>A new species and religion.</li>
<li>Balance and fixes</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the new update video below:</p>

      <title>Last Call BBS, the final game from Zachtronics has left Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Last Call BBS, the final game from the clever people at Zachtronics has left Early Access and is out now along with Native Linux support. Such a shame to see such a great developer move on. They've had some really amazing games over the years with my personal favourite being <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2018/01/opus-magnum-is-an-exceptional-puzzle-game-available-for-linux/" target="_blank">Opus Magnum</a> from 2017.</p>
<p>"Boot up your Z5 Powerlance and dial into Last Call BBS, the last game from Zachtronics!</p>
<p>The Barkeepâs loaded up his retro computer with a full set of puzzle games for you to download and play. No need to worry about copy protection, theyâre all fully cracked and ready to enjoy!"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EdU-ABucIjk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/97a32015fdc3e15f50d716593b04f14b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EdU-ABucIjk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This is actually multiple games in one package:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>20th Century Food Court</strong>: Design factories to produce food just like they did over 700 years ago in the 20th century. Keep your costs low and your machines running fast!</li>
<li><strong>STEED FORCE Hobby Studio</strong>: Assemble robot models based on the anime smash hit Steed Force right on your computer. No sandpaper required!</li>
<li><strong>XâBPGH: The Forbidden Path</strong>: Enter a cursed world and create bizarre flesh sculptures in exchange for eternal life. The master is pleasedâ¦ but can you trust him?</li>
<li><strong>Sawayama Solitaire</strong>: It wouldnât be a Zachtronics release without a brand-new solitaire game. This time itâs a fresh take on Klondike, the âclassicâ solitaire variant.</li>
<li><strong>Dungeons &amp; Diagrams</strong>: Try your hand at these beguiling tile-based logic puzzles. Can you map out the dungeons and steal all the treasure?</li>
<li><strong>ChipWizardâ¢ Professional</strong>: Build integrated circuits using wires, transistors, and capacitors. Wait a second, is this a game or a CAD program?</li>
<li><strong>HACK*MATCH</strong>: The tile-matching minigame from EXAPUNKS, completely remastered with a single player campaign and local head-to-head multiplayer (with Steam Remote Play support).</li>
<li><strong>Kabufuda Solitaire</strong>: Create matching sets of Japanese kabufuda cards in this retro-demake of the challenging original solitaire game that debuted in Eliza.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>This really is their final game!</em></p>
<p>You can buy it now on <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/last_call_bbs" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1511780/Last_Call_BBS/" target="_blank">Steam</a> with Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>No more DLC for Oxygen Not Included, devs decide to do free updates instead</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oxygen Not Included is not getting any more DLC, Klei Entertainment has announced. Instead, they're going to keep pumping out free updates for all players. What is it? ONI is a space colony building game where you have to manage a growing group of people in a hostile environment.</p>
<p>Writing in a post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/457140/view/3388414690589449312" target="_blank">Steam</a>, the developers explained they had been planning a second major DLC but they've decided it "wasnât the right fit for our long-term goals" and that they want the game to feel like a "true universe" with it continuing to expand. Most importantly, they don't want to split the community again and limit their own design choices with the game as they would have to decide between main features and DLC.</p>
<p>They also explained that the more DLC they would do, the harder it would be to maintain for everyone. So instead they're "shifting our focus to building out a lot of the same content and systems youâd expect from a DLC, and releasing them regularly as free game updates that work for both base game and Spaced Out".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18515855861659619312gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18515855861659619312gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Very nice!</p>
<p>You can buy Oxygen Not Included onÂ <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/457140/Oxygen_Not_Included/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It's a Native Linux game and it is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s the current most-played games on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/valve-reveals-the-top-10-most-played-steam-deck-titles-and-theyre-all-fully-verified/" target="_blank">A little while ago</a> Valve showed the current top 10 most played games on Steam Deck and now we have an update on what people are currently playing.</p>
<p>Shared via the official <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1554912282387173376" target="_blank">Twitter</a> account these are the top 10 over the last week, sorted by the daily average user counts:</p>
<ul>
<li>MultiVersus</li>
<li>Vampire Survivors</li>
<li>Stray</li>
<li>ELDEN RING</li>
<li>No Man's Sky</li>
<li>Hades</li>
<li>Stardew Valley</li>
<li>Grand Theft Auto V</li>
<li>Aperture Desk Job</li>
<li>MONSTER HUNTER RISE</li>
</ul>
<p>It's pretty amazing to see the likes of Vampire Survivors continue to stick in the top 10. Who would have thought a tiny little and rather simplistic indie game could keep on going like this? Vampire Survivors has managed to hit over 110,000 user reviews on Steam now, with an Overwhelmingly Positive score.</p>
<p>Not surprising to see MultiVersus there either, given that it's currently a top 10 game on Steam overall and worked right away at release and even before during the Beta as I showed previously:</p>

      <title>Valve teams with Komodo to bring the Steam Deck to Asia</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some huge news for the future of the Steam Deck, as Valve has announced a teaming up with Komodo for the release of the Steam Deck in Asia. This is absolutely massive considering the size of the potential playerbase there, and the continued expansion only continue to show how all-in Valve are with this device.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>"We hope that gamers in Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan agree with us that the performance and design of the Steam Deck makes it a great way to play the games they know and love," said Gabe Newell, President and CEO of Valve.</p>
<p>"We are very excited to be working with Komodo to bring Steam Deck to Asia. We have worked with the team at Komodo for years, and we have high confidence that they'll help us make customers very happy," says Greg Coomer of Valve.</p>
<p>"We are honored to deliver Steam Deck to gamers in Asia, and look forward to showcasing it and our first in-house game in Kyoto this weekend and at Tokyo Game Show next month," said Ricky Uy, CEO of Komodo.</p>
<p>Reservations for Asia will use a different reservation queue, so it will not affect anywhere else.</p>
<p>The first units are targeted to arrive in Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan late this year which can be ordered from the dedicated Steam Deck site on <a href="https://steamdeck.komodo.jp" target="_blank">Komodo</a>. It will start off with Japan with additional units going on to Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan "in the weeks immediately following". Not only that, Valve also plans to be at BitSummit and the Tokyo Game Show.</p>
<p>Starting prices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ä½59,800 in Japan</li>
<li>NT$ 13,380 in Taiwan</li>
<li>HK$ 3,288 in Hong Kong</li>
<li>KRW 589,000 in Korea</li>
</ul>
<p>From the site, it looks like Asia will be getting a slightly different type of carrying case too:</p>

      <title>Space Bandit is a top-down shooter with slick tunes and a Hotline Miami vibe</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Space Bandit is a new Native Linux top-down shooter where you're running through cramped corridors on some space ship. It's got a whole lot of style and some great tunes too. Honestly, it firmly gives off vibes similar to Hotline Miami, only with a sci-fi setting and it's just as crazy at times.</p>
<p>It's now in Early Access, although this is just a finishing-up job as the developer said there's no missing content as it's basically complete but they want feedback before saying it's truly finished. The premise here is simple: you're a gun smuggler and you got ripped off, now you're out for revenge. It's ridiculously fast once the action gets going, but mostly it gives you a moment to think around the start of each section on how you wish to tear through it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cJmyGeQKOWE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3942710516d52f7ca5383e26abbed1a4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cJmyGeQKOWE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It has some pretty good AI that will actually attempt to take you down and not just run blindly at you firing, and that's part of the selling point. The developer actually says the AI is "madly advanced and challenging" and that the AI will "work together to flank you, they'll call out your position to each other, they'll revive each other and generally make you suffer". I can definitely attest to the suffering part, I lost count of my deaths some time ago.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Brutal (one hit kill) twin stick shooter gameplay.</li>
<li>Hilariously clever fun AI that doesn't just run at you like an idiot.</li>
<li>Teleporting... THROUGH PEOPLE.</li>
<li>Exploding barrels everywhere.</li>
<li>4 Proceduraly generated zones and roguelike stuff to keep things fresh.</li>
<li>4 unique no bullet sponge bosses.</li>
<li>Crazy weapons like the Rail Gun that shots through walls.</li>
<li>Full mouse, keyboard and controller support.</li>
<li>Kicking enemies when they're already dead because they could always be deader.</li>
<li>A fine professional business colleague that chain smokes and spouts conspiracy theories.</li>
<li>Shooting people out windows into the void of space.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Works <em>great</em> on desktop and on Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1435470/Space_Bandit/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#39;s Revenge gets a nice big stability update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge is an absolutely fantastic beat 'em up throwback and now perhaps even better, with a big <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1361510/view/3362518358054122480" target="_blank">stability update</a> out now!</p>
<p>With this update they've been focusing on making the core game feel better, with lots of niggles being fixed up. For the Steam Deck, they also added in Deck-specific input glyphs as a nice cosmetic tweak. The online play also had two additions with a message to tell you if you're kicked, and not letting people play mismatched versions to prevent problems.</p>
<p>As for fixes, there's loads actually and the online play received the most with many fixes to client-side issues with things not happening as they should, like lag during boss fights sometimes just breaking it entirely or game clients ignoring enemy grab cancellation and lots of little improvements like that. Online play also has better detection of when all players are ready, better transitions between stages and more.</p>
<p>Performance should be improved too as they're now preloading all enemies, Dizzy players are no longer invincible and in story mode pressing continue no longer forces you through how to play. Some players noticed audio issues too, which should be solved!</p>

      <title>The 30th update for Dead Cells is out now as &#39;Enter the Panchaku&#39; </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Enter the Panchaku is the latest big update to the rather great game Dead Cells, continuing to expand the game in a number of ways and tweak existing features. For those that don't know somehowÂ â Dead Cells is a rogue-lite, metroidvania inspired action-platformer.</p>
<p>With this update they've added in:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New Weapon: Panchaku - Two pans tied together by a string, the perfect DIY weapon to tear through the island!</li>
<li>New Outfit: Bobby Outfit - A new outfit inspired by the Beheaded's design from the Dead Cells trailers, flaming head included.</li>
<li>New crossover content with Soul Knight including the Magic Bow that fires 5 slowly-moving homing arrows, the Knight's Outfit and a new lore room.</li>
<li>New Custom Mode Option: Legendaries Only - Turns all weapons found in the run into legendary ones.</li>
<li>You can now pet your Pets when you are in transition areas, by holding interact next to them!</li>
<li>Lots of weapon and Legendary balancing changes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I must admit, when reading their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/588650/view/3383909822377684031" target="_blank">announcement</a> their NFT line almost had me. Cheeky. New gameplay trailer below too:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zlPJBqtiZKc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f4ed78764dc80fd5c34df627311cfb78.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zlPJBqtiZKc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They also put a reminder about their new roadmap, which will see Dead Cells gain updates and new content for what looks like at least another year yet. So there's plenty more to come including a boss rush mode and many surprises they're not yet revealing to us.</p>

      <title>Raspberry Pi 4 gets a graphics bump with Vulkan 1.2 conformance</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Are you still enjoying your Raspberry Pi 4? Well, there's a graphics bump coming thanks to all the work in the drivers with it hitting Vulkan 1.2 conformance.</p>
<p>Writing in an official <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/vulkan-update-version-1-2-conformance-for-raspberry-pi-4/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Eben Upton noted that they continue to press ahead with improving Vulkan support since OpenGL is rather old now and Vulkan is just the future. The update isn't available yet but people from open source consulting firm <a href="https://www.igalia.com/" target="_blank">Igalia</a> have been working on it, with Vulkan 1.2 conformance hit and merged upstream into Mesa ready for a future Raspberry Pi OS update.</p>
<p>An example they showed is that the Deferred Shadows Sample from Sasha Willems is now working:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2280669851659528592gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2280669851659528592gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>What does having proper support for Vulkan 1.2 mean? Well, more advanced and modern features of Vulkan should see more apps and games working on the Raspberry Pi 4! In addition to Vulkan 1.2, work has also been ongoing to support various extensions and Vulkan 1.3 along with bug fixes and performance improvements.</p>
<p><em>Support for Android has also been improving too with <a href="https://konstakang.com/devices/rpi4/" target="_blank">unofficial builds</a> of LineageOS.</em></p>

      <title>OBS Studio 28.0 Beta 1 brings Linux improvements, lots of new features</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio" target="_blank">OBS Studio</a> is getting another major version bump with OBS Studio 28.0 Beta 1 now available for testing. Lots of big features included in this one, plus some nice Linux client updates.</p>
<p>A major new addition is support for 10-bit and HDR Video Encoding Support, which is sadly limited on Linux (and macOS). For Linux, it's mainly because we don't really have HDR yet but now that OBS has it in, once various parts of Linux are upgraded to support HDR hopefully it won't be too much to get it into OBS then too.</p>
<p>Some major technical changes too like upgrading the internals to Qt 6, since the version OBS was using is no longer supported. So now they have access to the latest features and fixes to keep improving the UI. This does mean that a bunch of plugins will need updating which the OBS team said they're working on with the community, plus some older operating systems are no longer supported like Windows 7 &amp; 8, macOS 10.13 &amp; 10.14, Ubuntu 18.04 and all 32-bit operating systems.</p>
<p>Other new features and tweaks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added obs-websocket 5.0 as a first-party plugin.</li>
<li>A new default theme.</li>
<li>Added native SRT/RIST outputs.</li>
<li>The ability to automatically split recordings based on file size or duration, or manually via hotkey.</li>
<li>Support for sending chat messages to YouTube from within OBS.</li>
<li>Accessibility section added to the settings window.</li>
<li>CEF (Chromium) updated to version 103 (5060).</li>
<li>Image sources will now honor the rotation in the EXIF metadata</li>
<li>Hotkeys now require strict modifiers (exact modifier matches)</li>
<li>Significantly improved reconnecting when streaming disconnects, including lowering the default reconnect delay to 2 seconds</li>
<li>+ loads more tweaks</li>
</ul>
<p>Specific to Linux these changes made it in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switched rendering on Linux from GLX to EGL, which should result in a better experience</li>
<li>Added support for the H264 Format in the Linux V4L2 (video capture device) source</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where right-side modifiers wouldn't be detected on Linux</li>
</ul>

      <title>DXVK 1.10.3 out with work for Halo Infinite plus better Stray performance for Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk" target="_blank">DXVK</a> is a Direct3D to Vulkan translation layer used in Proton, to help run Windows games on Linux and Steam Deck. A new release version 1.10.3 is out now.</p>
<p>This is a "minor maintenance release" readying the project for the next version of Proton. While the team mentioned recently that much newer drivers would soon be needed, that's not the case for this release since it's just a minor one. That said, as always, more compatibility and performance improvements is welcome.</p>
<p>Here's what's new in the release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added support for shared fences (PR <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/2608" target="_blank">#2608</a>). This is needed for videos in <strong>Halo Infinite</strong> to work, alongside corresponding wine and vkd3d-proton patches.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression introduced in 1.10.2 that would cause rendering issues in various D3D11 games, including <strong>Prey</strong>, <strong>Bioshock Infinite</strong> (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/2757" target="_blank">#2757</a>), and some others.</li>
<li><strong>Need For Speed 3</strong>: Fixed Modern Patch not working (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/1699" target="_blank">#1699</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Ninja Blade</strong>: Fixed alpha test issues (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/2745" target="_blank">#2745</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Stray</strong>: Enabled <code class="inline-code">d3d11.ignoreGraphicsBarriers</code> option to work around some GPU-bound performance issues.</li>
<li><strong>Ys Origin</strong>: Work around stutter with the game's built-in FPS limiter (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/2750" target="_blank">#2750</a>, PR <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/2754" target="_blank">#2754</a>).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>As a reminder: you can upgrade the version of DXVK used in Proton, without waiting on a new release.Â To do so you can just overwrite the existing DXVK files with theÂ release downloadÂ of DXVK 1.10.3. You can find your Proton installÂ <em>somewhere</em>Â like this (depending on your Steam Library drives):</p>
<p><code>path-to-your/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Proton x.x/dist</code></p>
<p><em>Where x.x is whatever Proton version installed you wish to give a new DXVK.</em></p>
<p>Inside there you will see "lib" and "lib64", for 32bit and 64bit. Inside each of those, there's a "wine" folder and inside there is a "dxvk" folder and that's where you replace the files with new versions. Do so at your own risk but it's usually harmless. If you mess anything up, one way toÂ ensure it gets reinstalled cleanly is just to remove the "/dist" folder.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Go on a bit of adventure as a Wizard in Scrabdackle, you just have to find your wand first. This scribbly-art hand-drawn adventure is ridiculously charming. Funded on Kickstarter and coming out next year, the developer has been toiling away at the code and artwork over the last year to bring out a much improved new demo that just landed.</p>
<p>With Native Linux support planned at release, along with support already hooked up with the new demo, it's something you definitely need to try. The artwork really is great and the quirky atmosphere it gives off leaves a lasting impression. Check out the new demo teaser trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="c3-nxqhlbLQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a5cd92681d32bf52d7f55897837576eb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/c3-nxqhlbLQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Expansive, non-linear world</strong> allows for high replayability. The map can be navigated in any order on any playthrough. Try a different route every time!</li>

<li><strong>Unique storybook visual style</strong> made with hand-drawn line art and a pixelated brush.</li>
<li>Optional dialogue that <strong>doesnât take control away</strong> from the player. Just walk away mid-conversation, and characters will wave you off.</li>
<li><strong>Fill out your official wizardly notebook</strong> by scrying new creatures and documenting your findings! Review your field logs any time to see the world in closer detail!</li>
<li><strong>Charming original soundtrack</strong> with new tracks for every corner of the world.</li>

      <title>Frogun is a 3D platformer with the soul of a Nintendo 64 game </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Frogun is a brand new Native Linux release, designed in the spirit of the PlayStation 1 and Nintendo 64 era, this is a proper classic 3D platformer. Note: key provided by their PR team.</p>
<p>Developed by Molegato with publishing help from Top Hat Studios, you play the role of Renata who has an unusual weapon â a Frog, that's also their best friend. It's a thoroughly quirky premise and incredibly charming. For fans of collectathons, this is something you will likely enjoy. Starting off with a sweet little semi-animated intro video, you learn that Renata's parents appear to have gone missing so you take it upon yourself to go off on an adventure to find them.</p>
<p>Official release trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EKrKy7LpYZc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2840e0ecdcd596a206f1c95391302e28.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EKrKy7LpYZc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This really is a collectathon through and through. Every level presents you with numerous coins, emeralds, notes and more to collect. Since it's a 3D platformer, you also have to pay attention to the world around you flicking the viewpoint around to ensure you're not missing out any secrets of which there's a good few to find. Not only that, you also gain extra coins if you manage to complete levels within a certain time limit so it is pushing you a little to be fast but you can easily repeat levels so it's not really a problem and it doesn't penalise you for not getting a specific time either.</p>
<p>Your Frogun is a fun feature to set it apart from other similar games too. Not only is your little froggy friend your gun to sucker up various creatures to move them out of your way, or throw a pot or two at them, it's also your way to traverse obstacles and reach different areas. When running around you can fire your frog's tongue to stick to surfaces to pull you across. If you finding sticking to a wall difficult, you can also hold down a button to have a more pin-point aim ability.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore colorful levels full of crispy pixelated ruins, freezing snow caps, and scorching lava swamps in a modern representation of the lowpoly aesthetic</li>
<li>From levers to buttons, lethal traps, and adorable enemies, there are countless ways to use your Frogun to navigate the world!</li>
<li>Race Renata's rival and fight big bosses</li>
<li>Find secret areas or shortcuts by mastering the grappling mechanics! How nimble are you?</li>
<li>Collect emblems by fulfilling level challenges, and discover the stories of other adventurers through hidden diary notes</li>
<li>Visit the hatter to trade your coins for hats, bestiary entries, game art, and more</li>
<li>A posable photo mode to let you show off your creativity</li>
<li>Unlockable 2-player duel arenas to challenge your friends!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A nice family friendly game for fans of the classics, and a good one to introduce a younger audience into it all too. Overall most of it is pretty easy and accessible too, except when you get to the racing where it can be a little frustrating to get through. For the most part though, it sets out to provide exactly what it advertises, a colourful and inviting throwback. My time with it played on Steam Deck with the Native build was great too, all worked nicely.</p>
<p>This is another game that was funded with help from people on Kickstarter, so it's nice to see it release without big issues or long delays!</p>

      <title>BLASTRONAUT is a fresh mining game full of explosions</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love exploration and mining? Want to do it with many explosions? Check out the new Native Linux release of BLASTRONAUT.</p>
<p>"It is a dangerous but lucrative job. Explore this vast procedurally generated world with your jetpack. Extract the minerals with an explosive gel. Expand your mining platform. But most importantly: stay alive."</p>
<p>It recently entered Early Access and it has very quickly won me over. A core gameplay loop that's quite satisfying, with you exploring deep below the surface and blowing everything up for resources, to then quickly blast back up to the surface with your jetpack to sell those resources and upgrade. There's plenty of games that have you go mining but not many do so <em>explosively</em> like this.</p>
<p>Here's some recently captured footage of it running on a Steam Deck and it works beautifully:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3iZHhnvxoCo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/58f2db3f7e39e3a136ced3c77a7785a8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3iZHhnvxoCo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Quite excited to watch this one develop. A really great idea and a shiny gem in the making here. I have a feeling it's another that's going to sucker away many hours of my time.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1392650/BLASTRONAUT/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>ScummVM 2.6.0 out now with more retro game support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Keeping a great many classics alive with new game engines, <a href="https://www.scummvm.org/" target="_blank">ScummVM</a> version 2.6.0 is officially out now.</p>
<p>This release brings eight newly supported games across 6 game engines, so there's plenty to be excited about for this very important open source game preservation tech. Newly supported includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sanitarium</li>
<li>Hades Challenge</li>
<li>Marvel Comics Spider-Man: The Sinister Six</li>
<li>The 11th Hour</li>
<li>Clandestiny</li>
<li>Tender Loving Care (CD-ROM Editions)</li>
<li>Uncle Henry's Playhouse</li>
<li>Wetlands</li>
<li>Chewy: Esc from F5</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course they're not just focused on getting new games running but fixing up older supported games too, and they've got numerous bug fixes and improvements there across various games engines to improve the likes of Simon the Sorcerer 1 &amp; 2, Titanic, Sherlock, Backyard Baseball 2003, Monkey Island 1 &amp; 2, Full Throttle, The Dig and The Curse of Monkey Island and many more.</p>
<p>A big addition to the UI this release is a new icon grid overview, along with some shiny artwork to go with it. Sounds like a nice way to show off and browse your collection.</p>

      <title>Free first-person strategy shooter Unvanquished version 0.53 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The free and open source first-person strategy shooter Unvanquished has a new Beta release, which is quite a big one too overall on what's changed. Don't let the Beta tag fool you, it's a fully playable game, they're just not ready to call it the finished product yet. Over a year since their last release!</p>
<p>With 0.53 Beta they continued working to improve the AI in many areas, so they should now be far less boring to play with. They also replaced their whole UI / HUD framework with one that is actually still maintained helping them keep up to date, some bits of the UI will also look better as a result.</p>
<p>You will also see the Parpax map had a complete overhaul:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14028345961659441855gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14028345961659441855gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For the AI, what actually changed? A lot! They're smarter about when to flee, human bots can now use grenades, human bots are smarter about what equipment they buy and pathfinding improvements. Alien bots are also smarter about evolving, so they won't die instantly from low health, they're also a bit smarter about when they choose to evolve before fighting.</p>
<p>Naturally tons of bugs were fixed over the last year too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is still a lot of work for us to do: many AI improvements are still possible, we still need to update the GUI/HUD lib we use to its latest version, and to implement better GUIs with it, and most importantly we still hope to replace our old NaCl integration with Wasm, which would allow us to support more hardware architectures like ARM systems.</p>
<p>We also know the gameplay is not perfect, but we believe we improved the game a lot in that year of development.</p>

      <title>Inspired by classic JRPGs, Shadows of Adam gets improved Linux and Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Shadows of Adam is a JRPG inspired retro game from Something Classic Games that released back in 2017 and a small update came recently to improve it on Linux and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>The patch was small simply improving support for running it on Linux distributions that have kernel 5.x and upwards (the Steam Deck is kernel 5.13). So it might not be some mind-blowing change but it's fantastic to see developers of all sizes keep their games nicely maintained. Also a good excuse to highlight another indie gem!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4jPO8BRNRTM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1a683570000a813ac00d1d7550d45bbc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4jPO8BRNRTM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Compelling Character Driven Story:</strong> Shadows of Adamâs story is one with deep narrative and an interesting plot. The story revolves around 4 main characters: Asrael, Kellan, Curtis and Talon.</li>
<li><strong>A Strategic AP Management Battle System:</strong> AP is restored between each round of battle automatically and through defeating enemies. This allows a unique attrition system that encourages skill use and fast combat.</li>
<li><strong>Beautiful Visuals:</strong> Shadows of Adam features beautifully modernized visuals inspired by classic JRPGs of the SNES-era.</li>
<li><strong>Original Soundtrack With Over 44 Tracks:</strong> An original soundtrack by Tyler Mire thatâs inspired by music from the genre's greatest games. This soundtrack includes unique themes for each area and character and has an emphasis on strong melody and emotional connection.</li>

      <title>Linux user share on Steam continues rising â highest for years again</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has put out their usual monthly Steam Hardware &amp; Software <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey?platform=combined" target="_blank">Survey</a> and it's looking like good news for Linux and Steam Deck once again.</p>
<p>We've seen the user share rise up to <strong>1.23%</strong>, making it the highest point in multiple years (again). If we use Valve's last monthly active user count, that points the monthly active Linux user count somewhere around 1,623,600. See more on our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">Steam Tracker</a>. Linux has remained at 1% or above for at least a full year now too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7666733111659439925gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7666733111659439925gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>According to the survey when filtering just to Linux, here are the most popular distributions:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 13.87% +2.45%</li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 11.40% +1.29%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 64 bit 9.78% -0.12%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS 64 bit 9.28% -0.45%</li>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 7.60% +0.02%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 20.3 64 bit 6.29% -0.16%</li>
<li>Freedesktop.org 21.08.14 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 5.29% -0.76%</li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 4.90% +0.11%</li>
<li>Other 31.60% -2.36%</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So we're seeing Valve's SteamOS now make up 7.6% of the Linux gaming audience on Steam, which is a pretty good early showing for the Steam Deck. In terms of hardware, on the Linux side the Steam Deck appears to be the most popular device as it's now top of the list of GPUs used too.</p>

      <title>Stealth-action game Republique is now FREE and Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Consider this your quick tip of the week, as Republique from developer Camouflaj is now free to keep on Steam and it's also Steam Deck Verified! The developer has reached their 10 year anniversary as a studio, so they've put Republique free as it was their first game. A nice little gesture.</p>
<p>"Help a woman named Hope escape from a totalitarian state in this stealth thriller that explores the perils of government surveillance in the Internet Age. Hack into the nationâs elaborate network, take control, and guide Hope to freedom across five episodes "</p>
<p>Here's a quick look at it working on Steam Deck. Looks like the Verified tick is nice and correct on this one, it works really quite nicely right out of the box:</p>

      <title>No need to wait on Valve, the Steam Deck Docking Station from JSAUX is great</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While many will no doubt wait on Valve for the official Steam Deck Dock, a lot of hardware vendors are coming out with their own versions. JSAUX are one of them and they sent over their Docking Station for Steam Deck for me to take a look at.</p>
<p>Since the Steam Deck is a full PC, you might want to hook it up to a proper monitor to use the desktop mode or just on your big TV and this will allow you to do just that without fussing around.</p>
<p>JSAUX actually sent over both their original model and the newer upgraded version (<a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/upgraded-docking-station-for-steam-deck" target="_blank">HB0603</a>). Testing both, I've come away very impressed. Honestly, at this point, you probably don't need to wait on Valve for the official one because the Upgraded Docking Station for Steam Deck from JSAUX does pretty much everything you need and it works a treat. While you could go for any number of USB-C hubs from the likes of Amazon, there's something special about a proper dock like this designed and tested to work nicely directly with the Deck.</p>
<p>Testing it extensively with my TV and my PC monitor, I've really not had much trouble at all. Most of my issues were just software quirks on the SteamOS side, and as Valve continue to improve the docked experience with SteamOS upgrades over time the quirks will be improved and they've done work on that a few times recently.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15236383271659370363gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15236383271659370363gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12983927321659370352gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12983927321659370352gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>The upgraded model (which I ended up sticking with) features gigabit ethernet, USB-C for the charging, three USB-A 3.0 ports and HDMI out with 4K 60hz support. The charging is full-power too, so no problems leaving it on charging through the Docking Station while you're using it.</p>
<p>How good is the ethernet? Does the upgraded model have a better speed like it says? Absolutely, you're going to have no issues with ethernet speed on the higher model.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7678529301659780077gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7678529301659780077gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For the most part, the design is close to perfect. While it might not be perhaps as slick as the Nintendo Switch dock with you just sticking it straight in, the design of the Steam Deck doesn't really allow that. JSAUX went with an easy approach here though. Just place the Deck into the gap at the front, then pull over the attached USB-C cable that fits perfectly. With some great anti-slip pads included, the Deck won't be moving while sat inside it. Great build quality too, it looks and feels pretty premium. My only real gripe with the design is the ethernet being on the side, it would have been better if that was on the back too as you can see the ethernet poking out.</p>
<p>Really, there's not a whole lot I can actually say about this without padding it out unnecessarily and that is absolutely a good thing. Everything works great. It's a simple device with a simple purpose and is exactly what you want to nicely rest the deck while powering / charging and gaining a few more ports.</p>
<p>We still don't know how much the Valve model will cost, and it won't exactly offer a great many advantages over this. Sure it has an added DisplayPort and a bump from USB 3 to 3.1 but I imagine a lot of people won't actually need that. So really JSAUX are positioned well here with pretty reasonable pricing too.</p>
<p>You can buy each model at the links below. Really, just get the upgraded model though unless you're really penny-pinching:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/steam-deck-docking-station" target="_blank">Original </a>-Â  $39.99 USD</li>
<li><a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/upgraded-docking-station-for-steam-deck" target="_blank">Upgraded</a> -Â  $49.99 USD</li>
</ul>
<p>I can happily recommend it. It's now one of my favourite Deck accessories from anywhere.</p>

      <title>Steam gets support for Nintendo Online classic controllers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve recently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/oldnews/141152" target="_blank">released</a> an update for the main Steam client, which amongst other things brings support in Steam Input for the Nintendo Online classic controllers. These are the special controllers Nintendo offers for playing their classics on Nintendo Switch, although Steam having support for them makes sure they have a whole lot more life.</p>
<p>The support includes the NES, SNES, Nintendo 64 and Sega Mega Drive / Genesis controllers.</p>
<p>Not only that Steam also now supports the Qanba Obsidian and Dragon Arcade Joysticks, the HORI Fighting Stick mini 4 and it has improved rumble emulation on DualSense Wireless Controllers with updated firmware.</p>
<p>A bunch of other fixes came in too like the Steam Overlay not working with Vulkan 1.3 applications, a Steam Cloud issue where an app launch would stall if there are sync conflicts but Cloud Sync is disabled for the game or account, a fix for resource usage of chat and web browser in Steam Overlay when hidden, a fix for micro-stutter in some situations where Steamworks API calls could be briefly blocked by Steam client log file, a fix for crashes with Vulkan games using the VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_library extension and more.</p>
<p>Specific to Linux these fixes were also released:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed resource usage of chat and browsers when Steam client is minimized/closed</li>
<li>Fixed Steam Overlay "Force Quit" not working for some native Linux games</li>
<li>Fixed some games being unable to create desktop shortcuts</li>
<li>Fixed the Steam client triggering "split lock" warnings</li>
</ul>

      <title>Valve bans devs from adding review scores and awards on Steam store assets</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's a lot of places where developers can have their game logo across Steam, and some developers have been going pretty overboard with noisy images filled with extras. Valve is putting a stop to it.</p>
<p>Announced in a Steamworks <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/6232436041608114695" target="_blank">blog post</a> Valve mentioned how they've "noticed more text, award logos, and even review scores being included by game developers in their graphical asset images" and that "some game logos themselves have become so small that it's hard for players to tell what the name of the game is" resulting in various graphical assets that are so noisy they're "distracting and hard to read". They also noted in most cases it's all in English too "isolating much of the Steam audience that doesn't speak English".</p>
<p>Hard to really argue with that, as a Steam customer it has become something of a nuisance. The example they included shows a small part of the issue:</p>
<p><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5238836511659353479gol1.jpg"/>There's plenty that did it far worse than their funny example images, but obviously Valve doesn't want to call out developers directly.</p>
<p>New rules come into effect on September 1st, with these clarifications:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_Whyj8">No review scores of any kind, including Steam reviews or external news sources</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_Whyj8">No award names, symbols, or logos</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_Whyj8">No discount marketing copy (eg. no "On Sale Now" or "Up to 90% off" text)</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_Whyj8">No text or imagery promoting a different product. This includes no marketing of sequels or other titles in the same franchise</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_Whyj8">No other miscellaneous text</div>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a few little exceptions of course, like adjusting the images to tastefully note the latest update which is never really a problem. Valve added a special bit for developers to override an image for one month.</p>
<p>Some developers aren't happy about it though, as it has been another small way to perhaps pull in a bit more attention, with images that have awards some Steam customers might be more likely to click and take a look. I get that developers want to do a little showing off but quite a number really took it too far and Steam has dedicated parts of store pages to list awards and other things.</p>
<p>In other Steam news, Valve has <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/valve-speeds-up-steam-deck-production-some-more-all-existing-reservations-this-year/" target="_blank">increased production of the Steam Deck</a>!</p>

      <title>Mojang rolls out Player Chat Reporting into Minecraft Java</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Minecraft <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-java-edition-1-19-1" target="_blank">Java Edition 1.19.1</a> is out now and it comes with some controversial changes, that many players are not particularly happy about.</p>
<p>The first major change is the addition of player reporting, if they send abusive message in the game chat. The system allows you to report specific people on servers and select multiple messages to include, plus add some comments. From there, Mojang / Microsoft moderators will look over reports and deal with them. It applies to everyone, even private servers. Linking together with that is another change to the text chat. With their new secure chat system, it will put a note by the chat for each message that was not sent through it or if the server somehow tampered with it.</p>
<p>Mojang say people won't be banned for swearing but it's more aimed at "hate speech, bullying, harassment, sexual solicitation, or making true threats to others". If you get banned it won't affect playing single-player.</p>
<p>Naturally, there's already mods to get around this like the <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/no-chat-reports" target="_blank">No Chat Reports</a> mod that claims to strip out the signatures attached to chat messages, making them "impossible to track and associate your chat messages with your Minecraft and, by extension, Microsoft account".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CSdQ61dEizI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4eef611dc22eaa172bd87d48b7532545.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CSdQ61dEizI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In case you missed it, Mojang also recently said <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/mojang-say-no-to-nfts-and-blockchain-with-minecraft/" target="_blank">no to NFTs and blockchain</a> in Minecraft.</p>

      <title>Linux gaming overlay MangoHud version 0.6.8 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud" target="_blank">MangoHud</a> is probably one of my favourite open source projects giving Linux gamers a fancy HUD to display various performance metrics in a nice overlay. Version 0.6.8 is out now!</p>
<p>It actually comes in two parts: there's MangoHud which is the generic overlay for most users, then there's MangoApp which is designed to be used directly with Gamescope (like on the Steam Deck). MangoHud can give you an FPS counter, frame timings, CPU and GPU temperature monitoring, battery remaining, RAM use, VRAM use and much more.</p>
<p>What does it look like? Well, any time you see the performance overlay in the corner on a Steam Deck, that's it in action. Something like this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1878409321659346755gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1878409321659346755gol1.jpg"/></a>That's set on the highest output level.</em></p>
<p>Here's what's new in version 0.6.8:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>MangoHud</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bumped layer api version to 1.3.0<br/>
	This fixes MangoHud not loading with latest DXVK</li>
<li>Bumped meson to 0.60</li>
<li>Only install data files if <code class="inline-code">include_doc</code> option is set</li>
<li>Allow use of system nlohmann_json dependency</li>
<li>Added metainfo file</li>
<li>Fixed <code class="inline-code">table_columns</code> not working as expected</li>
<li>Minor adjustments to hud elements and imgui</li>
<li>Convert from <code class="inline-code">printf's</code> to SPDLOG</li>
<li>Added <code class="inline-code">MANGOHUD_LOG_LEVEL</code> env variable<br/>
	it takes <code class="inline-code">off</code>, <code class="inline-code">info</code>, <code class="inline-code">err</code>, <code class="inline-code">warn</code></li>
<li>Added StarCitizen_Launcher.exe and InsurgencyEAC.exe to blacklist</li>
<li>Added FCAT support</li>
<li>Disabled <code class="inline-code">gamepad_battery_icon</code> by default</li>
<li>Generalize control over socket so it works with OpenGL as well</li>
<li>AMDGPU: fixed gfx and cpu power metrics being parsed incorrectly</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">fps_only</code> disables <code class="inline-code">legacy_layout</code> by default</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MangoApp</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added man page</li>
<li>Install MangoApp layer to libdir_mangohud</li>
<li>Prevent resizing of the MangoApp window when using <code class="inline-code">fps_only</code>.<br/>
	This prevents the hud from flickering when number of digits increase or decrease</li>
<li>Fixed issues caused by us not releasing the XAtom.<br/>
	Namely preventing other apps from using the gamescope overlay and sometimes causing a black box to be drawn</li>
<li>Disabled vulkan layer<br/>
	It was not working properly so we disabled it until fixed as to not cause confusion.</li>
</ul>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

</ul>
<p>Improvements</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve error handling in all drivers</li>
<li>Clean up driver code</li>
<li>Add additional support for Razer Huntsman V2 functionality</li>
</ul>
<p>Bug fixes</p>
<ul>

<li>udev: Check 'razer' as well as 'hid-generic'</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>To help you manage your devices you will also likely need a proper UI. There's a few available to try like <a href="https://polychromatic.app/" target="_blank">Polychromatic</a>, <a href="https://github.com/z3ntu/RazerGenie" target="_blank">RazerGenie</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.com/gabmus/razerCommander" target="_blank">razerCommander</a> and <a href="http://bithatch.co.uk/snake.html" target="_blank">Snake</a>.</p>

      <title>Linux 5.19 is out now, Torvalds released it using an Apple silicon MacBook</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest kernel release is out with <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2022/7/31/295" target="_blank">Linux 5.19</a> and showing just how far Linux support for the newer Apple silicon MacBooks has come, Linus Torvalds did the release on one!</p>
<p>Writing in the release notes, Torvalds mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On a personal note, the most interesting part here is that I did the release (and am writing this) on an arm64 laptop. It's something I've been waiting for for a _loong_ time, and it's finally reality, thanks to the Asahi team. We've had arm64 hardware around running Linux for a long time, but none of it has really been usable as a development platform until now.</p>
<p>It's the third time I'm using Apple hardware for Linux development - I did it many years ago for powerpc development on a ppc970 machine. And then a decade+ ago when the Macbook Air was the only real thin-and-lite around. And now as an arm64 platform.</p>
<p>Not that I've used it for any real work, I literally have only been doing test builds and boots and now the actual release tagging. But I'm trying to make sure that the next time I travel, I can travel with this as a laptop and finally dogfooding the arm64 side too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Torvalds also mentioned the next kernel release is likely to be the big 6.0.</em></p>
<p>For those that don't know, the <a href="https://asahilinux.org/" target="_blank">Asahi Linux</a> team have been dedicated to working on Linux support for the newer Arm hardware from Apple. It's come a long way in a short amount of time, with Apple M2 support only just landing in July 2022.</p>
<p>As always for kernel releases there's absolutely tons of changes, the vast majority of gamers don't really need to know about apart from the usual additions of new hardware support, bug fixes, security improvements and so on. This includes better Apple M1, Wacom hardware support upgrades, Lenovo ThinkPad TrackPoint II support, improvements for Intel laptops when in sleep mode, NTFS driver improvements, exFAT performance improvements and the list goes on.</p>

      <title>Valve speeds up Steam Deck production some more, all existing reservations this year</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3413183219974913052" target="_blank">has announced</a> that they've sorted out various issues with their Steam Deck supply chain, so they will get through reservations much faster than expected now. This means a lot of people will be bumped up the list a bit getting their Steam Deck purchase email a lot sooner.</p>
<p>Everyone who has an existing reservation will get their purchase email this year. So many who were in "Q4 or later" were bumped up to the Q3 window and Valve said everyone else is now sitting properly inside Q4.</p>
<p>Any new reservations will be in the Q4 list but if those fill up, naturally they spill over into next year. Either way it's good news, as Valve can get Steam Deck units shipping a lot sooner than before.</p>
<p>We don't know exactly what has changed, as Valve only said that "the supply chain shortfalls that affect Steam Deck are gradually clearing up, and we're continuing to ramp production, so we're able to produce more Decks faster than ever before"</p>
<p>Valve also said to expect "more news soon".</p>
<p>This is awesome news, I'm excited to see more of you getting your units. Every single device shipping is a new potential Linux gamer!</p>

      <title>Yars: Recharged from Atari launches August 23rd</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Yars: Recharged is the latest remake from Atari with developers Adamvision Studios and SneakyBox and it's launching on August 23rd with Native Linux support. This is the latest entry in the Recharged series followingÂ Missile Command: Recharged, Centipede: Recharged, Black Widow: Recharged, Asteroids: Recharged and Breakout: Recharged. No doubt they have more planned too.</p>
<p>They also teamed up with award-winning artist and composer Megan McDuffee for the the beat-heavy, pulsing original soundtrack. Plus a new teaser trailer up too:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nae3tQy08IA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b4556766b60365cd8d71be2ca46ce666.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nae3tQy08IA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arcade mode: Boss rush of 30 enemies. Itâs not endless, but itâs VERY difficult to get to the end of this mode. Three hits and you die, but donât worry, that hit-count resets when moving to the next fight.</li>
<li>Missions: 30 unique, challenging bosses and only one life to beat each. Like Gravitar: Recharged, thereâs one global leaderboard for mission mode, so you need to be on your game. Bosses pose a challenge, so you will need to take them head on with a barrage of bullets or start with the smaller, Minor Cores first and work your way to the boss.</li>
<li>Power-Ups: Minor Cores will drop power-ups when attached. Shoot in all directions at once, rapid fire, explosive shots, or fire a railgun â the nature of the power up is tied to the nature of the core that dropped it.</li>
<li>Co-op: Yars: Recharged is a local co-op game in both arcade and mission mode, a big change from the original and a ton of fun for you and a friend.</li>
</ul>
<p>Will be available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2019990/Yars_Recharged/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Modern Diablo game engine devilutionX sees new release, how to get it on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you want to play the classic Diablo RPG? Well, not only does <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/diablo" target="_blank">GOG</a> have it and the Hellfire expansion but the Native Linux devilutionX game engine can make it even better. Here's how to get it working on Steam Deck (and Linux desktop!).</p>
<p>Why would you want to use devilutionX? Well, it's constantly updated to improve playing Diablo for modern platforms! It just keeps on getting better. Many advanced features like high FPS support, more resolution support, skippable movies, quick casting, better multiplayer, UI improvements, better saved games and the list goes on.</p>
<p>How to:</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, you're going to want to install the <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> as that makes managing games from GOG <em>really</em> easy. You can get it easily as a Flatpak from <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.heroicgameslauncher.hgl" target="_blank">Flathub</a>, and on the Steam Deck from the Discover app.</li>
<li>Sign into GOG with Heroic and download Diablo.</li>
<li>Next up, download the AppImage from the devilutionX GitHub <a href="https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/releases" target="_blank">releases page</a>.</li>
<li>Make the AppImage executable. Right click -&gt; Properties -&gt; Permissions -&gt; Tick the "Is executable" box.</li>
<li>Move the AppImage into the folder where Diablo is installed.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it, now it will run via the AppImage and detect the content properly and work. However you can also add it to Steam, to launch it directly there.</p>
<p>How to add to Steam:</p>
<ul>
<li>In your Steam Library, go to the top menu where it says Games -&gt; Add a Non-Steam game.</li>
<li>Find where you installed Diablo and select All Files from the bottom of the file picker.</li>
<li>Select the devilutionX AppImage and add it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Done! Now you can launch it from Steam and it works on Steam Deck in Gaming Mode nicely too.</p>
<p>Now here's all that in video form to give you a walkthrough and a quick bit of gameplay just to show it working:</p>

      <title>itch.io has another Creator Day live with 100% going to developers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The game store <a href="http://itch.io" target="_blank">itch.io</a> is running another Creator Day, this is where they don't take any cut from developers. Developers will then get all of the proceeds from each sale (minus any required fees and taxes).</p>
<p>It's a great idea because it can give developers a nice little boost, and for itch as well it's an easy bit of advertisement â hey look even I'm writing about it, free press!</p>
<p>Here's a few ideas to get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arieljurkowski.itch.io/please-fix-the-road" target="_blank">Please Fix The Road</a></li>
<li><a href="https://abbyhoward.itch.io/scarlet-hollow" target="_blank">Scarlet Hollow</a></li>
<li><a href="https://terrycavanagh.itch.io/dicey-dungeons" target="_blank">Dicey Dungeons</a></li>
<li><a href="https://graffiti-games.itch.io/tbcte" target="_blank">Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sleeper-games.itch.io/hyperspace-dogfights" target="_blank">Hyperspace Dogfights</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Check out all that's <a href="https://itch.io/sales" target="_blank">on sale here</a>. I also have a collection of some <a href="https://itch.io/c/1674813/best-linux-games" target="_blank">great Linux games here</a>. Creator Day only runs for 24 hours until midnight PT (7AM UTC tomorrow Sat 30th).</p>
<p>If you do pick up something good, or see a particularly great deal going, do let other readers know in the comments!</p>

      <title>OUTRIDERS officially gets a Playable Steam Deck rating</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Looking for your next RPG-shooter hybrid with online co-op? OUTRIDERS from People Can Fly recently released the WORLDSLAYER expansion and it's now actually Playable on the Steam Deck (and Linux desktop too). Previously it had problems with Easy Anti-Cheat but that is no longer an issue.</p>
<p>Currently you <u>need</u> to set it <em>manually</em> to Proton Experimental (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1GvONkE9S0" target="_blank">guide</a>), as a very recent update stopped it working on Proton 7 and if you have any problems, just ensure you have the "Proton EasyAntiCheat Runtime" installed in your Steam Library. I imagine very soon it will be re-verified and set properly to Proton Experimental so you won't have to do that.</p>
<p>The developer even <a href="https://twitter.com/Outriders/status/1549411774738432000" target="_blank">tweeted</a> a brief announcement video about the official Deck Playable status. It appears it's Playable and not Verified due to needing the on-screen keyboard to be opened manually (Steam + X).</p>
<p>Here's a look at it on Steam Deck:</p>

<p><em>I think I'm going to enjoy this oneâ¦</em></p>
<p>You can buy it from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/outriders?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/680420/OUTRIDERS/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
