      <title>System76 working on a standalone PC case, plus a big Open Firmware upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://system76.com/" target="_blank">System76</a> are the company behind the popular Pop!_OS Linux distribution, plus various laptops and desktops and now they're expanding once again. <em>Their Pop!_OS is in<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/linux-hits-a-multi-year-high-for-user-share-on-steam-thanks-to-steam-deck/" target="_blank"> the top list for Linux</a> users on Steam.</em></p>
<p>For starters, they're going to be bringing out their own custom PC case for DIY builders. Carl Richell, the CEO and Founder, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@carlrichell@fosstodon.org/110471188327819605" target="_blank">mentioned on Mastodon</a> their new case is called the Nebula and it's set to arrive later this month for anyone who wanted a case inspired by their in-house custom-built Thelio desktop line. Here's what it looks like currently:</p>

<p>Richell mentioned in a reply there will be three different models for various sized motherboards too.</p>
<p>On top of that System76 formally announced an upgrade to their System76 Open Firmware in a <a href="https://blog.system76.com/post/major-updates-for-system76-open-firmware-june-2023" target="_blank">blog post</a>. This update includes: Intel Management Engine being disabled now a bug is fixed, Secure Boot and TPM2 support, increased battery power limits which can give better CPU performance, NVIDIA Dynamic Boost support, Coreboot support for 13th Gen HX-class Intel processors and more.</p>

      <title>Halls of Torment hits over 70K sales in the first week</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a nice little indie success story for you! Halls of Torment from Chasing Carrots launched on May 24th into Early Access with Native Linux support and it works great on Steam Deck. They've announced that their launch week was pretty great!</p>
<p>Writing on <a href="https://twitter.com/aayph/status/1664192884990509056" target="_blank">Twitter</a> one of their team mentioned that they've had over 70,000 sales, 22,000 daily active users (with around 1,390 of those on Steam Deck) and over 29% of people played it over 10 hours. Great to see that even with so many games releasing on Steam all the time, with nearly 7,000 already this year, that we can see such a success so early for smaller games like this.</p>
<p>You can see my original <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/halls-of-torment-is-out-in-early-access-a-great-fusion-of-diablo-and-vampire-survivors/" target="_blank">release article here</a> and my video below:</p>

      <title>Linux hits a multi-year high for user share on Steam thanks to Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After some recent weirdness where March saw a big drop, the Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/?platform=combined" target="_blank">May 2023</a> is now showing the Linux share at a multi-year high.</p>
<p>Checking back over <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">our Steam Tracker</a> where we're keeping tabs on it over time, we've not seen the Linux user share being as high as it is right now in at least 6 years. The Linux user share is now on 1.47% with macOS on 2.39% and Windows at 96.14%,</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15843983561685710785gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15843983561685710785gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>When filtering the results over to just Linux here's the current most popular distributions for Steam gaming:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 25.32% + 2.55%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 9.99% + 0.20%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS 64 bit 9.72% - 1.12%</li>
<li>Freedesktop.org SDK 22.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 7.27% - 0.34%</li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 5.79% - 0.46%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 21.1 64 bit 5.46% + 0.49%</li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 3.53% - 0.33%</li>
<li>Other 32.92% - 0.98%</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of absolute numbers we can take an educated guess here based on the last time Valve gave out their monthly active users, which they said was 132 million back in March 2022. So based on that 1.47% it would mean around 1,940,400 estimated monthly active users for Linux. However, Valve did <em>not</em> give out the number for the past year, and we know Steam is growing all the time, so in reality it's probably <em>much</em> higher.</p>

      <title>itch.io is hosting another big Queer Games Bundle for Pride Month</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's LGBT Pride Month which means there's another big bundle of games available in the Queer Games Bundle now on itch.io. Featuring 466 different items from 293 creators it's filled full with games, physical games, assets, soundtracks and more.</p>
<p>From the bundle page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we had the budget of an AAA game, we could give every solo developer in this bundle a livable wage multiple times over for a year and every single team a massive funding boost. Imagine what the developers and artists in this bundle could create a year from now if they weren’t worried about starving or how to pay their rent this month.</p>
<p>Purchasing the Queer Games Bundle is a direct action that you can take right now to support queer people in a life-changing way, and in exchange, you get over 450 amazing, heartfelt, fun, and radical games and artworks. </p>
<p>Help nurture our diverse queer arts community, fund the creation of the next great game you love, and find your new favorite game by purchasing the bundle today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's two different versions you can support the creators with the <a href="https://itch.io/b/1812/queer-games-bundle-2023" target="_blank">main bundle</a> and a <a href="https://itch.io/b/1813/queer-games-bundle-2023-pay-what-you-can-edition" target="_blank">PWYW bundle</a> ($10 minimum) for people who can afford less but still wish to grab it.</p>
<p>With this being the third year they've done the bundle, last year they managed to raise over $200K for all the creators involved across the two bundles.</p>

      <title>AirJet from Frore Systems could be great cooling for a Steam Deck 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If there's one thing I truly want from a Steam Deck 2 aside from the usual performance related upgrades, it would be better cooling and less noise. Perhaps the new AirJet from Frore Systems is what Valve could use.</p>
<p>What is it? According to Frore Systems the AirJet is a "fully self-contained active heat sink module, which is silent, thin, and light". This was revealed a little while ago at CES but interest in it is heating up again now, as they've <a href="https://www.froresystems.com/media-room/the-worlds-first-mini-pc-to-feature-airjet-r-launched-at-computex-2023" target="_blank">revealed</a> the first system coming with it in the ZOTAC ZBOX PI430AJ.</p>
<p>They're targeting many different types of devices including handheld gaming like the Steam Deck. Quite an exciting idea to have more space for other things since it's so small, a smaller slot would be needed for the intake and vent so less of your snack crumbs and dust would get in, reduced heat and being a whole lot quieter overall too. Although, it would push prices a bit no doubt.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental update fixes &#34;many&#34; games on Steam Deck and desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has put out a small update to Proton Experimental, which should fix many games due to a <em>regression</em> that was hiding away. With this release they've updated the included version of DXVK, which is what does the Direct 3D 9 / 10 / 11 to Vulkan translation for Windows games on Steam Deck and desktop Linux.</p>
<p>The changelog notes that it specifically fixes <em>Blazblue Centralfication</em> and <em>Kung-Fu Strike - The Warriors Rise</em> but they also mentioned a vague "many other games". It's one of those bugs their developers know would have hit numerous games but those are what they've re-tested and had reported working properly again. So if you saw a game that had some issues recently appear with Proton Experimental updates, time to check again.</p>
<p>Bugs that affect many titles is one of the fun parts of a translation layer like Proton, even a small change can potentially affect hundreds of games.</p>
<p>You can see the changelog <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How to change your Proton version:</strong></p>
<p>Steam Deck:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a game in your Library and head to the little cog icon on the right.</li>
<li>Click Properties, then Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>On a Linux desktop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right click a game, go to Properties.</li>
<li>Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>

      <title>Steam Deck OS update brings graphics driver fixes - ready up for SteamOS 3.5</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has now released two small graphics driver updates for Steam Deck OS (SteamOS) <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3702568031445749185" target="_blank">3.4.8</a>, which means the Preview update channel is now ready for a big update to drop.</p>
<p>The updates included in 3.4.8 are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Updated graphics driver with a fix for a GPU crash in Splitgate.</li>
<li>Updated the graphics driver with performance improvements for STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>These were left in the Preview channel for a while but now the Preview channel is <em>empty</em>, meaning the update many have been waiting for could be readying to drop into Preview real soon. We also haven't seen a major stable update in some time but Valve are constantly updating the Beta with client-side changes that eventually they will bundle into a stable update too.</p>
<p>SteamOS 3.5 is going to bring with it quite a lot including a Linux kernel upgrade, likely an updated KDE Plasma desktop version, more graphics driver upgrades, various additions to Gaming Mode like Soundtrack support and Screen Colour settings (teased in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyAmFvLdYbg" target="_blank">one of my videos</a>), adjustments to the performance overlay and no doubt plenty more.</p>
<p>Even Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais is doing a tiny little tease on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1664081074300022785" target="_blank">Twitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is out in Stable now, so Preview is nice and empty. 👀</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are you hoping that the new SteamOS upgrade brings with it?</p>

      <title>Physics be damned, go build some crazy stuff in Poly Bridge 3</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dry Cactus have now released Poly Bridge 3, the latest in their multi-million selling physics-based bridge-building puzzle game series and it looks to be the wildest yet. As before, it comes with full Native Linux support.</p>
<p>The idea and the levels often look simple. Just build a bridge, to get vehicles over to the other side. However, it quickly throws in plenty of annoyances that will make you craft some of the most insane death-trap bridges ever made that would make an architect cry. "Suspension bridges, draw-bridges, multi-level bridges, crazy almost-bridges, bridges, bridges, bridges!" — as the developer says.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="e5tSnAh3P14"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2d7a96d57bfba549daefdbfe626b721d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/e5tSnAh3P14" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Feature Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Campaign - Explore the new Open World Campaign with a dozen worlds and 100+ new levels. Jumps, Hydraulics, ‘Normal’ Bridges, and more giving you hours of gameplay to enjoy! Take a flying leap in Vaulting Towers or flex those hydraulic muscles in Bifrost Bend!</li>
<li>Sandbox - Let your engineering creativity flow with no restrictions in Sandbox mode, allowing you to push your bridge building skills to the limit. Challenge your friends and the community by designing intricate levels and publish them online for everyone to enjoy.</li>
<li>Community - Explore virtually infinite content and challenges designed by the community in the Steam Workshop. See what bridge designs other players come up with and show off your own in the Gallery. Challenge yourself and others by competing for the top spots in the cut-throat leaderboards and histograms.</li>
<li>Custom Physics - Our custom physics engine gives total control, reliability, and accuracy to your bridges. Sleep easy at night knowing your bridges will perform consistently every time!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's plenty that's new in this latest release, other than over 100 levels of puzzles to build your way through. There's improved modding support, decoration objects, the ability to create all sorts for it from vehicles to random additional shapes to place throughout levels. In terms of gameplay there's now some that have "build zones" where the challenge is to build in a more confined space, new foundation materials for super-strong bridges (but they're expensive…) and pre-built materials to bring with you for a helping hand or even an additional obstacle.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1850160/Poly_Bridge_3/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>New Stars is a slimmed down quicker Stellaris-like strategy sim</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need your 4x space fix but find the likes of Stellaris just a bit too long? Perhaps keep an eye on the upcoming release of New Stars. It will have full Native Linux support at release.</p>
<p>"New Stars is a galactic 4X grand strategy game. Stranded on a new colony, and the last of your kind, you must advance your empire, from within and without. Go head-to-head with alien empires and build the greatest empire to survive the test of time, or be the last remaining in the galaxy to succeed."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/414831521685547637gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/414831521685547637gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Speaking to the developer asking them why someone would go for this game rather than an established name, this is what they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1) Relatively fast-paced - Each games last a few hours on average.<br/>
2) Straightforward mechanics - (Should be) Easy to learn with a new tutorial system.<br/>
3) Graphics - galaxy has improved since screenshots, with optimization for low-end devices.<br/>
4) UI - unique with elements inspired from a wide range of games.<br/>
<br/>
There are similarities to Stellaris, such as the fleet management and fleets in general, however the gameplay, mechanics, and pacing is a lot different. Civilization and Stellaris were originally the main inspirations for the game, but New Stars is it's own game.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Highlighted Features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customize your empire from world preferences, different ideologies with their own bonuses, hundreds of empire icons and more. Customize a unique galaxy based on your chosen settings. There are five different galaxy sizes to choose from.</li>
<li>Unique empires, species, and clans exist within a customizable and procedurally generated galaxy with limitless possibilities, and thousands of unique planets, stars and worlds. Some planets have valuable resources that can be collected.</li>
<li>Explore star systems and discover new secrets of the galaxy, and find clues to your lost home. Discoveries such as white dwarfs, ancient ruins, lost ships, and much more can be found between the abyss. Some planets have hidden features that increase their value.</li>
<li>Expand your empire across new stars to new frontiers, and build strong colonies that will power your galactic economy. Collect natural resources from planets and stars using starhubs. Beware of pesky barbaric clans that may plunder your resources for their own gain.</li>
<li>Merge ships into one fleet, and combine them against your adversaries. Defend against attacks by upgrading starbases, or fortifying your colonies. Research new ship types or advanced military capabilities to get an edge over your alien foes.</li>
<li>Declare wars, trade resources, make agreements, declare friendships, share intel, forge powerful alliances, and much more. Some empires may be openly hostile or require appeasing, others may be cooperative, and some may be integrated into your empire.</li>
<li>Construct modular starships from unlocked modules, and turrets. Unlock larger ships and more powerful ship types, sections, turrets, and more. There are almost limitless combinations to meet your empire's needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Their latest progress report video can be seen on it below:</p>

      <title>The OmniCase 2 from JSAUX is a quality USB-C hub worth grabbing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A while ago hardware accessory maker JSAUX sent over the OmniCase 2 Pro, and it's a great USB-C hub worth grabbing if you need some extra ports for a Steam Deck, a desktop, laptop or anything in between.</p>
<p>This isn't a typical Steam Deck focused accessory from JSAUX that they've become known for over the last year, instead it has a wide target of anyone who needs the ports. However, they are doing a special Steam Deck stand just for it along with a laptop stand as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11263710001685544918gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11263710001685544918gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You can pick between two models of either the OmniCase 2 or the OmniCase 2 Pro, with the difference being that the Pro model has Display Port, an extra HDMI port and an extra USB-C port although the Pro model also has one less USB-A. So it really all depends on what ports your after to hook up some more devices.</p>
<p>It's all about the insides. Giving you space to store the wires, and storing any little cards you might need when on the go. The lid just pulls off and slots back on with low-powered magnets, same with the stand for the Steam Deck and also the laptop stand as well.<a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14106806221685544931gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14106806221685544931gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>With my time spent primarily using it on Steam Deck, it's been a perfect experience. I absolutely cannot fault this device. As a USB Hub, it does exactly the job you want it to while also being small enough to stick in your pocket and walk away with it to set up again somewhere else easily.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16905059371685544835gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>This is actually the device I've been using exclusively for all my recent Steam Deck videos and footage, and it hasn't let me down at all over the last few weeks.</p>
<p>It sure is sturdy too - it's built like a mini-tank. If you drop it on your foot, that's going to hurt and it will laugh at you. Don't ask me how I know that. Probably the best build quality of anything JSAUX has sent over so far. There's really not a whole lot else to say - you get what's advertised and it's just plain and simply great.</p>
<p>Cost is the important question though of course and the normal price is about £49 for the OmniCase 2 and about £65 for the OmniCase 2 Pro. You can bundle it with different extras like the stands for more.</p>
<p>An easy recommendation from me for anyone in the market for such a device. It has come in very hand over here. A very tidy little device. You can find it <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jsaux/omnicase-2-the-usb-c-hub-for-gamers-and-digital-nomads" target="_blank">on Kickstarter</a> where it's already proving quite popular gathering close to £20K in funding in the first hour.</p>
<p>If you do go for it, you can expect to see it arrive August onwards.</p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher 2.8.0 adds a DLC manager for Epic Games, side-loading browser apps</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Heroic Games Launcher, my favourite way to get Epic Games and GOG on Steam Deck and desktop Linux released v2.8.0 with some great new features - here's a run over what's new and improved.</p>
<p>There's three headline features for this release: the first being a DLC Manager for Epic Games. Giving you more control over what you're installing, letting you pick from various DLC at install time to make it really easy.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12623992921685529467gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12623992921685529467gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Also added in is support for side-loading browser apps and games, although DRM'd content like Netflix won't work for now. Testing it with Xbox Cloud gaming, the new side-loading feature there worked fine, so it could be useful for lots of different things. The app will also auto download Wine if it didn't find any on the system, which should smooth-over some rough edges for beginners.</p>
<p>Other changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed installation/update progress reports to the frontend.</li>
<li>Numerous UI fixes in the Nord Light theme.</li>
<li>Added missing Sideload game cover when no URL provided.</li>
<li>Fixed Linux native games failing to add to the launcher.</li>
<li>Missing GOG download size in the download manager.</li>
<li>Fixed installation of games that have Selective downloads (Fortnite, Fallout NV, and others).</li>
<li>Made login screen more responsive.</li>
<li>Improved sidebar link effect.</li>
<li>Improved handling of shortcuts from the frontend without depending on the menu.</li>
<li>Updated translations.</li>
<li>Several other fixes and improvements.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Get Battle.net, EA, Epic Games and more on Steam Deck the easy way</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's many different ways to get third-party launchers onto Steam Deck like Battle.net, EA, Epic Games and many others. Here's one way that does most of the work for you.</p>
<p>A developer has created a <a href="https://github.com/moraroy/NonSteamLaunchers-On-Steam-Deck" target="_blank">GitHub project</a>, with a simple script to download and run that will then download and set up the launchers of your choice - this even includes then adding their shortcuts to Steam. It's a fun idea and for those who prefer adding launchers to Steam directly to use Proton instead of using something like Lutris or Heroic, this can be a nice time saver.</p>
<p>Here's an example on Steam Deck with Battle.net and pre-loading Diablo 4:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="esD_Rk3JZP4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/933109e54a2541e3b5d8eee9c237a987.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/esD_Rk3JZP4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>As with any third-party stuff, use at your own risk but I've tested it and it really does work great.</em></p>
<p>All you need to do is download the script, pop it on your desktop for convience and then run it and it will be self-explanatory when going through it. One Steam quirk I've seen is that the shortcut might not work right away or let you change the compatibility options, just reload Steam if that's the case.</p>
<p>For people on <em>desktop</em> Linux, it works just as well there, although I've made a <a href="https://github.com/moraroy/NonSteamLaunchers-On-Steam-Deck/pull/32" target="_blank">pull request</a> for it not to assume "deck" as the username for the Steam shortcut which will ensure it works properly. Until then, you can just adjust the username to match yours in the Properties of the shortcut on Steam in the Launch Options.</p>

      <title>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart hits Steam on July 26th as Sony continue their PC expansion</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sony PlayStation, Insomniac Games and Nixxes Software are bringing Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart to Steam as Sony continue bringing more console games to PC.</p>
<p>The interesting thing here is that their feature list mentioned how it will have many graphics quality options so you can tailor the experience to "a wide range of devices, all the way from high-end PCs to portable PC gaming devices" — Steam Deck anyone? Hopefully this will work nicely at release with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> on Steam Deck and desktop Linux. It will have a pretty wide array of options like NVIDIA DLSS 3, AMD FSR 2, Intel XeSS, Ray Tracing, ultra-wide support and much more. Sounds like they're really going all-out on this one.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="i_jZ3BV6Adc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c0b79677925a79e6c335f481dee2ffec.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/i_jZ3BV6Adc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Such an awesome time to be a gamer on PC, seeing many more previously console exclusive games arriving. Will this be something you'll be playing on desktop Linux or Steam Deck? Must admit it looks pretty good and the previous PlayStation reviews of it have been quite glowing.</p>
<p>You can follow it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1895880/Ratchet__Clank_Rift_Apart/" target="_blank">Steam</a> where it's available for pre-order.</p>
<p><em>Note: the article originally stated it released on July 29th which was incorrect, it launches July 26th. Apologies on the error.</em></p>

      <title>Settlement-building strategy game Circle of Kerzoven is up on Kickstarter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> with full Native Linux support planned, Circle of Kerzoven is an upcoming settlement-building strategy game with some heavy simulation going on.</p>
<p>This isn't your typical city-builder with seemingly every element of it having something simulated that you need to take care of. Your people have individual needs, a specific home and place of work and then there's all the animals as they each need food and drinks, sleep and social interactions. Your actions will have a direct consequence on the lands - so animals can become extinct, or grow wildly out of control, there are seasons and weather that will affect your gameplay and the list seems to go on.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZiVEJ4QytSo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e13a2b5bfc6888fd03b14089fdc5f386.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZiVEJ4QytSo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Unique deep simulation of the nature in a building strategy game with complex interdependence of humans in nature.</li>
<li>Manage simultaneously the acquisition, refining and distribution of resources on multiple maps in different climatic conditions.</li>
<li>Manage the needs of the citizens. They are “alive” and have a specific home, workplace, and unique needs.</li>
<li>Animals are looking for food, get thirsty, sleepy and form social groups to find their place in nature.</li>
<li>Plants grow and are affected by the actions of the humans, animals, and their environment.</li>
<li>The seasons and climatic conditions affect the gameplay, as certain plants only grow in certain conditions and temperature affects humans, animals, plants, and the environment.</li>
<li>Interact and trade with other factions where all items were crafted with same rules as for the player.</li>
<li>Create own maps and scenarios in the editor and extend through mod support.</li>
<li>Charming and calm low poly art style.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer is seeking funding on their new Kickstarter campaign, where they're hoping to gather at least €15,000 EUR by June 29th. Currently Early Access is planned for Q4 2023 with a full release sometime in 2025.</p>
<p>I spent a little time with the Alpha Demo the developer sent a key over for and it's already pretty impressive. Although, I did find the UI a little on the small side <em>but</em> the developer is already showing up many others this early on, with a UI scaling option that works great. Once turned up a bit - it's all looking good. Nice atmosphere to it overall and you really can see the kind of simulation they're going for, with every person and creature clickable to see all their needs, like a hungry European Hare that keeps pinching my food.</p>
<p>Seems like a great start!</p>
<p>You can fund it on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kerzoven/circle-of-kerzoven" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> and follow it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1733110/Circle_of_Kerzoven/" target="_blank">on Steam</a> (demo available).</p>

      <title>NVIDIA driver 535.43.02 Beta for Linux updates Wayland support, new Vulkan extensions</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA has released the <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/download/driverResults.aspx/205050/en-uk" target="_blank">535.43.02 Beta driver</a> for Linux today, bringing with it support for multiple newer Vulkan extensions and extends Wayland support further.</p>
<p>The new Vulkan extensions support on Turing+ GPUs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_memory_priority.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_memory_priority</a></li>
<li><a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_pageable_device_local_memory.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_pageable_device_memory</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Other extensions now supported:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_video_queue.html" target="_blank">VK_KHR_video_queue</a></li>
<li><a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_video_decode_queue.html" target="_blank">VK_KHR_video_decode_queue</a></li>
<li><a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_video_decode_h264.html" target="_blank">VK_KHR_video_decode_h264</a></li>
<li><a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_video_decode_h265.html" target="_blank">VK_KHR_video_decode_h265</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For Wayland the NVIDIA driver now supports version 4 of the DMA-BUF Wayland protocol, plus there's a Wayland fix for a bug that prevented PRIME render offload from working for Wayland applications when running on a system with an AMD iGPU.</p>
<p>This driver release also improves performance of Minecraft Java Edition on RTX 3000 series GPUs, adds support for driving very high pixel clock mode timings such as 8K @ 60Hz, extends Dynamic Boost support on notebooks to include older Renoir and Cezanne chipsets, adds nvoptix.bin to the driver package used with the OptiX ray tracing engine library and now support for suspend and resume when using GSP firmware.</p>
<p>All the other improvements and bug fixes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a memory leak in the NVIDIA GLX driver, as reported at: <a href="https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/asan-reports-memory-leak-in-libnvidia-glcore-so-515-57/222697" target="_blank">https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/222697</a></li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused Vulkan X11 swapchain creation to fail on GPUs without a display engine when the VK_KHR_present_id extension is used.</li>
<li>Fixed console restore on legacy VGA consoles when using the NVIDIA Open GPU Kernel Modules.</li>
<li>Removed libnvidia-compiler.so.VERSION from the driver package. This functionality is now provided by other driver libraries.</li>
<li>Added power usage and power limits information to nvidia-settings PowerMizer page.</li>
<li>Updated NV_CTRL_GPU_POWER_SOURCE NV-CONTROL API to report undersized power source.</li>
<li>Added NV-CONTROL attributes NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_MULTIPLY_DIVIDE_MODE and NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_MULTIPLY_DIVIDE_VALUE to allow syncing a Quadro Sync II card to different House Sync signal rates. This feature requires firmware version 2.18 or later.</li>
<li>Added an application profile to avoid performance problems in Xfce 4 when the OpenGL compositor backend is enabled along with G-SYNC.</li>
<li>Moved the nvidia-settings application icon into the 'hicolor' icon theme, which allows it to be customized by other icon themes selected in the desktop environment.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented nvidia-installer from recording kernel log output to the installer log in some module loading failure paths.</li>
<li>Changed nvidia-installer to no longer use the $XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variable. XDG data files are now installed to a path specified by the --xdg-data-dir option, or /usr/share if not specified.</li>
<li>This fixes a problem when Flatpak is installed that caused the installer to place the nvidia-settings.desktop file in /root/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share/applications.</li>
<li>Changed the behavior of glXGetRefreshRateSGI() for non-integer refresh rates to round to the nearest whole number rather than truncating.</li>
<li>Changed the compression format of the .run installer package from xz to zstd. This results in a smaller compressed package, and faster decompression performance. A fallback zstd decompressor is embedded into the installer package for systems which do not already have a zstd decompression program installed.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused nvidia-installer to mistakenly unload some already loaded non-NVIDIA kernel modules.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which caused incorrect reporting of presentation times when using the VK_NV_present_barrier Vulkan extension.</li>
</ul>

      <title>The Outlast Trials manages to sell over 500K in the first week</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Outlast Trials released from Red Barrels on May 18th was something a bit special, with it Steam Deck Verified and working great on desktop Linux with Proton.</p>
<p>After so many thoroughly broken and disappointing releases recently, it was very nice to see a release come out that not only worked properly but performed well and looked great too. Seems many took notice, as it managed to sell <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRedBarrels/status/1662179977486319627" target="_blank">over 500K</a> copies in the first week! A huge milestone for Red Barrels, showing many developers how it's done. At time of writing it has a Very Positive user score on Steam from 14,822 counted reviews.</p>
<p>You can see my previous Steam Deck video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zF-WOfOCKpI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/67e687c0aec20289c707a7f1dc92457c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zF-WOfOCKpI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"Set in the era of the Cold War, human guinea pigs are involuntarily recruited by the good folks at the Murkoff Corporation to test advanced methods of brainwashing and mind control. In a world of distrust, fear, and violence, your morals will be challenged, your endurance tested, and your sanity crushed. All in the name of progress, science, and profit."</p>
<p>Have you been checking it out? Let me know your thoughts on The Outlast Trials in the comments. Really great to see another good game, that's popular, working so well on Steam Deck and desktop Linux and it's only in Early Access so it's going to keep expanding.</p>
<p>It's a pretty surprising game and really puts me on edge playing it. The kind of game that you should play with headphones on in a dark room for the full experience. Scary stuff!</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/the-outlast-trials?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1304930/The_Outlast_Trials/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Do some drifting with a cruise ship in Summer Trip Cruise</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Summer Trip Cruise looks like a fun little game, giving you control of a cruise ship that you need to keep afloat while avoiding various obstacles with on-screen controls. In a way, the idea looks little like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/12/the-absolutely-genius-frick-inc-from-kenney-is-now-up-on-steam/" target="_blank">Frick Inc</a>. </p>
<p>"Take a cruise through different countries. Relax as you enjoy the views, and tourists take pictures of their favourite landmarks. Take it easy - or not so much! But most importantly: be careful. You will be able to navigate through different countries, each with its own architectural style, environment and music. Close your eyes and feel like you are there, but not for too long or the consequences will be catastrophic."</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Use your mouse to drive with the on-screen controls.</li>
<li>Game driven by physics.</li>
<li>15 handmade levels set on 3 different countries.</li>
<li>Beautiful music unique to each country.</li>
<li>Scoring system (don't crash, take the photo and beat the time mark).</li>
<li>World leaderboards to see who is the fastest captain.</li>
<li>Twitch integration: join the cruise of your favorite streamer and cross your fingers that you won't die if the captain has to crash.</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="background-color:var(--article-main-background); color:var(--font-color); font-size:16px">Seems like quite a fun idea for a game. Nice for those of you who like smaller more casual experiences for your coffee breaks perhaps.</span></p>

      <title>Valheim devs clarify stance on modding including a clear no to paid mods</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Iron Gate mentioned recently they've been getting many questions on their stance of modding Valheim, so they wrote a post to give their thoughts including the subject of paid mods.</p>
<p>Valheim doesn't actually have official modding support but that's never really stopped anyone has it? Mods help keep games alive for years after developer move on, so it's pretty much always a good idea to support it.</p>
<p>In their post on their <a href="https://www.valheimgame.com/news/regarding-mods" target="_blank">official site</a> (and also Steam), Iron Gate mentioned how they're "happy" to see people make mods and they find it "flattering" people wish to do it, however by not having official support they're not giving any kind of guarantees that mods will work between releases - so you do so at your own risk. </p>
<p>On the subject of paid mods though? They're not particularly happy about that as they do "not condone locking modded content behind a paywall" and they feel that charging money for a mod "is against the creative and open spirit of modding itself, and therefore we urge all mod authors to make their mods freely available to all who want to play them". They have no problem with donations but they don't want to see any part of a mod behind a paywall.</p>
<p>Additionally, they're asking mod creators to ensure they make it clear that their work is unofficial.</p>
<p>Every developer will likely feel different about this, as will a fair amount of gamers. How do you feel about paid mods?</p>
<p>Valheim is available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/valheim?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Tactical RPG &#39;Radix Chronicle&#39; getting Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Radix Chronicle is an in-development tactical RPG from Marcus Sanders, better known as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@EpicNameBro/featured" target="_blank">EpicNameBro</a> for making videos about Fromsoft games and their own game will now support Linux.</p>
<p>Inspired by classics on SNES and early PlayStation classics, Radix Chronicle will bring with it some dark themes and bright characters with a fantasy setting that changes depending on how you fight. One bit that makes it interesting is that there's no RNG for the fights, no 99% hit chances that miss. Instead, every action has a timing trial you need to hit a bit like a rhythm game almost. The resolution is a bit cramped though, as it was originally designed for Android but they said it grew to the point of wanting to do a PC release.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Jqus-OWqk54"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ccae9a0285acd4c973afd9742c92dc04.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Jqus-OWqk54" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's currently crowdfunding on Kickstarter and seems popular, as it still has 24 days to go and has nearly $40K pledged against the $33K goal so clearly gamers are interested.</p>
<p>Originally they said Linux support would be "probable" but in recent <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/enb/radix-chronicle/posts/3818396" target="_blank">public update</a> they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was a very busy and very successful day, but we're not resting yet. First of all: we're going to officially offer Linux as a platform choice on Kickstarter now! This includes anyone who already backed it at a tier that features the game. Later in development, we will send out backer surveys (to you as an individual) about preferred platform and then use that to determine which version you get. </p>

      <title>Steam Deck hits South Korea retail via Electromart on June 1st</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve's partner Komodo has announced that they're expanding the Steam Deck retail presence into South Korea on June 1st. They'll be doing this through Electromart through a partnership with SHINSEGAE I&amp;C, the leading retail tech company of SHINSEGAE, the largest retail group in South Korea. This will include the Steam Deck and the Docking Station at all of the Electromart stores nationwide.</p>
<p>This follows on from the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/steam-deck-hitting-retail-stores-in-japan-from-april-29th-south-korea-to-follow/" target="_blank">expansion into Japan</a> in late April plus <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/steam-deck-hitting-retail-in-hong-kong-taiwan-and-later-japan-and-south-korea/" target="_blank">Hong Kong and Taiwan back in March</a>.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>Ricky Uy, CEO of KOMODO, said: </p>
<p>“We continue working towards our goal of bringing Steam Deck to as many customers as possible, and we are very pleased to be working with SHINSEGAE I&amp;C to launch retail sales in South Korea. We also plan to offer more Steam Deck trial opportunities in Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan.”</p>
<p>Joon Jung, Vice president of SHINSEGAE I&amp;C, said:</p>
<p>“Based on our solid distribution channels and know-how, SHINSEGAE I&amp;C is continuously expanding its business portfolio in the gaming sector, from gaming device distribution to game IP and publishing. We look forward to working with KOMODO to introduce Steam Deck to a wider range of Korean gamers through SHINSEGAE I&amp;C’s various retail stores.”</p>
<p>Komodo also stated they have plans for plenty more promotions and events to come but not hints as to what.</p>

      <title>Nintendo blocked Dolphin emulator release on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 29/05</strong>: According to Pierre Bourdon on <a href="https://mastodon.delroth.net/@delroth/110440301402516214" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>, who was Dolphin's treasurer for the foundation backing the project (Bourdon is stepping down), Valve actually initiated the conversation to check in with Nintendo on this. So this is not a DMCA takedown request but Nintendo said it <em>would</em> violate the DMCA anti-circumvention provisions, so Valve took it down. So there's technically nothing for Dolphin to counter here.</p>
<p><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-gamecube-wii-emulator-dolphin-valve-piracy-1850482929" target="_blank">Kotaku</a> also got a statement from Nintendo on this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Nintendo is committed to protecting the hard work and creativity of video game engineers and developers,” a spokesperson for Nintendo told <em>Kotaku</em> in an email. “This emulator illegally circumvents Nintendo’s protection measures and runs illegal copies of games. Using illegal emulators or illegal copies of games harms development and ultimately stifles innovation. Nintendo respects the intellectual property rights of other companies, and in turn expects others to do the same.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The article title was updated to better reflect the situation.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p><u><em>Original article below for context:</em></u></p>
<p>Back in March the plan was announced for the Wii and GameCube emulator Dolphin to release on Steam, along with some useful Steam features but now that seems unlikely to happen.</p>
<p>The Dolphin team has now announced that their Steam page was taken down, as Nintendo sent a cease and desist notice to Valve about it. Here's the <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2023/05/27/dolphin-steam-indefinitely-postponed/" target="_blank">statement</a> they released:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is with much disappointment that we have to announce that the Dolphin on Steam release has been indefinitely postponed. We were notified by Valve that Nintendo has issued a cease and desist citing the DMCA against Dolphin's Steam page, and have removed Dolphin from Steam until the matter is settled. We are currently investigating our options and will have a more in-depth response in the near future.</p>
<p>We appreciate your patience in the meantime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such a shame.</p>
<p>Why now though? Dolphin has been around since 2003 for GameCube, adding basic Wii support in 2007, so Dolphin was there during the time the Wii was still being fully supported. Nintendo also only went after the Steam page, not the project as a whole as it can still be found on <a href="https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/" target="_blank">official site</a>. According to a comment from the Citra developer on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/comments/13ss1o9/comment/jlry1kq/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, it's due to Dolphin including decryption keys with the project.</p>
<p>Really, it's not going to do Nintendo much good, it's put Dolphin all over the news and even more people will now know about it and end up using it.</p>

      <title>Stone Age farming life-sim Roots of Pacha has returned to Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/roots-of-pacha-removed-from-steam-after-fight-with-publisher-crytivo/" target="_blank">messy situation</a> with their publisher, Soda Den has now split from Crytivo and Roots of Pacha has returned for sale on Steam.</p>
<p>What is it? Roots of Pacha is basically Stardew Valley but in the Stone Age. That is the simplest way to explain it and it's actually a really good description of it. There's plenty of additions and differences of course and it has been reviewing well so it was a shame when it vanished.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="9zX8OrNV4oE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dac50ade19f2c6d7d17462e4a08569d0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/9zX8OrNV4oE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Here's the statement shared in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the past two weeks, Crytivo and Soda Den have worked tirelessly to achieve the common goal of restoring Roots of Pacha on Steam. We are happy to share we have reached an agreement and that Roots of Pacha has been restored to Steam for all to purchase.</p>
<p>We also would like to share that Crytivo and Soda Den have made the decision to amicably part ways under terms that are mutually beneficial.</p>
<p>Soda Den sincerely thanks the Crytivo team for their efforts to support and market Roots of Pacha. Crytivo sincerely thanks Soda Den for their dedication and craft that went into the creation of Roots of Pacha.</p>
<p>Our collective priority has always been the fans. We hope that the restoration of the Steam store page brings you joy.</p>
<p>Thank you all for your support.</p>
<p>Signed,</p>
<p>Crytivo and Soda Den</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In case you missed it they also <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1245560/discussions/0/5617721963192270287/" target="_blank">added a Native Linux build</a>, mainly for the Steam Deck, where they believe it will work better overall. Now the situation is sorted, I'll be going and taking another look at it.</p>

      <title>Many years later Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition is still getting better</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Originally released in 2002 and then later as Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition from Beamdog, many years on it's still getting major upgrades including a new Toon shader and loading speed improvements.</p>
<p>"Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition adds all-new enhanced features to the content of Neverwinter Nights Diamond Edition. Slink through the shadows as a deadly half-elven rogue, wield fearsome magics as a powerful gnomish sorcerer, vanquish your foes as an armor-clad dwarven paladin... whatever hero you create, incredible adventures await. Discover magic, wonder, and danger at every turn on your own or with friends in these classic Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventures."</p>
<p>Build 8193.35 was released on May 24th and here's what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Spells and spell-like abilities now display a targeting indicator displaying their range and, if appropriate, their AOE shape and size.</li>
<li>Added support for up to 8 multiclasses, configurable per-module.</li>
<li>Improved area load times by up to 100x!</li>
<li>Added an in-game News UI that shows upcoming patches and community news.</li>
<li>NUI windows will no longer break input to the game (WASD, drag&amp;drop).</li>
<li>Added a new "Toon" postprocessing shader.</li>
<li>Hundreds of new functions and goodies for module builders.</li>
<li>Hundreds of bugfixes and optimizations.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For the new Toon shader, here's an example of the differences. First shot is normal, second on the Toon shader:</p>

      <title>If You Like... Left 4 Dead</title>
      <author>scaine</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What’s this? An entirely new genre, you say? Well, arguably that’s exactly what Valve presented to the public in 2008 with the original Left 4 Dead, and its superlative sequel the following year. But was it really a new genre?</p>
<p><em>IYL will be a short series of articles delving into various genres and looking at the best examples in each. I’ll follow a standard layout. I’ll start with a bit of history about the most famous game representing the genre. Next, I’ll cover a game that’s very similar to the original, then (hopefully!) any games that have surpassed it since, and finally any games that do things in a unique way, but still tipping their hat to the original. Then it’s over to you to tell me how wrong I am, in the comments!</em></p>
<p>Well, that gets a little tricky, but I’m going to say yes. For example, the original Killing Floor, which has a similar basis, was originally a mod for Unreal Tournament 2004 and debuted in 2005. But true to the base game, Killing Floor didn’t feature a story, and the entire “mission” was a single area with random trader spawns after each “wave”. I’m not sure that formula justifies being called genre-defining.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Left 4 Dead launched with so many unique features, it’s hard to keep track of it all! Player characters had… character. They had multiple situational voicelines, prompts and interactions during play that went beyond the usual “RELOADING” scream. They had back stories which, while not relevant to gameplay, gave the whole world a sense of realism.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17159671141684876872gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17159671141684876872gol573.png"/></a></p>
<p>A realism which was echoed by zombie animations which even today remain sensational. This was Havoc physics… but without the jank. In fact, it turns out that the Source’s physics engine that powers that animation, called <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/VPhysics" target="_blank"><u>VPhysics</u></a>, is actually based on early Havoc builds, back before it was owned by Intel or Microsoft and was actually open-source. The good old days. Seeing the zombies lean into turns, stumbling out of fires, or tripping over objects is something you rarely see, even in modern games.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9980314741684876873gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9980314741684876873gol573.png"/></a></p>
<p>And that physics engine is used everywhere - you can break windows, blow up barriers, see chairs or TVs flying around from the power of your gunfire. The zombie “tank” has a melee attack that sends cars flying - an instant KO if one hits your character!</p>
<p>Then there’s the dynamic lighting and shadows, the scene setting and sound design, the idle animations, the themed zombie types (military, hospital, etc) and the complete lack of a loading screen from the start of a mission to the end and an AI “Director” that changes the difficulty depending on how well you do, encouraging replay. Combined, it delivered an atmosphere that inspired a believable sense of dread and panic.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21125102471684876873gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21125102471684876873gol573.png"/></a></p>
<p>And the multiplayer didn’t just stop at the survivors. No, Valve also let you play PvP, putting  you in the shoes of multiple types of “special” infected, from Hunters that leap huge distances, or Chokers who throw their tongues out from afar to reel in the player, to the slow moving but devastating bloater that will summon a horde of zombies to the player, even in death. This all makes for a fascinating blend of tense strategy, forced cooperation and genuine jump scares.</p>
<p>And as usual for these articles, I haven’t covered mods… but they’re there. Oh, they’re so, so there, all <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse?appid=550" target="_blank"><u>120 thousand</u></a> or so!</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>A direct clone - Back 4 Blood [</strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/924970/Back_4_Blood/" target="_blank"><u>Steam</u></a><strong>]</strong></h3>
<p>And then there was Left 4 Dead 3! At least, that’s the reputation Turtle Rock Studios were flattered with when the mainstream gaming media proclaimed them the “creators of Left 4 Dead” and hyped Back 4 Blood, an attempt at modernising the Left 4 Dead experience.</p>
<p>It didn’t quite work out that way, however, when it launched in October 2021. Turtle Rock Studios are still asking £49.99 for Back 4 Blood, despite its “mixed” review status on Steam. Throw in a touch of Denuvo DRM, a <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/924970" target="_blank"><u>silver</u></a> rating on ProtonDB (including a lack of EAC support that kills the multiplayer), janky AI, and a complete lack of mod support and frankly, it’s amazing that quite a few media outlets rated it as high as 8/10. User reviews on metacritic were harsher, scoring it 5.4 overall.</p>
<p>I won’t spend any more time on this one, except to quote this comment from “Neon357” from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=EdRLNUGmFC8" target="_blank"><u>this daming Youtube video</u></a> which compares the two games.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best thing that Back for Blood accomplished was making people realize how good Left 4 Dead really was</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Games that do it better - Deep Rock Galactic [</strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/548430/Deep_Rock_Galactic/" target="_blank"><u>Steam</u></a><strong>]</strong></h3>
<p>I nearly didn’t buy Deep Rock Galactic. As a man born in the 70’s, I grew up learning first hand what a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xcb4_QwP6fE" target="_blank"><u>hive of scum and villainy</u></a> the internet actually is. It started with Doom, then Quake, Quake 2, Unreal Tournament and ultimately Call of Duty. It was probably CoD that finally killed any interest I had to play with “randos” (random people on the internet). And here was Deep Rock Galactic, a game that forces four randos together and the only hope of their survival is cooperation. That… just can’t happen these days, right?</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8774473041684876870gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8774473041684876870gol573.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Rock and Stone, brother! I can’t explain it. I really can’t. But when you land in a hosted session in this game and burst out of your delivery pod, you press V to shout “Rock and Stone” and wave your axe in greeting, and instantly all other players will do the same. It’s uncanny. Yet so wholesome and heart warming. You’re a team, after all.</p>
<p>There’s rarely any voice chat in DRG either. Cooperation is instead enabled and encouraged through the use of your laser pointer with which you can tag resources or enemies, calling them out for all the other players. That cooperation is absolutely necessary too, as most hosts will enforce a balanced team, ensuring one player of each class - driller, scout, engineer, and gunner. The driller can tunnel through the environment, the scout can grapple and light the area up, the engineer can place pancake-like platforms and turrets, and the gunner… does what you'd expect, but also features a nice line grapple that can help navigate the depths, and a short-lived shield to protect his brother dwarves when the fighting gets thick.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3430470731684876870gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3430470731684876870gol573.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You need all four to be successful, and somehow, it works. There’s no light in the dank caverns on the planet Hoxxes, so your dwarf throws a series of regenerating flares which slowly fade over time. The scout is crucial here, as they have a massive light flare that lasts much longer and lights up a huge area, but the tension created by frequently needing more light is superb. It encourages you all to stick together, and play together.</p>
<p>DRG’s replayabilty is next level too, with a variety of mission types, an often-complex mission structure for each, and random events, all coupled with an organic, random map generation system which can only be described as evil incarnate. I’ve lost count of how often I’ve made my way to the bottom of a mission only to realise that I don’t have any good way to get back out! Follow that digger, who will often drill as close to “straight up” as they can manage, while desperately trying not to overheat their drill bits, letting the rest of the team fight off multiple hordes before the timer runs out.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4620214431684876869gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4620214431684876869gol573.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Meta progression is also superb. The perk system allows for gameplay choices to be made (run faster, carry more, sense enemies, etc) and each class will advance in levels allowing for gear unlocks and upgrades. Cash can also be spent on customising your dwarves with new hairstyles, beards, side burns, hair colour, caps, armour and more.</p>
<p>Even the simple hub area is a chance to bond with your squad before setting out on another mission, with games to play, beer to drink (for mission-based perks) and music to “dance” to.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1655024921684876868gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1655024921684876868gol573.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>And there’s so much more I haven’t really covered. The end-game “deep dive” missions, the weapon customisation, the hilarious voice acting, the boss fights, the single-player mode (if you simply can’t abide randos, even friendly ones), or Molly the “minecart”. If you haven’t tried DRG yet, you owe it to yourself to give it a shot. You owe it <a href="https://deeprockgalactic.fandom.com/wiki/Karl" target="_blank"><u>to Karl</u></a>.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Something a little different: Aliens: Fireteam Elite [</strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1549970/Aliens_Fireteam_Elite/" target="_blank"><u>Steam</u></a><strong>]</strong></h3>
<p>Game over, man! How can I recommend Aliens Fireteam Elite when it barely scores higher than Back 4 Blood? Well, the simple fact is that I really, really bought into the Aliens atmosphere this game delivers in spades. Whether that’s the film-like military comms between you and Sergeant Herrerra in Tactical, the nicely recreated Aliens-style sci-fi bunkers and hangars, or the strong sound design recreating the sweet sweet rapid-fire of your M56 Smartgun, the whole thing <em>feels</em> like the films. There’s also the now-iconic echoing blip of your gun’s movement scanner to raise the tension. And the aliens’ elephant-like death scream just never gets old.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you’ve played Alien: Isolation, you’ll appreciate the Weyland Yutani synth units and their creepy, lifeless voices. Indeed, play single player and you’ll get two such combat synths to join you on your mission. And yep, I said two units - oddly enough, this is a three-player game, not a four-player game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8209216191684876872gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8209216191684876872gol573.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>That incredibly authentic in-mission atmosphere does suffer a little when you get back to the main hub, a space craft in orbit around LV-895, an Engineer planet and the setting for the game. Despite Cold Iron Studios being a 60+ person outfit, and despite the excellent voice-acting, none of the character’s faces are animated, which is actually weirdly unsettling in a 2021 game. But many of the in-game dramatic reveals and set pieces are genuinely jaw-dropping, such as when Lieutenant Ko’s dropship clears a bridge of aliens as you run across it in a rocket barrage that can only be described as spectacular overkill.</p>
<p>There are only 3 missions plus a DLC mission, which each consist of 3 story sections, amounting to around 20-30 minutes per section of gameplay. Honestly, that’s pretty short and you’ll clear the bulk of the content in around 6 to 10 hours at the lowest difficulty. Sure, it’s reasonably priced at £25.99 (without DLC), and personally, I managed 65 hours in this beautiful shooter… but I can’t lie when I say I wanted more, which is actually an endorsement of how fun the shooting actually is! Sadly, the lack of mod support definitely hurts here, especially when there’s so little variety in playthroughs (minor randomisation only).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20487546781684876871gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20487546781684876871gol573.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>But there’s a lot to like here. Superb and meaningful progression for up to 7 classes (which play very differently), lots of mods for your weapons, heaps of perks that can be upgraded in a satisfying jigsaw puzzle as you level up. A large variety of weapons, from pistols to SMGs, shotguns to smart-guns, rifles to flamethrowers, there’s something for everyone. The clever “Battle Card” system is great too, introducing a massive variety of special buffs and debuffs for enhanced rewards. Some of these are incredibly inventive too, like the one that makes the whole mission look like the helmet-cams from the film, or one where if you move into a team mate, it stumbles them. Difficulty can be set too, introducing varying levels of friendly fire and intensity of the hordes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15623076661684876871gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15623076661684876871gol573.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16264618921684876871gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16264618921684876871gol573.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>If you can find two friends to play with, it’s an engrossing experience.</p>

<h3><strong>And the rest</strong></h3>
<p><em>World War Z [</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/699130/World_War_Z/" target="_blank"><em><u>Steam</u></em></a><em>]</em></p>
<p>I haven’t played this one, but it gets decent reviews on Steam and certainly captures the sheer size of the hordes you see in the film of the same name. Some complaints about the grind, but definitely one to look into further.</p>
<p><em>Killing Floor 2 [</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/232090/Killing_Floor_2/" target="_blank"><em><u>Steam</u></em></a><em>]</em></p>
<p>Slicker follow up to the original game and features more classes and more progression along with a little more enemy variety coupled with new maps and bosses. Ultimately very, very similar and that’s going to be a good thing or a bad thing depending on your opinion on the first game!</p>
<p><em>Outriders [</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/680420/OUTRIDERS/" target="_blank"><em><u>Steam</u></em></a><em>]</em></p>
<p>I’d love to describe this as a sleeper hit - it’s made by the same team that produced Painkiller Black Edition and Bulletstorm, it’s published by Square Enix, and yet no-one has heard of it. Truth is though, despite being excellent, it’s stupidly overpriced. I enjoyed it, it’s good, but it’s typically around £50… <em>on sale</em> for the full game (with DLC)! Worth checking out, but I only played for around 30 hours in the end, so I have serious reservations over the value for money I got.</p>
<p><em>Warhammer Vermintide 2 [</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1125710/Gatewalkers/" target="_blank"><em><u>Steam</u></em></a><em>]</em></p>
<p>While the game itself plays fine to a platinum level, sadly Fatshark couldn’t wrap their head around how to enable the anti-cheat properly. So while you can host a game on Linux, you can’t actually join games. Fatshark <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/552500/discussions/0/2960544187643622408/?ctp=26#c3419936604888208895" target="_blank"><u>swear it’s either Epic, or Valve’s fault</u></a>, and with their new (largely panned) <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1361210/Warhammer_40000_Darktide/" target="_blank"><u>sequel</u></a> now out, it’s unlikely this will ever be fixed. Which is a shame, because there’s some nice progression and pretty graphics on show here. If you have 3 Windows-using friends and you’re prepared to host every session, this might be fun. For the rest of us though, it’s a pass.</p>
<p><em>The Anacrusis [</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1120480/The_Anacrusis/" target="_blank"><em><u>Steam</u></em></a><em>]</em></p>
<p>Made by Stray Dog, a studio created by an ex-Valve staffer who worked on Left 4 Dead (sound familiar?) this is the true indie version of Left 4 Dead, complete with jank. It gets generally good reviews despite some lobby issues, and it looks like it captures the spirit of the game, if not the polish.</p>
<p><em>GTFO [</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/493520/GTFO/" target="_blank"><em><u>Steam</u></em></a><em>]</em></p>
<p>A little bit different, this one! Yes, it’s 4 player-coop, yes, you fight off hordes of alien-like creatures and yes, it’s dark and full of horror. However, a lot of GTFO is actually based on stealth, and requires absolute coordination between players. Absolute. If you end up shooting for any length of time, your run is likely over! Steep learning curve but it has a cult following and still garners more players per day than Back 4 Blood. Also recommended by streamer, GTFO expert and GOL supporter, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Corben78/recommended/493520/" target="_blank"><u>Corben</u></a>!</p>
<p><em>No More Room in Hell [</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/224260/No_More_Room_in_Hell/" target="_blank"><em><u>Steam</u></em></a><em>]</em></p>
<p>This was originally a Half Life 2 mod, launched in 2011, but made it to a full release via Steam’s Greenlight scheme in 2013. It’s free to play and <em>still</em> supported today, with bug fixes and feature releases every few months. If this 8-player, native co-op shooter takes your fancy, keep your eyes peeled for the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/292000/No_More_Room_In_Hell_2/" target="_blank"><u>upcoming sequel</u></a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Phew, we’re done. I feel like I need a lie down after all that tension. As usual, feel free to educate me on what I’ve missed or gotten wrong in the comments. I still lean towards single-player games, but writing this article has reminded me of all the fun to be had when you team up with some friends (or dwarves) for the greater good. Hopefully this gives you some ideas yourself!</p>

      <title>Modrinth make their own launcher for Minecraft modders</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://modrinth.com/" target="_blank">Modrinth</a>, the open source modding platform that's gaining popularity, has now announced the first Alpha build of their own launcher to make modding easier for Minecraft fans.</p>
<p>There's no need to go dumping your other favourite launcher, it's just another option. Fully open source too just like the rest of Modrinth, focused on providing a good experience for gamers. Even though it's only the first Alpha, it's already looking pretty good and managed to get me into a modded game in no time at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13479181041685021732gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13479181041685021732gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11949826711685021733gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11949826711685021733gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>With it being in Alpha, it's nowhere near complete so expect some issues and features that haven't made it in yet.</p>
<p>The source is on <a href="https://github.com/modrinth/theseus" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and Alpha access available via their <a href="https://discord.gg/EUHuJHt" target="_blank">Discord</a>. The Linux version is currently an AppImage and does seem to work well. Written in Rust, this is not yet-another Electron thing but instead uses Tauri and Vue.</p>

      <title>Wine and Wayland take another step closer with more code merged</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The ongoing work bit by bit to get Wine and Wayland to fully work together on Linux has taken another step, with a third big <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/merge_requests/2712" target="_blank">merge request</a> accepted. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/wine-84-rolls-out-with-initial-wayland-graphics-driver-work/" target="_blank">Wine 8.4 from mid-March</a> was the first development release to actually have some of the initial Wayland work in it.</p>
<p>From the merge request that's now accepted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This MR introduces the driver mechanisms to handle dynamic events from the Wayland compositor, using wl_output events as the guiding use case (i.e., we want to update the win32u display settings when the host settings change).</p>
<p>In this design we create a dedicated thread to read and dispatch Wayland events received from the compositor. If a Wayland event handler wants some code to be run in the context of a particular HWND's thread, it can add an internal event to a custom queue we have for each (GUI enabled) thread. The ProcessEvents driver callback processes internal events from that queue. In order to wake up waiting threads we use a pipe to notify about new internal events, with the read end acting as the thread's host queue fd. This is similar to how winemac.drv works.</p>
<p>We use the aforementioned mechanisms to queue win32u display device updates to the desktop window thread. Since there are many pieces that need to fall into place, this MR gradually reaches the final design:</p>
<ol>
<li>We first introduce the dedicated read/dispatch thread and handle events (and also display device updates if in the desktop process) in that thread.</li>
<li>We ensure access to Wayland output information is thread-safe and consistent (since in step 3 we will need to access it from a different thread).</li>
<li>We finally introduce per-thread internal event queues and, if we are in the desktop process, queue the display device update to the desktop window thread internal event queue. Note that the main portion of the wl_output event code is still handled in the dedicated read/dispatch thread.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Why is this actually needed? Well currently Wine uses X11, and so for anyone running Wayland it will then be run through XWayland, which is basically X running under Wayland like a compatibility layer. As Collabora said in their original announcement <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/12/collabora-announce-their-wayland-driver-for-wine/" target="_blank">back in 2020</a> talking about it they said it's "a source of complexity and possible inefficiencies" and so it would "be ideal if Wine could talk directly to Wayland to enable a leaner and more efficient stack on modern systems"</p>
<p>So the end result should be for users on Wayland, which will eventually be everyone, to have Wine work without the XWayland layer and have it all work nicely far into the future.</p>

      <title>Fedora Onyx voted in as a new official Fedora Linux immutable variant</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Much like Fedora Silverblue, Fedora Kinoite, and Fedora Sericea there's going to be a new immutable version of Fedora coming called Fedora Onyx.</p>
<p>These immutable versions of Fedora Linux work like SteamOS on Steam Deck, with the main system being the same across every installation, and it doesn't change. Upgrades are done over the whole thing, it's supposed to be faster and more stable and it's an increasingly popular way to use Linux.</p>
<p>Fedora Onyx comes with the Budgie desktop, and the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Fedora_Onyx" target="_blank">proposal</a> from developer Joshua Strobl has now been <a href="https://pagure.io/fesco/issue/2996#comment-857114" target="_blank">approved</a>, and so with Fedora 39 we should hopefully see its first release.</p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fedora Onyx is an immutable desktop operating system, featuring the Budgie Desktop environment. Fedora Onyx leverages the same foundational technologies as other Fedora immutable variants such as Fedora Silverblue, Fedora Kinoite, and Fedora Sericea (flatpak, rpm-ostree, podman, toolbx). Fedora Onyx is built for people that are attracted to / find value in the Fedora computing platform and Budgie Desktop environment, but need the robust immutability and atomic capabilities that rpm-ostree provides, which are not be offered through traditional Fedora spins (e.g. Fedora Budgie Spin).</p>

      <title>Help fund Fish Folk, an ever-growing bundle of open source multiplayer games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fish Folk is an in-development and constantly growing bundle of multiplayer games. All open source and they want your help to grow bigger and better. The first game they're focusing on is Fish Folk: Jump, a spiritual successor to the popular Duck Game, with Fish Folk being created out of their love for it. They want the basic idea to continue on but be open to the community which is why it's open source with modding in mind too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lot of <em>really good</em> computer games have been made in the last few decades. Many of them are designed with such elegant simplicity that, mechanically, they have no expiration date. And yet these wonderfully timeless creations do sadly expire into obsolescence because of the game industry conventions of secrecy, exclusivity and unrelenting newness.</p>
<p>The intention of Spicy Lobster studio (makers of the Fish Folk franchise) is to make <a href="https://spicylobster.itch.io/jumpy/devlog/337996/everlasting-games" target="_blank">everlasting games</a>, holistically designed to last for as long as the game is still being played by a passionate community. We aim to honor this higher bar by following the development practices of the open software movement with its many long-lived giants such as Linux, WordPress,  Blender and Godot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They're committing to have it all stay open source, be highly flexible &amp; moddable with their smart level editor and be cross-platform with couch co-op and online play. For their online play they've already worked on rollback p2p networking based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GGPO" target="_blank">GGPO</a> model.</p>
<p>As they though say it's not just one game, they're doing multiple including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/fishfolk/jumpy" target="_blank">Jumpy</a> (2D platformer, where it all began)</li>

      <title>Halls of Torment is out in Early Access - a great fusion of Diablo and Vampire Survivors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What do you get if you combine classic Diablo with Vampire Survivors? Well one developer decided to show you with an unholy combination in Halls of Torment.</p>
<p>Available now in Early Access on Steam, I’ll admit I’m a little bit obsessed with this. I played the demo prologue it had for a long time and the developer sent over a key so I’ve been giving the bigger version a go and honestly, it’s great. It’s clearly going to be my next obsession for whenever I have a few minutes free, as I'll keep going back to it.</p>
<p>Check out my video, talking about it and showing it on Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Q7pAYvSVZyE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dc9cb0a5ba777f96bcf9e5e57f667c38.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Q7pAYvSVZyE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Text review:</p>
<p>For an early access game, it has a ridiculous amount of content already including at least 3 stages, 7 characters, 11 abilities to upgrade, 12 unique bosses, 30 unique monsters, 14 blessings that make you stronger over time for each run, over 150 quests to complete and the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>Much like Vampire Survivors, Brotato and many other popular games like it, the games are short, taking a max of about 30 minutes a pop. Each run lets you build up a slightly different build and you can become overpowered if you play it right. What makes it interesting and worth playing though is how different it feels, as yet again a small developer has taken a popular game and put their own spin on it. </p>
<p>Like a more traditional ARPG, you find equipment out in the world to use during your run, there’s a quest system for some meta progression, the monsters and bosses have some really varied abilities and behaviours so they don’t just walk at you and hope for the best. Although it does have plenty that will just walk at you to attack, because they’re your levelling up food for the grinder.</p>
<p>Even the environment has some interesting bits to do like putting down traps and dealing with hazards. There’s a few other differences here, instead of levelling up and choosing a new weapon or major ability, the level ups are mainly about general character buffs, because the weapons you find in the world to pick up. Although when you find a new ability, level ups can then contain buffs for those too - the choice is yours.</p>
<p>The direction you face is important too, because this is a mixture of a twin-stick battler and an auto-battler. So you attack with your main weapon where you’re facing, but your abilities fire automatically making it quite the fun blend. That said, there are some accessibility features to make it easier on you if needed. You can set auto-attack and auto-direct both on to control it more like Vampire Survivors, letting the game deal with the aiming but then you can turn it back off when you want to focus on a particular area or creature more than other. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17484391011684948106gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17484391011684948106gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>If you have a love for RPGs, auto-battlers, Vampire Survivor likes and anything in between those, you’re going to feel right at home here. It’s been kicking my butt too, as it’s quite a difficult game which is <em>good</em> because it keeps you wanting another run, it keeps your entire attention when you’re playing it.</p>
<p>For me I’m just in love with the design of it, the environments and the enemies look fantastic with the retro Diablo theme it’s going for, the sound design too sounds very much like the classics but it’s all wrapped up in modern mechanics so it doesn’t feel old — it’s thoroughly satisfying to play though.</p>
<p>On Steam Deck, no problems at all. It has full Native Linux support and so works brilliantly out of the box. Considering how intense it gets with all the different creatures, mini-bosses and full bosses it really sucks you in and it’s so easy to play multiple hours at a time.</p>
<p>This is probably one of my favourite indie releases this year, and it’s not even finished. The developer mentioned they’re aiming for about 6 months in early access, to add in an increased number of characters, stages, quests, and items. This would also include, they say, unique and bespoke mechanics for specific characters and items. They want to provide longer meta progression, improve balancing based on player feedback and polish the experience overall.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2218750/Halls_of_Torment/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Exil is a post apocalyptic fusion of Hollow Knight &amp; Cuphead</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hollow Knight and Cuphead fused together in a post apocalyptic setting? Yes please. Exil not only sounds good but it looks the part too. It will also have full Linux support.</p>
<p>"Humanity was wiped out during a massive war. What remains are the robots and androids on the floating islands caused by the destruction of the war. What path will the robots and androids take in a world without their masters. Intense arena battles. Blood pumping, well animated, boss fights. Unique storylines (based upon in-game decisions, multiple endings)." — Mystic Clockwork Studio</p>
<p>I'm especially interested in the music on this one with the composer from Anime series like Fire Force, Cells at Work!, Goblin Slayer and many more. Check out the trailer:</p>

<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“Currently, 65% of gamers surveyed are playing at 1080p and the majority are still using older graphics cards, unable to take advantage of the latest performance and visual-enhancing features that deliver the best gaming experiences,” said Scott Herkelman, senior vice president and general manager, Graphics Business Unit at AMD. “AMD offers a range of graphics solutions at different price points, memory configurations and performance levels to support a variety of gamers’ needs. The Radeon RX 7600 graphics card at US $269 hits the sweet spot for high-performance 1080p gaming. It allows users to enjoy the latest features like AV1 encoding, the AMD Radiance Display Engine and more to take their gaming, streaming and content creation projects to the next level.” </p>
<p>VRAM size aside, the price to performance ratio seems pretty reasonable here. No review from me though, as AMD don't send over hardware ever and don't reply to emails even just to be on their press list either despite repeated attempts. I email them every product launch to complete silence.</p>
<p>Most importantly - what do you make of the specs and price? Will this be your next GPU?</p>

      <title>HDR and Colour Management for AMD / Steam Deck and KDE Plasma coming along</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With all the work going on right now to get Linux to properly support HDR, another <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/amd-gfx/2023-May/093457.html" target="_blank">patch set</a> has landed to hopefully get some of it hooked up. This is the second attempt, after the first Request For Comments was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/hdr-and-colour-management-patches-for-steam-deck-amd-gpus-under-review/" target="_blank">sent in April</a>.</p>
<p>The work as before is being done by Melissa Wen, Joshua Ashton and Harry Wentland with the purpose to "enhance AMD KMS color pipeline for Steam Deck/SteamOS by exposing the large set of color caps available in AMD display HW".</p>
<p>While the work right now is targeting Steam Deck / SteamOS with Gamescope, naturally this work will lend itself to the overall stack and getting it working elsewhere. This new patch set is different to before, as they've removed the KConfig option to instead keep it behind the driver-specific AMD_PRIVATE_COLOR property.</p>
<p><em>As a reminder, the Steam Deck work will be for external screen handling, since the Steam Deck itself does not have a HDR screen. Although, perhaps with a Steam Deck 2…</em></p>
<p>So hopefully we can start to see more upstream support for HDR and Colour Management begin to land soon, unless they need to adjust it some more.</p>
<p>In other related news, Xaver Hugl of KDE has been putting in plenty of work to get it all hooked up in Kwin and their <a href="https://zamundaaa.github.io/wayland/2023/05/18/hdr-and-color-management-in-kwin.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> highlights some of the work going on there. As noted by Nate Graham's usual <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2023/05/20/this-week-in-kde-preliminary-hdr-support/" target="_blank">overview</a>, the first parts of the work have landed in Plasma 6.0 for their Wayland session.</p>
<p>Lots of moving parts right now but very exciting to see.</p>

      <title>This Unity to Godot importer has me a little excited</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's a lot to be interested and excited about when it comes to <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, the free and open source game engine and now Unity game devs may want to keep watch. Shared on Twitter, which seems to have raised the eyebrows of and excited many developers, is a <a href="https://github.com/barcoderdev/unitypackage_godot" target="_blank">new project</a> that aims to let you import Unity projects into Godot. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11985467401684931755gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11985467401684931755gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Pictured above is the rather large <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy/polygon-fantasy-kingdom-low-poly-3d-art-by-synty-164532" target="_blank">POLYGON Fantasy Kingdom</a> Unity environment, which is used as one of the examples on the <a href="https://github.com/barcoderdev/unitypackage_godot" target="_blank">GitHub page</a> of the project. Currently it seems to have been tested working on macOS and Windows, so hopefully anyone doing Linux will be willing to give it a run. This could be a really interesting boost for Godot Engine and FOSS development, if the project continues to go well.</p>
<p>According to the project it so far has all this implemented:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Components:</p>
<ul>
<li>GameObject</li>
<li>MeshFilter</li>
<li>MeshRenderer</li>
<li>SkinnedMeshRenderer</li>
<li>Transform</li>
<li>Stripped Transform</li>
<li>Light</li>
<li>Camera</li>
</ul>
<p>Importers:</p>
<ul>
<li>DefaultImporter</li>
<li>ModelImporter</li>
<li>NativeFormatImporter</li>
<li>PrefabImporter</li>
<li>TextureImporter</li>
<li>ShaderImporter</li>
<li>AudioImporter</li>
</ul>

      <title>Comet is an open source implementation of GOG Galaxy SDK that needs testing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One sticking issue with <a href="http://gog.com" target="_blank">GOG</a> currently is GOG Galaxy, and how it has no support for Linux. Now the <a href="https://github.com/imLinguin/comet" target="_blank">Comet</a> project aims to bridge the gap.</p>
<p>The aim of Comet is to eventually get it to work with projects like the Heroic Games Launcher and Lutris, to get their GOG support into even better shape with Wine / Proton on desktop Linux and Steam Deck. So in a way you could compare it to Legendary for Epic Games, giving a minimal and platform agnostic SDK.</p>
<p>A developer reached out to note they're now after more testers to play around with it, specifically on desktop Linux with Steam Deck testing planned later on.</p>
<p>So Comet will provide support for the likes of achievements, stats, friends, leaderboards and more. It's not finished yet of course, with some features under development and some not there at all yet but it's impressive work and continues to be an example on how the FOSS community are showing certain companies how it's done with a little community effort.</p>
<p>See more on the <a href="https://github.com/imLinguin/comet" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun is absolute boomer shooter joy</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun has released on Steam and it works out of the box on Steam Deck and desktop Linux thanks to Proton 8. With thanks to Focus Entertainment for sending a pre-release key.</p>
<p>To get two notes out of the way first: the videos are currently broken, with it giving a Proton test screen. This is usually solved when Valve can recode them into a different format, which they give out with the shader cache. Another issue is that on Steam Deck, external controllers didn't work right at all. On desktop Linux controllers worked without a problem.</p>
<p>It’s a blend of Warhammer themed visuals with the retro feel of 90's shooters, what everyone calls boomer shooters. It’s a homage to the classics much like DUSK, Ion Fury, Prodeus, ULTRAKILL and the list goes on and on. We’ve certainly not been short on retro shooters these past few years. Here's my video thoughts:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rc6MG0-vKrQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/948262fdfafb811992d1864cdf0cafc0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rc6MG0-vKrQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Stuff like this continues to show that you developers don't need to constantly chase realism, there’s plenty of room for games like this to be a whole lot of fun, which it is. I’ve been playing it on Medium and I’m surprised by how good the combat felt here, I might have to play again bumping the difficulty up and that’s saying a lot, I don’t often replay games on a higher difficulty because I’ve just enjoyed it that much and feel like I want it to hurt me plenty.</p>
<p>The video features the gameplay on Steam Deck but on desktop Linux the performance was great as well. It also sees the momentary shader stutter, which will no doubt get smoother later on when Valve has a cache ready. On all max settings at 2560x1400 with my NVIDIA 2080 Ti and AMD Ryzen 5800x it's been looking great!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4755809451684870280gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4755809451684870280gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6449545281684870282gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6449545281684870282gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun on Fedora KDE 38.</em></p>
<p>Overall, if the video issue doesn't bother you and the external controllers aren't a problem for you on Steam Deck (if you don't dock it), then it's an easy recommendation. </p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/warhammer-40000-boltgun?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2005010/Warhammer_40000_Boltgun/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Total War: PHARAOH announced - Linux port from Feral Interactive (UPDATE: incorrect)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Feral Interactive emailed me to correct the record that they're <strong>not</strong> actually doing a Linux port this time. They said the Creative Assembly FAQ post was incorrect. Feral are now doing macOS only.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>SEGA and Creative Assembly officially announced Total War: PHARAOH today for release in October 2023, and as usual Feral Interactive will be doing their Linux and macOS ports. For those who will be waiting for the Native Linux build, you'll need to wait a bit longer as noted at the bottom of the official <a href="https://pharaoh.totalwar.com/news/announce-faq/" target="_blank">FAQ</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lLlD650ZBFQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/737b1ad326ff3b48fe47a1a022eb7a4c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lLlD650ZBFQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"There are few periods more iconic than Ancient Egypt; fraught with political intrigue, cataclysmic events and grand war campaigns, it's the perfect setting for a Total War title," said Game Director, Todor Nikolov. "As Pharaoh, you must save Egypt from the cusp of destruction and guide your people through the calamitous Bronze-Age collapse. It is up to you to either survive or fade into history." </p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Shape Your Dynasty - The Pharaoh is dead, and the people of Egypt, Canaan, and the Hittite empire cry out for a new leader. Many desire the power of the throne, but the path to becoming Pharaoh is a perilous one. As the leader of these great nations, you must overcome societal collapse, face natural disasters and fight to protect your people against invaders from far off lands. </li>
<li>With a choice of eight Faction Leaders from three rich cultural hubs, step into their unique playstyles and take charge of deadly and diverse unit rosters. Whether you’re charming the courts as a peerless diplomat, charging into battle as an unwavering commander or causing chaos as a fearless warlord, become a leader that history will remember. </li>
<li>Unearth Ancient Egypt - On your journey to becoming Pharaoh, uncover a beautifully lush and vibrant recreation of Ancient Egypt at the height of its power. From the fertile banks of the river Nile to the windswept, arid deserts of the Sinai Peninsula and the mountainous crags of ancient Anatolia, this magnificent visual reimagining brings the beauty and brutality of Egypt’s most tumultuous era to life. </li>
<li>Epic Dynamic Battles - Enemy armies aren’t the only challenges to overcome on the battlefield. Lead your soldiers through sudden and dramatic shifts in weather, such as thunderstorms and sandstorms, and witness the tides of battle turn as it directly impacts the surrounding terrain. Beware the threat of fire too, as battles can become engulfed in flames, striking and spreading across the battlefield as it burns forests and damages the foundations of enemy settlements. </li>
<li>Customize and Play Your Way - With a brand-new Campaign Customisation feature, no two campaigns will ever feel the same. Determine how you play with an extended range of campaign customisation options, such as random starting positions for all factions, detailed resource settings, the ability to toy with natural disasters and much more. With an abundance of options, stack the odds against yourself for an added challenge or become an unmatched power to breeze your way to victory. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>At release it will cost:</p>
<ul>
<li>Base Game: £49.99 / $59.99 / €59.99</li>
<li>Deluxe Edition: £61.17 / $72.87 / €72.87</li>
<li>Dynasty Edition: £77.96 / $91.46 / €91.46</li>

      <title>Nintendo Switch emulator yuzu gets a nice Steam Deck upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The team working on the Nintendo Switch emulator <a href="https://yuzu-emu.org/" target="_blank">yuzu</a> have released some Early Access upgrades, this time around for the Steam Deck. With their Early Access updates, these are available to people who support development on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/yuzuteam" target="_blank">Patreon</a> before rolling out to all users in their main public releases.</p>
<p>From the Early Access 3604 release notes via their Discord:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Tweaked garbage collector to be more aggressive in favour of steam deck.</li>
<li>Automatically detect system timezone.</li>
<li>Yuzu now automatically sets the system timezone based on the desktop operating system clock.</li>
<li>Limit device access memory for integrated devices to 4 GB.</li>
<li>Prevent vram usage from filling up in integrated devices like steam deck.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Great to see developers improve things on my favourite Linux-powered handheld.</p>
<p>Have you been doing much emulation on Steam Deck or desktop Linux? Let me know in the comments how you've found the experience to be. I don't do much at all myself.</p>

      <title>Dino MMO survival game Path of Titans is really coming along</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Path of Titans is one I haven't checked on in some time, a dinosaur MMO survival game currently in development and it's looking pretty good. Still relatively early days for the game, but the content has been expanding on this quite nicely.</p>
<p>It feels a bit like a dino-themed Rust in a way, with you being dropped into the world as a dino of your choice, with your customized pattern and colours and it's up to you to do what you want. It just recently had a Nightstalker Update adding in expanded combat abilities, and as the update name suggests - special nighttime abilities too. There's also been various upgrades for dino textures and animations and dinos that love fish will now gain certain special buffs from certain types of fish.</p>
<p>Trailer of their recent Night Stalker update:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="f2V6s3c41bk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/438b396e8180661fa9d9e25ec096bb10.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/f2V6s3c41bk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>So much more has been added and coming soon! There's big upgrades to the two included open-world maps, their music system is coming with an original soundtrack, there's a new random colouring button to randomize your dino and lots more.</p>
<p>Having a bit of a dive into it today, I was quite impressed by what I was seeing. The dino design and animation is looking fantastic, I especially love the wiggle when you walk and the various sounds you can make to say hi or to warn others. The tutorial it has now at least gives you a basic intro to the mechanics, and there's some starting quests now too but I feel it could still do with a bit more hand-holding for newer players. Plenty of fun to go exploring though and seeing what creatures you come across.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20213511861684852508gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20213511861684852508gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12433370381684852509gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12433370381684852509gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I ended up with a little follower for a while, until they decided to chomp on my leg which they clearly regretted considering how much bigger and more powerful my jaws were…</p>

      <title>Duke Nukem Forever: Restoration Project got a big upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Remember Duke Nukem Forever? You would be forgiven if you don't. As usual though, modders to the rescue. With the release of the Duke It Out update for the <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/dnf2001-restoration-project" target="_blank">Duke Nukem Forever: Restoration Project</a>. This project has a simple goal: to complete Duke Nukem Forever as it was originally intended back in 2001.</p>
<p>Not a native game of course but this update included lots to be interested about. Lots of performance improvements to the rendering system, along with a note that they're continuing to work on an OpenGL port as well. The update includes HUD upgrades, the single-player was improved, multiplayer gained 9 new maps and so much more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="H0l9Rhv-7DA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4d0ebb6a3b0e8ccf4f218dae8006b1c5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/H0l9Rhv-7DA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They even talked about running it on Steam Deck in their news post on <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/dnf2001-restoration-project/news/get-ready-to-duke-it-out" target="_blank">Mod DB</a>, as they've streamlined the process a fair bit and there's also now a Steam Input layout just for it.</p>
<p>Nice to see modders work to make something of it.</p>

<p>“Looking back on the incredible journey of Cities: Skylines, it’s clear to see that it has become more than just a game. It's a community of passionate and creative individuals who have built intricate and magnificent cities with their own unique visions,” said Mariina Hallikainen, CEO of Colossal Order. “Hotels &amp; Retreats is the last expansion for Cities: Skylines and celebrates its legacy by introducing ways for players to express their creativity.”</p>

      <title>Inspired by Japanese folklore, Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus looks gorgeous</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>An upcoming 2.5D action platformer with some gorgeous visuals inspired by Japanese folklore? Sign me up, this sounds great but it's a little while away yet.</p>
<p>Seems I completely missed this one originally, as it was funded on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/squidshockstudios/bo-a-hand-drawn-2d-adventure-based-on-japanese-folklore/description" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> back in early 2022 and Linux is a confirmed release platform for the game. It surfaced again recently, as they've now teamed up with Humble Games (the publishing arm of Humble Bundle).</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NGCzrmMHAHw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1b514e90911c8bc6b3aecce4e9780a57.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NGCzrmMHAHw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"Flow with acrobatic grace and agility through a mysterious world of myth and legend in Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus, a colorful hand-drawn adventure inspired by Japanese folklore.</p>
<p>Undertake a mystical journey as Bō, a celestial blossom (fox tentaihana) descended from the heavens to play a key role in an ancient and mysterious ritual. Use your legendary bō staff to bounce and glide fluidly through an otherworldly realm of hand-drawn, dreamlike landscapes, strange and adorable yokai, and massive monsters summoned from ancient legends of Japan."</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A genre that will feel familiar yet fresh to many players. A 2.5D side-scrolling action platformer with metroidvania elements that merges classic hand-drawn animation and scenery with new atmo- spheric bells and whistles that make the experience wondrously novel yet cozily familiar.</li>
<li>Tight platforming controls. Bō feels amazing to control and players will feel great agency as they enter a flow state navigating the challenging platforming puzzles.</li>
<li>Explore a mysterious world based on Japanese folklore! The world of Bō is open and interconnected. Explore everything from haunted bathhouses to a thriving Japanese-inspired metropolis. Find ways to travel back to areas that you thought you explored fully and unlock new paths and surprises.</li>
<li>Gather and collect ingredients and relics. Mine the valuable resources in the Kagayaki Cave or harvest bizarre flora in Midori Forest.</li>
<li>Unlock powerful new abilities! Brew and drink arcane teas to unlock Bō’s shapeshifting staff abilities. Including the Mochi Mallet, Blossom Dash and the Grappling Gun.</li>
<li>Daruma doll sidekicks! Collect daruma dolls throughout your journey to tune your abilities and give you advantages (or even disadvantages) in unique ways. All daruma dolls begin with 1 eye filled in. They can be upgraded to a 2-eyed daruma that enhances the original daruma’s perk. These loveable daruma dolls will be by your side throughout your journey.</li>
<li>A colorful cast of bizarre and adorable yokai (Mischievous monsters from Japanese folklore) as well as original characters based on Japanese cultural archetypes. All of these characters and enemies are animated with charming detail in traditional hand-drawn 2D frame-by-frame animation. Help them with their side quests or just stop by for a chat and a cup of tea.</li>
<li>Epic Boss Battles! On your journey you will encounter many massive monsters from Japanese folklore. Use your gained knowledge and skill to vanquish them and advance further in your quest.</li>
<li>Beautiful hand-drawn and immersive areas and landscapes with traditional Japanese inspired trimmings.</li>
<li>An absolutely gorgeous original musical score composed by Moises Camargo (Moixhka) that beautifully blends traditional Japanese instrumentation with modern orchestral music.</li>

      <title>Portal Reloaded team announced The Cooperative Update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Currently available in Beta on Steam for you to test out, the <a href="https://portalreloaded.com/coop/" target="_blank">Cooperative Update</a> for Portal Reloaded sounds like a lot of fun. For those who haven't played before: it's a free, community made modification for Portal 2. Building on the original concepts in the game by giving you a third portal allowing you to travel between different timelines.</p>
<p>The Cooperative Update is planned to arrive sometime in the Summer bringing with it 20 new puzzles, which you can play either online or via split-screen. It also gives new music, new menu backgrounds, new subtitle options and various upgrades to the single-player time travel logical to solve some bugs.</p>
<p>"The Cooperative Testing Initiative is sent back to the past to retrieve some very important data that has been lost to time. One of you is in charge of shooting regular portals while the other takes care of placing time portals. This creates some very interesting gameplay mechanics, as both players rely on their partner to travel through space and time respectively."</p>

      <title>Odencat announced surreal adventure Dream Channel Zero</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Odencat (Meg's Monster, Bear's Restaurant, Fishing Paradiso) and Fuming have announced Dream Channel Zero, a rather surreal sounding adventure about a boy who gets sucked into the world of a mysterious video game.</p>
<p>"Dream Channel Zero tells the tale of a boy named Akira, who one day gets suddenly and inexplicably sucked into the world of a mysterious video game. There, he meets Rumiko—a seemingly normal girl in a teal blue hoodie—and the two team up to conquer whatever perils this strange virtual world might throw at them, and hopefully find a way out."</p>
<p>Check out the first teaser trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Jy6kg8BZoNU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e2f9769b4ad095a628421f02d5b1ca21.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Jy6kg8BZoNU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Sounds just as unique as games previously from Odencat, so no surprise to see them teaming up with Fuming on this one. The battle system sounds interesting too, as the world is filled with strange creatures and all of them will stand in your way but they say "in many cases, a single well-timed punch to the face will be enough to send them to their graves" with each battle having its own unique trick to beat it and no repeat encounters.</p>
<p>It will release sometime in 2024 and you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2382810/Dream_Channel_Zero/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>VKD3D-Proton v2.9 out now with multiple performance improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just before the weekend hit <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/tag/v2.9" target="_blank">VKD3D-Proton v2.9</a> was release, giving some big improvements to the Direct3D 12 to Vulkan translation layer used in Proton on Steam Deck and desktop Linux.</p>
<p>Some of the improvements include greatly reduced system memory requirements on the first run of an application, the <em>VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_libraries</em> extension now used to avoid shader compilation stutter in some extreme edge cases, performance was improved for certain bad occlusion query patterns (Elden Ring being noted here), improved CPU performance of <em>VK_EXT_descriptor_buffer</em> with vendor-specific "ultra-fast paths" and improvements to VRAM oversubscription behaviour if <em>VK_EXT_pageable_device_local_memory</em> is supported.</p>
<p>Various new features were added like better DXR 1.1 support, completed FL 12.1 support, D3D11on12 interoperability interfaces are now supported and added support of VK_EXT_image_sliced_view_of_3d for sliced 3D UAVs.</p>
<p>They've removed the legacy swapchain and they now share code with DXVK which requires v2.1, plus added support for Native Linux swapchain.</p>
<p>Even more game-specific workarounds and bug fixes were made, although they're no longer listing them individually becaise it has become "impractical" to do so. There's also some driver workarounds for NVIDIA and Mesa RADV like a RADV bug causing memory bloat in shader caches.</p>
<p>Work was also done to support the different ways newer games were loading the Direct3D 12 DLL files, as some were assuming a layout like AgilitySDK, so now VKD3D-Proton supports this layout as well (so more games should work).</p>

<p>After 27 years, Jeremy White is leaving CodeWeavers, the company who oversee and fund Wine development and also work on Proton with Valve for the Steam Deck and Linux desktop.</p>
<p>This is going to be a big change for their company, with it moving over to an Employee Ownership Trust, which sounds like a really nice move overall. This ensures the company works for the staff and the community, giving employees more of a say in how it runs and a share of profits too.</p>
<p>Announced in a <a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/about/news/press/20230517" target="_blank">press release</a> and a personal <a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/blog/jwhite/2023/5/19/a-new-chapter-for-codeweavers-and-myself-trust-me" target="_blank">blog post</a> from White, the new CEO will be James Ramey who has been the long time president of the company and Ulrich Czekalla, their director of development, moving over to President. However, White will remain as Chairman of the Board so not entirely gone.</p>
<p>“We believe that this trust represents a new model for corporate governance,” said White. “The trust allows the company to be run for the benefit of the staff and the broader community, rather than for shareholder profit. I believe this will create a more sustainable, ethical, and equitable business.”</p>
<p>“I'm looking forward to seeing this in practice!” said Proton lead developer Arek Hiler. “The relationship with many employers is very one-sided—employees are there to generate value for the owners and can be made redundant on shareholders' whim. With this change, I know the company has my back. Not only is it more democratic, but profits will go to the employees who generate them.”</p>
<p>Seems like their team are happy with the move, so hopefully this will help keep Wine and Proton development going strong long into the future.</p>

      <title>The Outlast Trials out now - amazing on Steam Deck (and desktop Linux)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready to scare yourself silly? The Outlast Trials has hit Steam Early Access and it's Steam Deck Verified right out of the gate. This is a single-player and online co-op survival horror mixing together gory action with plenty of psychological stuff thrown in to really make you sweat.</p>
<p>"Set in the era of the Cold War, human guinea pigs are involuntarily recruited by the good folks at the Murkoff Corporation to test advanced methods of brainwashing and mind control. In a world of distrust, fear, and violence, your morals will be challenged, your endurance tested, and your sanity crushed. All in the name of progress, science, and profit."</p>
<p>With Proton 8, it works out of the box on desktop Linux and Steam Deck. When I say it <em>works</em>, I mean it, that Steam Deck Verified rating is absolutely <em>deserved</em> as it genuinely works shockingly well. So good that words won't be good enough so here's a video of some clips on Steam Deck where it has been pretty much a solid 60FPS nearly the entire time on the default settings:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zF-WOfOCKpI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/67e687c0aec20289c707a7f1dc92457c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zF-WOfOCKpI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This is how you do a new release. Make sure it performs well in general and get it Deck Verified right away. Lots of other developers could learn a thing or two from how this release has been handled. Developer Red Barrels should be proud of this one. It already has an Overwhelmingly Positive user score on Steam too, and right now there's over 25,000 people playing it, so it certainly seems like one of this years most popular games.</p>
<p>On desktop Linux the experience is very much the same, very smooth and looking exceptionally good. Doesn't appear to use Steam Cloud for syncing characters though, which is a bit annoying but not a major problem and one I'm sure they'll sort later.</p>

      <title>Last Christmas, a short and &#39;not so sweet&#39; adventure gets a Linux version</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For fans of point and click adventures with a twist, you may want to take a look over at Last Christmas that recently added a Native Linux version. The game released on Steam in April, with the Linux version arriving May 17th.</p>
<p>Since it appears to be on the short side, the developer hasn't really explained all that much about it. Noting that "Last Christmas is a short and not so sweet point and click adventure game. Join Frankie up in the mountains at the family cabin and help him to prepare the perfect Christmas for his girlfriend Betty, but watch out, things aren't always as they seem..." and a very brief promo trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="MoPjvY_aDfY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/deb6eb03e18261839427a6a0ca6e23a0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/MoPjvY_aDfY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The game has 4 different endings, some dark humour and 24 achievements to hunt down. With a few point and click modern touches like double click to exit scenes and a hotspot finder.</p>
<p>You can find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2129020/Last_Christmas/" target="_blank">Last Christmas on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>The next game in the series is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2369460/First_Christmas" target="_blank">First Christmas</a>, which also plans to have a Linux version and it launches later this year.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>8BitSkull developer of the awesome <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/void-scrappers-blends-vampire-survivors-mechanics-with-a-space-shoot-em-up/" target="_blank">Void Scrappers</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/09/retro-tactical-rpg-where-time-moves-when-you-do-fates-of-ort-has-a-big-hero-mode-update/" target="_blank">Fates of Ort</a> has announced BORE BLASTERS, a game all about drilling with machine guns.</p>

It also features a 180° hinge, if for whatever reason you need to lay it out flat.</p>

      <title>Sci-fi colony building sim Stardeus gets a big planetary expansion</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/dwarven-colony-builder-mountaincore-is-out-now/" target="_blank">dwarves</a> aren't your thing and you want to do some building in space, Stardeus is worth a look and it just recently had a pretty huge upgrade. As a reminder: Stardeus is a deep colony sim set on a broken starship manned by drones and hibernating human survivors. As the AI, have your drones repair your ship, save your crew and travel the stars in this beautiful simulation.</p>
<p>With the latest update the developer has expanded on the planet system, allowing you to now enter any Planet in the game and they will have multiple points of interest and resources. You will also have full control over your planetary expedition to tell them where to go.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14191511541684490142gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14191511541684490142gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12387637501684490174gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12387637501684490174gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Lots more new in the latest update including the ability to sell derelict ships, distress signals you can respond to, some mining automation, you now need to make Enriched Uranium for nuclear reactors giving them another step in the process and you can now build a scanner to detect alien intrusions. There's even more customization with the ability to paint everything too:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19619981391684490316gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19619981391684490316gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Sounds like a really fun update for a game that already sucked away plenty of my time. Full changelog can be seen <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1380910/view/3722831692207775366" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can see their full overview of the updates below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="pX6_TiVtJsw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/12e3fc45ae76c91bab228468e2d44791.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/pX6_TiVtJsw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified. Definitely worth a look if you enjoy sci-fi colony builders and you're after something different, that has plenty of depth to it already.</p>

      <title>Dwarven colony builder Mountaincore is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Enjoy games like RimWorld, Dwarf Fortress and The Settlers? You'll likely quite enjoy dwarven colony builder Mountaincore as well. It's just hit Early Access and works well on Linux desktop and Steam Deck with full support.</p>
<p>Technically, this <em>isn't</em> a <em>new</em> game. It was previously called King under the Mountain until <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/publisher-of-king-under-the-mountain-backs-out-so-its-re-releasing-as-mountaincore/" target="_blank">their publisher dropped-out</a> so they had to go through a rename but it comes with a huge upgrade. Now it's properly back and they developer is continuing on with development. Always nice to see a win for a small team.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="S9XP3rGsGBs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/20264c023daebedd90b4a257920d1d53.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/S9XP3rGsGBs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer mentioned the game is based around these central pillars:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A simulated world - The game world is built on a series of interlocking systems which combine together to simulate a living, breathing world. As night changes to day, trees and plants will grow (or not) based on sunlight and rainfall. The local environment and changing seasons have effects on the native flora and fauna. Your settlers and other characters have their own personal social and physical needs that you'll have to fulfil to keep them happy (or at least stop them from breaking and going insane!)</li>
<li>Procedural generation - Every map is randomly generated from an initial seed (a large number) so that no two maps will ever be the same - unless you choose to use the same seed! The art assets for the game have been created in such a way that they can be drawn by the game engine for near limitless variation in colour - so every tree, plant and character will have their own unique combination of colours and appearance.</li>
<li>Peaceful expansion - It's an important design goal that it's possible to play the entire game without getting into armed conflict with other factions (if you choose to). Although weapons and combat can be significant parts of gameplay, we wanted to make sure you can peacefully build up a fully-functioning town to have the satisfaction of sitting back and watching your settlers go about their business productively.</li>
<li>Player-driven content - Have you ever spent hours in a creative game building something, only for it to sit hidden away on your computer? In <em>Mountaincore</em>, players can opt-in to automatically upload their settlements for other players to visit. This drives the basis of the adventure mode - you put together a party of champions from your settlement's population, and go off on an adventure to explore another player's creation. This mode will involve tactical combat as you explore and battle through another player's fortress, claiming rare resources that may be difficult or impossible to acquire otherwise. It's important to note that nothing will be lost by either player in this encounter - you don't actually ?attack? the other player, only a copy of their settlement, and there are benefits to be gained by both parties. Note that the adventure mode is not implemented yet and coming later in development.</li>
<li>Mod friendly engine - Another big design goal is that everything you see or read in the game (and the variables behind them) are fully open to modification. In fact, the base game is built as an engine with one base mod applied to it (which modders can look at to see how things work). The game is fully integrated to <a href="http://mod.io" target="_blank">mod.io</a> (game page at <a href="https://mod.io/g/mountaincore" target="_blank">https://mod.io/g/mountaincore</a>) to download and update mods automatically.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems like a nice big upgrade over their previous release, which due to the issues with their publisher hadn't seen a public update in many months. They have a lot of plans for the future of this game, so it's another that's going to be fun to keep digging deep into at various updates. For now though, it's already full of things to do so worth checking out.</p>
<p>Native Linux support and works just fine on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://rocketjumptechnology.itch.io/mountaincore" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2370310/Mountaincore/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>FX Technology tease their upgraded screen for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fancy upgrading the resolution of your Steam Deck screen? Well it seems FX Technology also known as F(x)tec are planning to offer Steam Deck screen upgrades under the Deck HD brand.</p>
<p>The screen on all three models of the Steam Deck have a 1280x800 resolution, and the top-end Steam Deck has special anti-glare coating. What if we could swap it out for a 1920x1200 anti-glare screen? Well that's their plan. Not just that though, their screen will offer better colours too they claim 74% AdobeRGB Coverage versus 45% AdobeRGB Coverage on the original Steam Deck screen.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15992438261684430442gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15992438261684430442gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>It's not available yet but you can join the waitlist on their <a href="https://www.deckhd.com/" target="_blank">website</a>, with a price expected to be around $99.</p>
<p>An interesting idea, although it's worth remembering that powering that extra screen resolution will come with a cost attached. Even at the 800p of the existing Steam Deck screen, that can be too much for some of the latest AAA games to handle. Might be nice for some older games though, or just anything that <em>isn't</em> the latest 3D AAA titles.</p>
<p>I actually spoke about this in my recent Steam Deck news round-up video, as it was <a href="https://twitter.com/balika011/status/1657086740350263302" target="_blank">teased</a> on Twitter but only today I found the official site launch for it. Anyway my round-up is below:</p>

      <title>Kubuntu Focus launch the 5th-gen M2 Laptop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need a high-powered laptop and love KDE Plasma? Well the team at Kubuntu Focus just announced the fifth-generation M2 Laptop. Buying from Kubuntu Focus also helps to support KDE development, as Kubuntu Focus <a href="https://dot.kde.org/2023/04/11/kubuntu-focus-becomes-kde-patron" target="_blank">became a KDE Patron</a> as of April 2023.</p>
<p>Starting at $1,895 it comes power-packed for that with an Intel i9-13900HX (24 cores), 16GB 4800MHz RAM, NVIDIA RTX 4060, 500GB NVMe and a 15.6" 2560x1440 240 Hz IPS display. Overall, that certainly sounds good and it ships with KDE Plasma 5.24 LTS on Kubuntu 22.04 LTS.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18317613901684425693gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18317613901684425693gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You can also upgrade it up to 64GB RAM, an NVIDIA 4070 and 2 x 2TB NVMe. Even with the entry level you could pretty easily replace a desktop with this absolute unit.</p>
<p>Plenty of ports too including HDMI 2.0b, Mini DisplayPort, 2 x USB-C 3.2 (with Thunderbolt, DisplayPort, and Power-In), 2 x USB-A 3.2, Headset Audio Jack, Mic + S/PDIF Audio Jack and 2.5 Gigabit RJ-45 Ethernet.</p>
<p>They offer free shipping inside USA / Canada but for outside you need to email them to arrange it.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://kfocus.org/spec/spec-m2.html" target="_blank">M2 Laptop here</a>.</p>

      <title>Prison Architect has a final free update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Prison Architect is officially done. The final update has rolled out with The Sunset Update, as Paradox Interactive and Double Eleven have said they're finished with it.</p>
<p>Quite a surprise to see actually. Paradox only purchased the rights to it back in 2019, and I expected it to just keep on going for a lot longer than this, more like what they've done with their other strategy games but it's still had a rather long life. Perhaps a sequel is secretly in the works?</p>
<p>Anyway this final update they said the focus was on improving the player experience as much as possible.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="G0GAiCxMjmo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/01908d499b0d28e66de11c294183c47f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/G0GAiCxMjmo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The main additions:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Capacitor 2.0: I introduce to you, the Capacitor Max Plus - an upgraded version of the capacitor which allows your Power Stations to now produce twice the amount of power than they did before - for twice the price of course.</li>
<li>Remote Doors: We have added a coloured variant of the remote doors for both Death Row and Supermax security levels.</li>
<li>Riot Van Speed: Due to the efficiency of air-bound emergency units we have increased the movement speed of the Riot Guard Vans, to lower their arrival time.</li>
<li>Super Dog Mutator: Due to our undeniable fondness of them, we’ve added a new mutator based on the Super Guard mutator which will help give our furry friends an upgrade.</li>
<li>Updated Descriptions: After sweeping through the game we decided to update or add a number of new text strings. As such we’ve updated text for Item description, Staff descriptions, and also Need Descriptions.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a whole lot of bug fixes and general cleanups as well. Full details on what's changed <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/the-sunset-update-is-live-this-ones-for-you.1584895/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can buy Prison Architect from <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/franchises/prison-architect?ref=gol" target="_blank">Fanatical</a>, <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/prison_architect?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/prison-architect?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/233450/Prison_Architect/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and Valve tagged it as Steam Deck Playable (but not fully Verified).</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental fixes The Elder Scrolls Online launcher &amp; improves Street Fighter 6</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A fresh May upgrade for Proton Experimental has arrived giving us a few tweaks to improve some select games. Here's what's new in the May 17th upgrade.</p>
<p>Valve are listing Super Bomberman R as a newly playable title, the rest are fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed The Elder Scrolls Online displaying an empty/flickering launcher window.</li>
<li>Improved video playback in Roboquest.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression that made Portal RTX not playable.</li>
<li>Fixed various memory leaks during video playback that were affecting the last Street Fighter 6 beta.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changelog is <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">over here</a>. Since there's many different Proton versions it can get a bit confusing, so head on over to my <a href="http://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">beginner's guide on Steam Play and Proton</a> for more info.</p>
<p>Is there something specific you're hoping Valve can improve in Proton for Steam Deck or desktop Linux? Let me know in the comments.</p>
<p>How to change your Proton version:</p>
<p>Steam Deck:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a game in your Library and head to the little cog icon on the right.</li>
<li>Click Properties, then Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>On a Linux desktop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right click a game, go to Properties.</li>
<li>Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>

      <title>Valve tries to improve Big Picture Mode on Linux for NVIDIA GPUs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In the latest Steam Beta Client for desktop, Valve has made an attempt to improve the experience for NVIDIA GPU owners on Linux. Since the New Big Picture Mode landed, it has been pretty rough for NVIDIA users and that's being kind. It's sluggish as heck but now perhaps for some a bit better.</p>
<p>For Linux from the latest <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3731840159844956304" target="_blank">Beta</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed mouse input not working in the Store/Community pages on process startup.</li>
<li>Fixed mouse input not working in the top area of the window when dpi scaling was enabled.</li>
<li>Fixed hidpi scaling not working on Nvidia GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed HW acceleration not being enabled on Nvidia GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed Big Picture mode performance when using Nvidia GPUs. Known issue: some visual artifacts may appear. Use -disable-desktop-gl-fallback to restore previous behaviour if desired.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10904948361684411788gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10904948361684411788gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For me, I saw <em>no</em> improvements at all, it's still sluggish and the first attempt to load it just completely and instantly logged me out of KDE Plasma - ouch. Let me know how you get on in the comments!</p>
<p>The other changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue with a black Library pane when starting Steam with -silent (used when Steam starts with your computer) and then clicking on a Steam shortcut to bring up the main window.</li>

      <title>Mundfish remove graphics options from Atomic Heart on Steam Deck (updated)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 17:09 UTC</strong>: they said in a new <a href="https://twitter.com/mundfish/status/1659237675436474379" target="_blank">Twitter</a> post, that they're now going to be adding specific settings just for the Steam Deck:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our team, striving to provide all players with the best experience, continued looking for ways to maximize #AtomicHeart performance and is glad to announce that it has been made possible to add specific graphics settings relevant for Steam Deck with the future patches. Stay tuned</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we've gone from having all settings, to having none and next we're getting dedicated settings. Okay then.</p>
<hr/>
<p><u><em>Original article below:</em></u></p>
<p>This is just weird. Developer Mundfish seems to have intentionally removed all graphics options for Atomic Heart on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Originally, they seemed to be claiming it as a bug and that it would be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/12iaqk4/comment/jfxxi8o/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank">fixed</a>. A month later though, and their team on <a href="https://twitter.com/mundfish/status/1658860230606745601" target="_blank">Twitter</a> has made it clear it was intentional:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We hear all your feedback.</p>
<p>Removing the graphics settings in Atomic Heart on Steam Deck was a hard decision for us to make in order to maximize performance, Steam Deck battery and gameplay stability.</p>
<p>Our main goal here is to provide best game performance on every platform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Respectfully, I'm going to have to firmly disagree. Removing player choice like this is <em>not</em> acceptable in my opinion. Give the game good defaults (like a "Steam Deck" preset), and then let people tweak it as they wish afterwards - that would be the proper way to do it. Also have an option to reset to the defaults as well, this is all just basic stuff for a PC platform. </p>
<p>Hiding options in the name of maximising performance? That just doesn't make <em>any</em> sense.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5262458961684409922gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5262458961684409922gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Good intentions perhaps but simply the wrong way to go about this. It ends up feeling like they're trying to cover something up. It doesn't affect desktop Linux with Proton at least (I checked) just the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>It feels just as silly as Striking Distance Studios <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/the-callisto-protocol-got-a-steam-deck-upgrade/" target="_blank">hiding the benchmark mode</a> for Steam Deck in The Callisto Protocol.</p>
<p>You can see a whole bunch of gameplay on Steam Deck from release in my video below:</p>

<p>What do you think? It's weird right?</p>

      <title>Starship Troopers: Extermination is a little janky but so much fun</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A little janky in places as expected from an Early Access game but Starship Troopers: Extermination is a lot of fun to play with friends and even complete strangers. <u>Note</u>: copy provided by Evolve.</p>
<p>Luckily I was able to get a good couple of games in before the release, so I could already see that it was working quite nicely on desktop Linux with Proton. I've been testing it with Proton Experimental and everything as far as I can see works great! As a big fan of the original film, the books and the old Roughnecks CGI series I've wanted a game just like this for a long time but nothing before it really came close. This is good enough that I can easily see myself spending a whole lot of time crushing bugs because as we all know — the only good bug is a dead bug.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FDdRjfwOLoM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/541ff7de46335642f2609ae19d73dfa8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FDdRjfwOLoM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The statement "good enough" I think is really hitting the nail on the head here though. There's a <em>lot</em> of potential but it's early days for the game. A great start to what I honestly think will end up as a great game overall, if they manage to fix the janky feeling of some of the alien movement like how they jump to the side sometimes, which just looks a bit ridiculous and get a lot more content in there.</p>
<p>With multiple player classes, each with their own levelling and unlocks, there's space for them to make this really interesting and worth playing more but the problem is just how light it is on level content. We just seem to be repeating the same few levels over and over right now. Wouldn't be so bad if there were more dynamic events so I'm looking forward to the multiple planets they say they'll be adding in.</p>
<p>Part of the jankiness is the building system, with all of you being able to build when the time comes to prepare at the end of a mission. This generally results in a big mess. Feels like it's also part of the charm though at the same time, with a whole bunch of you building walls and towers with no real plan and then watch as it all crumbles down as the Arachnids crash through it later.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cooperative Gameplay </strong>- 16 players can team up in squads of four to defend their base, complete objectives, gather resources, and <em>try</em> to kill every Bug in sight. </li>
<li><strong>Three Playable Classes</strong> - Choose from Assault, Support, and Defense classes to best suit your playstyle and support the rest of your squad. </li>
<li><strong>Build Defenses</strong> - Construct walls, towers, ammo stations, and more using resources acquired from planetside refineries. </li>
<li><strong>Class Progression System </strong>- Unlock new weapons, equipment, and perks for each class to become an elite warfighter among the Deep Space Vanguard. </li>
<li><strong>5 Unique Bug Types</strong> -<strong> </strong>At Early Access launch, encounter Drone, Warrior, Gunner, Plasma Grenadier, and Tiger Elite enemy Bugs during missions. </li>
<li><strong>Escalating Infestation Levels </strong>- Increasing Bug threat levels during missions bring bigger and more dangerous enemies to the fight. </li>
<li><strong>Large-scale Battles </strong>- A massive map with five unique zones, and swarm-based combat with hundreds of enemy Bugs on screen delivers the sense of an overwhelming planetary war. </li>
<li><strong>Ground War </strong>- Retake bases and refineries, destroy hives, and complete a variety of side objectives to wrest control of the map away from the Bug menace. </li>
<li><strong>Ping system </strong>- Communication is key! The ‘Ping’ system gives players a quick and easy way to call out points of interest, objectives, incoming enemies, and more to teammates.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I should note it does use Easy Anti-Cheat, which can often be a problem for Steam Deck and desktop Linux. In this case though it has worked fine throughout pre-release and now after release it continues working. I did ask for an official statement of support on EAC + Proton but have yet to get a reply on it from the developer but I am chasing them on it.</p>
<p>For Steam Deck, you may want to sit and wait a while for some big needed optimizations, because even on the lowest details possible it often couldn't hold 30FPS or even 20FPS during the late-game hordes. Here's some gameplay from Steam Deck and desktop Linux:</p>

      <title>Realm Architect looks like an awesome modern VTT</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Realm Architect is an attempt to make a next-gen virtual tabletop experience, while also keeping it simpler to get into and keep running. It also looks great and it's confirmed to get Linux support now too.</p>
<p>They say that it "completely changes the way you create and play TTRPG campaigns, makes it easier than ever before to set up entire worlds, or Realms as they are called here, and removes the time-consuming stress of preparing everything down to the most minor of details".</p>
<p>It's currently crowdfunding on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/realmarchitect/realm-architect/description" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, with the initial €22,000 goal smashed very quickly and it's now sitting around €86,000. Thanks to the current funding level, we now have Linux support fully confirmed.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="J4hOxNhuRNc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0bdd1b86ff809979f811140bc36aa9ac.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/J4hOxNhuRNc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drag &amp; Drop</strong>: The ease of use in Realm Architect is next to none, with zero coding required. Every essential element is right there for you to drag &amp; drop onto your map.</li>
<li><strong>Easy to use codex</strong>: Whether you want to upload your own character sheets and monster manuals or use existing ones, it's as easy as the click of a button.</li>
<li><strong>No notes required:</strong> Our automated systems keep track of player HP, status effects, and even buffs &amp; boons that affect your die-rolls. No need to write anything down, we do all the grunt work for you!</li>
<li><strong>Build Realms, not maps</strong>: You can navigate from the world map, to a town center, and waltz into the inn with a few clicks, no need to load separate scenes.</li>
<li><strong>Plug &amp; Play</strong>: Realm Architect will have ready-made content for you to adventure through. Choose from campaigns made by experienced GMs and veteran publishers and find whatever your thrill-seeking heart may require.</li>
<li><strong>Make it your own</strong>: the UI will be customizable so the look &amp; feel of the interface matches your campaign. Going for a Lovecraftian horror setting or a cyberpunk sci-fi thriller? Everything is possible.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So why yet another one? It all comes down to time and easy of use it seems. They think they can do better than the likes of Foundry VTT, Roll20 and others.</p>

<p>The latest release of the all-in-one game manager Lutris is here, with v0.5.13 bringing with it some important features like new store integrations.

<p>Here's all that's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Add support for Proton.</li>
<li>Add drag and drop on the main window. Dropped files will be matched No-Intro, Redump and TOSEC checksums.</li>
<li>Add support for ModDB links in installers (moddb python module required).</li>
<li>Added "Missing" sidebar option for games whose directory is missing.</li>
<li>Re-style the configuration, preferences, installer and add-games windows.</li>
<li>Group configuration options into sections.</li>
<li>Added checkbox to stop asking for the launch config for a game.</li>
<li>Added checkbox to sort installed games first.</li>
<li>Support for launch-configs in shortcuts and the command line.</li>
<li>Show platform badges on banners and cover-art.</li>
<li>Installing games from setup files can now use different presets (Win98, 3DFX, ...).</li>
<li>Add filter field to runner list.</li>
<li>Show game count in search bar.</li>
<li>Workaround Humble Bundle authentication issues by allowing importing cookies from Firefox.</li>
<li>Add Itch.io integration.</li>
<li>Add Battle.net integration (protobuf dependency required).</li>
<li>Improve detection of DOSBox games on GOG.</li>
<li>Added "Unspecified" Vulkan ICD option.</li>
<li>Removed ResidualVM (now merged into ScummVM).</li>
<li>Detect obsolete Vulkan drivers and default to DXVK 1.x for them.</li>
<li>Improved High-DPI support for custom media.</li>
<li>Performance improvements.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Have you picked up anything during Steam Sports Fest 2023?</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/sports" target="_blank">Steam Sports Fest</a> has officially begun (I'm a little late on that) and it runs until May 22nd, so you've got plenty of time to check it out. During this time there are demos, discounts, free Steam stickers each day and more.</p>
<p>What actually counts as a sport when it comes to games is a pretty wide genre, that said sports as a whole is a pretty big net so no doubt there's something you'll be able to find.</p>
<p>Valve continue doing their funny little trailers now too:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="GXb-t1U6_kA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d7fd456f2937314b6dd917ee5746c406.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/GXb-t1U6_kA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Although they do the more serious business trailers as well:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ug6gAP8EdjI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8a325edca41eb1cc733b81e9031fa0f2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ug6gAP8EdjI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>If you scroll down the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/sports" target="_blank">special sale page</a>, there will be all sorts of filters you can apply. It's pretty slim pickings if you're only going for Native Linux games though. For Steam Deck and desktop Linux with Proton, there's <em>loads</em> of good picks that work out of the box. Admittedly sporting games aren't exactly my jam though.</p>
<p>Have you picked up anything good?</p>

      <title>NVIDIA Vulkan Beta 525.47.24 brings new extensions, 4GB+ pipeline caches support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA have a brand new release of their special developer-focused <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" target="_blank">Vulkan Beta Driver</a> with v525.47.24 available now. This driver series is mainly aimed at game developers, open source developers, and anyone who needs the latest Vulkan extension support.</p>
<p>Here's the newer extensions added:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_attachment_feedback_loop_dynamic_state.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_attachment_feedback_loop_dynamic_state</a> - This extension adds support for setting attachment feedback loops dynamically on command buffers.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_memory_priority.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_memory_priority</a> [Linux] - This extension adds a priority value specified at memory allocation time. On some systems with both device-local and non-device-local memory heaps, the implementation may transparently move memory from one heap to another when a heap becomes full (for example, when the total memory used across all processes exceeds the size of the heap). In such a case, this priority value may be used to determine which allocations are more likely to remain in device-local memory.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_pageable_device_local_memory.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_pageable_device_local_memory</a> [Linux] - Vulkan is frequently implemented on multi-user and multi-process operating systems where the device-local memory can be shared by more than one process. On such systems the size of the device-local memory available to the application may not be the full size of the memory heap at all times. In order for these operating systems to support multiple applications the device-local memory is virtualized and paging is used to move memory between device-local and host-local memory heaps, transparent to the application.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's what else has changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New:
<ul>
<li>Support for 4GB+ pipeline caches</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixes:
<ul>
<li>Correctly handle VkAccelerationStructureTrianglesOpacityMicromapEXT.micromap and VkAccelerationStructureTrianglesDisplacementMicromapNV.micromap NULL handles</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For normal gamers and desktop users, you generally want to stick with their main driver series. Recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/nvidia-release-details-of-security-issues-and-release-new-drivers/" target="_blank">NVIDIA released</a> details of security issues and release new drivers so be sure to check you're up to date.</p>

      <title>Immersion Corporation sues Valve over Steam Deck and Valve Index haptics tech</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Immersion Corporation have a history of taking on companies and winning, with Valve being the latest in the firing line over Immersion's patents. The patents involved are <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US7336260B2/en" target="_blank">7,336,260</a>, <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US8749507B2/en" target="_blank">8,749,507</a>, <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US9430042B2/en" target="_blank">9,430,042</a>, <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US9116546B2/en" target="_blank">9,116,546</a>, <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US10627907B2/en" target="_blank">10,627,907</a>, <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US10665067B2/en" target="_blank">10,665,067</a>, and <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US11175738B2/en" target="_blank">11,175,738</a>.</p>
<p>They're pretty notorious for this going after Xiaomi, Meta (Facebook), Sony, Microsoft and more in the past. Most companies just seem to partner up with them now and license their stuff. </p>
<p>From the press <a href="https://ir.immersion.com/news-releases/news-release-details/immersion-files-complaint-against-valve-us-district-court" target="_blank">release</a>:</p>
<p>“Immersion and its employees have worked diligently for almost 30 years to invent innovative haptic technologies that allow people to use their sense of touch to engage with products and experience the digital world around them. Our intellectual property is relevant to many of the most important and cutting-edge ways in which haptic technology is and can be deployed, and, in the case of AR/VR experiences, haptics is crucial to an immersive user experience,” said Eric Singer, Chairman and CEO.</p>
<p>“While we are pleased to see that Valve recognizes the value of haptics and has adopted our haptic technology in its handheld video game and AR/VR systems as part of its effort to generate revenue streams through the sales of hardware, games and other virtual assets, and advertisements, it is important for us to protect our business against infringement of our intellectual property to preserve the investments that we have made in our technology,” added Mr. Singer. “We must ensure that our intellectual property is recognized as a necessary feature in the handheld video game and emerging AR/VR markets, even when litigation becomes necessary.”</p>
<p>I have reached out to Valve Press, to see if they have any statement to share on this.</p>

      <title>Valheim has a performance boost patch in Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valheim is a fantastic game but it could do with some optimisations, especially when you're building up a big castle and whatever else people come up with. Thankfully Iron Gate have put out some improvements.</p>
<p>Available now in their public Beta on Steam a patch has arrived for testing that optimises many parts of the game for worlds big and small, which should also result in better network performance, better loading times and smaller save file sizes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13379357531684259863gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13379357531684259863gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>However, as an important note, they say to backup your save files, as it's less backwards compatible than before. So if you're testing, be sure to make an extra backup first.</p>
<p>Highlights of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/5448836977170331099" target="_blank">Patch 0.216.5</a> (Public Test):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Many performance, memory and networking improvements for both small and large worlds</li>
<li>World save file size greatly reduced</li>
<li>Fixed hitbox issue for close combat and spear throwing issue</li>
<li>Minimap pin input fixed on steam deck &amp; big picture mode</li>
<li>Added "UI scaling" to settings on Xbox</li>
<li>Fixed endless loading of save manager when switching tabs too fast</li>
<li>World save files that are corrupt, have load errors or have missing meta files can now be restored from the most recent backup directly from within the Select World menu by pressing the "Start" button.</li>
<li>Save file stability &amp; issues fixed</li>
<li>Decreased load times in the Manage Saves menu.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that would cause the GUI to not update when deleting the bottommost backup in the Manage Saves menu.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Great to see such upgrades being made, in addition to the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/valheim-is-getting-siege-weapons-fortresses-and-fearsome-foes/" target="_blank">new content teasers</a> we've been getting.</p>
<p>Valheim is available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/valheim?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Steam gets game trials with Dead Space being first, plus Valve dumps Google Analytics</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two bits of Steam news for you here, as Valve continue iterating on Steam features for players and developers.</p>
<p>The first of which, is that it seems Steam now supports game trials with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1693980/Dead_Space/" target="_blank">Dead Space</a> giving you the ability to play 90 minutes free until May 29th. As far as I know, this is officially the first proper time Valve has enabled a developer to do this. With it being announced in a Steam post, the game is also 20% off.</p>
<p>You can play Dead Space on Steam Deck and Linux desktop with Proton 8.0. Although if you're on desktop Linux, you might want Proton Experimental <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/proton-experimental-improves-ea-app-battlenet-and-nvapi-enabled-for-many-games/" target="_blank">which recently enabled the NVAPI</a> for it (for NVIDIA GPUs).</p>
<p>What do you think to trials of games on Steam?</p>
<p>Another bit of news is more for developers, but it's actually a good thing for Steam customers as well. Valve announced in a Steamworks <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/3719453992486109639" target="_blank">blog post</a> some upgrades to player tracking systems for developers. With it, Valve mentions their focus on user privacy. An interesting point here is that Valve are dropping support for Google Analytics as "Google’s tracking solutions don't align well with our approach to customer privacy" and so they're building the more useful parts directly into Steam. Nice.</p>

      <title>European Commission approves Microsoft acquisition of Activision Blizzard</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Despite <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/uk-cma-blocks-the-microsoft-takeover-of-activision/" target="_blank">opposition from the UK CMA</a>, and the ongoing legal battle in the USA, the acquisition of Activision Blizzard takes a step forward as the European Commission has approved it now.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_2705" target="_blank">press release</a> the EU Commission made it clear that initially, they did feel the deal could "harm competition" in the console and PC gaming space (including cloud gaming). However, after their "in-depth market investigation" they changed their mind and said Microsoft "would not be able to harm rival consoles and rival multi-game subscription services" but that Microsoft could still "harm competition in the distribution of games via cloud game streaming services and that its position in the market for PC operating systems would be strengthened".</p>
<p>So why are they approving it? Microsoft offered up these terms for cloud gaming for 10 years:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>free license to consumers in the EEA</strong> that would allow them to stream, via <strong>any cloud game streaming services</strong> of their choice, <strong>all</strong> <strong>current and future Activision Blizzard PC and console games</strong> for which they have a license.</li>
<li>A corresponding <strong>free license to cloud game streaming service providers</strong> to allow EEA-based gamers to stream any Activision Blizzard's PC and console games.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Once those were set the EU decided the commitments "fully address the competition concerns identified by the Commission and represent a significant improvement for cloud game streaming compared to the current situation".</p>
<p>The UK CMA are standing firm though, releasing a statement on Twitter in a <a href="https://twitter.com/CMAgovUK/status/1658131200181952516" target="_blank">small thread</a>. To save you clicking around their statement says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The UK, US and European competition authorities are unanimous that this merger would harm competition in cloud gaming.</p>
<p>The CMA concluded that cloud gaming needs to continue as a free, competitive market to drive innovation and choice in this rapidly evolving sector.</p>
<p>Microsoft’s proposals, accepted by the European Commission today, would allow Microsoft to set the terms and conditions for this market for the next 10 years.</p>
<p>They would replace a free, open and competitive market with one subject to ongoing regulation of the games Microsoft sells, the platforms to which it sells them, and the conditions of sale.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons the CMA’s independent panel group rejected Microsoft’s proposals and prevented this deal.</p>
<p>While we recognise and respect that the European Commission is entitled to take a different view, the CMA stands by its decision.</p>

      <title>Roblox still plan to make it work with Wine on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The situation is currently a bit messy, with conflicting statements but it appears that Roblox should work again on Linux / Steam Deck with Wine eventually.</p>
<p>As a little refresher: Roblox acquired Byfron, makers of anti-cheat software. They've now fully integrated it into Roblox with what they now call Hyperion in their new 64 bit client. They made a choice to block Roblox in Wine with this update, giving an <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/roblox-intentionally-blocking-linux-with-wine-in-their-new-update/" target="_blank">assortment of reasons</a> but saying Wine was still a priority and then later <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/goodbye-to-roblox-on-linux-with-their-new-anti-cheat-and-wine-blocking/" target="_blank">seemingly backtracking</a> on that a bit.</p>
<p>Hope is not lost though Roblox fans, as they've now put out a fresh comment on the subject to make it clear that while they won't support it officially, they aim to get it working again.</p>
<p>Here's the <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/proper-support-for-the-linux-platform/56544/120" target="_blank">latest word</a> on it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To clarify one detail: while we have no plans to release a Linux client, we are aiming to support Wine again. It seems possible, and we see a lot of value in it as a way of letting people run on Linux without the large investment on our end of releasing a native client. For all the reasons described above, Wine won’t ever be something that we guarantee will work, but also for all the reasons described above, we’d really like to make it work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right now though, it's all just words of course. We'll have to wait and see if it happens.</p>

      <title>Albion Online &#39;Knightfall&#39; is here with new content and improved controls</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Offering up plenty of new content for players to explore, the Knightfall update for Albion Online is here and it may be time to give it another look.</p>
<p>The open world has been expanded and improved upon once again, giving you more reasons to actually explore. In the the Mists for example, there's new Coffers to find that reveal themselves to nearby players that will give you some treasure. Normal mob camps also got a bit more interesting, as they didn't previously offer all that much. Now they offer up a lootable Cache when a camp is cleared and you can even get some pretty rare loot. There's also a new Knightfall Abbey dungeon in the Mists to find, with multiple floors to clear and lots of treasure.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xhLxGK0MvnA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4f1341b0f3f48f71eec1f5b72709648f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xhLxGK0MvnA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of the other bits included:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Extensive combat balance changes.</li>
<li>Optional WASD movement system.</li>
<li>Characters' gender can be changed for Gold.</li>
<li>New "Travel Mode" offers transparent map overlay while traveling.</li>
<li>Items can now be repaired directly via the Marketplace UI.</li>
<li>New guild logos, Season Winner statues, and skill icons.</li>
<li>Major optimizations to mobile and controller gameplay.</li>
<li>…and much more.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Albion Online can be picked up on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/761890/Albion_Online/" target="_blank">Steam</a> or <a href="https://albiononline.com/home" target="_blank">direct</a> from the developer and it's free to play. It has Native Linux support and it is tagged as Steam Deck Playable by Valve.</p>
<p>Going by what they said in <a href="https://albiononline.com/news/albion-player-record" target="_blank">early April</a> after launching a new Eastern server, they're still breaking their own records for players with over 300,000 active users. Just going by Steam alone, there they regularly have over 20,000 people playing at the same time every day so it's quite popular!</p>

      <title>Roots of Pacha removed from Steam after fight with publisher Crytivo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems the indie team at Soda Den are having some issues with their publisher Crytivo, and their fight has caused Roots of Pacha to be removed from Steam for now.</p>
<p>What is the game? "Be a part of a thriving Stone Age community. Join friends in this farming and life simulation game set in the early days of civilization. Discover “Ideas,” domesticate crops, befriend animals, and contribute to the growth of your village." — it's basically a Stone Age version of Stardew Valley and it was reviewing very well too.</p>
<p>Now though, they're going to be losing out on likely a fair few purchases, since the Steam page has been hidden due to the dispute between Soda Den and Crytivo.</p>
<p>Writing in a statement on <a href="https://twitter.com/rootsofpacha/status/1657485686466039809" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and also on their Steam Forum they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As you may have noticed, the Roots of Pacha Steam page is temporarily offline.</p>
<p>We are sad to report that we have been engaged in a dispute with Crytivo over the rights to Roots of Pacha. We worked hard to amicably resolve our issue with Crytivo internally. Instead of working with us to address the issue, Crytivo went to Valve and authorized them to remove Roots of Pacha from Steam without our knowledge or consent.</p>
<p>While we work out our issues with Crytivo, we’ll continue developing Roots of Pacha with the same energy we’ve always put into it. We couldn’t be any more thankful for the overall reception of the game. We’re currently working on a roadmap and are excited to say it’ll be ready for you next month!</p>
<p>We’re cautiously optimistic that Roots of Pacha will return to Steam very soon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the face of it, this could look like a publisher acting poorly but things are never quite that simple. Especially since we don't know what's been said behind the scenes, and what their publishing contract actually contained. This led to Crytivo putting out their own <a href="https://twitter.com/Crytivo/status/1657531829673508865" target="_blank">statement</a> where they explained that two days after release, Soda Den contacted them to "unilaterally rescind the contract we had worked under for three years, treating it as void".</p>
<p><em>Sounds real messy.</em></p>
<p>This seems like a good time to also mention Soda Den won't be doing Native Linux support, which was part of their <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sodaden/roots-of-pacha/description" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> campaign. Speaking to them on <a href="https://twitter.com/rootsofpacha/status/1654232186126733312" target="_blank">Twitter</a> previously, they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Being a small indie team we've opted to do PC and Mac for now, and we've verified that the game runs well on Steam Deck using Proton, so we're hoping the Linux community can enjoy the game that way for the time being.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Update 15/05/23 - 19:23 UTC</strong>: after publishing this article, the developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1245560/discussions/0/5617721963192270287/" target="_blank">announced</a> a Native Linux build is in testing.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6179034801684147364gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6179034801684147364gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Checking it out on desktop Linux, it works out of the box with Proton 8. I was due to review it for Linux desktop and Steam Deck, since Crytivo approved a Steam key, but it seems like it's going to be best to wait a bit on that.</p>
<p>Even though it's removed on Steam, you can still buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/roots-of-pacha?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>.</p>

      <title>Time running out to swap your Minecraft account over to Microsoft</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mojang recently sent out a rather important reminder, as the time is running out to swap your Mojang account for Minecraft over to Microsoft.</p>
<p>If you don't swap over, you'll lose access to play Minecraft: Java Edition after September 19th 2023. Since I know there's plenty of Minecraft fans reading, figured it might be a good time to prod you towards the switch over to ensure you don't lose access to your game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1950876131684144832gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1950876131684144832gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Minecraft with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/iris-and-sodium-for-minecraft-move-to-modrinth-away-from-curseforge/" target="_blank">Iris and Sodium</a>.</em></p>
<p>So you'll need to switch over <u>before</u> September 19th. Otherwise, you really will lose access so don't delay.</p>
<p>You can find out how to do the move <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/mojang-account-move" target="_blank">over here</a>.</p>

      <title>COSMIC desktop from System76 coming along nicely</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>System76 are busy hacking away on their new upcoming COSMIC desktop environment, and their latest development <a href="https://blog.system76.com/post/may-flowers-spring-cosmic-showers" target="_blank">blog post</a> is looking good. They also recently released System76 Scheduler 2.0, to further optimize the performance of their Linux distribution.</p>
<p>Looks like COSMIC is already quite usable too, with their COSMIC Panels feature that acts like the panels you see in other desktop environments like GNOME and KDE Plasma. These panels have their own applets, they said to think of them like GNOME extensions but they're technically their own applications and run in their own processes. These include things like notifications, workspaces, applications, battery, wifi, bluetooth and so on with plenty more coming.</p>

<p>Rather customizable too so you can make whatever layout you wish. <em>Click the pictures to enlarge.</em></p>
<p>System76 also stated that while COSMIC is intended to be their own flagship experience and the default for a future Pop release, it's designed for everyone. So any other distro could pick it up and customize the layout and experience for their users.</p>
<p>They're also working towards HDR support, 10-bit colour support, building up their settings app which will also be modular to allow anyone to add into it and they're taking great care on accessibility too.</p>
<p>Looking forward to testing the first release when it's ready.</p>

      <title>If You Like… Diablo</title>
      <author>scaine</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There shouldn’t be any arguments when I claim that the original Diablo was a masterpiece. Launched in the 90’s, it defined a new genre of dungeon crawling, successfully mixing traditional Rogue/Nethack elements with beautiful visuals, real-time combat, class selection, an innovative loot system, and haunting music. Let’s look at the series as a whole, and the genre it largely created.</p>
<p><em>IYL will be a short series of articles delving into various genres and looking at the best examples in each. I’ll follow a standard layout. I’ll start with a bit of history about the most famous game representing the genre. Next, I’ll cover a game that’s very similar to the original, then (hopefully!) any games that have surpassed it since, and finally any games that do things in a unique way, but still tipping their hat to the original. Then it’s over to you to tell me how wrong I am, in the comments!</em></p>
<p>There was something very special about the first Diablo. Arriving in 1997, the majority of households didn’t yet have internet connections and those that did were still on 28K or (if they were lucky!) 56K modems. ADSL was rare and fixed connections were pure fantasy. So for a game like Diablo to land with multiplayer baked in was unusual. Perhaps inspired by Doom which was 4 years old by then, Blizzard were targeting the LAN party crowd?</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9396166201684013389gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9396166201684013389gol573.png"/></a></p>
<p>But I experienced it by dialling my ISP and playing with my best mate. It was fabulous. The village of Tristram felt alive as you stocked up on potions and sold your latest loot before delving into the dynamically generated dungeons and caves below the village to level up further. There was, simply, nothing else like it.</p>
<p>And the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnMR6SOBa9k" target="_blank"><u>music</u></a>!</p>
<p>Before we move on, it's worth mentioning that you can still play Diablo 1 today, thanks to the DevilutionX project. Just grab the <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/diablo" target="_blank">original game from GOG</a>, and follow the instructions on the <a href="https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX" target="_blank">project page over on Github</a>.</p>
<p>While the original was a classic, eventually selling a very respectable 2.5 million copies, its sequel which arrived three years later was really just more of the same. Diablo II introduced five new player classes, updated visuals and enemies spread over four distinct Acts. Later expansions added two further classes, but the core gameplay remained virtually unchanged from the original. It was still a huge hit, selling 4 million copies within 18 months, and its lasting appeal saw Battle.Net still reporting 11 million players in 2010!</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2012 and Diablo III would land with several controversies. By then, Activision had bought Blizzard via its parent, Vivendi, and World of Warcraft was Activision Blizzard’s new darling. The focus on its subscription-led cash cow reflected poorly on Diablo as a whole. First, several expansions to Diablo II were delayed or abandoned due to that focus, and of course it had been over a decade since Diablo II first landed. Second, Diablo III arrived with an invasive DRM stipulating that even single player games required an always-on, high-speed internet connection which resulted in players in Europe suffering crippling lag in their single-player games. South Korea had it even worse after the Fair Trade Commission raided Blizzard’s offices there, resulting in Korean players being unable to play at all, despite owning the game.</p>
<p>You’d like to think that Activision Blizzard had therefore learned its lessons when it launched the mobile-focused Diablo Immortal last year, but of course that’s not the case. By now, the firm was famous for all the wrong reasons, whether that’s an appalling culture of development crunch, or 2016’s loot-box-gambling-arena-FPS, Overwatch. So while it was disappointing to see loot boxes in Diablo Immortal, it was hardly surprising. What was surprising was the sheer unbridled greed of how it was implemented. Several streamers ended up spending tens of thousands of their own money to demonstrate the appalling scale of that greed. In one case, YouTuber jtisallbusiness spent over $100K upgrading his character, only to find that the system couldn’t accommodate his power level, and so he wasn’t able to use that character anymore - the matchmaking failed to match him appropriately!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14539309841684013390gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14539309841684013390gol573.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14567533781684013390gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14567533781684013390gol573.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Anyway, Diablo IV is arriving next month and Activision Blizzard have apparently already announced that there will be no loot boxes. However, with the game garnering mixed reviews during its open beta, and criticism of its WoW-inspired visuals, I wonder if it’s only a matter of time before they’re patched back in.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>A direct clone - Path of Exile [</strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/238960/Path_of_Exile/" target="_blank"><u>Steam</u></a><strong>]</strong></h3>
<p>Enough about the fall and fall of Diablo, because it’s October 2013 and there’s a new kid in town. That kid is called Path of Exile and not only is it a game focused on massive scaling and end game content, it’s also completely free. Yes, there’s a shop, and yes, you can spend hundreds of your finest dollars, but unlike Diablo, PoE’s paid content is largely cosmetic. Largely, because some upgrades do allow you to store more loot, but the gist of it is clear - no pay-to-win mechanics here.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7987062961684013532gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7987062961684013532gol573.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Path Of Exile’s character development is boggling, but the core of your power level actually comes from your equipment. Much of PoE’s equipment features a varying level of sockets, each of a distinct colour. Gem drops of each colour bring differing effects or power scaling and can be “socketed” into your equipment to buff its skills, effects, or power level.</p>
<p>This means that even two otherwise identically levelled characters of the same class will often feature wildly differing utility and damage output, based on the capabilities they’ve chosen in their development tree, equipment, and socketed gems.</p>
<p>Another always-online game, PoE features various Hub areas which are also MMO-based. There, you can chat to others, trade with them, or even challenge them to a duel for some instant PvP action. That last is entirely optional however - I’ve never been challenged in the game, nor challenged anyone myself. PvE all the way for me! You can also party-up in these Hubs before attempting your next mission.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16346684661684013533gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16346684661684013533gol573.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Path Of Exile has had a rocky life on Linux with pre-Proton wine builds being a bit hit or miss. Early Proton was sometimes shaky too. I’m happy to report that more recently, it’s absolutely flawless, as my 70 hours or so will attest.</p>
<p>My only gripe with PoE is that I’ve played Grim Dawn and as a result, the action is just a bit too zoomed in for my liking. This is a gripe also being aimed at Diablo 4 in its public alpha too - it can be sometimes frustrating to have an enemy off-screen firing at you, or worse, killing something off-screen with a long-range attack and never even seeing what it was!</p>
<p>I hate to say it, but Grim Dawn ruins quite a few other games in this genre simply through its excellence. Speaking of Grim Dawn…</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Games that do it better - Grim Dawn [</strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/219990/Grim_Dawn/" target="_blank"><strong><u>Steam</u></strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/grim_dawn" target="_blank"><strong><u>GOG</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></h3>
<p>I might have 70 hours in PoE, but I have nearly ten times that number in Grim Dawn. It’s one of my most played games, and there’s a reason for that. Several actually: lengthy, grim-fantasy story which really engages without getting in the way of the action, stunning full-3D graphics that can be rotated and zoomed to your exact specification, atmospheric music and sound design and a character system that is incredibly flexible, yet wonderfully balanced. Throw in tonnes of content, two superb DLC campaigns, an intuitive fast travel system, heaps of secrets and several end-game loot mechanics and you can see why this is often acclaimed as the king of the ARPG.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13404476441684014244gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13404476441684014244gol573.png"/></a></p>
<p>One thing to get out of the way right from the start - the maps in Grim Dawn and its many, many secrets are <em>not</em> dynamically generated. They benefit, therefore, from being beautiful and well designed. The drawback of course is that once you know the levels and secrets… you know them. They won’t change. There is some minor randomisation - some levels will close routes off to force you around a different way, or a dungeon is spawned in a different location - but the map itself hasn’t changed, just the obstacles on the map.</p>
<p>But you probably won’t mind until thousands of hours in - there’s just so much of it all. The content feels never ending. And then there’s two equally gigantic DLC expansions!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12504401641684014246gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12504401641684014246gol573.png"/></a></p>
<p>Then there’s the character customisation. Each of six classes (and a further 3 in the two DLCs) has its own tree of skills and effects. Each level grants points to distribute on the tree, either to grow along the bottom, reaching new abilities, or power up existing abilities you’ve already reached and unlocked. There are also three core character attributes to level up. Then there’s the gear, and the associated “socketing” of said gear with a massive array of gems which grant new effects and capabilities.</p>
<p>And then, when you hit level 10, about 20-30 minutes into the game… multi-class options become available. Yep, choose a second class to start progressing along with your first chosen class. This gives so many opportunities for synergies, it’s mind-boggling (in a good way). Starting as a Soldier, then multi-classed to Arcanist? Well done, now you’re a Battlemage. Strength AND magic? Yes please!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13479496311684014248gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13479496311684014248gol573.png"/></a></p>
<p>You want more customisation? Okay, how about an entire tree of constellations which you unlock by earning points for cleansing altars spread throughout the world (some of which are cleverly hidden). Unlock the whole constellation for bonus effects, or entirely new abilities. There are 82 of these, allowing for further synergies and strategy building.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12389684531684014247gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12389684531684014247gol573.png"/></a></p>
<p>Quality of life? Grim Dawn has it in spades. Nearly every screen can be opened independently of one another, map overlays, shift-clicking, view rotation, zooming, loot filtering, loot highlighting. Nearly every interface can be searched by keywords, or reorganised with the click of a button. The game just gets out of your way as much as possible to let you zone into the action.</p>
<p>How about crafting? Hundreds of blueprints across all power levels are available, and once learned, you just need those precious materials. Some of these materials will have you re-visiting certain areas to grind for what you need, but if crafting and grinding for materials isn’t your bag, there are plenty of alternative ways to earn powerful loot, such as the Crucible (DLC - 100 waves of monsters in an arena, with increasing rewards every 10 levels), or the Shattered Realm (DLC - a race to defeat a set number of monsters before the next realm closes, forcing you to return to base with whatever you looted on the way). These risk vs reward game modes are brilliant fun, and a welcome break from the campaign missions.</p>
<p>I’ll stop there, but given the core game is frequently under £5 and the bundle of the game plus all three DLC is frequently under £20, this game is absolute steal for the value it offers. If you like Diablo, this is what you should be playing.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Something a little different: Last Epoch [</strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/899770/Last_Epoch/" target="_blank"><strong><u>Steam</u></strong></a><strong>]</strong></h3>
<p>I’ll keep this one short, because although it is different, it’s not <em>that</em> much different. Last Epoch takes a little bit of Diablo (the core genre), a little bit of Path of Exile (gear-focused builds) and a little bit of Grim Dawn (designed levels, beautiful 3D environments) and throws in a couple of interesting mechanics.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6955946811684015267gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6955946811684015267gol573.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>First, time travel! Each map has five or six “eras” or epochs that you can travel between as the story opens up. One great example of this (minor spoiler warning) sees you turned away from the locked door of a late era temple because you don’t have an imperial insignia. But by then, you’ve unlocked that era and can rift-gate to the earlier period, find an insignia then travel forwards in time to advance into the temple. It’s nicely done, and seeing the various cities and architecture change throughout the eras is fascinating.</p>
<p>Second, while there are five classes and a set number of skills, Last Epoch’s customisation comes from what they call skill specialisation. You choose which subset of skills you will specialise in, and doing so will grant points in a skill tree unique to that skill. Like the fireball? Specialise in it and you can advance in various ways - make it penetrate, give it larger explosion, fire three or even more at once, rapid fire them, or even turn it into a short-range flamethrower. How you choose your specialisation will determine how you play the game and the flexibility is very satisfying.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8555545991684015268gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/8555545991684015268gol573.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7026654291684015269gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7026654291684015269gol573.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Loot specialisation is interesting too, with an always-available forge option, which allows you to add a variety of special effects to your gear, even mid-combat, which I definitely don’t recommend!</p>
<p>Last Epoch recently added multiplayer to what was previously a single-player experience and there are some rough edges as a result, but if you’re looking for something a little different, it’s definitely worth checking out.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>And the rest</strong></h3>
<p><em>Wolcen [</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/424370/Wolcen_Lords_of_Mayhem/" target="_blank"><em><u>Steam</u></em></a><em>]</em></p>
<p>Quite a slick looking ARPG with a nice story. Sadly, also quite a few bugs, particularly inventory slots suddenly becoming unavailable, stash not working, or gear not equipping. Some of the cut scenes are embarrassingly over-sexualised, but voice acting isn’t bad. This could have been a great ARPG, but there’s a general lack of inspiration overall - linear maps, no real quality of life in the interface, far less loot in general. One to consider when it’s on sale, perhaps. Note: was on GOG once upon a time, but <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general/removal_of_wolcen_lords_of_mayhem/page1" target="_blank"><u>was removed</u></a>.</p>
<p><em>TitanQuest [</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/475150/Titan_Quest_Anniversary_Edition/" target="_blank"><em><u>Steam</u></em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/titan_quest_anniversary_edition" target="_blank"><em><u>GOG</u></em></a><em>]</em></p>
<p>Can’t speak to this one, as I haven’t played it, but the Anniversary Edition gets good reviews on Steam, despite the visuals showing their age <s>(despite only being a year older than Grim Dawn!)</s>. <em>EDIT: I've had a few folk point out that the original game was actually released in 2006 - it was the Anniversary Edition that came out in 2016, so for a game well over 15 years old, it's actually looking pretty good!</em></p>
<p><em>Victor Vran [</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/345180/Victor_Vran_ARPG/" target="_blank"><em><u>Steam</u></em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/victor_vran" target="_blank"><em><u>GOG</u></em></a><em>]</em></p>
<p>A strong contender for “Something a little different”, because Victor Vran is more action than RPG. There’s no character progression as such, control is via gamepad, and customisation comes from whichever weapon you favour, and a series of “destiny cards” which grant a variety of buffs to help combat. Great graphics, satisfying (if occasionally grindy) combat and good voice acting, it’s definitely worth checking out.</p>
<p><em>Torchlight series [</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/200710/Torchlight_II/" target="_blank"><em><u>Steam</u></em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/torchlight_ii" target="_blank"><em><u>GOG</u></em></a><em>]</em></p>
<p>It’s been a while since I played the first two, and I haven’t tried the third which gets poor reviews, nor the “Infinite” game that launched a few days ago. The first two games are definitely worth your time, however, although I did eventually become overwhelmed by the sheer amount of gear the game throws on the ground as you chew through the enemies. In fact, the devs introduced a mechanic whereby your pet will collect loot and return to town to sell it while you continue to accrue a never ending stream of gear!</p>
<p><em>Gatewalkers [</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1125710/Gatewalkers/" target="_blank"><em><u>Steam</u></em></a><em>]</em></p>
<p>Launched at the start of the year, this showed promise, but was cut down by reviewers when it turned out there was no mouse-movement option. That option was quickly added, but the damage was done, and now it’s hard to know if this is worth a look. It’s still on my wishlist and I’ll give it a try someday, no doubt.</p>
<p><em>Albion Online [</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/761890/Albion_Online/" target="_blank"><em><u>Steam</u></em></a><em>]</em></p>
<p>A diablo-like? Well, kind of. I thought I’d mention it due to the isometric view, character movement and fighting mechanics, which are indeed quite diablo-like. But as an MMO, this is much more focused on gathering, crafting and guilds, so feel free to give this a pass if that’s not your bag.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And that’s it for this genre! Feel free to educate me on what I’ve missed in the comments. This is one of my favourite genres, so all suggestions are welcome!</p>

      <title>Reus 2 announced letting you shape humanity again</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Abbey Games are back and they're making a sequel to Reus, their god game from 2013 where you play as giant beings in control of shaping planets in Reus 2. This time they're being published by Firesquid Games.</p>
<p>"As humanity evolves, learns, and reaches for the stars, it will be entirely up to you to help them uncover both the best and worst of their destinies. Choose to foster and shape human aspirations by helping them achieve their goals or pave a more difficult road. Don’t like what you’ve built or being threatened by an angry, nuclear-armed population? You can always start a new humanity." — Abbey Games</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="RreWiz8gy4g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/27df13644d54574ccb2efefda5ec8dc5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/RreWiz8gy4g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Control Giants:</strong> Step into the shoes of powerful giants as they shape planets. Foster or punish the development of human societies. The choice is yours.</li>
<li><strong>Experiment with Natural Resources:</strong> Using different combinations of flora and fauna makes for new discoveries which will change the human societies that inhabit that world.</li>
<li><strong>Observe and Define Your Own Goals: </strong>Shape the development of humanity and watch as their societies evolve from a primitive tribes into advanced civilizations. Whether they are obsessed space explorers or self-destructive warmongers, who are you to judge their choices?</li>
<li><strong>Leave a Lasting Legacy: </strong>Each playthrough leaves a lasting legacy in the stars - and inspires new paths to take.</li>
</ul>
<p>In regards to Linux desktop and Steam Deck support, I spoke with the developer and they said this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're actively seeking to support Steamdeck, since the game would be perfect for it! We're also always looking to support general Linux to the best of our abilities, but since we have no native Linux users, it's always hard to make promises there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1875060/Reus_2/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Nintendo Switch emulator yuzu gets a huge performance boost</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Emulation coding is tricky business done by some people that are clearly 100x smarter than I am, and now the Nintendo Switch emulator yuzu devs are just showing off.</p>
<p>In their <a href="https://yuzu-emu.org/entry/yuzu-progress-report-apr-2023/" target="_blank">April 2023 progress report</a>, they talked about a big performance improvement landing thanks to a rewrite of most of their old buffer cache code, plus work in other areas. The result is that you could see up to 87% better performance, although they said for most people it will probably be about 50%.</p>
<p>Just look at these differences (click to enlarge):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13408787661683900749gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13408787661683900749gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16967125741683900750gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16967125741683900750gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>They said nothing special is needed to get this boost, you just need to be up to date and set GPU accuracy to "Normal".</p>
<p>Plenty more was mentioned like asynchronous presentation with Vulkan, which is behind a tickbox, because in some cases it might make frametimes less consistent but for a lot of people it might actually make things smoother. It needs more testing for them to be sure where to enable it.</p>
<p>The Linux side of yuzu got some nice improvements too like fixing up the initialization of the Vulkan swapchain on Wayland, making it work better for NVIDIA GPU owners and also a crash with Flatpak was solved too.</p>

      <title>ChimeraOS 42, the Linux distro for handhelds and consoles v42 is out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to get Linux onto your handheld PC or your living room PC console? <a href="https://chimeraos.org/" target="_blank">ChimeraOS</a> is probably what you're going to want and version 42 has just been released. Since Valve haven't yet released SteamOS 3 currently used on the Steam Deck for everyone, this is probably the next best thing.</p>
<p>It comes with Linux kernel version 6.1.27, Mesa 23.0.2 patched for Intel ANV + Gamescope compatibility and NVIDIA 530.41.03.</p>
<p>For device support, there's plenty of improvements to be found like: support for the GPD WIN 4 with controller, it adds support for the AYANEO 2's TDP controls and launching their Chimera App directly for managing lots of different things like GOG and Epic Games, support for managing the LED's on the AYANEO AIR, AIR Pro, 2, and GEEK devices <em>and</em> there's also fan control support for the AYANEO2 and AYANEO Geek.</p>
<p>They also have a new OpenGamepadUI display session option, which gives their own special custom UI (since the default is the new Steam Big Picture). This is "early Alpha" stuff but it sounds quite interesting as a multi-library launcher system with plugin support.</p>
<p>All changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Removed Old Big Picture Mode session and steamos-compositor-plus. It served us well. <em>Valeo.</em></li>
<li>Formatting and mounting of all secondary storage devices has been fixed. For real this time.</li>
<li>Improved the usability and aesthetics of the disk management utility in the chimera app</li>
<li>Added controller support for GPD Win4. (HandyGCCS)</li>
<li>The Chimera App can now be launched locally on the AYANEO 2 using the LC button. (HandyGCCS)</li>
<li>The Chimera App now has built-in TDP controls for AYANEO 2</li>
<li>The Chimera App can now be launched locally from the desktop</li>
<li>The Chimera App now shows app/game titles on the Flathub, GOG, and Epic Games Store pages for easy searchability</li>
<li>Fixed the ChimeraOS boot splash screen</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the bootloader generator that failed to pickup additional kernel options</li>
<li>Fixed a race condition with suspend that could cause a device to immediately re-suspend after wake. (HandyGCCS)</li>
<li>Fixed a bug on AYANEO 2 and AYANEO Geek devices that could cause duplicate key-presses. (HandyGCCS)</li>
<li>Fixed some issues with button mapping in RetroArch emulators for devices managed by HandyGCCS.</li>
<li>Updated the device-quirks script for the AOKZOE A1 for systemd-boot. See the <a href="https://github.com/ChimeraOS/chimeraos/wiki/Device-Specific-Configurations#aokzoe-a1" target="_blank">guide</a> on usage.</li>
<li>Added two experimental sessions for OpenGamepadUI. These sessions should be considered alpha software and are included for testing purposes only. They are not currently recommended for "daily driving".</li>
<li>Added the AYALED service for control of LED's on AYANEO AIR, AIR Pro, 2, and GEEK devices. See the <a href="https://github.com/ChimeraOS/chimeraos/wiki/Device-Specific-Configurations" target="_blank">guide</a> for usage.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Mangohud would display in the center of the screen for left-rotated displays.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Mangohud would not display the overlay correctly with systems with multiple CPU cores/threads.</li>
<li>Switched from sudo to polkit for brightness control.</li>
<li>Added the pikaur AUR helper for simpler troubleshooting and development usage. The filesystem must be unlocked in order to use pikaur and it is not recommended for general usage in ChimeraOS.</li>
<li>Exposed fan control support for AYANEO2 and AYANEO Geek in sysfs via the oxp-sensors-dkms driver.</li>
<li>Added <code class="inline-code">export-gpu</code> CLI utility to manage Multi-GPU systems (Useful for Nvidia systems paired with a CPU with an iGPU). See the <a href="https://github.com/ChimeraOS/chimeraos/wiki/General-Configuration#multi-gpu-management-utility-egpu-and-igpu--dedicated-gpu-configurations" target="_blank">guide</a> for usage.</li>

      <title>NVIDIA open sources more of RTX Remix with v0.2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA has released version 0.2 of RTX Remix today, which on top of lots of improvements also opens up their NVIDIA RTX Remix Bridge.</p>
<p>What is it? A modding platform that allows people to make "RTX remasters" of various older games enhancing them with Ray Tracing and DLSS. It does this with thanks to the DXVK translation layer, which NVIDIA now have their own fork of just for this. This is the same tech NVIDIA used for Portal with RTX.</p>
<p>As of the 0.2 release they've now also open source the Remix Runtime Bridge, from the <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/bridge-remix/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The NVIDIA RTX Remix project allows bringing high quality pathtraced rendering, lighting, shadows etc. into classic games. This repo contains the NVIDIA RTX Remix Bridge client and server components required for enabling a 32-bit game to interact with the 64-bit Remix Runtime dll.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So eventually we might see a whole bunch of mods for older DirectX 8 and 9 games, to give them fancy new rendering features. Although, NVIDIA do say on their roadmap they eventually plan to support OpenGL games as well. They should all be easy enough to get running on Linux, since Remix ends up with Vulkan thanks to their use of DXVK.</p>
<p>All the changes from the 0.2 release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The Remix Runtime Bridge is now open source on GitHub! You can find the repo <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/bridge-remix" target="_blank">here</a>!</li>
<li>Many Bridge improvements have gone into this release to address various game compatibility issues:
<ul>
<li>Fixed issues with shader parser logic that helps with Shader Model 2+ games.</li>
<li>Fixed surface data pitch issue that was leading to crashes in some games.</li>
<li>Added support for games that change the main window handle on <code class="inline-code">Reset()</code>.</li>
<li>Allow <code class="inline-code">null</code> vertex declaration on server to fix unnecessary failures in some situations.</li>
<li>Properly initialize render state according to the official DirectX9 documentation to fix geometry corruption in some games.</li>
<li>Handle <code class="inline-code">CreateTextureXXX()</code> calls with <code class="inline-code">levels = 0</code> to fix geometry corruption in some games.</li>
<li>Fixed mouse input processing for games where the mouse pointer would not move in the game or with the Remix menu opened, and added other DirectInput fixes for games using different exclusive modes. Also added optional input message pump hook that is needed for some games.</li>
<li>Better matching of the native D3D9 behavior when dealing with shaders and swapchain initialization.</li>
<li>Added more input validation on client and server side – the server is now properly returning failure codes to the client where failure is allowable.</li>
<li>Added DPI awareness to the bridge client so that the game window gets scaled and mouse input is handled properly on displays with higher than 100% DPI.</li>
<li>Optimized how the <code class="inline-code">SharedHeap</code> works to reduce crashes at launch and require less finetuning of its settings. Since the <code class="inline-code">SharedHeap</code> can still lead to issues in certain games we switched it to be turned off by default, but it can be enabled in <code class="inline-code">bridge.conf</code> with the <code class="inline-code">useSharedHeap</code> setting.</li>
<li>Added forced window client option <code class="inline-code">client.forceWindowed</code> to <code class="inline-code">bridge.conf</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DXVK-Remix improvements and game compatibility fixes:
<ul>
<li>Improvements to culling issues–Remix now includes an initial set of heuristics to work around engine-side culling.</li>
<li>Improved handling of alpha-tested geometry that uses fractional ("feathered") alpha.</li>
<li>Improved detection of shadow volumes.</li>
<li>Support for capturing normals in vertex capture path.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improvements to RTX Remix menus and documentation: expanded and clarified the existing documentation, and added tooltips in the UI to make it more accessible.</li>
<li>Debug symbols for the release are now available in a separate <code class="inline-code">remix-0.2.0-symbols.zip</code> package to make debugging the source code from the compiled binaries easier.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Mechabellum is an auto-battling Supreme Commander - I&#39;m completely hooked</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mechabellum is a new Early Access release from Game River and Paradox Arc (the publishing arm of Paradox Interactive). It's an auto-battler like say Dota Underlords and Auto Chess, but with big mech units with battles like Supreme Commander.</p>
<p>Safe to say, it is absolutely my sort of thing. Quick games, lots of explosions and plenty of strategy. So TriplePoint PR sent over a key and I've been playing it to see if this may be the next big thing. Working out of the box on desktop Linux with Proton 8.0-2, this is absolutely going to be my next multiple-hundred hour game. I can already feel it's teeth sinking into my brain as I just want to play one more game constantly.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4Rj3sgSQLdU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1a852bb365d0e49a5397cb237e89e309.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4Rj3sgSQLdU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>After blasting through a few of the solo tutorials to get me started, I quickly jumped into online games doing 1v1 battles and honestly, I was impressed with it very quickly. It takes the basic idea of an auto-battler, but just makes it so much more entertaining than any that came before. Who doesn't love lots of explosions, lasers and missiles firing everywhere while you sit back and watch the fireworks hoping your idea will work for this round?</p>
<p><em>I don't want to put it down. I might even have to cancel my dinner plans tonight, I need to play more.</em></p>
<p>I'm not very good at it yet mind you, I've been repeatedly stomped into the ground by everyone having much better ideas on what units to unlock and deploy each round but I'm having fun and that's the main thing. It really does look quite a bit like the classic RTS Supreme Commander, but on a much smaller scale with games that aren't hours long. Exactly what I want right now.</p>
<p>You have a really great mixture of units to deploy to from tiny nuisances, which are great to pull the attention from bigger enemies, to massive mechs and everything in between. Everything has a strength and weakness, although there are some balancing issues the developer needs to sort. Starting off by picking your commander to get your first units and bonuses, it's then a tug of war each round as you pick a new unit to unlock, deploy up to 2 additional units and then position them. Plus, you get to sprinkle in some especial abilities like a bombing run, sneaky units you can place behind enemy lines and even big storms to really screw with your opponent.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7429491881683893492gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7429491881683893492gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The idea is just to destroy all the enemy units, or as many as you can until the 60 second round timer ends. How many units you have left will be how much health you take away from your opponent, so you want as many as possible left. Once your opponent or you reach zero health, it's then game over. Taking down one or both of the enemy towers is a safe bet, if you can get there, as it then gives a momentary slowdown to enemy units and that can be quite devastating but they get put back each round.</p>
<p>At the start of each round you get to upgrade units to give them an overall buff, plus give them additional upgrade which affects other similar units. You also have your two towers, which also have upgrades available on each, to buff up all your units. Everything you do has a cost though, with the game having a single resource for everything so it means you really have to think between new units and what to upgrade.</p>
<p>Since it's an auto-battler, one you've finished deploying and upgrading, it's down to the AI to hopefully crush the other side and it's quite <em>epic </em>to watch.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4543147071683893914gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4543147071683893914gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Rarely does a brand new release get such intense excitement from me, I only hope the community sticks around for it to give it a longer life than other auto-battlers. It has all the makings of a great game. I'm off to go play some more now.</p>
<p><em>Early Access is planned to last around 12 months.</em></p>
<p>You can buy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/669330/Mechabellum/" target="_blank">Mechabellum on Steam</a> but it will be eventually free to play.</p>

      <title>DXVK 2.2 released supporting D3D11On12, plus improvements for game launchers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>DXVK translates Direct3D 9 / 10 and 11 into Vulkan for Proton and Wine, used on Linux desktop and Steam Deck for gaming. The new DXVK 2.2 release sounds like quite a big one, and just shows how awesome open source is. Once it's ready and in a new Proton release, we should see another nice little bump in game compatibility.</p>
<p>The first big one is support for D3D11On12, Microsoft's own layer "which maps graphics commands from D3D11 to D3D12". DXVK does this with the help of VKD3D-Proton (the Direct3D 12 to Vulkan translation layer) and is required for D3D12 support in recent Unity Engine titles such as Lego Builder's Journey according to the DXVK team. To test that right now you need a recent build of VKD3D-Proton.</p>
<p>Another nice addition is support for D3D9 Partial Presentation, which should improve compatibility with various game launchers, "particularly those based on Microsoft's WPF toolkit, and some visual novels". The downside is that it has a noticeable "performance hit".</p>
<p>There's also some specific game fixes for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jade Empire.</li>
<li>Sid Meier's Pirates.</li>
<li>Total War: Shogun 2.</li>
<li>Battle Fantasia Revised Edition.</li>
<li>Cold Fear.</li>
<li>Dawn of Magic 2.</li>
<li>DC Universe Online.</li>
<li>Far Cry 2.</li>
<li>Halo: The Master Chief Collection.</li>
<li>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus these other fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recent RE Engine games performance fixes.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue wherein threads were not properly destroyed.</li>
<li>Fixed Vulkan validation errors caused by incorrect layout tracking when enabling feedback loops for a texture.</li>
<li>Fixed Vulkan validation errors caused by 0x0 sized clears in D3D9.</li>
<li>Improved usage of some VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state3 features to avoid hitting slow paths on some drivers.</li>
<li>Significantly reduced memory usage in situations where games create unused D3D11 devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changelog can be <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v2.2" target="_blank">seen here</a>.</p>
<p>No doubt an upcoming Proton Experimental release will include it, as always I'll let you know when that happens.</p>

      <title>World Turtles is a city-builder on the back of a space turtle out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>City-builders come in all shapes and sizes and now you can build on the back of a massive turtle flying through space in World Turtles.</p>
<p>Now in Early Access released on May 1st, it's certainly an interesting idea, and reminds me on the basic idea found in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/the-wandering-village-gets-gamepad-and-steam-deck-support/" target="_blank">The Wandering Village</a> which I very much loved. While you're dealing with building up your city, you're also dealing with the fact that you're in space and your turtle friend might go into some dangerous areas. Check out the launch trailer:</p>

<p>The developer said they expect Early Access to last at least 1 year, possibly longer depending on feedback and just how much they decide to add into the game.</p>
<p>Right now it has the basic core mechanics of resources gathering, climate issues, research, health, terrain interaction and so on. Plus different characteristics of space but it all needs to be fleshed-out with more of everything and just making your decisions have more impact to the overall journey. Some of what they plan to add includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Populating more of the existing game systems and mechanics, especially the interaction of the Turtle and the Meeps with Space. A part of this lies in the already kicked-off Space Resources that are obtained through various interactions with Space.</li>
<li>Adding a Culture / Art mechanic similar to the current Research mechanic, where different building types can contribute to industry-specific progress.</li>
<li>Expanding the random map generator and map builder to include more variety and randomness that actually change the way a map plays out.</li>
<li>Expanding into higher tier buildings, moving into the services industry rather than raw resource gathering.</li>
<li>Adding more focused challenges with a variety of clearly defined goals. Also, mini-challenges with certain risks and rewards will liven up normal free-play games.</li>
<li>Eventually, making a map editor with ever-increasing functionality available to players. I already use a crude editor for development.</li>
<li>Possibly adding a Campaign - this requires game mechanics, systems and behind the scenes data structures to be largely settled.</li>
<li>I would love to eventually add some multiplayer / Co-op functionality so players could interact with each other's worlds, but that's a while away...</li>
</ul>
