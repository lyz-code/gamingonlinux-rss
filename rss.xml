      <title>Lucky Tower Ultimate is an absurdly funny dungeon crawler you need to play</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lucky Tower Ultimate from Studio Seufz is probably one of the funniest real-time dungeon crawlers I've ever played and I can't wait to play more. Developed by Studio Seufz, who some might recognise from their previous game <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/03/the-longing-is-out-today-so-you-can-begin-your-own-400-day-adventure/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Longing</a> (which I also really liked).<em> Note: key provided by Evolve PR.</em></p>
<p>Older readers might recognise the name Lucky Tower too, since it was a series of Flash games from quite a few years ago. Lucky Tower Ultimate is the third in the series, updated for new audiences and given a modern rogue-lite taste, you don't need to know anything about it to play this though it's completely standalone.</p>
<p>Here's the thing — some dungeon crawlers can be thoroughly frustrating to play. I end up getting annoyed, cursing at the screen and not in a fun way and so just stop playing and give up on them. Not the case here though thanks to the totally ridiculous slapstick comedy of Lucky Tower Ultimate. Each death was either a belly laugh or a rather silly surprise. It captured my attention instantly, and I haven't wanted to put it down and I still don't want to.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13530955131730828395gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13530955131730828395gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>The idea here is that one night while having a drink at the local tavern, you go to use the <em>facilities</em> and you're suddenly teleported into a strange tower with nothing but your underwear. The <em>top</em> of the tower too, not the bottom, so you have to work your way down as you go through various doors. With some truly comical moments, backed up by some nice voice acting, it's certainly an experience you won't forget. Part of what makes it funny, is that you can pick up pretty much all items to use as weapons — including creatures and people.</p>
<p><em>I'm just going to give you a small slice of what to expect from it…</em></p>
<p>In my first run, I came across an old lady wandering around. After a little chat, I accidentally picked her up and shook her about for some loot. Obviously she was unhappy about this and slapped me dead. Well, that was a short run for my first go. On my second run I opened a door and walked into a room that was entirely full of barrels of dynamite with lit fuses, and then the entire tower blew up. Taking a second look inside "just to be sure" wasn't my best idea. You can see where this is going right? This game is the story of how you will die a thousand different ways.</p>
<p>At times a creepy wizard will appear and offer you items for free. Like potions! Who doesn't love a fancy potion! I decided to drink it, for science, and — dead again. The very next run they promptly appeared in front of me again, and dropped a hammer for me, so perhaps I can trust them? That is a helpful item indeed to smash some goblins with.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19582950261730826955gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19582950261730826955gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Run number…oh I don't know I've lost count, I found the old lady again. This time she was trapped in a cage, so I freed her and it turns out her name is Alva and she can give you potions. Hooray! Off we go into another room where a creature was sat at a table with three pots. They offered me a bet: pick the right pot that has a tooth under it after they spin them around and win a prize, lose and forfeit a wager. I clearly wasn’t paying attention as my wager was supposed to be placed on a button behind me…right where Alva was stood. I lost and Alva got turned into food. Stupid creature <em>cheated</em> though! I picked right at least once and they said they weren’t paying attention so spun the pots again. Annoyed, I hit them with a hammer and they punched the life out of me. <em>That's another run over.</em></p>
<p>One run lasted all of about 30 seconds. As I walked into a room that <em>seemed</em> safe, so I took a hand off my controller for a few seconds to grab a drink next to me and the floor opened up and goodbye hero — dammit!</p>
<p>Every time I think I'm doing well, and that I'm safe, the tower has other ideas. Hear some screaming getting louder? Well, standing around to find out wasn't my brightest idea as this thing below smashed through the wall and promptly smashed <em>me</em> with a rather large hammer.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14516132261730826763gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14516132261730826763gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Okay. Next time I will beat it for sure, I say to myself.</p>
<p>I walk into a room and there's a creature asleep on a chair. Near the creature is a horn on the floor, obviously I didn't see it so I stepped on it creating a <em>honk</em> and the creature cheekily opens one eye to take a little look. So I back off, wait for them to sleep again and try to creep past…but they wake up and quickly scoop me up into their mouth. I became lunch. Run over. Ouch.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1929342951730826651gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1929342951730826651gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>What makes it great is that it really is mechanically simple. From movement to combat, it's all very basic. It's the silliness of it, and all the different encounters and traps that make it worth playing through. The design is just fantastic.</p>
<p>I could go on for quite some time about how stupidly I died, and how each death made me want to just play more. But I'll leave you with that small slice for now. Lucky Tower Ultimate is all about expecting the unexpected, and then probably dying in some really silly way. Truly fun.</p>
<p>Since it's in Early Access these are just my initial thoughts on it, and I'll be playing a whole lot more right up until release where I'll be covering it again no doubt. The developer has announced a big content update is due out <em>today</em> (Nov 5th) too, so that's my late evening and probably into the early hours entirely written-off to play and discover more.</p>
<p>It plays <em>beautifully</em> with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/proton-90-3-released-and-proton-experimental-upgraded-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-3</a>, with my time playing it on Steam Deck across a mixture of docking it up to a TV and playing it handheld. Not a single problem encountered, which is why it's a surprise to see it only rated Steam Deck Playable as everything appears to work out of the box.</p>
<p>This is one of the easiest recommendations I've ever done. Go buy it.</p>

      <title>Croc Legend of the Gobbos remaster to release in December</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently we had the news that the classic Croc Legend of the Gobbos was getting a remaster, and then we learned it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/croc-legend-of-the-gobbos-remaster-will-be-a-gog-exclusive/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">would be a GOG exclusive</a>. Now we at least know it will release in December, although they're not giving us an exact date as to when just yet.</p>
<p>More about it: Croc Legend of the Gobbos follows the heartwarming journey of an endearing, humble little crocodile equipped with only his iconic backpack and a wiggly butt as he sets off on his quest to rescue the Gobbos from the clutches of the nefarious Baron Dante and his hordes of Dantinis. Croc must platform his way across a series of unique worlds by running, jumping, climbing, swimming, and tail spinning to save the Gobbos from captivity.</p>
<p>Trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="T2SZtxMF2Jg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fede7814905cacae43f7a28050fd3b36.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/T2SZtxMF2Jg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release: “From the outset, our vision has been to release Croc only when we’re happy with it. We are speed-running towards a December 2024 release and are very close to being complete. However, if we need to add a little more polish, we won’t hesitate to do so. After waiting 27 years, we trust that our dedicated fans can wait a few weeks longer,” said Jez San, Founder of Argonaut Games.</p>
<p>San continued: "The Croc remaster aims to reignite the imaginations of players with its enhanced HD graphics, updated modern controls, and an authentic gameplay experience that will transport players back to the golden age of gaming."</p>
<p>At release it will be $29.99.</p>

<p>Since it won't be on Steam you'll need to use something like the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/heroic-games-launcher-2152-released-fixing-amazon-gog-and-epic-games-issues/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> to run it on Linux desktop and Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Playing with special beans in Bean To Me! is messing with my brain</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Don't judge me on this one, but I've been playing with beans for a while in the new release of Bean To Me! from Melonleaf Industries / Very Evil Demons. Note: key provided to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4218320-GamingOnLinux/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">our Steam Curator</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, beans. Inspired by the ancient game of Mancala, it's all about two players trying to move beans around a simple board with little cups. It's strangely captivating and takes a while to learn properly but the basic idea is simple enough. You're just moving beans from one side of the board to the other, eventually getting them into your big pot to score and it's a race of minds in turn-based strategy to get as many beans as possible before one player runs out and the game is over.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2744000521730808630gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>On the surface it may <em>seem</em> quite simple however it's anything but. And I don't think I've quite gotten the hang of it properly yet, but I'm really enjoying the idea as I've not actually played a game like this before. Mechanically simple at least, you just click a pot that has beans and your hand will gather them all up, moving to the right depositing one bean over each pot as it goes. It doesn't stop on your side though, if you click a pot with many beans your hand will keep going over to your opponent to deposit beans as well.</p>
<p>The key is in the bean placement, as there's ways to steal a whole big lot of beans from your opponent. You can also get an extra go if you plan right, by dropping your last bean in your hand into your big pot to add to your score with no beans going to your opponent's side. Then there's all the special kinds of beans you can unlock to take into battle with you, some might even explode destroying other beans that can really mess with things.</p>
<p>There's quite a lot to think about during each run. And I actually needed to play the tutorial twice to properly get the mechanics. After that, it's a lot of trial and error with all the different types of special beans and before you know it a few hours have vanished like a runner bean.</p>
<p>Playable in single-player, local multiplayer and online too so you can challenge friends. It has Native Linux support and works great.</p>
<p>Really great. A wonderful idea that's simple to get into but surprisingly hard to master and will keep you thinking for hours. Cheap too at £4.29 when not on sale.</p>

      <title>Stardew Valley 1.6.9 released with a new friend to help you find lost items</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Much like Terraria, work never seems to be finished on Stardew Valley, with a brand new update out now with a few new features and surprises. Stardew Valley is probably one of the best casual games out there, really nice to chill with. It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified!</p>
<p>As detailed in the <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-6-9-changelog/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a> here's the main new content and features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If you lost an item that can’t be found again, a <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Secret_Woods#Lost_Items_Shop" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">new friend appears in the secret woods</a> who can get it back (for a price).</li>
<li>You can now put legendary fish in fish ponds. These are limited to one per pond and produce legendary fish roe. Each fish has a unique water color.</li>
<li>You can now place beds and sleep inside any constructed buildings that allow furniture.</li>
<li>Items dropped in water now float for a short time, so you can collect them if you’re quick or have a magnet ring.</li>
<li>Sam and Shane now have work portraits while working at JojaMart.</li>
<li>Slightly tweaked some dialogues.</li>
<li>Added new Easter eggs.</li>
<li>Added <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Multiplayer#Cheat_commands" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">hidden cheat commands</a>. (Only on platforms where a save edit is possible)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20852832921730806162gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>There's plenty more balance changes, quality of life improvements and bug fixes too. The developer also updated SDL from 2.0.x to 2.30.4 that should keep it running nicely, and they also swapped from FAudio to OpenAL which they said should "improve performance when playing audio".</p>
<p>Players using a controller / Steam Deck will also be glad to know there's also some gamepad improvements too like various crashes being fixed and some UI issues.</p>

      <title>Manjaro Linux want your system info with their new data collection tool</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Manjaro Linux team are asking for testers for their new data collection tool called "Manjaro Data Donor", which they plan to have as opt-out and not opt-in.</p>
<p>As expected, they are catching some comments from users not particularly happy about their plan to have it hooked up as something you have to opt out of due to privacy concerns. Telemetry is often a bad word to a lot of people, but the reality is that when done correctly it can be truly essential for projects to know where to focus. </p>
<p>Manjaro developer Roman Gilg said in the <a href="https://forum.manjaro.org/t/testers-needed-manjaro-data-donor/170163" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> that currently they use <a href="https://matomo.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Matomo</a>, which is pinged via the Network Manager but it's unreliable for various reasons. So they created Manjaro Data Donor (MDD) which gives more information and should be more reliable overall, and they actually have full control over it.</p>
<p>Currently they just want Manjaro users to test it and give feedback, but eventually it will be hooked up as a systemd service:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the next few days we’ll do some more testing and if results are positive, I plan on installing it on all Manjaro systems and adding a systemd service to submit the data automatically.</p>
<p>As a reminder: Right now you have to install MDD manually and there is no systemd service yet.</p>
<p>With this systemd service later in place, sending the hardware data with MDD will be opt-out because I believe, if you do opt-in, the data you gather will be so heavily skewed you can just leave it be.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think. I know telemetry is a contentious subject, but we need at least some data about how Manjaro is being used by so many people around the world in order to show that the project has a future and also to plan for that future.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck SteamOS 3.6.20 update released for everyone</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve are acting quickly to clean up some Steam Deck problems from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-deck-steamos-36-officially-out-with-improved-performance-mura-compensation-lots-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the huge SteamOS 3.6 update</a> with a new SteamOS 3.6.20 update released for everyone.</p>
<p>This time it's just a few bits but all pretty nice to see:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the updater could repeatedly revert you to the previous OS version if certain configuration files were user-modified.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with taking multiple screenshots if Game Recording is on.</li>

<p>Are you currently having issues you want to see solved? What are your biggest problems right now?</p>
<p>Mine is a small one but still annoying: when docking to my main 4K TV, the performance overlay is absolutely tiny and unreadable. It's a really odd issue, but I would like to see it solved with some proper scaling of the performance overlay. It happens with every dock I've tried including Valve's official dock, multiple from JSAUX to the recently tested <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/the-benq-becreatus-gr10-usb4-steam-deck-dock-is-simply-great/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BenQ beCreatus GR10</a>.</p>

      <title>The BenQ beCreatus GR10 USB4 Steam Deck Dock is simply great</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While a little on the pricey side, the BenQ beCreatus GR10 USB4 Steam Deck Dock is a worthy addition to your arsenal for both at home and while you're on the go. <em>Disclosure: BenQ sent over the device for review, I did not need to send it back.</em></p>
<p>There's a <em>lot</em> of docks out there now including the official one from Valve, multiple from JSAUX, UGREEN and the list of companies doing them goes on for a while. Valve basically created another little accessory industry here. Most of them are quite similar but BenQ are at least doing something a little <em>different</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4452880041730740182gol1.png"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">It has some nice specifications to begin with including:</p>
<ul>
<li>USB4 Type-C cable for device connection. This comes with a removable 90 degree USB-C adaptor already attached.</li>
<li>USB-C PD charger (input max 100W).</li>
<li>USB-A Connector (10 Gbps, 4.5W charging) x 2.</li>
<li>USB-C Connector (10 Gbps, 7.5W charging) x 1.</li>
<li>2.5 Gigabit Ethernet RJ-45.</li>
<li>HDMI 2.1 (4K 120Hz/8K 60Hz).</li>
</ul>
<p>So with it you get a reasonable amount of ports, that all work great and have a good fit with various connectors. The fun part though? The stand for your devices folds out from it. Making it easy to fold back and pack away for any travels you're doing. A bit of a novelty perhaps, but for anyone who does travel a fair bit, this will make it quite a nice space-saver for docking it wherever you go. The device connection cable also folds away into the device as well keeping it all safe and secure.</p>
<p>Having the device connector with a removable 90 degree USB-C adaptor is a nice touch too, if you're planning to hook it up to other devices when the stand is folded away, doubling it up as a decent USB HUB for other devices too. BenQ say the beCreatus GR10 will be plug and play across iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux devices.</p>
<p>BenQ certainly aren't the first to have a stand that you pull out, I believe JSAUX got there first with their RGB Docking Station, but that's a little flimsy feeling and wobbly as it does not sit flat as there's a gap under it. Not a problem at here, as the designers at BenQ made sure the foldable stand actually folds out flat onto the surface. So it feels a lot sturdier than the competition. The build quality overall is fantastic too. Feels solid and looks nice while staying out of your way — not much more is needed than that.</p>
<p>Other docks I've looked at before had ports that were a bit overly snug when connecting / disconnecting wires, which I'm pleased to say is not a problem here at all. The cuts for the ports are as snug as they should be, but not where it may cause issues.</p>
<p>I've been testing this constantly for about a week and a half now, and I haven't had a single problem with it. While I only have a Steam Deck to test with it, BenQ note it will fit and work well with other handhelds too including the ROG Ally, MSI Claw and the Legion Go thanks to the spacious 21.5mm size of the foldable stand.</p>
<p>You can see their own video on it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mlcIJgcMIyE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6e7010d6b59efe8c5c66dedf6785de78.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mlcIJgcMIyE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The only downsides really are the <em>price</em> and <em>shipping</em>. At $109 it's a bit more than most other docks, and it seems they're only shipping in the USA right now. For the price though you get rather nice specifications and the useful foldable stand that sits nicely. I'll also say personally I think it's a bit <em>silly</em> that BenQ so prominently list 120Hz and 4K for it, despite the Steam Deck not performing well at 4K for really anything. But hey, that's great for other uses!</p>
<p>Overall this is easily one of the nicest docks I've had for review and I've been through quite a few now. For me personally it's going to be my own go-to for when travelling between places, which I actually do a fair bit of recently, so it came at a good time. And it actually works <em>better</em> than Valve's official dock, which I still at times have issues with displaying on my main TV whereas this as it should — just works. You don't get a better recommendation than that right?</p>
<p>This is a premium dock with the price, build quality and ease of use to match with the added bonus of being good for travel. If you have yet to get a dock for your handheld, or you're looking for a <em>better</em> one, the BenQ beCreatus GR10 would be a great purchase that I'll happily recommend.</p>

      <title>Half-Life 3 fan game Project Borealis: Prologue gets a Steam page - due out soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Project Borealis is finally coming to Steam, to give you a taste of what Half-Life 3 or Half-Life 2: Episode 3 could have been. A good time to do so, since we're coming up on the 20th anniversary of Half-Life 2.</p>
<p>Created by a bunch of passionate fans they aim to give you a proper conclusion to Valve's popular FPS series. Built with Unreal Engine 5 they aim to create a faithful recreation of iconic Half-Life 2, although with plenty of upgrades. This is only a Prologue though, which is basically a demo.</p>
<p>I missed it but they did release a teaser trailer back in September:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="dwdjgE74-98"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/59783061bf438aa945bb6652c9d53f88.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/dwdjgE74-98" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Legacy Continues</strong></p>
<p>Inspired by the epic cliffhanger from Half-Life 2: Episode Two, Project Borealis represents a fan-made effort to realize a cohesive story conclusion to the episodic series. This prologue chapter invites players back into the HEV suit of Gordon Freeman, offering a glimpse into the next chapter of his journey.</p>
<p><strong>A Familiar Yet Different World</strong></p>
<p>Step into a Ravenholm transformed by time and the elements. The once-familiar town now lies buried under a blanket of snow, hiding the past and new present dangers beneath its pristine surface. As you navigate through this hauntingly beautiful landscape, you'll encounter some classic enemies reimagined and completely new secrets hidden within.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The developers say it will be a "condensed, standalone game experience showcasing an early look and feel of the upcoming full Project Borealis game" with an original score to accompany it.</p>

      <title>Atari acquires Transport Tycoon from Chris Sawyer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Atari have announced they've now acquired Chris Sawyer's Transport Tycoon, as Atari continue building themselves back up.</p>
<p>This follows on from other acquisitions from Atari including the<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/infogrames-atari-have-acquired-the-surgeon-simulator-franchise/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Surgeon Simulator franchise under Infogrames</a>, the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/atari-acquires-intellivision-brand-and-over-200-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Intellivision brand and over 200 games</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/atari-revives-infogrames-and-acquires-totally-reliable-delivery-service/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Totally Reliable Delivery Service</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/atari-acquires-awesomenauts-swords-soldiers-and-digital-eclipse/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Awesomenauts, Swords &amp; Soldiers and Digital Eclipse</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/atari-are-acquiring-night-dive-studios/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Night Dive Studios</a>.</p>
<p>From the press release: "We are honored that Chris has entrusted us with Transport Tycoon and our team is committed to both honoring and advancing his groundbreaking creation." said Atari Chairman and CEO Wade Rosen.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14930145311730737698gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Transport Tycoon, taken by me.</em></p>
<p>They said they plan to "expand digital and physical distribution, potentially develop new titles or content, and explore brand and merchandising collaborations as part of a long-term plan to preserve and expand this classic sim".</p>
<p>Makes sense for Atari to grab it since they were the publisher for Chris Sawyer's Locomotion too. On top of that Atari also currently control the licensing for RollerCoaster Tycoon as well, although they don't own it as Sawyer still does.</p>
<p>A bit of a colourful history between Sawyer and Atari though, as Sawyer actually sued Atari back in 2005 for unpaid royalties. Atari then counter-sued for damages in 2007, and later it was settled out of court in 2008 with an undisclosed sum paid to Sawyer.</p>
<p>Worth nothing that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/openttd-140-brings-a-scalable-font-a-new-ship-pathfinder-social-platform-integration/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">OpenTTD</a> exists, it's an open source simulation game based upon Transport Tycoon Deluxe, and it's pretty darn popular.</p>

      <title>New release of Raspberry Pi OS brings Wayland to all models with a new compositor</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Raspberry Pi team have released a brand new version of the Raspberry Pi OS that brings with it Wayland support to all models.</p>
<p>As detailed in the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/a-new-release-of-raspberry-pi-os/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they've dropped their Wayland compositor called wayfire, and replaced it with <a href="https://github.com/labwc/labwc" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">labwc</a>, which is based on a <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlroots" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">wlroots</a>. They say this project was a "much better fit for the Raspberry Pi graphics hardware" and when speaking to the developers they found "their future direction very much aligned with our own".</p>
<p>They've been working on it for most of this year in collaboration with the developers of both labwc and wlroots, and now it's reached the point where it runs just as fast as Xorg on older Raspberry Pi models and so the latest released Raspberry Pi OS runs Wayland by default across all models.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some other improvements in this release include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Significantly improved support for using the Desktop with a touch screen.</li>
<li>Better Raspberry Pi Connect integration.</li>
<li>A better and rewritten panel application for the taskbar at the top of the screen.</li>
<li>A new Screen Configuration tool.</li>
</ul>
<p>Seems 2025 will truly be the year of Wayland on Linux with most distributions and desktops now being in pretty good shape with it.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma 6.3 will show when apps are killed due to out of memory (OOM)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Work continues as always on the next version of the popular KDE Plasma desktop environment. My favourite desktop, and the one used for the Steam Deck Desktop Mode.</p>
<p>Developer Nate Graham also recently announced that the This Week in Plasma blog posts have moved to a new home. They're no longer going to be on their personal blog, instead actually on the official KDE blog system as noted in <a href="https://blogs.kde.org/2024/11/02/this-week-in-plasma-spoooooky-ooooooooom-notifications/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the latest post</a>.</p>
<p>One new feature coming for Plasma 6.3 is that you will get nice clear notifications in the case of your system experiencing out of memory (OOM) where the Linux kernel terminated an app. Graham noted there's "now a little service to detect this and show you a system notification explaining what happened, plus suggestions for what you can do about it in the future". This sounds great to have.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5832418511730718961gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Some other improvements noted to be coming include improvements to the Emoji Selector app to have "sub-string matching from the middle of words too, so you can find emojis more easily" due for Plasma 6.2.3. Additionally the grouping indicator for apps on the task manager bar will no longer always be green, and will instead follow your selected accent colour, this is due in Plasma 6.3.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4737823901730719070gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Plus as usual plenty of bug fixes are coming like XWayland-using apps acting weird when resizing them.</p>

      <title>Check out Proton-Sarek if you have an older GPU for Windows games on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve's work with Proton to run Windows games on Linux / Steam Deck is amazing, but they do require you have newer GPUs so some have been a bit left behind. Proton-Sarek aims to fix that.</p>
<p>What is it? A community built version of Proton (like GE-Proton) designed specifically for those of you who have a GPU that doesn't support newer Vulkan, or with no Vulkan support at all but still want all the latest updated from Proton to keep gaming on Linux.</p>
<p>As the developer explains on the GitHub page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because there are still users with GPUs that support Vulkan 1.1+ but not Vulkan 1.3, as well as others with non-Vulkan support. Those who can use DXVK often rely on older Proton versions, which suffer from lower compatibility and performance compared to newer builds. Meanwhile, users dependent on WineD3D frequently face poor gaming experiences. This repository provides patched versions of Proton and/or Proton-GE, offering better performance with DXVK v1.10.3 and WineD3D mainly trough the custom parameter <code class="inline-code">PROTON_TWEAKS</code>, along with other enhancements, ensuring a smoother experience for both Vulkan and non-Vulkan setups.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems like a nice idea for older systems. And much like GE-Proton, there's no support from Valve for this, but it's useful if you need it.</p>
<p>The developer recently released Sarek 9-18 and 9-17 with the base of the project updated to GE-Proton 9-17. On top of that it includes two new options:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">PROTON_VK_SOFTWARE</code>: Uses Lavapipe to enable CPU-based rendering for Vulkan, supporting API version 1.3.</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">PROTON_OGL_SOFTWARE</code>: Uses LLVMpipe to enable CPU-based rendering for OpenGL, supporting API version 4.6.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Linux Mint partners up with Framework, also working on Night Light for Cinnamon desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some fun Linux distro news for you this morning as the Linux Mint team have a fresh <a href="https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=4762" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> up on what they've been doing and it's quite exciting to see.</p>
<p>The first thing is that for the Cinnamon desktop environment they're working on a Night Light feature. Previously they shipped Redshift but now they're working on one that's properly integrated, and plan for it to work with both Wayland and Xorg. On top of that they're also continuing the work to port key Cinnamon dialogs to Clutter.</p>
<p>A fun announcement in the post is that they've begun working with <a href="https://frame.work/gb/en" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Framework</a>, who make the popular modular laptops. According to Mint lead Clement Lefebvre, Framework want "to achieve full compatibility with Linux Mint and the Cinnamon desktop" and their laptops are "packed with components we don’t have or technologies which we hadn’t really focused on yet" so it will "boost new areas of development for us". Lefebvre now has a Framework Laptop and seems to like it quite a lot.</p>

      <title>ASYLUM from Senscape finally has a release date - March 6, 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After the successful crowdfunding for ASYLUM back in 2013, Senscape have been working away on the supernatural horror adventure and the spiritual successor to cult classic Scratches. Now it finally has a release date, so we're going to visit the ASYLUM on March 6th, 2025.</p>
<p>More about it: "ASYLUM is an ambitious and intricate first-person horror adventure casting you into the hallucinatory setting of the Hanwell Mental Institute. Interact with its curious denizens, gather clues, unravel the mystery, and march towards a shocking conclusion."</p>
<p>They even have a fresh trailer to celebrate the release date being announced:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A mind-bending original storyline that we somehow managed to keep secret during 15 years of production.</li>
<li>Between 10 and 15 hours of gameplay — and that's without learning all the dark secrets!</li>
<li>An atmosphere so engrossing you will almost smell the stench of decrepitude and putrefaction around you.</li>
<li>Exciting challenges rewarding your wit and observation.</li>
<li>Memorable soundtrack inspired by 80s horror films and quite a bit of John Carpenter.</li>

      <title>Terraria hits over 60 million sales with Terraria 1.4.5 shaping up to be another big update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest State of the Game developer <a href="https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/terraria-state-of-the-game-october-2024.139253/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> for Terraria gives out some big new sales numbers, and announces a new use for Life Fruit.</p>
<p>Firstly, on the subject of sales, Terraria has now crossed over 60 million (60.7m) with 33 million of those just on PC. Simply amazing, and it continues to be one of the most popular games on Steam as it's pretty much always in the top 100 most played games. It's in the top 100 over the last month and year specifically for Steam Deck too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14487642851730545971gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>As for some announced changes the team revealed the new Jungle Juice, an upgraded healing potion for 180 points of health that can be crafted using Life Fruits in Hardmode. Good for those of you towards the end-game to keep you stocked up during some big battles.</p>
<p>There's a whole lot more coming in Terraria 1.4.5 that's being tracked in a <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Upcoming_features" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Wiki</a> including a Dead Cells crossover, new whips, new furniture sets, music blocks, transformation mounts, new accessories, a new film noir styled shader and a whole lot more.</p>
<p>No date is being given for Terraria 1.4.5 as they're continuing their mantra of "it's ready when it's ready".</p>
<p>Terraria has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Windows to Linux compatibility layer Wine 10.0 planned for mid-January 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lead developer Alexandre Julliard <a href="https://list.winehq.org/mailman3/hyperkitty/list/wine-devel@winehq.org/thread/FVV5ZB7263Q5OIV5U4BUX6XPHF6WOGVT/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> that Wine 10.0 is going to be releasing in mid-January 2025.</p>
<p>There's been a delay to the latest development build though, due to low activity and Julliard is travelling. So Wine 9.21 is instead coming out November 8th (instead of yesterday).</p>
<p>Two weeks after that, Wine 9.22 will be out and then another two weeks later on December 6, the first Release Candidate for Wine 10.0 will be available and mark the annual code freeze where the focus is purely on bugs and not new features.</p>
<p>That freeze will last until the final 10.0 release due "sometime around mid-January".</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Wine 10.0 will have a lot of additions compared to Wine 9.0 like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved Unicode.</li>
<li>Improved Wayland support.</li>
<li>Lots of DirectPlay support upgrades.</li>
<li>A new Media Foundation backend using FFMpeg.</li>
<li>ARM64 support upgrades.</li>
<li>An initial Driver Store implementation.</li>
<li>Expanded support for ODBC Windows drivers.</li>
<li>Support for elevating process privileges.</li>
<li>Better Dvorak keyboard detection.</li>
<li>And much, much more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Eventually then we will see a new <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> version too based on Wine 10 to continue improving Windows gaming on Steam Deck / Linux from Steam.</p>

      <title>Linux hits exactly 2% user share on the October 2024 Steam Survey</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey is out for October 2024, and the Linux user share has gone back up again to exactly 2%.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Overall:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows: 96.61% -0.23%</li>
<li>Linux 2.00% +0.13%</li>
<li>macOS: 1.39% +0.10%</li>
</ul>
<p>Quite likely we're seeing the drop of Windows because the English language share overall went up by 8.09%, with Simplified Chinese dropping by 1%. We generally see the Linux share drop when Simplified Chinese on Steam rises, which it had done for two months in a row. So this seems like things going back to a more normal position.</p>

      <title>Stuck for what to play this weekend? DayZ works really nicely on Linux now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're in need of something to game on Linux this weekend, why not try out the open-world survival game DayZ. The game is also going through a player surge thanks to a new expansion release.</p>
<p>The DayZ Frostline expansion launched October 15, and Bohemia Interactive announced it sold over 300,000 copies of the DLC in the first week. Along with that on October 20th they marked the best day ever with "501,522 total daily active users" and an all-time high on concurrent players "with 79,000 on Steam, 33,000 on PlayStation, and 36,000 on Xbox".</p>
<p>The thing is, I've been trying to play DayZ on and off for a while but always had issues with the launcher. Valve even <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/12/more-battleye-titles-for-proton-on-linux-including-dayz-arma-3-now-supported/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced back in late 2021</a> that DayZ was one of the titles that enabled BattlEye anti-cheat support, ahead of the Steam Deck release. As of the latest DayZ update though? No problems at all getting into the game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1354828141730491948gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1354828141730491948gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15530831761730492841gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15530831761730492841gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - DayZ on Linux, click pics to enlarge</em></p>
<p>Nice to see that some developers appear to have no problem with keeping their anti-cheat enabled for Linux unlike <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/grand-theft-auto-v-gets-battleye-anti-cheat-breaks-online-play-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GTA Online for GTA V</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/ea-respawn-now-block-apex-legends-from-running-on-linux-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Apex Legends</a>.</p>
<p>The only issue I've encountered is that if you leave the game launcher open, you get a weird outline of it on top of the game window. Simply closing the launcher once you're in the game gets rid of it. Other than that on the latest Proton 9.0-3 it seems to work <em>really</em> nicely.</p>
<p>Pretty reasonable performance too on the Extreme graphics preset on 2560x1440 I've been seeing it run swimmingly over 60FPS all of the time in the open-world, and higher when in various buildings. Depends on the area though, some areas give much better performance.</p>
<p>DayZ is also 50% off until November 4th.</p>

<p>While it's not the focus of the Beta testing, they've also pulled in lots of enhancements to their build of the GZDoom game engine that includes a lot improvements to the core gameplay. They said more details on all that will be revealed properly when the Beta is over.</p>
<p>Currently their plan is to properly launch this towards the end of November into the stable version, while work continues on the next story chapters.</p>
<p>To try it on Steam you need to manually opt into the "publicbetabranch" Beta in the game properties.</p>

<p>AMD say they have re-engineered it with the 64MB cache memory now below the processor, putting the core complex die (CCD) closer to your cooler to make the chip run cooler than the previous generation Ryzen 7 7800X3D. As for performance differences AMD are claiming an average of an 8% improvement over the previous generation, and up to 20% faster than an Intel Core Ultra 9 285K.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 9-17 and 9-18 out now with various upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's two new versions of GE-Proton that have been released in the last day, although it's mostly just updating components from upstream to continue to improve Windows games on Linux platforms including Steam Deck.</p>
<p>For GE-Proton 9-17:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Proton:<br/>
-wine updated to latest bleeding edge<br/>
-dxvk updated to latest git<br/>
-vkd3d-proton updated to latest git<br/>
-dxvk-nvapi updated to latest git<br/>
-ICU building + linking imported from upstream<br/>
-misc proton script fixes imported from upstream</p>
<p>Protonfixes:<br/>
-Audio fix for Mini Ninjas (thanks UsernamesAreNotMyThing)<br/>
-Fix typo'd mod support for ES: Oblivion (thanks MaxBosse)<br/>
-Disable esync/fsync in Disgaea 4 to prevent crash (thanks UsernamesAreNotMyThing)</p>
<p>Nothing major here, just a refresh of various parts that need updates from git, mostly to add new video playback fixes from upstream proton.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4763709421730481762gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em></p>
<p>And then GE-Proton 9-18:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hotfix:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add missing proton script python uuid import (which broke prefix creation)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Taken from the <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> releases page.</em></p>
<p>A lot of their work right now is going into Open Wine Components like UMU, the unified launcher for Windows games on Linux, which allows the likes of GE-Proton to run properly outside of Steam for use in tools like Lutris, Heroic, Bottles and other launchers. The creator, Thomas Crider, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/ubuntu-summit-2024-highlights-linux-gaming-talks-on-umu-and-heroic-launcher/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently did a talk at the Ubuntu Summit</a> you should check out.</p>

      <title>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered may need a workaround on desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered is out now and like other recent Sony PlayStation releases on PC, it forces a PlayStation Network Account which is causing issues for some desktop Linux players.</p>
<p>You can run it on Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a>, but you might have issues actually logging into the PSN account system to play it. Not particularly surprising, since with<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/god-of-war-ragnarok-steam-deck-verified-needs-a-launch-option-for-desktop-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> God of War Ragnarök</a> you needed to pretend your desktop Linux system was a Steam Deck but in this case you <em>don't</em> want to do that.</p>
<p>Writing on the Steam forum, a developer at Nixxes Software <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2561580/discussions/0/4634860082274840611/#c4634860082274843235" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">said to do this</a> instead:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The SteamDeck parameter includes other changes specifically designed for the Steam Deck.<br/>
If you are experiencing issues with the login flow on Linux, please use the following workaround:<br/>
<br/>
On Steam, right click the game in your Library, choose Properties, go to General.<br/>
Add <strong>-showlinkingqr</strong> in the field for Launch Options</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see this sort of thing has been thought about, and to have a developer directly reply with a solution.</p>

      <title>Black Mesa has a new Beta with &#39;WAY better&#39; support for Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Crowbar Collective have a fresh Beta available for Black Mesa, their fan-made reimagining of Valve Software's Half-Life. This brings with it some nice improvements all across the game, especially for Linux platforms like Steam Deck.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/362890/view/4486241294570487809" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they mentioned "Welcome to Fall, and a Black Mesa beta patch post! We have pushed a build to public-beta that includes a bunch of fixes to some lingering issues, and WAY better Linux/Steam Deck support" with these highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improved game start up for a smother first time launch and improved stability.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused the game to crash to the menu when changing video settings during gameplay.</li>
<li>Fixed performance issue with moving wires (Thanks to npc_pigeon, narkvic, and the community).</li>
<li>Re-added DXVK for Windows as a launch option.</li>
<li>Significantly better native Linux implementation and Steam Deck support.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12565454981730400051gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>They go into quite a lot more detail on all the changes too, which is nice to see. We often see developers note improvements, but not many go deep into the individual details. Specifically for Linux here's everything they listed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ToGL/Linux:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated ToGL/Linux shaders with the latest GBuffer changes to ensure the application of up-to-date rendering techniques.</li>
<li>Cleaned up the shadow filter state in ToGL/Linux, resulting in more accurate and stable shadow rendering.</li>
<li>Migrated ToGL/Linux to use the OpenGL 3.3 Compatibility Profile, enhancing compatibility with a broader range of hardware and driver configurations while maintaining access to modern OpenGL features.</li>
<li>Introduced an optional experimental Binary Shader Cache for ToGL/Linux, accessible via the -glusebinarycache command line option on Linux and native Steam Deck builds, which improves shader load times on supported platforms.</li>
<li>Resolved a half-pixel halo issue in the ToGL/Linux rendering pipeline, improving visual accuracy in rendered scenes.</li>
<li>Added per-triangle and optional per-vertex validation for studio models to resolve issues in ToGL/Linux related to static and dynamically lit models. A second pass for per-vertex validation can be enabled via the +r_studio_validate_vertices 1 command line argument.</li>
<li>Improved lighting buffer quality on ToGL/Linux to resolve a red hue in specular highlights, ensuring consistent visual output across platforms.</li>
<li>Added a missing window icon on ToGL/Linux to address a minor visual issue.</li>
<li>Configured default arguments for the Linux launcher to optimize display settings on Steam Deck, ensuring a better out-of-the-box experience for AMD/Intel GPU users.</li>
<li>Fixed debug assertions in Havok that leaked into the release build on Linux, preventing potential crashes during runtime.</li>
</ul>
<p>Proton/Linux:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forced the shipped DXVK configuration on Proton if no overrides are provided, enhancing compatibility with Proton 9.x and newer versions.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For some background: <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/ToGL" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ToGL</a> is the original translation layer Valve used in their earlier Linux ports, that translated Direct3D to OpenGL. Later Valve games have native Vulkan support, and they also nowadays of course have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> with DXVK and VKD3D-Proton for translating Direct3D to Vulkan.</p>
<p>That's a rather surprising amount of effort that's been put into the Native Linux version of the game.</p>

<p>Vampire Survivors: Ode to Castlevania DLC is out now and it's a rather large addition to an already great game. <em>Note: DLC key provided by Future Friends Games, the base game I purchased myself originally.</em></p>
<p>Taking an already fantastic content-filled game and just giving you a whole lot more of it, what's not to love about Vampire Survivors? Accessible action that you can hop into for a run whenever you want, and now there's a healthy dose of Castlevania too? Yes please.</p>
<p>It probably needs no real introduction right? Vampire Survivors spawned a whole genre with its simple mechanics of building up a crazy character with auto-firing attacks. Vampire Survivors: Ode to Castlevania adds in over 20 new characters, 40 new weapons, over 30 new music tracks and a huge new castle map to battle through. That's only really scratching the surface of this monstrous expansion though.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="RnzmiDonN2E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8843e1edff4652e79b2f3644e4ae6bfb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/RnzmiDonN2E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The themed map is a nice addition to the game and quite different from most of the maps. With a mixture of closed and open areas, with plenty of extras in it to find and unlock. Unlike other maps, it also has dedicated spots to spawn various Castlevania themed bosses so you can take them on when you feel you're powered up enough.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5594656041730398248gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5594656041730398248gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>While the map is nice the real weight of the DLC comes down to all the characters and weapons, but it will take you a good while to get through it all. We're talking tens of hours of gameplay here on the normal speed to battle through the bosses, and deal with the challenges to unlock all the new characters.</p>
<p>I won't spoil it, but lets just say that they're <em>massively</em> underselling this DLC thanks to a big secret. There's a <strong>lot</strong> more to it than what they're telling you. No doubt you'll be able to find what easily somewhere else, but I'm not a fan of ruining a very nice surprise that really was awesome to see. I have no doubt this will bump the game back up the most played lists on Steam and for good reason.</p>
<p>All the usual jank of Vampire Survivors with enemies walking on top of all the walls, while in other sections they all get stuck on them. It's the game you know and love, just more of everything.</p>
<p>Vampire Survivors: Ode to Castlevania DLC is a brilliant addition to the game, and one that is really a no-brainer on recommending you pick up. The price ($3.99 / EUR 3.99 / £2.99) for the content is just absurd, poncle really did some great stuff here.</p>
<p>Vampire Survivors is Steam Deck Verified, and has Native Linux support (although not advertised).</p>

      <title>EA / Respawn now block Apex Legends from running on Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developers of Apex Legends have announced that they're going to be blocking the game completely on Linux platforms including Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Writing in a <a href="https://x.com/PlayApex/status/1852019667315102151" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X / Twitter I'll copy it below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey Legends,</p>
<p>We’re sharing today that Linux (and Steam Deck using Linux) will no longer be able to access Apex Legends.</p>
<p>Our dev team wanted to provide a bit more context into this and share some of the decision-making process that happened along the way. As mentioned in our prior <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/anti-cheat-update-082124" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">anti-cheat dev blog</a>, competitive integrity is a top priority for our team and there are many ways in which we’re battling cheaters—this is one to add to the list. We remain committed to more regular updates on topics like this and appreciate your continued reports.</p>
<p>Read on to hear from our Anti-Cheat Team.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>What’s happening?</p>
<p>In our efforts to combat cheating in Apex, we've identified Linux OS as being a path for a variety of impactful exploits and cheats. As a result, we've decided to block Linux OS access to the game. While this will impact a small number of Apex players, we believe the decision will meaningfully reduce instances of cheating in our game.</p>
<p>Linux is used by default on the Steam Deck. There is currently no reliable way for us to differentiate a legitimate Steam Deck from a malicious cheat claiming to be a Steam Deck (via Linux).</p>
<p>Decision making process</p>
<p>The openness of the Linux operating systems makes it an attractive one for cheaters and cheat developers. Linux cheats are indeed harder to detect and the data shows that they are growing at a rate that requires an outsized level of focus and attention from the team for a relatively small platform. There are also cases in which cheats for the Windows OS get emulated as if it’s on Linux in order to increase the difficulty of detection and prevention.</p>
<p>We had to weigh the decision on the number of players who were legitimately playing on Linux/the Steam Deck versus the greater health of the population of players for Apex. While the population of Linux users is small, their impact infected a fair amount of players’ games. This ultimately brought us to our decision today.</p>
<p>Next steps</p>
<p>To eliminate this cheat vector, we have made the decision to prevent access to the game for Linux users. This means that Apex Legends will be unplayable immediately for those running this operating system. Playing on handhelds, such as the Steam Deck, is still possible if the user opts to install Windows.</p>
<p>To clarify, this will not impact users who play Apex via Steam on Windows (or other supported platforms).</p>
<p>Thanks for everyone’s continual support and we look forward to sharing future anti-cheat updates!</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>This is only a part of our ongoing efforts towards Apex’s anti-cheat. We are continually expanding and refining our detection and banning capabilities globally. Keep an eye out for more news to come in the future. Please continue to report cheaters using <a href="https://help.ea.com/no/help/apex-legends/apex-legends/report-player-apex-legends/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the designated tools and channels</a>. Your reports are helpful and matter to us and anti-cheat continues to be a top priority for us.</p>
<p>For future updates and the latest info, continue to follow us here or check out the <a href="https://trello.com/b/ZVrHV38P/apex-tracker" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Apex Tracker Trello</a> for bugs or concerns we’re investigating.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Valve are really going to need to do something more about the anti-cheat situation on Linux. We only <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/grand-theft-auto-v-gets-battleye-anti-cheat-breaks-online-play-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently had GTA Online in GTA V blocked</a> (single-player still works). EA also broke the likes of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/ea-anti-cheat-arrives-for-battlefield-1-breaking-it-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Battlefield 1</a> and various other multiplayer games as well on Linux / Steam Deck, and I did say it was likely only a matter of time until EA messed with Apex. The list of blocked titles just keeps going like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/game-over-for-roblox-on-linux-steam-deck-as-its-now-blocked/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Roblox</a> too — it's just a repeating problem that seems to have no end in sight.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3288417851730392752gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Soon then the official Steam Deck rating from Valve will drop from Playable to Unsupported. <em><strong>Update 18:16 UTC</strong> - Valve have now marked it as Unsupported on Steam Deck.</em></p>
<p>When you try to play on a Linux platform now, you're just given an anti-cheat message. So this is the end of Apex Legends on Linux and Steam Deck.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10408696591730393051gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>How much of a loss is it? Well, for Apex fans on Linux platforms it will of course be a <em>big</em> one. However, looking at Valve's own stats, Apex isn't actually in the Top 100 for the last month of most played games on Steam Deck. The past year though? It's number #48 overall.</p>
<p>Oh, and before you suddenly go "but…but Microsoft are banning kernel-level anti-cheat!" — no they're not. Various YouTube videos and other media made headlines about it, but <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/microsoft-windows-kernel-changes-dont-suddenly-mean-big-things-for-linux-gaming/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">they're wrong which I wrote about before</a>. Even <em>if</em> in some far-away future Microsoft managed to do so, companies will still block Linux directly if they wanted to (and they already do like Roblox!).</p>
<p>In related news, Valve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-games-will-now-need-to-fully-disclose-kernel-level-anti-cheat-on-store-pages/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">only announced yesterday</a> that Steam store pages will need to properly note what kernel-level anti-cheat they use.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck the &#39;perfect platform&#39; for their game say Escape From Castle Matsumoto devs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Escape From Castle Matsumoto looks like quite a unique one, and the developers give the Steam Deck some rather high praise. It's releasing with Native Linux support on December 5th.</p>
<p>In the game two shinobis race against each other to recover stolen items and escape a Japanese castle, using your wits and tricks to outsmart your opponent. What makes it interesting is the split-screen mechanic, along with the slick retro pixel-artwork that looks like it was inspired by the classic Spy vs. Spy.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="H3PsS55E2FY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fe6043758f9f51ff4fa7675e6d923eb0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/H3PsS55E2FY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2490030/announcements/detail/4541409756166750375" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam the developer said: "Escape From Castle Matsumoto will be 100% Steam Deck compatible, including an official input layout. In fact, Steam Deck will be THE perfect platform for our game."</p>
<p>Could be a good one to keep an eye on!</p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">You will need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>thoroughly search the castle to locate and collect all items</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hinder your opponent's efforts by setting up tricks and obstacles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if necessary, challenge your opponent in a direct fight</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Use all of your shinobi training to accomplish the mission:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ninja's tools: locks and smoke bombs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>powerful spirits you can summon to guard items and passages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>defensive remedies to break tricks set up by your opponent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>martial arts if a direct confrontation becomes inevitable</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Play against the CPU or another player, over split-screen or network.</p>

      <title>Epic roguelike Caves of Qud now has a proper tutorial</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gearing up for the final 1.0 release on December 5, the sci-fi fantasy epic roguelike Caves of Qud now has a proper tutorial released.</p>
<p>You still have to wait for the 1.0 release for the end of the main story though, but at least now you can jump right in and get a proper good idea of what to do. I suggest you do too, because it's a fantastic game that is at times completely absurd in what you can do and what your character can become.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="87TKcq4tcJ4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/52258000d8bb63ab7374b84c18b68a7c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/87TKcq4tcJ4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I've gone through and tested the tutorial, and it really is a nice introduction to the game. Since it's a huge roguelike though, it does only scratch the surface of what the game is about and what you can do. Does the job well though and works great on Linux.</p>
<p>The price, as they previously announced, has also now risen to £24.99 / $29.99 / €28.99.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>DEEP PHYSICAL SIMULATION</strong> — Don’t like the wall blocking your way? Dig through it with a pickaxe, or eat through it with your corrosive gas mutation, or melt it to lava. Yes, every wall has a melting point.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>FULLY SIMULATED CREATURES</strong> — Every monster and NPC is as fully simulated as the player. That means they have levels, skills, equipment, faction allegiances, and body parts. So if you have a mutation that lets you, say, psionically dominate a spider, you can traipse through the world as a spider, laying webs and eating things.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>DYNAMIC FACTION SYSTEM</strong> — Pursue allegiances with over 70 factions: apes, crabs, trees, robots, and highly entropic beings, just to name a few.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>RICHLY DETAILED SCIENCE FANTASY SETTING</strong> — Over fifteen years of worldbuilding have led to a rich, weird, labyrinthine, one-of-a-kind storyworld, layered on top of the simulation, all for you to explore. Live and drink, friend.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>TACTICAL GAMEPLAY</strong> — Turn-based, sandbox exploration and combat offers as many solutions as you and your mutations, implants, artifacts, and skills are creative enough to invent.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>RPG ELEMENTS</strong> — Quests, NPCs, villages, historic sites; some dynamic and some handwritten, interwoven to produce a transportative RPG experience.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>ATMOSPHERIC ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK</strong> — Over two hours of otherworldly music to delve to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Available with Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Steam games will now need to fully disclose kernel-level anti-cheat on store pages</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve announced a change for Steam today that will make things a lot clearer for everyone, as developers will now need to clearly list the kernel-level anti-cheat used on Steam store pages.</p>
<p>In the Steamworks Developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4547038620960934857?snr=2___" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> Valve said: "We've heard from more and more developers recently that they're looking for the right way to share anti-cheat information about their game with players. At the same time, players have been requesting more transparency around the anti-cheat services used in games, as well as the existence of any additional software that will be installed within the game."</p>
<p>Developers with games already on Steam will also need to do this, as it's not just for new games coming up for release, and it is also part of the release process now too. So Valve will be doing checks on games to ensure the notices are there and correct.</p>
<p>However, it's only being <em>forced</em> for kernel-level anti-cheat. If it's only client-side or server-side, it's <em>optional</em>, but Valve say "we generally think that any game that makes use of anti-cheat technology would benefit from letting players know".</p>
<p>Valve's example pictured below:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7927772011730316555gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Some games don't properly remove everything when you uninstall either, with Valve noting this happens with older games, so it's nice to also see this will be noted too.</p>
<p>This should make it a bit easier knowing what to avoid on Steam Deck / Desktop Linux now too, since kernel-level anti-cheat games are usually blocked by the developer from running with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>
<p>Valve have done a few rather interesting Steam updates lately like dealing with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/steam-store-pages-are-about-to-get-a-lot-cleaner-valve-puts-an-end-to-game-advert-spam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">publisher banner spam</a>, implementing <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/valve-makes-a-big-improvement-for-native-linux-games-in-a-steam-beta-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">improvements for Native Linux games</a>, actually noting clearly when you go to purchase a game <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-purchases-now-clearly-state-youre-just-getting-a-license-not-ownership/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">it's just a license</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/steam-subscriber-agreement-updated-for-disputes-removing-the-need-for-individual-arbitration/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">removing the need for individual arbitration</a>.</p>

      <title>Luma Island devs spent an &#39;enormous amount of effort&#39; to make it smooth on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Luma Island looks pretty sweet from Feel Free Games, a game that combines together elements of adventuring and building together that you can play solo or with up to 4 people together.</p>
<p>In a post on Steam the developers mentioned "For any up and coming adventurers that were hoping to play Luma Island on the go, we have got you covered! We have spent an enormous amount of effort ensuring that everything runs smoothly on the Steam Deck, allowing you to farm, fish and explore on the move."</p>
<p>Additionally they said they plan to keep improving it after release. Check out the trailer:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore the Island: Traverse the island solving quests and helping the locals through their struggles. Dangerous spider caves, ancient temples, mind-bending puzzles and hidden treasures await you!</li>

<li>Master Your Profession: Pick from several unique in-depth professions each with its own progression path. Upgrade your tools to gather rare materials and collaborate with your teammates to become the masters of your crafts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course since it's being optimized for Steam Deck, this means thanks to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton </a>it will then also work well on desktop Linux with your favourite distro!</p>

      <title>KDE&#39;s end of year fundraiser is live</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you appreciate the work from the KDE team on things like the Plasma desktop environment, maybe it's time to give them a little donation. KDE are looking to raise at least €30,000 with the total being updated each day.</p>
<p>This time around they've given the page a special Halloween theme with some short stories about issues with proprietary software. They're just a little reminder of what can happen like licenses being pulled away, companies using your work to train their AI, Windows updates being forced while you're working and more. Some truly horrifying stuff there.</p>
<p>From the fundraising page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're kicking off our 2024 end-of-year fundraiser just in time for Halloween!</p>
<p>Even if the spine-tingling horrors of the long dark night of Walpurgis are mostly imaginary, the sinister threats of predatory proprietary software providers remain all too real.</p>
<p>Fear not! We, the KDE community, will help you, your friends, family, company, and community banish all the creepy and insidious proprietary software that haunts your computers, phones, and household appliances.</p>
<p>But we can't do it alone! We need you to help us fight the good fight against the tech-ghouls from beyond. Use the form to donate any amount to our fundraiser (or become a regular donor to our community) and help us keep the dark forces of proprietary software at bay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See all on <a href="https://kde.org/fundraisers/yearend2024/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">their fundraising platform</a>.</p>
<p>KDE Plasma is my favourite desktop environment, I would honestly feel a bit lost without it on Linux nowadays. It's nice on the Steam Deck Desktop Mode too. I just recently updated Kubuntu from 24.04 to 24.10 as well, getting all that Wayland goodness from a much more recent Plasma version has been fun to test.</p>

      <title>Bazzite updated to Fedora 41 with expanded PC gaming handheld support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bazzite Linux has seen an upgrade to the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/fedora-41-is-out-now-with-plenty-of-enhancements-like-easier-nvidia-driver-installs/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">just released Fedora 41</a>, and with it comes lots of extra enhancements to their support of various PC gaming handhelds from AYANEO, ROG Ally and others.</p>
<p>What is Bazzite? It's "a cloud native image built upon Fedora Atomic Desktops that brings the best of Linux gaming to all of your devices - including your favorite handheld". Basically, it's a SteamOS-like based on Fedora that can turn your Windows handhelds into a smooth Linux device.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">With the Bazzite F41 update they've got an updated Linux kernel v6.11 that includes patches for Ayaneo, OneXPlayer, Ayn, basic controller support for the MSI Claw and a whole lot more goodies. Some of these changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speaker patches for Ayaneo Geek, Geek 1S, 1S, 2, 2S, Kun, Flip KB, Flip DS, and Ayn Loki MiniPro.</li>
<li>Display quirks for Ayaneo Flip DS, Neo 2S, GEEK, Founder edition and Ayaneo 2.</li>
<li>ROG Ally has a new patch that "selects the correct firmware for the Ally speakers, offering superior performance for users that used the incorrect firmware previously".</li>
<li>OneXPlayer X1 and X1 Mini sensors driver updated with "support for charge limiting and charge bypass" plus allowing control of the Turbo LED.</li>
<li>The MSI Claw also had support added to the "Handheld Daemon, where the front OEM buttons and the controller will work properly in Steam Gaming Mode". Lots of work still needed there though as there's plenty missing like TDP controls and back buttons.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lots of background work on the Bazzite project as a whole too. Bazzite has grown massively recently, with even the likes of Digital Foundry giving it a spin showing how it can improve on the mess of Windows on handhelds:</p>

      <title>Fedora 41 is out now with plenty of enhancements like easier NVIDIA driver installs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fedora 41 is officially out now and brings with it plenty of upgrades for all users. Here's just some of what's new and improved.</p>
<p>If you stick with Fedora Workstation you'll get the newer <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/gnome-47-denver-released-with-accent-colours-and-various-system-enhancements/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GNOME 47</a> that comes with lots of additions I covered before like accent colour customization, enhanced small screen support, an improved Files app, a better Online Accounts system and much more.</p>
<p>Specifically in Fedora 41 there's IPU6 Camera support and improvements for Traditional Chinese. A big one is support for installing Nvidia drivers with secureboot, although the process needs a few steps it's good to see it in. There's also a new terminal app with Ptyxis.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5173878781730288226gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Fedora 41</em></p>
<p>There's also the newer DNF 5 package manager, PHP is 64-bit only, Valkey replaces Redis, PipeWire camera sensor support in Firefox and upgrades to various included applications.</p>
<p>See more in the <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/latest/release-notes/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>
<p>Fedora KDE got some nice upgrades too like<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/kde-plasma-62-released-with-improved-wayland-colour-management" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> KDE Plasma 6.2</a> that has improved Wayland colour management, lots of enhancements for drawing tablets, overhauled accessibility options and so on. There's also a new KDE Plasma Mobile spin.</p>

      <title>Steam Beta adds plenty of Game Recording improvements plus a Steam Play update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve rolled out another two Steam Client Beta updates recently, as they continue pushing the Game Recording system towards a stable release. The fixes are the same for Steam Deck and Desktop since it's a Steam Client update.</p>
<p>From the update on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/4507632758953083307?snr=2___" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">October 28th</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the names of manually added or removed games not appearing in the collection filter header if the game had been removed from the user's library.</li>
</ul>
<p>Game Recording</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced clip export/share time in many cases when exporting native resolution, codec, and frame rate.</li>
<li>Added ability to start/stop recording of a clip via manual recording shortcut key, when in background recording mode.</li>
<li>Updated desktop toast notifications during game recording to show clipping action and depict clip duration.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And then for <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/4507632758953083387?snr=2___" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">October 29th</a>, which also has an adjustment of Steam Play for third party compatibility tools (like GE-Proton, Luxtorpeda and others):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed steamwebhelper deleting temp directories that it may not have previously created.</li>
</ul>
<p>Game Recording</p>
<ul>
<li>Extended the "auto" quality setting, which sets the recording bit rate based on the game's video resolution, into four levels: low, medium, high and ultra. These replace the prior fixed bit rate quality settings. See the quality setting dialog for more info.</li>
<li>Improved the speed of exporting a file in some scenarios.</li>
<li>Recording video with AMD GPUs should now use a higher H264 codec profile setting.</li>
<li>Improved navigation of Game Recording Settings in Big Picture</li>
</ul>
<p>Linux</p>
<ul>
<li>Extend recent Steam Play fixes to third party compatibility tools.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's been a few adjustments to Steam Play recently like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-beta-removes-option-to-globally-disable-steam-play-plus-game-recording-improvements/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">removing the global toggle</a> to turn it off, and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/valve-makes-a-big-improvement-for-native-linux-games-in-a-steam-beta-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">using a newer container runtime</a> instead of the legacy environment for better compatibility overall.</p>
<p>How long do we think before Game Recording rolls out in a stable update? How are you getting on with it? Let me know in the comments.</p>

      <title>Beelink have open-sourced their Multi-Functional EX Docking Station for mini PCs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hardware vendor Beelink have "open-sourced" their Multi-Functional EX Docking Station that you can use to extend their GTi Ultra Series mini PCs with a full GPU.</p>
<p>I can't find anywhere that lists a <em>specific</em> license, so it may not be OSI approved "open source" by their definition of it but they are being very open about it and their promise includes the patents too. Seems like they want it to become a standard of some sort, which would benefit them too. If more and more vendors decided to use it, that would make them eventually easier and cheaper to produce with more options.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

      <title>Speedollama is an ultra fast, violent and silly platformer-shooter out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Coming from Chaosmonger Studio who created ENCODYA, Clunky Hero, Three Minutes To Eight and other games is a new release with Speedollama. <em>Note: key provided by the developer to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4218320-GamingOnLinux/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">our Steam Curator</a>.</em></p>
<p>If you enjoyed games like Metal Slug, Contra and other classic action-platformers, you'll probably love this one quite a lot. It's ridiculous in all the best ways, but still very much on the simple side mechanically overall. Speedollama, as the name suggests, is all about <em>speed</em>. You race through the generated levels to collect items to unlock the exit against the timer, blowing up every single alpaca that's in your way and watching all their pixel bodies explode into tiny pieces.</p>
<p>Making you feel like a speed-runner, although with procedurally generated levels, you get to choose from 3 different characters each with slightly different stats. As you progress through you will also be able to purchase a few character buffs to make it just that little bit more crazy.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EYFWldXi1bo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bd730858a46150fd1b096d0db71db9a7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EYFWldXi1bo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer said how it "pushes the limits of the run-and-gun genre" and they're not wrong. I had to take a few breaks, just because of the speed of it all to allow my mind to catch up a bit. Run, gun, bounce around chaotically and keep on running some more. Reminded me a fair bit of Broforce, without the environmental destruction, with the sprinkle of comedy too.</p>
<p>Speedollama is just totally absurd. You can't help but smile as you run through it.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support and works great on Steam Deck too.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Feature Highlight:</p>
<ul>
<li>Procedurally generated levels offering endless replayability.</li>
<li>Vibrant, coloured pixel-art graphics with hand-made frame-by-frame animations.</li>
<li>Fantasy violence with humorous splatter scenes and gallons of pixelated blood.</li>
<li>A variety of weapons and upgrades to enhance gameplay.</li>
<li>Extremely fast-paced action for adrenaline-fueled fun.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Assassin&#39;s Creed Mirage gets improved Steam Deck support and now rated Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ubisoft gave a very small update to Assassin's Creed Mirage on Steam and managed to get it bumped up to a Steam Deck Playable rating. <em>The rating and update went live today.</em></p>
<p>Don't expect much though, they didn't make any specific upgrades to the game. Here's what they announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The game will automatically detect your Steam Deck and will run default settings for better performances on this device. We recommend keeping using the proposed presets to smoothly experience Basim's coming of age story on your Steam Deck.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, this is absolute minimum-level effort stuff. They haven't announced any plans to improve it elsewhere, so that may be the best we get for it.</p>
<p>Why is it rated Playable? First up: Ubisoft Connect (that's required) has issues where you may be forced to use the touch screen and it may have small text. On top of that you will need to <em>manually</em> bring up the keyboard any time it's needed, some in-game text is too small and the game will also not exit clean so you have to force close it when you're done as you get left with a black screen.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19171083541730218978gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Here's a bit of fun behind the scenes info for you: surprisingly, Ubisoft sent a key to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4218320-GamingOnLinux/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">our Steam Curator</a>. However, it came with a major problem. I <em>couldn't</em> actually play Assassin's Creed Mirage at all. I'll give you one guess as to why. It was due to Ubisoft Connect — what a surprise! Did you guess correctly? I bet you did.</p>
<p>Even though Ubisoft release their games on Steam now, and will be going back to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/assassins-creed-shadows-and-star-wars-outlaws-head-to-steam-as-ubisoft-return-to-same-day-releases/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">same-day releases</a> for future titles, they still use their additional launcher. Not just that, it <em>also</em> needs a special activation code (like a CD Key). For Steam purchases this is done in the form of a DLC. For Steam Curator keys, initially this activation code DLC was <em>not</em> actually linked up.</p>
<p>I spoke to Ubisoft Support, who gave me the usual unhelpful runaround of not actually reading what I wrote. Ubisoft Press <em>didn't</em> even reply and Valve support initially gave the usual unhelpful didn't-read-it reply too. 3 days later, the activation code DLC was suddenly in my Steam Library. Steam support then replied again that same day, to note basically "you're wrong, it's there" — well of course because someone did fix it. Who? I'll apparently never know. <em>Update: Ubisoft press did reply, after the article was published, but it's solved now anyway.</em></p>
<p>Somewhat a unique situation being a Steam Curator, but just another in the list of why these extra launchers can be a nuisance. 3 days of waiting on it…</p>

      <title>Ubuntu Summit 2024 highlights - Linux gaming talks on UMU and Heroic Launcher</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Ubuntu Summit 2024 has been and gone, and with it we had a lot of good talks but with our focus on here with gaming there's two that stand out that you may wish to have a look at. <em>Currently the talks haven't been split up so they're across three big livestreams.</em></p>
<p>On Day 2 there was a <a href="https://events.canonical.com/event/51/contributions/580/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">presentation</a> from Paweł Lidwin of the Heroic Games Launcher project, a cross-platform free and open source launcher for Epic Games, GOG and Amazon Prime Games. The talk gives a brief overview on what they've been working on like UWP/WinRT in Wine, Comet for GOG multiplayer features and more. But Lidwin also does a quick little sneak peek intro on a new project called Maxima Launcher, an open source replacement for EA Desktop / Origin that will eventually get Heroic integration too.</p>
<p>Skip to 8:43:32 for the Heroic talk:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZNK4aSv-krI?rel=0&amp;start=31410"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/92bd9d3153728cdc2de20533101aa2b5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZNK4aSv-krI?rel=0&amp;start=31410" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Then on Day 3 we had a <a href="https://events.canonical.com/event/51/contributions/510/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">presentation</a> from Thomas Crider, also known as <em>GloriousEggroll</em>, who made GE-Proton (originally called Proton-GE) on the creation of UMU the unified launcher for Windows games on Linux. It's a nice overview for people confused on how UMU works and what it's actually for. The talk goes over how Steam actually runs games on Linux, and how UMU deals with running Proton outside of Steam along with the UMU Database that has a bunch of game-specific tweaks to run them properly.</p>
<p>For this one skip to 1:03:34:</p>

      <title>AYANEO continue teasing the AYANEO 3 Code: REVO handheld</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While still giving us no actual details, AYANEO are hyping up the AYANEO 3 Code: REVO handheld that's due to be announced properly sometime soon. Their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/ayaneo-tease-the-ayaneo-3-as-a-revolution-and-a-completely-new-concept/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">initial announcement</a> was just marketing speak word-salad, and — surprise, this <a href="https://www.ayaneo.com/article/857" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">latest</a> isn't really any different.</p>
<p>They're saying it's "not just a product of technological innovation, it is also an awakening of product thinking" whatever that means. And it will bring "not only hardware innovation, but also a deeper change in the way players interact with their handhelds". Once again, it's like they picked a bunch of buzzwords, put them on a board and threw darts at it to pick out things to say. They continued to note how they aren't just "looking for a faster and more powerful device" but are also "exploring the boundaries of the AYANEO handheld gaming experience". Okay then.</p>
<p>Going by the teaser pictures they included, it's very much a traditional handheld shell design, so it's not exactly that much of a revolution. But, there's only so much you can do with handheld PC designs.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3797216291730197813gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3797216291730197813gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11555724631730197814gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11555724631730197814gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><em>From that second teaser image, it looks a lot like the Steam Deck.</em></p>
<p>They touched on how previous handhelds have "many trade-offs and compromises among portability, performance, control, battery life and experience" and claim that the "AYANEO 3 brings a new level of freedom, a technological leap, and a conceptual revolution and sublimation, allowing us to say goodbye to the constraints and welcome more possibilities".</p>
<p>Hopefully Bazzite and other Linux versions can get support for whatever it turns out to be nice and quick.</p>

      <title>90s horror adventure game Clock Tower: Rewind released outside Japan for the first time</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Clock Tower released originally in 1995 for the SNES and later for other systems, but it was never officially translated and supported outside of Japan until now with Clock Tower: Rewind. You'll need <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> to play this one on Linux systems.</p>
<p>Not one I'm actually familiar with directly so I'll let the official blurb speak: "Turn back the clock for one of the pioneers of the survival-horror genre. Translated and released outside of Japan for the first time, Clock Tower: Rewind is a revival of the terror-inducing 16-bit classic that dares you to explore the haunting confines of the Barrows family manor. As teenage orphan Jennifer, you must search every disturbing corner to find items, reveal secrets, and discover ways to evade Scissorman, a murderous, unstoppable, shears-wielding psychopath."</p>
<p>Gameplay trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EdV1kzvyr9w"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dc6518f1763fb38cb0f4c9304960c7dc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EdV1kzvyr9w" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>The survival-horror classic, Clock Tower, officially translated and brought out of Japan for the first time</li>
<li>Choose from Original mode or Rewind mode, which features numerous gameplay additions and quality-of-life refinements</li>
<li>Run, hide, and survive as you attempt to evade the psychotic Scissorman</li>
<li>Atmospheric 2D art, detailed animations, and haunting sound effects augment the tense point-and-click gameplay</li>
<li>Multiple endings and randomized gameplay elements maximize replayability (and jump scares)</li>
<li>New animated opening, motion-comics with VO, and vocal theme song performed by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn</li>
<li>Featuring an art gallery, music player, behind-the-scenes creator interview, save states, and other modern inclusions</li>
</ul>
<p>Nice to see more classics available to a wider audience.</p>

      <title>Men of War II finally gets an offline mode with a big content update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Men of War II from Best Way originally released back in May, but it forced an online connection. With the Steel Rain update out now that's no longer the case. Nice to see the developer actually deliver on what they promised.</p>
<p>You can now switch between offline and online modes and additionally the developer added the ability for all single-player modes to have the option to change the game speed. They also mentioned how "the quality of the game world simulation will now improve based on the power of your PC" as well. They also said they expect almost everyone to notice "a somewhat less “arcadey” feel of the game". Online play had some tweaks too like an improved MMR score calculation, which they feel is a "significant improvement".</p>
<p>New content too like 8 new units and 3 new battalions, plus updated models for a bunch of existing ones. Some new visual effects are in, new blood effects, particle reflections in water, particles got shadows, smooth fading of light sources at a distance and lots more. There's also new and improved sound effects, unit balancing and the list goes on.</p>

      <title>Set comfort level to maximum with the Mechanism Gaming Pillow for handhelds</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You may remember Mechanism from their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/your-steam-deck-deserves-a-deckmate/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">original Deckmate</a> system of attachments for the Steam Deck, but they have since expanded to cover other handhelds and they also now have the Mechanism Gaming Pillow.</p>
<p>For full disclosure: the Mechanism team sent it over a while ago for review, and it has become something I now use without even thinking about — it just makes sense. If I'm not going to be docking it, and I'm sat where I can sit back and relax a bit, I will absolutely be popping the Steam Deck into it without question.</p>
<p>However, I wasn't even remotely convinced until actually getting it and using it for a while. Why? Just the very idea of a gaming pillow never really appealed much to me. I thought it would be gimmicky, or just a fancy pillow with the word gaming attached to bring up the price. Thankfully, the Gaming Pillow from Mechanism is actually a genuinely good idea.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21002292951730129889gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Image credit: Mechanism</em></p>
<p>Here's the thing: I play on my Steam Deck near-enough every day. A lot of the time, I prop my arms up with some sort of pillow underneath anyway. At times on my sofa building something resembling a pillow fort just to get properly comfy for a decent gaming session. Why? The dreaded aching arms, and slightly sore neck that can come with holding it up for a while.</p>
<p><em>Mechanism's Gaming Pillow solves the entire problem and then some. </em></p>
<p>It's super simple to attach it together. All you need for the Steam Deck is the Deckmate mount that you just slot over the top of the Steam Deck, and then you just click it into the arm mount on the Gaming Pillow. The Gaming Pillow can be purchased with a mount for the Steam Deck, ROG Ally / X, Nintendo Switch, and there's also adaptors for the dbrand and JSAUX cases plus there's a universal grip to stick it to anything else.</p>
<p>From there, you can then position it pretty much whichever way you want with the pillow sat on top of you. This is thanks to the ball socket attached to the end of the arm, allowing you to really get it where you want it. So even if you're tall, or you have short arms, or you're just generally short (hi) it's not an issue getting it into position.</p>
<p>It entirely frees up your arms to game for longer sessions without worry. Maybe you want to quickly check your phone or have a sip of your coffee or whatever without dropping the Deck itself or moving it anywhere. It will just sit there floating in the mount waiting for you. There's even an extra mount directly on the top of it for you to stick down a battery pack, a USB hub, your phone or whatever else you might need while relaxing with your handheld.</p>
<p>While I think it's great, there is <em>one</em> thing that annoys me about it. The material and coating on the top where you rest the Steam Deck (if you have it set down low) is a bit squeaky with any movement of the attachment rubbing on it. Not overly distracting, but still just a tiny bit annoying. Other than that, it's quite wonderful.</p>
<p>I would have liked to have more to say about it, but there's not a lot of extra I can add in here that wouldn't just end up as nonsense text-padding. It does exactly what it advertises, and does so very nicely. I no longer have to build up a little pillow fort under my arms to get comfy and that's wonderful.</p>
<p>You're still going to look a fair bit silly with it though but who really cares when you're the master of comfort.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://getmechanism.com/products/gaming-pillow" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the Mechanism website</a>. It's being done in batches with the next expected in November.</p>

      <title>Albion Online &#39;Horizons&#39; update brings a customizable HUD and a more dynamic world</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the few actually popular MMOs that has official Native Linux support, Albion Online has expanded again today with the Horizons update out now.</p>
<p>This sandbox MMO update brings with it a customizable HUD with a built-in HUD editor so you can move everything around to where you want it. You can also save and share your layouts with the ability to have 10 saved at a time for different activities.</p>
<p>The world should feel a bit more interesting too with dynamic encampments to find as you explore for both solo and group play with some valuable loot. You might also find a special map which gives you access to a special boss lair to fight through. There's also dynamic resource hotspots, you might now find valuable coffers to open up across the open world, a new portal system for solo players to jump to unpredictable locations for easier exploration in the Outlands and a lot more.</p>

<p>Albion Online has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Playable. It has a pretty healthy number of players too. On Steam alone in the last 24 hours it had a peak of 12,842 which does not count the standalone launcher players or mobile players (all play together cross-platform).</p>

      <title>Create completely ridiculous weapons in survive-em-up roguelite shooter NIMRODS: GunCraft Survivor</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NIMRODS: GunCraft Survivor on the surface may look just like yet another survivor-like, but it has captured my total attention in a way not many have been able to. It's just thoroughly great. <em>Note: key provided by Fiveamp.</em></p>
<p>Much like all the others in the genre that spawned from Vampire Survivors it has the basics: repeated runs where you take down enemies, while you collect little experience orbs to level up. Here though, you're also building a gun as you go through various attachments (that they call augments). What you can end up with is totally <em>ridiculous</em> and I love the way you see your attachments represented in the weapon itself on-screen as you run around. Although I do hope they expand on this visually, as some attachments don't change the look at all. <em>A bit like how Brotato evolves your character's look as you go.</em></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="f09L7Uy5xII"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7c93de2b73a7dbde6c9b66f40615c602.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/f09L7Uy5xII" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's a lot that sets this apart from other games in the genre too that I'll go over a few bits of now. For starters: the level up system. Here it's not completely automatic. When you reach a level up, a pod will drop down you have to run to collect. Even that can be a little challenging at times, due to the amount of enemy swarms you might be dealing with. It's also just a supremely cool idea to have a pod drop down to buff your weapon with some new attachments.</p>
<p>When you die, the weapon you've built <em>won't</em> just vanish either. You go back to your little home base, where the weapon with all the attachments is on the floor. You can pick it up to test it again, or give it to a drone that will follow you around and the drone will level it up exactly how you made it during a run. A really clever idea that gives some extra meta progression to the game. If you decide you didn't like the weapon, you can sell it for some credits towards unlocking more weapons and attachments to use during a run. Or, you can put it on display to swap with the drone later.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6061212851730120076gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6061212851730120076gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>The map you drop into also needs actual exploration. You start off with a pretty blank map covered in a shroud / fog of war, which gets revealed as you run around. This exploration stays for your next run too, so you'll know more of where you want to go. As you explore you'll find various new areas with new types of enemies, along with the option to collect blueprints to unlock more weapons and attachments. <em>The map is also pretty darn big.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17355577861730120023gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17355577861730120023gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Trying to get a blueprint is quite difficult too as you need to stand in a specific area around a case, while a percentage ticks up towards 100% where you unlock the blueprint to buy it after a run. But, while you're waiting for the timer, enemies will swarm around you.</p>
<p>Quite a few different enemy types too and some entertaining boss battles as well, with each little boss getting their own fancy little mini-intro to highlight that they've appeared. Like all good survivor-likes, you unlock more of the game as you go. As you defeat these mini-bosses, more doors in the home base will be available to walk through giving you access to more features.</p>
<p>A game that continues to open up the more you play it. Through all the weapons, the attachments, new areas of the map, the drone adjustments and so much more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8621063321730120224gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8621063321730120224gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Nice and accessible too with options to auto aim, auto fire your main weapon and seperately the underbarrel if needed (so you could auto fire main weapon, and have say a grenade launcher underbarrel set to manual) or you can play it like a proper twin-stick shooter. The option is yours — the perfect balance.</p>
<p>With the Early Access release there's already a <em>lot</em> of weapon types and attachments to try out many combinations with plans to add in more guns, more attachments, more enemies, more minibosses and just a lot more of everything. The developer said the current plan is to continue development in EA for at least a year, and if successful they will continue with post-release updates too.</p>
<p>Once you do die (and you will, a lot) the game over screen gives you a nice amount of details too. Showing off what killed you, how long you lasted, distanced travelled, missions completed and lots more to show off to friends.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21446843501730120024gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21446843501730120024gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>It works thoroughly great with Proton on Desktop Linux and Steam Deck. The developer noted they put great effort into ensuring it works well on Steam Deck. While performance in some places could be improved, overall it's great. The only issues on Steam Deck are the black bars at the bottom and top of the screen, hopefully they add the proper aspect ratio to use the whole Deck screen. And some text on items is a little small, so they need some scaling there.</p>
<p>Now if you'll excuse me, duty calls, I'm off for another run in NIMRODS: GunCraft Survivor because it's just that good. It has instantly become my new go-to game for when I need to blast around in something for a while. This will keep your attention for a whole lot of hours if you wish to not only complete the missions to unlock more, but to keep trying out the hundreds of combinations of weapons you can build. Awesome. Go grab it.</p>

      <title>Portal fans may want to try the demo for Total Reload</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you loved the overall style of Portal and enjoy puzzle games, Total Reload looks like one to keep in your watch list. The developers recently updated the game to include a Native Linux demo too.</p>
<p>A strange sounding one, with a description from the developer that leaves more questions than answers. There's something wrong with the Universe itself apparently it's just one big disaster, so you're going to try and reboot it all. Well, that's certainly an idea.</p>
<p>As they said: "The game world of TOTAL RELOAD consists of many locations connected by special devices for fast movement called Quantum Transporters. Each location has different energy sources that you have to combine into a single network with Quantum Transporters. Some energy sources are located in hard-to-reach places, and to get there, you'll have to use wires to temporarily supply power to various objects: moving platforms, sensor grids, energy filters and closed doors. In TOTAL RELOAD you have to learn to “think with wires” or, in other words, understand that by temporarily supplying power to various objects you can get to previously inaccessible locations."</p>

<p>It's due for a full release on January 15, 2025. Sounds like the demo is worth a go!</p>

      <title>Co-op dungeon crawler Barony gets a big free expansion with the Keep Your Secrets update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>First-personal co-op dungeon crawler Barony has a big free "Keep Your Secrets" update out now expanding many areas of the game. The developer said that "Every feature of the expansion makes Barony richer and more interesting to explore."</p>
<p>With this free upgrade you get access to The Compendium, a journal of everything you find and see, giving you an easy way to look up anything you need to like the strengths and weaknesses of enemies. A feature the has been long-awaited since the original Kickstarter. They also overhauled the Ruins with around 170 new types of rooms and there's some new enemies to find. Like the Gnome Thieves that have given up mining and will instead attempt to rob you, Bugbears that use a variety of weapons to take you down, several new varieties of Slimes, Bats have been added that like to nest in small colonies and more.</p>

      <title>Complex 2D train management sim Iron Roads hits Early Access in January 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a Demo and Steam Playtest available, Iron Roads from Cowleyfornia Studios is a top-down 2D train management game that's going to enter Early Access next year. Cowleyfornia Studios mentioned the EA date is now set for January 20th.</p>
<p>Check out the latest trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ijQ1tREKF0s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ed343d003c868eab69afa5f6b7c46301.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ijQ1tREKF0s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Iron Roads is a top-down 2D train management game for Desktop and Mobile with a focus on optimising train networks. Its minimalistic interface is easy to learn, but encourages deep and sophisticated gameplay. We’re aiming for the accessibility of Mini Metro and the depth of simulations such as OpenTTD, while also capturing the irreverent tone of games like Theme Hospital.</p>
<p>In addition to more established train management mechanics, Iron Roads explores themes surrounding sustainable development. Rather than encouraging unconstrained construction, the game reacts to the player’s actions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some of the features already in include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting up fast transport networks that will get erudite animal passengers to their destination on time</li>
<li>Efficient transport of goods in complex production chains.</li>
<li>A minimalistic interface that is easy to learn, but that allows for many happy hours optimising and building networks.</li>
<li>Music in Iron Roads is a combination of notes generated from trains and passengers, and authored melodies. The music generated is as unique as the layouts built by players.</li>
<li>Contracts: Scenarios come with a grant system where players can follow focussed goals to earn extra money and get the satisfaction of ticking off a to-do list.</li>
<li>Performance graphs: the main goal of Iron Roads is to optimise the train networks, so charts are available to analyse data relating to finances and passengers.</li>
</ul>
<p>With a plan to add mod support, multiplayer, weather events and more.</p>
<p>The developers mentioned to me that not only does it have Native Linux support, but it's also mostly developed on Linux. Eventually they will also be adding in full controller support so it will be a better experience on Steam Deck then too.</p>

      <title>Factorio: Space Age sold over 400,000 copies and sets a new player count record</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wube Software have announced some pretty incredible numbers after the release of the Factorio: Space Age DLC.</p>
<p>Released on October 21st, the Space Age expansion for Factorio is a truly huge addition to the game, and it's clear a lot of players are happy with it. In their latest Friday Facts <a href="https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-434" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Wube Software mentioned how they've managed to sell over 400,000 copies.</p>
<p>Pretty amazing numbers for a game that's a good few years old now. Not just that, but the player numbers have absolutely rocketed upwards with it hitting a peak of 118,674 about 15 hours ago. For comparison the previous peak was "only" 34,700 all the way back in 2020.</p>

      <title>Open source evolution survival sim Thrive v0.7.1 is a feature-filled release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Thrive is an open source evolution sim that has continued to impress me, and the latest release version 0.7.1 is nice and feature-filled.</p>
<p>Some nice improvements to the visuals in this release too, it's not just about new features. The world backgrounds are now much more dynamic with new effects like bubbles and distortions with various layers. The developers added a bloom effect, membranes are now fully 3D to make cells look more realistic, new ice chunks and more work to bring up the visual assets in the later stages of the game.</p>
<p>A major new game mechanic with oxygenation has been implemented too. With this you now initially spawn on a world without oxygen, but the world will evolve with you and oxygen will slowly be produced by various lifeforms and so you'll need to deal with the new systems revolving around that. As a whole the game is just a lot more dynamic now. </p>

<p>There's more to the update including a rework of the auto-evo reports, giving you a better understanding of what exactly is going on in the world. Plus there's now a Food Chain tab, so you can see the distribution of organisms across different levels of the chain.</p>
<p>Thrive has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Playable. It's made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>.

      <title>Check out the classic CRPG inspired Passageway of the Ancients out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Available now with Linux support from Passageway Games, a new retro-styled RPG is here for you to sink some hours into with Passageway of the Ancients.</p>
<p>With gameplay and a visual style clearly inspired by many of the great early CRPGs like Neverwinter Nights and Baldur's Gate, this might be quite the treat for fans of the genre. This is a game that very much feels like a blast from the past right down to spending an age customizing your character.</p>
<p>The character creator is a bit of an odd one. It has lots of customization for body parts size like upper arm mass, triceps tone, breast size, belly girth, the size and shape of your hips and so on. Lots of individual bits, but then it skimps on things like hair colour with only a couple of options. Either way, you're going to be there a while. Look at the options for just your nose:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16522720701729964350gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16522720701729964350gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><em>I won't say how long I was there, but it was a while…</em></p>
<p>More about it: "Passageway of the Ancients takes you to the world of Aieryon – the galaxy’s sole remaining magical planet – where you explore the city of Ithgar to solve an unspeakable crime. Beset with grief, you’re tasked with surviving deadly creatures lurking behind every door while gathering clues, managing your party, and leveling up your characters. You also must pick locks and solve Runic puzzles to gather the best loot."</p>
<p>Certainly a peculiar mix this one. Giving you somewhat tactical real-time combat with pausing, along with a strange dual personas system. At the start you pick your <em>public-facing</em> race, but you also have a special "Dragonkindt" form that you develop simultaneously. There's also a few different necessary options to tweak for the combat. Like melee for example lets you pick your attack form, attack height, stroke type and so on. Then magic allows you to tweak a few different things too like your vocal energy put into it, complexity of the spell mechanic and more that all together change how fast you cast and how much damage you'll do — it can be a little confusing to get into. <em>So many options.</em></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3UIFoiGnd9o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/183f3737ba1a5ff801d548843546449d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3UIFoiGnd9o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>If you want an RPG that's clearly designed with love for the classics, but also tries to do its own thing this is definitely one for you. Passageway of the Ancients will have you ending up getting totally absorbed by it for a whole lot of hours as you explore the world, especially while hunting for some good loot. I'm certainly looking forward to more from Passageway Games!</p>
<p>“Releasing a game like Passageway of the Ancients in 2024 feels like going back in time – back to the days of 40+ hour campaigns with no microtransactions ... just a straightforward, polished experience you can enjoy free of interruptions. We sincerely hope gamers give our little CRPG a chance. It’s packed full of everything we love about the classics: a feeling of adventure, plenty of danger, interesting characters, and challenging scenarios. It’s the game I’ve been dreaming about making for decades.” – Jon Grierson (Creative &amp; Technical Director, Passageway Games)</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Engage in Turn-Based &amp; Real-Time Combat: Use both turn-based and real-time elements – drawing on real medieval weapons and tactics.</li>
<li>Unleash Your Dragonkindt Nature: Develop your character’s two personas simultaneously – a hidden “Dragonkindt,” and a public-facing race of your choosing.</li>
<li>Sharpen Your Wits &amp; Make Strategic Choices: Manage battle spoils, solve puzzles, adjust the frequency of special activities, choose interactions, and gather clues.</li>
<li>Wield Powerful Magical Items: Carefully equip items affecting intelligence, will, and other character attributes.</li>
<li>Customize Your Character: Choose your character’s alternate persona, appearance, and gender as Dwarf, Elf or Human.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It has Native Linux support which as far as I could tell works really nicely.</p>

      <title>Steam Beta removes option to globally disable Steam Play plus Game Recording improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another fresh Steam Client Beta for Desktop and Steam Deck fixing up some bugs, plus some improvements for Game Recording.</p>
<p>There's one fix that's specific to the Steam Deck that Valve noted: "Fix overlay hanging for some games in Desktop mode after the game restarts itself". Plus one just for the Desktop client: "Fix a case where the wrong DPI scaling factor would be used for systems using a non-gnome based session with an active gnome-desktop-portal service."</p>
<p>As for the rest it's the same across both Desktop and Deck:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fix progress bar not updating during game update and move operations involving large files</li>
<li>Fix overlay hanging in some games on macOS and Linux after the game restarts itself</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Game Recording</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for automatic gain control for recording microphone</li>
<li>Added support for forcing microphone input to mono for misconfigured stereo mic setups</li>
<li>Fixed a bug preventing loading of additional programs to record audio at client start time</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Big Picture Mode</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fix keyboard input dialog in-game failing to close/re-open properly if Steam Overlay is toggled while visible</li>
<li>Fixed multi-line mode support in the dialog shown by the ShowGamepadTextInput API call in Steamworks</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Linux</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Always allow the Steam client to fallback to X11 when SDL_VIDEO_DRIVER/SDL_VIDEO_DRIVER is set to wayland.</li>
<li>Remove the UI toggle to disable Steam Play globally, correctly reflecting that Steam Play is always enabled on Linux. Steam Play was always partially active even when set to off in the UI as it is a requirement for Steam client operation.</li>
</ul>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Each week Prime Gaming, part of what you get with a subscription to Amazon Prime, add and remove various games you can claim to keep. Here's the updated list for October 25th.</p>
<p>I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"/> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play. Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now.</p>

      <title>SONIC X SHADOW GENERATIONS released and Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SEGA fans might want to check this one out. SONIC X SHADOW GENERATIONS has arrived and it has already been Steam Deck Verified by Valve. This means you should be good to go on desktop Linux too with the latest <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/proton-90-3-released-and-proton-experimental-upgraded-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-3</a>, which is what Valve set for it on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>More about it: "Shadow the Hedgehog is back with Classic and Modern Sonic in SONIC X SHADOW GENERATIONS, an all-new collection featuring two unique experiences!</p>
<p>Play as Shadow in a brand-new story campaign featuring never-before-seen abilities that prove why he’s known as the Ultimate Life Form! Speed through iconic stages from Shadow’s history, discover hidden secrets in an expansive hub world, and unlock new powers to take on Black Doom and save the world.</p>
<p>SONIC X SHADOW GENERATIONS also includes a complete remaster of the highly acclaimed SONIC GENERATIONS, a time-traveling adventure featuring a greatest-hits collection of 3D and 2D Sonic stages, now with upgraded visuals and new bonus content."</p>

<p>314 Arts have revealed their upcoming World War II zombie co-op FPS Projekt Z: Beyond Order is now set to release in Spring 2025.</p>
<p>More about it: Projekt Z: Beyond Order is an atmospheric first-person zombie co-op shooter set in WW2.

<p>More info:</p>

<li>Deep Weapon Customization - Build and customize an array of weapons to obliterate zombies into decaying pieces of flesh. Scavenge for supplies and blueprints to upgrade guns and melee weapons at the Hideout workbench to best match your playstyle. Use weapon modifiers to make your firearms even more powerful.</li>
<li>Free Roam Mode - After completing a level, dive into Free Roam Mode to explore the mysterious island further to battle terrifying zombies, find loot and blueprints, take on side missions and more!</li>

<li>Gather Loot - Survive the island one day at a time by looting its valuable resources for weapons, medical supplies, ammo, blueprints and more.

</ul>

      <title>Rockstar Games Launcher (GTA V, Red Dead Redemption) gets updated for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rockstar Games released an update to the Rockstar Games Launcher which actually includes an improvement for Steam Deck players.</p>
<p>Even though they're still <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/grand-theft-auto-v-gets-battleye-anti-cheat-breaks-online-play-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blocking GTA Online in GTA V</a> for Linux platforms like Steam Deck (single-player works) and claiming they never supported it anyway, they're still improving things for Steam Deck players elsewhere.</p>
<p>The update for the Rockstar Games Launcher for October 24th <a href="https://support.rockstargames.com/articles/34741693164819/Rockstar-Games-Launcher-Title-Update-1-0-97-2200-Notes" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[October 24, 2024] - Miscellaneous</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that resulted in the Rockstar Games Launcher not resizing when maximized.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that resulted in titles not uninstalling correctly.</li>
<li>Improvements have been made to how titles are launched on Steam Deck.</li>
<li>Improvements have been made to the stability of the Rockstar Games Launcher.</li>
</ul>

<p>Useful for anyone playing Grand Theft Auto V single-player, Red Dead Redemption 2 and the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/red-dead-redemption-and-undead-nightmare-come-to-pc-on-october-29/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC release of Red Dead Redemption and Undead Nightmare</a> that arrive on October 29th.

      <title>Deadlock from Valve gets 6 new experimental heroes and new stylized rendering of heroes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve continue expanding their upcoming game Deadlock, the online third-person MOBA shooter. The latest update is quite a big one too.</p>
<p>The first major addition is the inclusion of 6 new heroes in the Hero Labs, a new experimental matchmaking mode. Valve said the goal is to get early feedback on these newbies, whose names aren't final but for now they are: Holliday, Calico, Wrecker, Fathom, Viper and Magician.</p>
<p>Additionally, Valve also completely changed how they actually render the heroes. Using a brighter and more stylized display to improve visibility. As their example shows it's quite an improvement:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20123320511729858213gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20123320511729858213gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Numerous other changes were added too including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added Commends. You can commend players you've enjoyed playing with during the game or in the post-game scoreboard (same places you would report). The number of commends you've received on each hero will be displayed in your profile.</li>
<li>Added sequential kill streak music cues.</li>
<li>Added keybinds for "Fly Up" and "Fly Down". Used for flying abilities like Ivy's Air Drop and Vindicta's Flight</li>
<li>You can now drag and drop build categories to move them around</li>
<li>Added quick-selection for favorite builds. Clicking on the name of your currently active build in the shop will bring up a dropdown that lets you switch between favorited builds for that hero without opening the build browser.</li>
<li>Various new sound effects.</li>
<li>Lots of gameplay and hero balancing changes.</li>
<li>Some map changes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>See the <a href="https://forums.playdeadlock.com/threads/10-24-2024-update.40951/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">full patch notes</a>.</p>
<p>You still need an invite to access it and to run it on Linux you need <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>. It's not clear if Valve will add a Native Linux version or not and not likely until much closer to the main release if so.</p>

      <title>That&#39;s the weekend sorted! Brotato adds 4 player local co-op and Abyssal Terrors DLC out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>My favourite top-down arena shooter rogue-lite, Brotato, has a free update and big new DLC out now with Brotato: Abyssal Terrors. It's Steam Deck Verified and works great on Desktop Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>
<p>For everyone you get local co-op for up to 4 players, 4 new characters, 5 new weapons, 15 new items, new music, new accessibility options and more. By itself that would be quite a decently sized addition to the game, and free too so you certainly can't complain.</p>
<p>The co-op trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0cJ5DvHwnBE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/871e914ea3ef3cd464f7ed4a48f88f08.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0cJ5DvHwnBE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>But then there's also the Brotato: Abyssal Terrors DLC that adds in a new map with 20 waves of new enemies, elites and bosses! Plus 14 new characters, 16 new weapons, over 30 new items, new game mechanics, new music, new achievements and so on.</p>
<p>DLC trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="VSFmHdk9WAI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d0dc40420ebf580e28681bafcebcf92f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/VSFmHdk9WAI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For £3.39 the DLC is very reasonably priced considering the extra content, plus the free update - an easy purchase.</p>
<p>I've sunk lots and lots of hours into this one, and now it's about to absolutely destroy my time once again. Definitely looking forward to some co-op chaos. Absolutely wonderful. If you've still not picked it up you're really missing out.</p>

      <title>Slay The Princess Review: As Pristine As The Blade Cuts Deep</title>
      <author>alexa_bement</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One year later, the path in the woods has been well-traveled, the Princess has been slain or saved many times over, and at the end of that path is the Pristine Cut major free update, the expansion on the base game that aims to fill in what's missing and bring the game to a completed state.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="l9S92mzFAkw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ea2a5d242a6a4ceba95d5c33b09b6899.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/l9S92mzFAkw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Now that it's out, did the Pristine Cut elevate the already masterful base game to new heights? Let's find out what's in the cabin in chapter two:</p>
<p></p>
<h3 style="color:#aaaaaa; font-style:italic">The Story --- No path in the woods left untraveled</h3>
<p>The characters and themes of Slay The Princess were some of the strongest points of the original release. With the Pristine Cut additions, I can safely say my minor complaints of feeling some routes had more depth than others have been fixed. Everything that was expanded upon in the Cut adds to the overarching theme by exploring the nooks and crannies left out. With the new full game, you see every part of the theme at hand play out, leaving you with no stone unturned to understand the story. You will also get to see a few 'what if' scenarios play out that I didn't even think the game was willing to explore. All of the characters, who were already deep to begin with, gain even more depth in the extended cut. Most of the Voices have new avenues of their character explored, with situations that make you see them for what they truly are. None of them are fully just the adjective that describes them, and I love to see that nuance from them. The Narrator in particular shocked me by showing me there is even more to him than I thought possible. And of course, we get to see even more of how the Princess feels and thinks, but the Hero is shown in new lights as well. We took for granted what he is and how he works.</p>
<p>At the end of this, I am satisfied with what I saw. I feel Slay The Princess has told its story to completion, and anything that was left murky with the original release is explored with the depth that allows you to understand everything the game is. The new chapter three from the Damsel route in particular hit as hard emotionally as the golden ending of the original game. The cacophony of emotions I felt watching that play out will stick with me.</p>
<p></p>
<h3 style="color:#aaaaaa; font-style:italic">The Gameplay</h3>
<div>While virtually unchanged from before, there are a couple new details I appreciate the addition of. The cursor now changes even more depending on what's going on in a route, and there's a new icon for situations where you no longer have a hand to hold anything with. Just as before, I appreciate the level of detail present in the game. There's also a new gallery of still art unlocked as you go along finding each outcome, a welcomed and valuable addition to make it easier to find and appreciate all the frames that went into this masterpiece.</div>
<h3 style="color:#aaaaaa; font-style:italic"></h3>
<h3 style="color:#aaaaaa; font-style:italic">Conclusion</h3>
<p>With the Pristine Cut additions, I can officially say Slay The Princess elevated itself to a 10/10 experience. The routes no longer feel uneven, the story is even deeper and more beautiful, anything that was missing has been added, you have the TAB key to skip dialogue you've seen before, and just about all of the minor route logic errors have been fixed over time. Slay The Princess is a masterpiece, plain and simple, one that will leave you satisfied with this horrifically beautiful love story. The team set out to make it even better, and they most definitely made it even better. This free DLC gives the game the complete package it deserved. The Pristine Cut sends this absolute labor of love off with a beautiful waltz out of the cabin.</p>
<p>So open up your game and get ready to walk down the path in the woods again- there's more Princesses to slay and save, and a lot more to learn about yourself and the Voices in your head. We're sending off one of the best indie horrors with a final bow and a closing of the pages.</p>
<p>Slay The Princess has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified!</p>
<p>Pristine Cut Review Score: <strong>10/10</strong></p>

      <title>Croc Legend of the Gobbos remaster will be a GOG exclusive</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/argonaut-games-announced-a-return-with-a-remaster-of-croc-legend-of-the-gobbos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Back in August</a> I reported on the new remaster of the classic Croc Legend of the Gobbos, and today it has been revealed it will be a <a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> exclusive on PC. The release will have both the classic version and the remastered version available on GOG.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Wsd8f6P4uJA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/252304dc1454571f901355204ab3d18e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Wsd8f6P4uJA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Remaster</strong><br/>
<br/>
With enhanced HD graphics, modern control mechanics with an updated camera, retro video modes, and the same delightful gameplay that charmed all of us in the 1990s, you’ll dive into a beautifully recreated world filled with vibrant colors, captivating landscapes, and playful challenges to ignite your imagination. The remaster offers a true blend of nostalgia and modern gameplay, ensuring an authentic experience that pays homage to the original while inviting a new generation to discover its timeless magic.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>The Classic</strong><br/>
<br/>
While we suspect that the original Croc needs no introduction, here’s how it was described to gamers all the way back in 1997:<br/>
<br/>
<em>Croc's Got The Moves!<br/>
<br/>
Help Croc, the humble little green crocodile, rescue his peace-loving Gobbo friends from the grasp of the evil sorcerer Baron Dante. Guide him through a beautifully-rendered 3D world on a free-wheeling, free-roaming adventure against Dante’s impish assistants the Dantinis!</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>5 different 3D worlds to explore including volcanoes, ice glaciers, and underwater caves</em></li>
<li><em>Free roaming, stunningly rendered real time 3D gameplay lets you go anywhere as you run, jump, climb, swim…</em></li>
<li><em>More than 40 levels, enemies galore, and bosses to keep you busy!</em></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From the press release: “The Croc remaster aims to reignite the imaginations of players with its enhanced HD graphics, updated modern controls, and an authentic gameplay experience that will transport players back to the golden age of gaming,” said Jez San, Argonaut Games’ founder.</p>
<p>“Croc Legend of the Gobbos is both a nostalgic return for retro-gamers and an exhilarating new adventure for first-timers. We have dedicated ourselves to bringing this remaster to as wide an audience as possible so that fans of PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, Xbox, and PC on GOG can experience the magic and enjoyment of Croc," added Jez San.</p>
<p>“Croc represents the heart of our mission: preserving and celebrating the legacy of gaming. By offering both the classic and the remastered versions in one package and keeping all our games DRM-free, we’re ensuring that players not only relive the magic but have the true sense of ownership, as well. We’re the ultimate destination for gamers who want to experience timeless classics as they were meant to be played, and we couldn’t be happier for Croc to become a part of this adventure,” said Bartosz Kwietniewski, Head of Business Development at GOG.</p>

<p>So with that you'll need some form of Wine / Proton to run it on Linux / Steam Deck. My favourite being the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/heroic-games-launcher-2152-released-fixing-amazon-gog-and-epic-games-issues/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a>.</p>

      <title>AYANEO tease the AYANEO 3 as a &#39;revolution&#39; and a &#39;completely new concept&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Unlike Valve who confirmed again recently they are <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/valve-still-waiting-on-a-generational-leap-for-steam-deck-2-but-its-coming/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">waiting for a generational leap for a Steam Deck 2</a>, AYANEO are doing yet another handheld with the AYANEO 3.</p>
<p>A few days ago AYANEO put up a <a href="https://ayaneo.com/article/855" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> full of fancy marketing wording like how it's a "revolution in AYANEO's product definition, changing gamer's imagination of handheld consoles" and that it's "not only a technological leap, but also a completely new concept, which to some extent foreshadows the future possibilities of handheld devices".</p>
<p>The marketing speak continues with zero actual details on, well — anything at all really. They're really hyping this one up though claiming it "symbolizes the new direction of gaming handheld" and that the "future has arrived". <em>Okay then. Whatever you say.</em></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SE7dawzHuAw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3ea22264beb61ddf628632cb5b74b464.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SE7dawzHuAw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Obviously it will ship with Windows, just like all their previous handhelds, but it likely won't be too long after release until it's supported by the likes of the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steamos-alternative-bazzite-adds-support-for-onexplayer-plus-improvements-for-rog-ally/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">popular SteamOS alternative Bazzite</a> which supports lots of different handheld gaming PCs. AYANEO did try for Linux once, and then promptly <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/ayaneo-next-lite-no-longer-ships-with-steamos-like-holoiso-linux-windows-11-instead/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">backtracked on that</a>.</p>
<p>What to expect? Good question. Most likely is AYANEO adding in the latest generation of AMD chips inside to give it another boost in performance. Aside from that? Well their marketing lingo makes it sound like it might have a new shell design. Who knows, I guess we'll find out soon won't we.</p>

      <title>Which Way Up: Galaxy Games is a gravity-bending party platformer inspired by Mario Galaxy</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gravity-bending party platformer Which Way Up: Galaxy Games from Turtle Flip Studio plans to release in early 2025 with a demo available and it's crowdfunding on Kickstarter to help it expand. Inspired by Mario Galaxy, you compete in various acrobatic gravity events in this low-gravity platformer.</p>
<p>More about it: "Perform graceful gravity gymnastics, sprint away from the relentless pull of a black hole and launch your competitors into space as you battle through round after round in this gravity-defying party game! Keep playing to unlock new events! Cherry-pick your favourites for a winning edge.</p>
<p>Which Way Up gives you a unique freedom of movement not frequently felt in platformers. Experience running on walls and ceilings, orbiting around planets, or falling across an entire level by manoeuvring through gravity fields. The varying designs of the levels &amp; game modes can make you feel like you are enclosed in a small room or that you might float away into the emptiness of space. Each game mode has different objectives, creating many opportunities for chaos, sabotage and mischief."</p>

      <title>Raspberry Pi launch their own SSDs and SSD Kits, along with SD Cards</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Raspberry Pi have recently expanded their hardware offerings with their own SSDs and SSD Kits, plus they're also selling their own SD Cards now too. Giving you some more chances to turn your Raspberry Pi 5 into a full-blown desktop at a low cost with good performance.</p>
<p>Earlier this month they <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/sd-cards-and-bumper/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">released</a> branded SD Cards and the silicone Raspberry Pi Bumper you can just snap onto the board to protect it. The SD Cards were made in partnership with Longsys, so you at least know they're going to be legit and work properly. These are available across 32GB, 64GB and 128GB.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12307269521729762475gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>And just this week they've also now <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-ssds-and-ssd-kits/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">launched</a> Raspberry Pi SSDs and SSD Kits. Available across 256GB and 512GB these use the M.2 2230 form factor. You can buy the SSDs separately, or you can buy them as a kit with the also newly launched Raspberry Pi M.2 HAT+ to actually plug them in. Making it super simple to get started.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental gets a big change for video playback in games on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a new update to Proton Experimental with a big change for how they handle video playback, and hopefully give a nice compatibility boost for Windows games on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The update released today, October 23rd, has a <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a> that notes fixed or improved video playback for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gal*Gun 2</li>
<li>SOULCALIBUR VI</li>
<li>Call of Cthulhu</li>
<li>All-Star Fruit Racing</li>
<li>Greedfall</li>
<li>Onimusha: Warlords</li>
<li>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night</li>
<li>Indigo Park: Chapter 1</li>
<li>Agony Unrated</li>
<li>TELEFORUM</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/857883721729708099gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Call of Cthulhu</em></p>
<p>In the linked GitHub <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/8186" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">issue</a> developer Arek Hiler mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Living true to its name <em>Proton Experimental</em> will serve as a vehicle to <strong>roll out and test a new implementation of media source</strong>. While it improves video playback in many games and enables us to fix even more things in the future, the change is substantial and may cause regressions.</p>
<p>We've done extensive internal testing and made the changes available via the bleeding-edge beta branch already. Now it's time to push this experiment even further - into the default Proton Experimental.</p>
<p><strong>In case of regressions in video playback please report them here.</strong><br/>
There's a beta branch named <code class="inline-code">old-media-source</code> (select Proton Experimental in your Steam Library -&gt; cog icon -&gt; Properties -&gt; Betas -&gt; and select the branch from the beta participation drop-down).</p>
<p>If you face any issues please make sure that they are not present with <code class="inline-code">old-media-source</code> before reporting them here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">While the above list notes improved games, there's also some games with known issues right now with it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resident Evil 7 videos fail to play.</li>
<li>Resident Evil Village videos fail to play.</li>
<li>Quantum Break videos have green flashes and intermittent crashes.</li>
<li>Shin Megami Tensei III has intermittent video playback failure.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's changes like this that's why I always advise you to stick to the main versions of Proton, the latest being Proton 9, unless you specifically need Proton Experimental - as it can come with breakage.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA detail new GPU driver vulnerabilities in their October 2024 Security Bulletin</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA have released a security bulletin to detail new security issues, so it's time to update your GPU driver once again.</p>
<p>There's six vulnerabilities being disclosed today, although the date stated is October 22nd, they only emailed it today. Only <em>one</em> of the issues noted actually affects the Linux display driver (and Windows), the rest are <em>just</em> for Windows. Here's the note on the one for Linux:</p>
<p>CVE‑2024‑0126 - "NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Windows and Linux contains a vulnerability which could allow a privileged attacker to escalate permissions. A successful exploit of this vulnerability might lead to code execution, denial of service, escalation of privileges, information disclosure, and data tampering."</p>
<p>If you're on driver versions 565.57.01, 550.127.05, 535.216.01 or later you're secure. Otherwise, you should probably go and update. So that explains the tiny one-liner update I covered for the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/nvidia-565-57-01-beta-has-wayland-and-hdr-improvements-plus-dxvk-and-vkd3d-optimizations/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">550.127.05 release yesterday along with the 565.57.01 Beta</a> that was also released at the same time.</p>
<p>See more in their <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5586" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">security bulletin</a>.</p>

      <title>The Rogue Prince of Persia now Steam Deck Verified with a big update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Coming in a day late for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-deck-verified-round-up-your-late-october-2024-highlights/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my recent Steam Deck Verified round-up</a>, The Rogue Prince of Persia from developer Evil Empire and publisher Ubisoft is now Steam Deck Verified with a big update out.</p>
<p>More about it: "Experience a fast-paced, challenging but accessible roguelite as you master acrobatic moves and flow seamlessly between platforming and combat. Find new weapons, equip trinkets with special effects and upgrade them to make your own builds. Discover new characters, information and areas as you try to find a way to save Persia from a Hun invasion and become the hero you have always wanted to be."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">What to expect from the update:</p>
<ul>
<li>50 new Medallions with an all-new system.</li>
<li>The Book of Heads: more secondary objectives.</li>
<li>The Rescue levels: more platforming challenges.</li>
<li>Tons of tweaks, fixes &amp; polishing.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Speaking in a post on Twitter (X), the developer <a href="https://x.com/Studio_Evil/status/1849107939576971713" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Since the last update, The Rogue Prince of Persia is Steam Deck verified!</p>
<p>A few notes though :<br/>
1. We will continue improving performance throughout Early Access.<br/>
2. The hub and later biomes may experience occasional drops in frame rate.<br/>
3. We still recommend setting the FPS to 30max in the options."</p>

      <title>Get your own UFO in the latest No Man&#39;s Sky update during a really weird Expedition</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hello Games have updated No Man's Sky again, bringing with it a reality-bending new Expedition with The Cursed.</p>
<p>Unlike some previous updates, this doesn't include some major new features elsewhere, as it seems firmly focused on this new Expedition that runs for the next two weeks. There are of course plenty of bug fixes across the whole game though.</p>
<p>So what's The Cursed all about then? Taking place in a "sort of twilight realm, straddling the boundary between one reality and the next", here the very boundaries of reality are crumbling and things will start getting pretty weird. During it you can get a few new items like an exclusive jetpack customization and the Boundary Herald Starship which looks very much like a classic UFO blended with a Millennium Falcon,</p>

      <title>EA Anti-Cheat arrives for Battlefield 1 breaking it on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's here. EA Anti-Cheat has now been rolled out into Battlefield 1, breaking another multiplayer game on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux.</p>
<p>We've known it was coming for a little while <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/battlefield-1-gets-ea-anticheat-in-september-will-be-left-broken-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">as I reported back in August</a>, EA were planning this roll-out originally for September, but it seems it was later delayed until a day ago where it's only just now become live. Battlefield 1 joins the likes of Battlefield 2042, Battlefield V, EA SPORTS WRC and Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2 that added EA Anti-Cheat <em>after</em> release and <em>all</em> now broken on Linux platforms.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7736225661729686272gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>They aren't the only games completely unplayable for Steam Deck / Linux as this EA Anti-Cheat is also in EA SPORTS FC 25, EA SPORTS Madden NFL 25, F1 24 and EA will continue using it for future multiplayer games so we can expect them all to be unplayable at release. </p>
<p>How long until they roll this out into Apex Legends to replace Easy Anti-Cheat? It must be only a matter of time now.</p>
<p>Anti-Cheat continues to be the biggest issue for gaming on Steam Deck / Linux, like how <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/grand-theft-auto-v-gets-battleye-anti-cheat-breaks-online-play-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Grand Theft Auto V is also now broken</a> due to adding in BattlEye with Rockstar refusing to enable it for Proton.</p>

      <title>Creepy retro horror game Fear the Spotlight is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fear the Spotlight from Cozy Game Pals and Blumhouse Games is a retro-styled horror game that looks like it would fit right in on the original PlayStation. It's just be re-released on Steam with Linux support. <em>Note: key provided by fortyseven.</em></p>
<p>Originally released last year, the developers took it off Steam to expand it a little with new content and fix up various reported issues. The result? A seriously tension-filled love letter to PS1 survival horror, with little nods to Silent Hill and Resident Evil, and a perfect fit for your 2024 Halloween to get in the mood.</p>
<p>Starring a bit of an odd couple, Vivian and Amy, who are very much the opposites in terms of style and personality. One night they decide to break into their high school to find a spirit board to hold a séance, and as you might expect from a horror game — it doesn't exactly go to plan.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cEo__9Fd3w8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0abbe577f8a7f351f1dfca18e1358807.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cEo__9Fd3w8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What's quite interesting is that you get to play through two different stories here. The first one that serves up as an intro into all the game mechanics, the setting and the atmosphere and then a few hours in once you finish the main story it will flip (in a way I won't spoil) so that you get a taste of things from another perspective.</p>
<p>It's not a particularly scary game (although definitely creepy) that relies on the atmosphere and not jump scares or combat. Fear the Spotlight is all about hide and seek from enemies, and all the disturbing sounds to make your heart race a little. There's plenty of puzzles to do as well, which will change how you interact with the game from the third-person exploration into more of a point and click interface that nicely splits up the exploration (and gives you a chance to breathe a little easier). The puzzles aren't particularly challenging either, so overall it's one that would be quite a nice entry into the genre and for perhaps a slightly younger adult / late teen audience to appreciate.</p>
<p>As long as you can stand the retro visuals, you're in for a bit of a treat. Visually, I think the retro look works a lot better with these types of horror games than it does other genres, it just seems more fitting somehow and Fear the Spotlight really does look and feel the part. Not an overly long game either that you can likely finish between 5-6 hours, so it won't take you forever to get through either (which works in its favour).</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support. Although, the Native Linux version has an issue where the audio will go to the wrong output (a bug that happens on Steam Deck too). So you have to manually switch it over in your system settings. Another bug I encountered was the Linux version repeatedly locking itself to 20FPS. Neither bugs are present when playing the Windows version with Proton 9.</p>

      <title>Unified launcher for Windows games on Linux (UMU) v1.1.3 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Continuing to improve compatibility with Windows games on Linux outside of Steam, the Unified launcher for Windows games on Linux (UMU) has another release out now.</p>
<p>Following on from the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/unified-linux-wine-game-launcher-umu-gets-a-first-official-release/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">first official release in early October</a>, this release focuses on various bug fixes and ensuring it works well for Lutris and the Heroic Games Launcher.</p>
<p>A refresher on what it is: forming part of <a href="https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Open Wine Components</a>, it's <em>not</em> a launcher in the sense of it being an app like Steam, Heroic Games, Lutris, Bottles, Legendary and so on. Instead, it's a tool that various apps can use to run Windows games on Linux, acting as a copy of the Steam Runtime Tools and Steam Linux Runtime that Valve uses for Proton to allow Proton to properly run <em>outside</em> of Steam. In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/zoom-platform-store-announces-new-tool-to-run-windows-games-on-linux-with-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Zoom Platform store have begun using it</a> too.</p>
<p>From the v1.1.3 <a href="https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-launcher/releases/tag/1.1.3" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue that prevented heroic and lutris from using UMU as a game installer instead of wine</li>
<li>Fixed issue where sometimes DISPLAY envvar would get lost between handoff from umu to pressure vessel</li>
<li>Refactor/cleanup of window management code under gamescope -- both lutris and heroic can fully install and run games inside gamescope while both inside or outside of flatpak now.</li>
<li>Winetricks is now fully useable through UMU and GE-Proton/UMU-Proton</li>
<li>Updated apparmor bwrap permission profile to recommendations from upstream apparmor folks</li>
<li>Added a basic shim script to allow performing modifications inside the pressure vessel container after UMU handoff has happened.</li>
<li>Cleaned up standalone flatpak script to prepare for submission upstream</li>
<li>Fixed a few places that needed lock files in place to prevent prefix corruption if multiple instances are running</li>
<li>Missing 32 bit dependencies added for Nix packaging</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We're still working out github task attachments for releases being automated. For now we're manually attaching from the latest 1.1.3 builds in the actions section. Thanks for baring with us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A refactor was submitted to Lutris to allow full UMU functionality on the lutris side:<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/lutris/lutris/commit/3a45272a35dd61f32bd164660d670f9737c4146a" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">lutris/lutris@<tt>3a45272</tt></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lutris and Heroic also should be receiving the permissions they need in flatpak soon if not already:<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/flathub-infra/flatpak-builder-lint/commit/7aa23001f49beb946a58ecfd445e66d7e0349637" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">flathub-infra/flatpak-builder-lint@<tt>7aa2300</tt></a></p>

      <title>Escape Simulator gets a free Talos Principle DLC out now, plus a paid DLC in December</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Escape Simulator from Pine Studio continues doing some really cool additions, with The Talos Principle getting a little free crossover DLC out now. As long as you have the base game, you can grab this DLC for nothing (permanently).</p>
<p>It's a one room pack, although they said it's bigger than the standard ones and take you around 45 minutes to finish it. It also looks really great and fitting with the style of Talos. </p>

<p>The developer said: "As huge fans of the series here at Pine Studio, we’ve worked hard to capture the essence of its deep philosophical themes, mind-bending puzzles, and breathtaking environments. In this DLC, players will face a series of intricate puzzles and challenges inspired by The Talos Principle universe. Whether you are a veteran of Escape Simulator or a fan of The Talos Principle, we believe this room will offer a unique, engaging experience that bridges the gap between these two beloved puzzle game worlds."</p>
<p>Additionally an Escape Simulator: Mayan DLC will release on December 5th with four new rooms, new outfits, a new soundtrack a more:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Repolished the tutorial with new graphics, some new dialog, and several bugfixes.</li>
<li>Added a tutorial sequence to teach resting until healed.</li>
<li>We did a big refactor of the options menu, cleaning up option categories and text, gating advanced options behind a checkbox, and deleting some deprecated options.</li>
<li>We did a refactor of the control bindings menu, cleaning up binding categories and text and deleting some deprecated bids.</li>
<li>Stunning Force now deals damage in up to 3 increments based on proximity to the center of the blast, as it's supposed to.</li>
<li>Fixed several small bugs.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>1.0 release date trailer below:</p>

<p>The price will be going up in a week too, so grabbing it right now would be a good idea. At the release they'll also be putting out a "Dromad Deluxe edition" that will include the game, an enhanced soundtrack and the Pets of Harvest Dawn DLC pack, with in-game companions for your character. The DLC includes pets that were originally exclusive to their Patreon supporters plus some new ones too.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA 565.57.01 Beta has Wayland and HDR improvements, plus DXVK and VKD3D optimizations</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA today released two new Linux drivers. The big one is the NVIDIA 565.57.01 Beta, along with a one-liner update in the stable 550.127.05 release.</p>
<p>The stable release driver <strong><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/details/233004/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">550.127.05</a></strong> mentions "Fixed a bug which could cause applications using GBM to crash when running with nvidia-drm.modeset=0".</p>
<p>While the bigger NVIDIA <strong><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/details/233008/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">565.57.01</a></strong> Beta includes various new features and fixes I've split below for easy reading.</p>
<p>New Features &amp; Improvements</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Re-enabled GLX_EXT_buffer_age on Xwayland. This extension had been previously disabled on Xwayland due to a bug which is now fixed.</li>
<li>Added support for mmap of exported DMA-BUF objects.</li>
<li>Added several new per-plane and per-CRTC vendor-specific properties to nvidia-drm. These properties may be used by Wayland compositors to program the GPU's color pipeline for HDR hardware acceleration.</li>
<li>Introduced a driver optimization to mitigate the performance loss from the 'd3d9.floatEmulation' option in DXVK.</li>
<li>Updated the framelock settings page of the nvidia-settings control panel to use the GTK3 theme text color rather than defaulting to white for the text color, improving legibility with some themes.</li>
<li>Implemented support for VK_EXT_depth_clamp_control.</li>
<li>Reduced some cases of stutter with OpenGL syncing to vblank while using GSP firmware.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Bug Fixes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause suspend/resume to fail when using the NVreg_PreserveVideoMemoryAllocations option: <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/issues/472" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/issues/472</a></li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused the cursor image to be truncated on Gamescope: <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope/issues/1099" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope/issues/1099</a></li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused FarCry 5 running through DXVK to display a black screen.</li>
<li>Fixed some performance regressions that were observed with Vkd3d 2.9.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause flickering in some applications when using Unified Back Buffer (UBB).</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which could cause incorrect and/or washed out colors to be displayed with HDR scanout: <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=482780" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=482780</a></li>
<li>Implemented support for VK_EXT_depth_clamp_control.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which could cause applications using GBM to crash when running with nvidia-drm.modeset=0.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause kernel crashes upon attempting KMS operations through DRM when nvidia_drm was loaded with modeset=0.</li>
</ul>
