      <title>The Last of Us on Steam Deck is not great</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here we are, another big release on Steam and sadly it's just seemingly not a good experience from my early testing. Even though it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/the-last-of-us-part-i-on-steam-deck-gets-support-from-valve-and-naughty-dog-co-president/" target="_blank">seemed like</a> we might see good support, the result is nothing of the sort.</p>
<p>Starting with the big nuisance: even though you've just downloaded it, you won't be ready to play. It will take around an hour to build the shaders on the main menu, something you'll need to do, otherwise you're likely to see worse performance. In my testing, you definitely want to wait on that being done too. Before it was done the performance was far more erratic and it ended up slowing down to a 1FPS crawl during one attempt.</p>
<p>Apart from that, it has the same issue some other bigger games have where the RAM will fill up to around 14/14.1GB as noted on the Steam Deck's performance HUD and then crash completely, often taking the Steam Deck with it for a full reboot.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5Zlbl9sGRss"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/71cd9332c2414d67c7e761672d2573f8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5Zlbl9sGRss" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Valve did give it a special Proton <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1888930/history/?changeid=18233564" target="_blank">Hotfix</a>, which doesn't seem to have done enough to make it properly playable or be something I can recommend at this time.</p>
<p>As for how it runs on desktop Linux? On my Ryzen 7 5800X and NVIDIA 2080 Ti (Fedora KDE), it gives an out of date driver warning that can be ignored to begin with. Then it took a good 30 minutes (almost to the dot) to do the shaders even with this clearly much more powerful system. When you only have a 2 hour refund window on Steam, that's not good. Now think about people who do genuinely swap between PC and Steam Deck, practically the entire refund window gone to see if you have issues with it.</p>
<p>For desktop though, you can of course get much better performance and at least on the Linux side, it actually seems to run reasonably well even at 2560x1440 with FSR set to Balanced it can mostly stick around 60FPS.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4350159611680033048gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4350159611680033048gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14808559401680033049gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14808559401680033049gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Both shots were actually 60FPS, but Plasma screenshot spikes the FPS down.</em></p>
<p>Seems it's quite a problematic port overall, as the Steam user reviews instantly went down to Mixed (Edit: and now "Mostly Negative"), with many people on Windows reporting problematic performance and constant crashes.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/the-last-of-us-part-i?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1888930/The_Last_of_Us_Part_I/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>AMD RADV driver will soon stop eating RAM with some games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Mike Blumenkrantz has continued blogging about Linux graphics driver improvements, with a fix from developer Samuel Pitoiset landing to stop the AMD RADV (Vulkan) driver eating up RAM.</p>
<p>In a blog titled "<a href="https://www.supergoodcode.com/oom/" target="_blank">Oom</a>", Blumenkrantz mentioned how it was discovered that Dota 2 was using far too much RAM. Using massif-visualizer and GFXReconstruct, they noticed how Dota 2 was eating up 3GB of RAM "just from the driver" and "nearly all of it just from in-memory shader IR". Turns out this was caused in part by using the new Graphics Pipeline Library, ongoing work to make games smoother using the <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_library.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_library</a> extension.</p>
<p>Thanks to the effort, the issue was properly identified and <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/22143" target="_blank">a fix</a> for the problem resulted in an "85% reduction in memory utilization" in Dota 2 that was being tested.</p>
<p>Since this could have potentially hit other games too, and with Graphics Pipeline Library hopefully going to be enabled by default in the next major release of the Mesa drivers, it's good to see.</p>

      <title>Dolphin Emulator for GameCube and Wii is coming to Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Giving you another easy way to download and keep it up to date, the Dolphin Emulator for GameCube and Wii is coming to Steam. Even though it's going to be on Steam, they don't dare mention Nintendo directly on the Steam page: "Dolphin is an emulator for the big N's 6th and 7th generation consoles, featuring enhancements such as increased resolution, save states, and netplay."</p>
<p>In their official <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2023/03/28/coming-soon-dolphin-steam/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, they said to expect a feature article going over the features of the Steam release later, as this has been a "product of many months of work". This will make getting it on Steam Deck easier than ever, and they've even <a href="https://twitter.com/Dolphin_Emu/status/1640589915082887168" target="_blank">confirmed</a> it will support Cloud Saves too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15068793831679993069gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15068793831679993069gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Naturally, the Steam release is just the emulator, you will still need to have your own copy of games to run in it.</p>
<p>They haven't given an exact date, other than the plan is to have it in Early Access on Steam by the end of 2023. They're going with Early Access as some Steam specific features aren't finished yet, plus they want to gather feedback on what people want from the Steam release.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1941680/Dolphin_Emulator/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Roguelite dungeon crawler Netherguild arrives on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now available in Early Access, if you're looking for a roguelite dungeon crawler take a look at Netherguild.</p>
<p>From solo developer David Vinokurov, Netherguild is a turn-based tactical roguelite dungeon-crawler where you play as the leader of the Netherguild - controlling your little voxel fighters in expeditions below the earth in a desperate attempt to find a cure to a strange plague. Explore, camp, and fight as far as you can before heading back to resupply.</p>
<p>The developer mentioned Early Access will continue for a couple of years, as they continue to add new content and polish the experience with community feedback. New trailer can be seen below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Sn75aKmif1U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/507a358d993150406bf9b3171dbbb22e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Sn75aKmif1U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Turn Based Combat</strong>: With no attack RNG, so you can count on your units and know when to engage enemies and when to fall back.</li>
<li><strong>Bonfires:</strong> and a food system which affects your characters with passive effects throughout their expedition.</li>
<li><strong>Oddities:</strong> random events you discover which present choices underground.</li>
<li><strong>Replay Value: </strong>with random equipment, random character backgrounds with different skills each playthrough and procedurally generated levels every time you descend underground mean that playthroughs feel different every time.</li>
<li><strong>Roguelite with Persistence and Story:</strong> Keep your characters at the end of each expedition (if they survive), equip them with powerful items and level them up over time. Netherguild's story progresses the more you explore and find out about the secrets of its world.</li>
<li><strong>Dungeon Crawling Resource Management:</strong> Balance powerful abilities across long expeditions underground.</li>
<li><strong>Original Game World:</strong> Netherguild is unconventional low-fantasy; No Orcs, no Elves, and no wizards casting fireballs. Expect to find strange creatures, machines and denizens far underground.</li>
<li><strong>Cute Voxel Aesthetics:</strong> Contrasted by a story with serious themes, as you face against plague and conspiracy!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll have some proper thoughts up on it when I've had a chance to play plenty of it. I was already impressed with the early demos some time ago and it played well even then.</p>

<p>The internet is currently buzzing about mentions of Left 4 Dead 3 appearing in files for the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/counter-strike-2-from-valve-releasing-summer-2023/" target="_blank">upcoming Counter-Strike 2</a>. So apparently Valve can count to 3 — not the 3 the majority of their fans will want I imagine but still, why is it there at all in a huge upgrade for CS:GO?</p>
<p>Mentioned in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/11zghe4/left_4_dead_3_spotted_in_cs2_files/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> post, it shows up with some curious strings:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6494299221679917553gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6494299221679917553gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>This has led some other news sites to run headlines like "Left 4 Dead 3 is a non-priority", because it makes for a great bit of clickbait, even though it also says the severity is "high". Realistically, no one outside of Valve will even know what these strings are actually doing.</p>
<p>Left 4 Dead 2 is easily one of my absolute favourites from Valve, so I'm cautiously excited over this. Clearly Valve are slowly getting back into actual games. We had the fantastic (and one of my all-time favourite experiences) with Half-Life: Alyx, Counter-Strike 2 coming this Summer and then who knows what? Valve hit a home-run with the Steam Deck as well, and clearly what has been announced for Counter-Strike 2 has a lot of people excited so it would be good to see them keep up this momentum.</p>
<p><em>What do you think? Might we get a Left 4 Dead 3 announcement at some point?</em></p>

      <title>Halls of Torment is classic Diablo meets Vampire Survivors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ah hell, going to say goodbye to any free time I had for the next month. Halls of Torment has sucked me right in being a blend of retro Diablo and Vampire Survivors.</p>
<p>I have to admit, I'm pretty sure I scrolled away from this on Steam the first time it came up, thinking it didn't look like much. Until the developer prodded me on Twitter, so I decided I might as well. Checking it out was a bad idea because I'm now going to be spending every spare moment playing the free Prelude until the main game enters Early Access later this year.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="GCVIaeK504g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e30f4e84ece6af502265aab138b63ab5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/GCVIaeK504g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I'm already a big fan of these <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/a-genre-is-born-horde-games/" target="_blank">horde games</a> / Vampire Survivors-likes, and so far most of them have given something unique that they all become worth playing. Here, it isn't just the retro pre-rendered Diablo-like style that it has going for it, although it is pretty nice for fans of the classic.</p>
<p>You do run around auto-attacking, picking up gems and levelling up like the others but here a level up is just a stat boost. To get new abilities, you need to actually explore the map and pick up pages. On top of that, you also pick up equipment much more like a traditional ARPG. Together, it has very nicely blended two similar genres but with the now very well known theme from Vampire Survivors.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17947119051679916230gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17947119051679916230gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18376219661679916227gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18376219661679916227gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Content included in the free Prelude:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>2 stages with dynamic progression.</li>
<li>3+ unique bosses.</li>
<li>15+ unique monsters.</li>
<li>3+ playable characters.</li>
<li>6+ different and upgradable abilities.</li>
<li>8+ blessings making you stronger for each attempt.</li>
<li>30+ different items to unlock and retrieve.</li>
<li>100+ traits that upgrade characters and abilities.</li>
<li>30+ quests to complete.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The boss battles are impressive too, I will admit my real surprise here facing the first big demon that appeared with it using a blend of attacks against me, caught me a bit off-guard after mowing-down a ton of skeletons.</p>

      <title>AMD detail more on FSR 3 and their new open source FidelityFX SDK</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AMD had plenty to show off at GDC, and they've done a bit of a summary and some of it is quite exciting for future games.</p>
<p>FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) is open source and they will be sticking to that with the MIT license, with FSR 3 getting some more early details but they said it's still too early to show a lot of it. As explained in their <a href="https://gpuopen.com/gdc-2023-fidelityfx-sdk-fsr3/" target="_blank">GPUOpen</a> post they're introducing "interpolated frames" which has allow them to get a "2x framerate boost". It's more complex though with some challenges:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>We can’t rely on color clamping to correct the color of outdated samples.</li>
<li>Non-linear motion interpolation is hard with 2D screen space motion vectors, which is why we recommend at least 60fps input.</li>
<li>If the final frames are interpolated, then the UI and all post-processing will also need to interpolated.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there is good news!</p>
<ul>
<li>There’s a high probability there will be at least one sample for every interpolated pixel.</li>
<li>There’s no feedback loop as the interpolated frame will only be shown once – any interpolation artifact would only remain for one frame.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19997125221679670271gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19997125221679670271gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>With FSR 3 you're going to get better framerates at the cost of latency. However, they said they will be including "latency reduction techniques to FSR 3". AMD also said it should be easier to integrate FSR 3 if developers already support FSR 2.</p>
<p>Additionally they've announced the FidelityFX SDK, also open source, which combines together their multiple effects libraries giving developers an easier way to integrate it. As previously their stuff has all been spread-out, causing problems for developers with "inconsistencies in coding and documentation standards, limited platform/API support" and so this SDK is their attempt to to "do better".</p>

      <title>vkd3d 1.7 is out now for the Wine translation layer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The <a href="https://www.winehq.org/" target="_blank">Wine</a> team just announced the release of vkd3d version 1.7, their Direct3D 12 to Vulkan translation layer. Not to be confused with VKD3D-Proton, Valve's own fork of it with a focus on gaming with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>
<p>Here's the main highlights of vkd3d 1.7:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Support for many more HLSL features and intrinsics.</li>
<li>Much improved support for the Direct3D shader model 1/2/3 HLSL profiles.</li>
<li>Public vkd3d-shader API for parsing and serialising DXBC blobs.</li>
<li>Miscellaneous bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The full changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*** libvkd3d-shader<br/>
<br/>
- New features for the HLSL source type:<br/>
  - Support for calling user-defined functions.<br/>
  - Support for array parameters to user-defined functions.<br/>
  - Much improved support for the Direct3D shader model 1/2/3 profiles.<br/>
  - Support for the SV_DispatchThreadID, SV_GroupID, and SV_GroupThreadID<br/>
    compute shader system-value semantics.<br/>
  - Support for the optional "offset" parameter of the texture object Load()<br/>
    method.<br/>
  - Support for the all() intrinsic function.<br/>
  - Support for the distance() intrinsic function.<br/>
  - Support for the exp() and exp2() intrinsic functions.<br/>
  - Support for the frac() intrinsic function.<br/>
  - Support for the lit() intrinsic function.<br/>
  - Support for the reflect() intrinsic function.<br/>
  - Support for the sin() and cos() intrinsic functions.<br/>
  - Support for the smoothstep() intrinsic function.<br/>
  - Support for the sqrt() and rsqrt() intrinsic functions.<br/>
  - Support for the step() intrinsic function.<br/>
  - Support for the transpose() intrinsic function.<br/>
  - Support for the case-insensitive variants of the "float" and "dword" data<br/>
    types.<br/>
  - Partial support for minimum precision data types like "min16float". These<br/>
    are currently interpreted as their regular counterparts.<br/>
  - Improved constant propagation support, in particular to constant<br/>
    propagation through swizzles.<br/>
<br/>
- HLSL static variables are now properly zero-initialised.<br/>
<br/>
- The Direct3D shader model 4 and 5 disassembler outputs sample counts for<br/>
  multi-sampled resource declarations.<br/>
<br/>
- New interfaces:<br/>
  - vkd3d_shader_parse_dxbc() provides support for parsing DXBC blobs.<br/>
  - vkd3d_shader_serialize_dxbc() provides support for serialising DXBC blobs.<br/>
  - vkd3d_shader_free_dxbc() is used to free vkd3d_shader_dxbc_desc<br/>
    structures, as returned by vkd3d_shader_parse_dxbc().<br/>
  - The VKD3D_SHADER_COMPILE_OPTION_WRITE_TESS_GEOM_POINT_SIZE compile option<br/>
    can be used to specify whether SPIR-V shaders targeting Vulkan<br/>
    environments should write point sizes for geometry and tessellation<br/>
    shaders. If left unspecified, point sizes will be written.</p>

      <title>Rogue: Genesia is another horde survivor (Vampire-like?) game worth a look</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>These Vampire Survivor-like horde survival games are still all the rage, and I keep discovering more. Rogue: Genesia is another, with Native Linux support and it is rated Steam Deck Playable.</p>
<p>While the basics of the game are Survivor-like with you facing off against various waves of enemies, auto-firing weapons, picking up gems to eventually level up and pick from randomised powers / equipment it does have some major differences too. The main mode is set up more like Slay the Spire, where you pick locations to explore through a map which could be a normal fight spawning lots of enemies, a boss fight, a chest and so on. However there is also a plain endless survival mode too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8ooEvLDmViM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/89d66f4c783c58b8c959b45c107f2dbf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8ooEvLDmViM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In terms of artwork it looks a lot more like the Octopath Traveler series from Square Enix. I genuinely love the style to this one, it's so different to all the rest.</p>
<p>As you go through it, you also unlock more locations and there's lots of different builds you can make. It's in Early Access so it's not finished and seems like it won't be finished for quite some time. Even so, it's a lot of fun to play through even now and worked pretty great on both Desktop Linux and Steam Deck (with settings turned down to Low).</p>
<p>I also still don't know what to call these types of games. Has the industry settled in a term for it yet? Horde survival? Vamp-like? Survivor-like? There <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/a-genre-is-born-horde-games/" target="_blank">sure is a lot of them</a>.</p>

      <title>Build your own racecar in Revhead, now with added Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Revhead, a racing sim all about actually building your own vehicle, recently had an upgrade with the developer now supporting the Steam Deck. It also has Native Linux support. Not one I've actually written about at all before, somehow the original release was missed in a sea of games back in 2017.</p>
<p>About it: "Revhead is a car racing simulation game, where you have to build your own race car. You have a friend Charlie, who is busy with building race cars. He would need some help from you and he invites you to Australia. You start your journey somewhere in a small town in Australia, where the only way to get recognised if you are able to build the fastest and best racing car around. You have Charlie, his expertise and his garage. The rest is up to you!"</p>

<p>From the March 22nd patch:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added new race location to the Airport (only open at late night).</li>
<li>Added some new brand limited race for night race at Airport.</li>
<li>Fixed some AI related braking issue at drag races.</li>
<li>Fixed duplicated controller issues.</li>
<li>Fixed some localizations.</li>
<li>Game now supports Steam Deck.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For Steam Deck support, Valve tested it on the Native Linux build and gave it a Playable rating recently, as some text can be a bit small and you need to manually bring up the keyboard (STEAM + X).</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/589760/Revhead/" target="_blank">find it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Framework reveal new laptop with modular graphics, plus an AMD Ryzen model</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Framework Computer Inc have done it again! They've announced multiple big exciting things for their modular laptops today. Here's what's coming.</p>
<p>If you've not heard of them before, you're going to want to keep a close eye on what they're doing. Giving you a laptop that you can build and upgrade yourself, along with pre-built options and good Linux support too. They even send hardware to Linux distribution developers to make sure they get hooked up nicely.</p>
<p>Firstly, they announced today they're upgrading to 13th Gen Intel (i5-1340P / i7-1360P or i7-1370P) and​​​​ now including an AMD Ryzen (7040 series 5 / 7) option for their 13 inch model. They're also releasing an upgraded battery from 55Wh to 61Wh that's compatible with the previous models. There's a new Matte screen, improved hinges, a more powerful speaker (taken from their Chromebook model) and it will be more customizable than ever with you being able to change the frame around the screen.</p>
<p>Even more exciting is their entirely new 16 inch model, which has more expansion slots for the various modules available to slide into it. The special bit about this model: it has a whole new expansion bay that supports a <em>modular</em> GPU (amongst other things). That's right, finally a proper customizable laptop where you can slot in a new GPU easily.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4185922831679592591gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4185922831679592591gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20925854051679592592gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20925854051679592592gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>In the shots above, the first is without the expansion, the second with it. As you can see, it gets a bit of a bigger bottom, so a more powerful GPU might extend a fair bit. They designed it this way so it's easier to replace, since it's not buried deep inside, and to allow for more space for future GPUs. They've designed the expansion modules much like the motherboard, so these expansion bay modules can be used in their own case outside the laptop for other things, including turning it into an eGPU enclosure to use on another laptop (like the newer Framework 13).</p>
<p>This larger 16 inch Framework is also even more customizable, since the whole input deck (the keyboard area) can be customized too. You could put in a numpad, have an RGB keyboard, another small display and so on.</p>
<p>Framework are also expanding shipping into Belgium, Italy, Spain, and Taiwan later this year.</p>
<p>Finally, they teamed up with Cooler Master to produce a transparent case for the Framework 13 Mainboard, so you can easily turn it into a standalone system.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/977700141679593363gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/977700141679593363gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>The live <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccpsyRipHlk" target="_blank">event</a>, which really didn't have great audio and video quality, was overall fun to watch. Lots of love for Linux from Framework, with plenty of what they're doing open source for developers to work with and create things for.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA 530.41.03 driver out now for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA has today released their latest stable driver <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/download/driverResults.aspx/200492/en-uk" target="_blank">530.41.03</a> update for Linux users, following on from the 530.30.02 Beta last month.</p>
<p>Here's everything that's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added an application profile to avoid performance problems in Xfce 4 when the OpenGL compositor backend is enabled along with G-SYNC.</li>
<li>Added support for suspend and resume when using GSP firmware.</li>
<li>Moved the nvidia-settings application icon into the 'hicolor' icon theme, which allows it to be customized by other icon themes selected in the desktop environment.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented PRIME render offload from working for Wayland applications when running on a system with an AMD iGPU.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented nvidia-installer from recording kernel log output to the installer log in some module loading failure paths.</li>
<li>Changed nvidia-installer to no longer use the $XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variable. XDG data files are now installed to a path specified by the --xdg-data-dir option, or /usr/share if not specified.<br/>
This fixes a problem when Flatpak is installed that caused the installer to place the nvidia-settings.desktop file in /root/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share/applications.</li>
<li>Changed the behavior of glXGetRefreshRateSGI() for non-integer refresh rates to round to the nearest whole number rather than truncating.</li>
<li>Changed the compression format of the .run installer package from xz to zstd. This results in a smaller compressed package, and faster decompression performance. A fallback zstd decompressor is embedded into the installer package for systems which do not already have a zstd decompression program installed.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused nvidia-installer to mistakenly unload some already loaded non-NVIDIA kernel modules.</li>
<li>Added compatibility for Linux kernels with Indirect Branch Tracking (IBT).</li>
<li>Added NV-CONTROL attributes NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_MULTIPLY_DIVIDE_MODE and NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_MULTIPLY_DIVIDE_VALUE to allow syncing a Quadro Sync II card to different House Sync signal rates. This feature requires firmware version 2.18 or later; to download the latest firmware version, please visit:<br/>
<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/firmware/quadro-sync-firmware-driver/" target="_blank">https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/firmware/quadro-sync-firmware-driver/</a></li>
<li>Added support for the VK_KHR_video_queue, VK_KHR_video_decode_queue, VK_KHR_video_decode_h264 and VK_KHR_video_decode_h265 extensions.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause the nvidia-settings control panel to crash when resetting the display layout.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause excessive GPU power consumption at idle when driving multiple displays with a high refresh rate.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in nvidia-powerd which could cause excessive CPU usage.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue which could cause applications to run at 1 FPS when using an NVIDIA PRIME Display Offload sink as the only active display.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>NVIDIA also recently released the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" target="_blank">Vulkan Beta</a> 525.47.14 and 525.47.15 for developers which include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_map_memory2.html" target="_blank">VK_KHR_map_memory2</a></li>
<li>VK_NV_displacement_micromap
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/Displacement-MicroMap-Toolkit" target="_blank">NVIDIA Displacement Micro-Map Toolkit</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Update VK_NV_displacement_micromap to work better on pre-Ada RTX GPUs</li>

      <title>Xwayland Video Bridge created to improve Linux screen sharing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the move between X11 and Wayland still ongoing, and likely won't finish for years, problems keep coming up like screen sharing but <em>XwaylandVideoBridge</em> may help solve this.</p>
<p>This new tool written by Aleix Pol and David Edmundson is designed to allow much easier sharing of screens and windows between X11 and Wayland, which should help to ease the transition from X11 to Wayland. The problem is that currently in the likes of Discord, MS Teams, Slack, Zoom and others that you run through Xwayland, you may end up with a black screen and no windows listed — this should solve it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19119635461679584274gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19119635461679584274gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em>Picture credit: David Edmundson</em></p>
<p>Hopefully in future things like this won't be needed, as everything moves over to Wayland. Still, it's good to have tools available for legacy apps that won't get updated and great for the next few transition years. </p>
<p>As the developers on it say it should work "on any desktop that supports the Xdg desktop portals and pipewire streaming and have a working system tray".</p>

Many of these solutions have already been upstreamed, and many more are on the way. Our team has also rigorously tested, reported, and helped fix bugs with KDE, Kubuntu, and Ubuntu. This collaboration benefits our customers and the entire community, and we thank all the wonderful people on these teams that make it all possible," stated Michael Mikowski, General Manager.</p>

      <title>Atari are acquiring Night Dive Studios</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well that is certainly unexpected news. Atari has entered into an agreement to buy up Night Dive Studios. Night Dive Studios are responsible for the upcoming System Shock remake, Forsaken Remastered, Turok and Turok 2 remasters, Blood Fresh Supply, Quake remaster and many more.</p>
<p>Atari already owned a minority stake in Night Dive and they will now have 100%.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>Wade Rosen, Chairman and CEO of Atari, commented: “Night Dive’s proven expertise and successful track record in commercializing retro IP is well-aligned with Atari’s strategy and I am confident that their combined talent, technology and IP portfolio will contribute to Atari’s future success.”</p>
<p>Stephen Kick and Larry Kuperman, principals of Night Dive commented: “Night Dive and Atari have a long history together and we know that Atari shares our passion for retro games and our focus on producing high-quality new and remastered games that do justice to the original IP. As we look to grow our business and expand our capabilities, we could think of no better long-term partner than Atari.”</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/atari-enters-agreement-acquire-night-220300554.html" target="_blank">Yahoo Finance</a>, Night Dive Studios reported a revenue of $3 million USD for 2022, and Atari will acquire them for an initial $10 million USD half in cash and half in Atari shares, plus an "earn-out" of up to $10 million USD in cash over the next three years based on Night Dive's performance. <em>This means if Night Dive do well, they'll get more money.</em></p>
<p>The acquisition is expected to be completed in April 2023.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental fixes up Call of Duty: Black Ops III videos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another fresh small update to Proton Experimental has landed on March 22nd, here's what's new and changed for Steam Deck and Linux desktop.</p>
<p>From the release notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fix graphical issues in Call of Duty: Black Ops III while playing videos</li>
<li>Fix PooShooter: Toilet Invaders starting to a black screen.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This should mean that Call of Duty: Black Ops III is truly click and play now for Steam Deck and Linux desktop — awesome!</p>
<p>I'll admit I had to look up that second one, it is a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/514390/PooShooter_Toilet_Invaders/" target="_blank">real</a> game and someone working for Valve had to fix an issue for it, kind of hilarious. While funny, it's also a good example of how often Valve doesn't just focus on the biggest names in gaming to get them working in Proton. Bugs in one game, even a small game, can affect others.</p>
<p>Changelog can be found <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>For an explanation of all the different Proton versions see <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">my original guide on Proton</a>. Proton Experimental gets automatically installed if Valve set it on a game, or you can just search for Proton Experimental in your Steam Library (<em>not</em> the Steam Store) to install it. </p>
<p>Need to know how to change the Proton version used? See the below video:</p>

<p><strong>Text guide</strong></p>
<p>Change it per game (Steam Deck)</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a game and head to the little cog icon on the right.</li>
<li>Click Properties, then Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>On a Linux desktop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right click a game, go to Properties.</li>
<li>Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>

      <title>Counter-Strike 2 from Valve releasing Summer 2023, Limited Test starts today</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has today announced Counter-Strike 2, which will be arriving in Summer 2023 and they've released some details on what's changed. </p>
<p>This will be a big free Source 2 upgrade for Global Offensive, with some of the features being announced now including responsive smoke, sub-tick updates for more responsive gameplay, overhauled maps, Source 2 tooling for the community, your whole inventory carries over from CS:GO, higher resolution models for basically everything, improved visual effects, an upgraded UI and much much more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ExZtISgOxEQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ad48c64e228f00c3761d26f316f219cc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ExZtISgOxEQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

<p>They're doing a Limited Test too, which is based upon invitations. Seems like they have more to announce, as the limited test and the features being revealed are "a subset of Counter-Strike 2's features, so that major issues can be resolved before the summer" and they will reveal more in "a few months".</p>
<p>As for how to get into the limited test? They will be selecting people based on recent playtime, trust factor, Steam account standing and so on. If you are chosen, you get a notification inside CS:GO, so you'll need to keep checking back with more players being added over time.</p>
<p>The limited test is Windows-only but SteamDB shows it all clearly set up for Linux and macOS too. It's likely just to get the main technical testing done they're keeping the platforms smaller to get it finished.</p>

      <title>GNOME 44 is out now finally adding thumbnails to the file picker</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One thing I genuinely hated about GNOME has finally been solved with the <a href="https://release.gnome.org/44/" target="_blank">GNOME 44 release</a>. It includes some big improvements and new features.</p>
<p>As dumb as it sounds, one of the most important new features is the added grid view for the file picker. Honestly, I still can't believe it took this long but it's finally in. You can now actually see proper previews of images. As they said in the release announcement that for years GNOME users have been requesting it. Apps will need to use GTK4 though, so hopefully plenty will.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19154507471679498448gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19154507471679498448gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>There's also various security improvements, accessibility upgrades like redesigned settings for accessibility with these new features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>An over-amplification setting has been added, to increase the volume above the usual maximum threshold.</li>
<li>Under <em>Typing</em>, an option has been added to enable accessibility features using the keyboard.</li>
<li>There is now a test area for the cursor blinking setting.</li>
<li>A new setting to make scrollbars be always visible has been added to the <em>Seeing</em> section.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Sound settings also got upgraded:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Volume level control has been moved into a separate window, making the more commonly used output and input controls easier to access.</li>
<li>It’s now possible to disable the alert sound, and a new alert sound window makes it easy to browse the available sounds that are available.</li>
<li>The sound test window has been redesigned, eliminating previous scaling issues when there are many outputs, and providing a more attractive interface.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Mouse and touchpad settings were overhauled, updates to the quick settings menu like being able to see a list of running apps without a window (Flatpak only for now), the GNOME Software app should be faster now and it has better Flatpak support, the terminal app Console now has a tab overview option, you can share from the Contacts app with a QR code, the GNOME Web browser was upgraded to GTK4 and the list goes on.</p>

      <title>Amazon Luna cloud gaming launches in Canada, Germany and the UK</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="http://amazon.co.uk/playluna" target="_blank">Amazon Luna</a>, the cloud gaming service has finally expanded into more territories. They're also no longer blocking Linux.</p>
<p>Previously, you needed a few tricks to get around their blocking to get into Luna, if you were in the USA where it was supported. Now though with the expansion into Canada, Germany and the UK more people can try it out. Playing it on my Linux desktop (Fedora KDE) with Chrome, it works out of the box but you just get an unsupported device warning that you can safely skip over and then the games appear to work just fine.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4989490161679495088gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4989490161679495088gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6332424081679495372gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6332424081679495372gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“With Amazon Luna, we’re making gaming easier and more convenient by offering instant access to console-quality games on devices customers already own,” said Eric Saarnio, vice president, Amazon Devices International. “Gamers in the U.S. have been enjoying Luna for the past year so we’re thrilled to now expand the service to customers in Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom.”</p>
<p>What it offers up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Free games each month for Amazon Prime subscribers, rotated so you don't keep them.</li>
<li>Luna+ at £8.99 a month for access to various games.</li>
<li>Ubisoft+ at £14.99 a month for lots of Ubisoft games.</li>
<li>Jackbox games at £3.99 to access their party games.</li>
</ul>
<p>Prime members who also have Luna+ can link to Ubisoft Connect to play a select few Ubisoft games too.</p>
<p>They're going to have to do a lot to compete with Xbox Cloud Gaming and NVIDIA GeForce NOW, both much more established and both can work on Linux and Steam Deck too. Cloud Gaming is clearly here to stay, it just depends on who has the resources to keep it up initially and doesn't go with a crap business model like Google did with Stadia.</p>
<p><em>Will any of you be giving Amazon Luna a go? Are you already using it? What do you think?</em></p>

      <title>Warside is a pixel-art turn-based tactics game much like Advance Wars</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love turn-based tactics and classics like Advance Wars? You should keep an eye on Warside, as it's firmly channelling that same energy. It looks pretty great and with full cross-platform multiplayer on top of the story campaign, it's certainly piqued my curiosity.</p>
<p>"Warside is a new game that cuts to the core of what made classic turn-based tactics games so great. A great story mode campaign, unique Commanders with totally different playstyles, awesome Battle Powers, and a wide variety of terrain and units. Choose your Commander, assemble your forces, and battle your way to victory."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zqXzciBYJZE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c10752bf6c3d6d36d51a66a53d38583e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zqXzciBYJZE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Intuitive turn-based gameplay with a familiar feel for fans of the classics.</li>
<li>12 playable Commanders, each with unique passive skills and Battle Powers.</li>
<li>Control 20+ unit types. Simultaneously battle over land, air, and sea with ground forces, aircraft, and naval units.</li>
<li>Faction unique units with mechanics specific to each faction.</li>
<li>Single-player campaign with over 30 missions.</li>
<li>Forest, desert and snow biomes, plus indoor close-quarters missions.</li>
<li>Challenge friends and foes with multiplayer battles. Local and internet play are supported.</li>
<li>Design your own maps with the built-in mission editor for both single and multiplayer.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can help <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lavabird/warside-a-pixel-art-turn-based-tactics-game/description" target="_blank">fund it on Kickstarter</a>. It's already hit the goal with £67,743 pledged and 23 days left so clearly there's a lot of interest in these types of games. They make it clear it will have Linux support too, and they will be supporting the Steam Deck as well. Made with <a href="http://godotengine.org" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, so it shouldn't have many issues with Linux.</p>

      <title>Colourful retro platformer Frogun Encore announced for Summer 2023</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Frogun Encore is the follow-up to Frogun from Molegato and Top Hat Studios, Inc. that was released in 2022, giving more family-friendly retro inspired 3D platforming. Designed much like classics from the PlayStation 1 / Nintendo 64 era, the original reviewed reasonably well, so hopefully they will be working to address any sticking points from the original.</p>
<p>According to the press release they said it will have an "expanded move-set and greater agility for our heroes" this time giving you the ability to "Catapult off ziplines, twirl and double jump, and launch yourself skywards by shooting grabbed enemies and objects downwards" — sounds like it could be fun. You also don't need to have played the original as it's a full standalone game.</p>

<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore colorful levels as you trek across the world - explore whimsical areas and environments in stylish lowpoly aesthetic.</li>
<li>Expanded fluid movement ; jump, double jump, swing on ledges and poles, grapple, and use your trusty Frogun to navigate the environment in new, unique ways!.</li>
<li>Fight big bosses.</li>
<li>Find secret areas or shortcuts by mastering advanced jumping &amp; grappling mechanics! How nimble are you?</li>
<li>Collect emblems by fulfilling level challenges, and discover the stories of other adventurers through hidden diary notes.</li>
<li>Unlock hats for your characters and show off your swag!</li>
<li>A poseable photo mode to let you show off your creativity!</li>
<li>True Co-Op; play with your best friend and cooperate or race together towards the end of each level!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can follow it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2312160/Frogun_Encore/" target="_blank">on Steam</a>. It will have Native Linux support just like the original at release. For the release they simply said it will be sometime in "Summer 2023".</p>

      <title>Upcoming city-builder HexLands sounds like a relaxing time</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>HexLands from Portgate Studios has been announced with a new Steam page live, taking inspiration from the likes of Islanders, Dorf Romantik and Sid Meier's Civilization.</p>
<p>The idea is to give you a more casual, relaxing city-builder with high replay value and randomisation inspired by roguelikes. You build up as much as you can on an island, and keep spreading out across more islands as you go through quests and manage your resources. It gets more difficult the further you go, as they become less habitable.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vSfM2zu89Eg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ece5d44ed577d1b6c867213c0a90511c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vSfM2zu89Eg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>City building on relaxing medieval islands with various environments.</li>
<li>High replay value - Explore endless procedural islands!</li>
<li>Roguelike elements.</li>
<li>Chance management.</li>
<li>Resource management.</li>
<li>Procedural perk tree, offering you customisable playstyle.</li>
<li>Speedrun and Sandbox mode, in case you crave for something different.</li>
<li>Master the game and climb the leaderboard!  </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer made it clear it will have Native Linux support at release, which is planned to happen sometime in Q4 2023 with an "open alpha" starting soon.</p>

      <title>Mask of the Rose set to release on June 8th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mask of the Rose, the incredibly stylish upcoming dating sim visual novel from Sunless Skies creator Failbetter Games is set to now release on June 8th.</p>
<p>A bit of a delay, which they explained was due to the continued expansion on how players interact with it. They're working on making the narrative "far more responsive and dynamic than we initially anticipated". Thanks to playtesting, they're making it a whole lot more interesting but that will take just a bit more time. While they've already implemented the features they want, given how dynamic it now is they want more time to fix up bugs.</p>
<p>They also have a new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HCuYH-a-lfk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/128d9512144a12ad4f66a72270e282c1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HCuYH-a-lfk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>(Re)invent yourself:</strong> who were you before the Fall? Who will you be now?</li>
<li><strong>Create outfits from a selection of clothing and unusual accessories</strong> to unlock different story options.</li>
<li><strong>Fall in love with a cast of diverse Londoners</strong>, each with their own secrets.</li>
<li><strong>Matchmake among your friends, or seek love for yourself</strong> (by any definition you like).</li>
<li><strong>Write love stories in a delightful minigame</strong>, and use them to impress the new Masters.</li>
<li><strong>Pick up odd jobs to earn money and gather resources.</strong> How are you at rat catching?</li>
<li><strong>Solve the first murder since the Fall</strong>, with the assistance of the victim.</li>
<li><strong>Discover cosy, mysterious and magnificent locations</strong> in a dark and delicious version of Victorian London.</li>
<li><strong>Seek deeper and deeper secrets</strong> over multiple playthroughs.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Big Ambitions drops Native Linux support shortly after the Steam release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After being in Beta for a while for pre-orders, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1331550/Big_Ambitions/" target="_blank">Big Ambitions</a>, a role-playing business sim from Hovgaard Games (who previously developed Startup Company) launched in Early Access on Steam and then dropped Native Linux support.</p>
<p>It entered Early Access on March 10th, with an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1331550/discussions/1/3825284575364986029/" target="_blank">announcement</a> made in their Steam forum noting they "no longer offer native Linux support for Big Ambitions" but they will "continue supporting and testing against Proton" and they plan to get Steam Deck Verified too.</p>
<p>For players who don't see Proton as an option, they said Steam will give refunds.</p>
<p>As for why? They saw a "very high amount of non-gameplay-related bugs (random crashing, high VRAM usage, file access issues, etc.)" and noted the low amount of players on Linux so they didn't think it was "fair to the rest of our player base" to spend more time on it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1hKg7q-HifU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5ea7d9f891a3afdce48a752dd66ce596.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1hKg7q-HifU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's a shame when this happens but thanks to the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a> translation layer, it does still mean Linux players will be able to run it and in this case the developer will support it there. Unless developers have Linux expertise and extra time for the currently smaller amount of users, Proton can often just work better, because it's constantly upgraded and optimized by Valve developers.</p>
<p>They're not the first by a long stretch to do this, and they won't be the last.</p>

      <title>Girl Genius: Adventures In Castle Heterodyne has a new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rain Games, developer of the Teslagrad series, World to the West and others are still working away on Girl Genius: Adventures In Castle Heterodyne and it finally has a new trailer.</p>
<p>More about it: "Discover the award winning, gaslamp fantasy world of 'Girl Genius™', experiencing Agatha Heterodyne’s story, as she navigates the hostile hallways, catacombs and kitchens of her ancestral home, Castle Heterodyne. As the Lost Heir in the family lineage, she must repair the ancient fortress to its ancient glory, and take the throne as a "True Heterodyne". Only then can she stand up to the might of the Wulfenbach Empire and the other wild forces of Europa that are trying to take control and subjugate its people. But first, she has to contend with a corrupt sentient AI controlling the castle, the very pink villain Zola Malfeazium that is intending to take the castle for herself, and spiky deathtraps and pits of doom at every corner."</p>
<p>It's been a while for this one, with the Kickstarter for it finishing back in 2020. Their last trailer was 6 months ago, but they've regularly kept up communication with their backers and provide Alpha builds to people too. Now another 6 months of work has been shown off which you can see below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cSRddBKfEiQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/74dbe2f40fee74948e780b1d9276ae4a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cSRddBKfEiQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features Planned:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Build tools like the Grapple Gun and the Wrencherang at the Workbench, and use your tools to explore and solve the castle’s challenges.</li>
<li>Discover numerous sights and secrets, by being perceptive and using your tools to the fullest.</li>
<li>Defeat foes in furious melee combat or with explosive gadgets, and utilize the environment to your advantage using your tools.</li>
<li>Use your trusty Dingbot minion to explore places Agatha can’t get to, by digging underground and moving in tight spaces.</li>
<li>Use the Dingbot to solve lock puzzles, and operate the internal machinery in the castle.</li>
<li>As Agatha’s power over the castle grows, command the castle AI to release traps at your foes, and activate mechanisms.</li>
<li>Use the unique “Build System”, rebuilding scrap traps into objects like the Springclank, Grappleclank and the special Rollerclank, giving the player a suite of tools for creative spatial puzzle solving.</li>
<li>Interact with several of the fantastic characters from “Girl Genius™”, like Gilgamesh Wulfenbach, Tarvek Sturmvoraus and many others.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Developer of Deadnaut: Signal Lost requests Linux testers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Deadnaut: Signal Lost from Screwfly Studios is an upcoming fast-paced sci-fi roguelike with a pretty unique style. The developer got in touch, as they want plenty more Linux testing.</p>
<p>More about it: "From the developer of cult hits Deadnaut, Zafehouse Diaries and Fear Equation comes Deadnaut: Signal Lost. In this slick, fast-paced roguelike you’ll take control of a single Deadnaut, unlock suit upgrades and abilities, fight cosmic horrors, and investigate drifting wrecks and abandoned moons. But remember: your Deadnaut is not your friend – earn their trust, do your job well, and they might return the favour."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="b0pswW5arCQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8e8a1e69d3e1571b743c942fc51b2fca.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/b0pswW5arCQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can direct-download <a href="https://signal-lost.com/files/SignalLostTechDemo.tar.xz" target="_blank">their Linux build here</a>, and comment your thoughts either here in GOL comments or on their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1801410/Deadnaut_Signal_Lost/" target="_blank">Steam</a> community. Keep in mind the Linux build offered is quite limited, as they're just after reports from various systems on how it runs (and a bigger demo will be released later on). So it's your chance to give an indie developer a little helping hand. They did mention some already known issues like:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The 3D location render on the navigation screen between missions does not display correctly. It is currently disabled in the Linux version while we work on a fix, however, it can be re-enabled via the command line switch "--disable-default-workarounds" (as it might work in some configurations).</li>
<li>Screen resolution and related settings are locked during missions due to a bug in Unity 2019.4 where some render textures are not correctly reinitialised. These settings can be freely changed at any other time. Again, you can disable this lock by using the "--disable-default-workarounds" switch.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The game is built with Unity, so hopefully it won't have too many issues.</p>
<p><strong>Game Feature Highlight:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>FAST ROGUELIKE GAMEPLAY - Equip your Deadnaut with a wide array of weapons and gear and lead them through a series of procedurally generated missions, fighting where you can — and running when you must.</li>
<li>TRUST ISSUES - Your Deadnaut may not like the idea of being torn apart by unknown horrors. If you do a good job, they'll happily accompany you. If not, pay them off or turn them into a mindless space golem. But remember: everything has a price.</li>
<li>FIVE DISTINCT SUITS AND PLAYSTYLES - There are many ways to play, from weapons and sensors, to shields and hacking. Will you take the heavy duty Labour suit and slice your way through the ship, or will you slip through the shadows in the ghostly Sensor suit? Maybe you prefer you manipulating gravity, placing drones or sniping from long-range? Play the way you want.</li>
<li>HOSTILE ENEMIES, DANGEROUS ENVIRONMENTS - Encounter dozens of enemy types, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Avoid — or exploit — the security system in each level, from the Watchers that roam ships to the malfunctioning security Towers and Sentinels that guard settlements.</li>
<li>TACTICS, UPGRADES AND CUSTOMISATION - Tailor your armour and damage potential, develop your Deadnaut, and discover powerful combinations and synergies among over 180 upgrades.</li>
</ul>

      <title>MiLE HiGH TAXi out now blending Crazy Taxi with The Fifth Element</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Fifth Element and Crazy Taxi are both classics, so one developer decided to try and combine them together into a game. What they've done is make a modern Crazy Taxi-like experience, with the flying cars and style found in The Fifth Element movie. <u>Note</u>: the developer sent over a key for review.</p>
<p>Not exactly a game that needs a big introduction and explanation really: you choose a player, then fly around a big city picking up passengers and dropping them off, making as much money as you can against the timer. Having to fly up and down to particular levels, based on where you need to drop off adds a nice element to the gameplay and it does initially feel quite fun. Annoying your passengers as you fly through signs and other things and hearing them scream is also somewhat amusing.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="RQB0tHnL3qs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/51f5ad2f30db14eecef53fb720f70aa1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/RQB0tHnL3qs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Offering up a few different modes to play from including Standard where you fly around and pick up who you want, Sequential where you have a specific order and Free Roam with no goal — where you just fly around to try and learn the map. Plus either Easy or Normal difficulty modes. The idea is nice, and I think on the basics it gets a fair bit right and is initially fun.</p>
<p>As great as the idea is though, it doesn't take long for the fun to wear off. I'll be clear: it's not a bad game, and if you're after something to just race around in for a while here and there, to scratch a missing Crazy Taxi fix with the added verticality you might enjoy it. Mechanically at least, it has the driving down quite well. Sadly though, I did not enjoy it and going by Steam reviews, even people that did and left a positive review, didn't play it for long at all.</p>
<p>Full of references to other movies, it doesn't exactly have much of a personality. Which, can be a bit of a problem as it comes across pretty cheesy. I'm sure some will love that but it could have done with a bit more building up on its own world for me. </p>
<p>The gameplay is overall just too simplistic, and that's the biggest problem. While it does have a few nice touches, and a little coin collecting, it's (as expected really) just about getting passengers from A to B, and after a while of looking at the same buildings and hearing the same voice lines repeated over and over — it ends up falling a bit flat. On top of that, finding pickups can be troublesome due to the vertical 3D nature of the game, and the minimap rotating made it more confusing than it should be, as I spent half the time just looking for someone to pick up.</p>
<p>You also have a certain height restriction too, and when you approach the limit the game starts flashing warnings at you. Which is fine to keep players informed, but when you're doing pickups and dropoffs right by the limit, it's just annoying.</p>
<p>It does have some other problems, like different audio lines and music all fighting for your attention often playing on top of each other that felt more than a bit messy. Overall it has a great idea, good visuals and it runs well but it doesn't fly as high as I would have liked.</p>
<p>As a solo effort, it's thoroughly commendable, and a nice twist on the classic but not a game I'm going to recommend at this time. Fun for an hour or so but not much more than that due to the limited design and the problems mentioned.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1366560/MiLE_HiGH_TAXi/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Striving for Light: Survival blends popular horde survivor games with a big skill tree</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you enjoy games like Vampire Survivors, Brotato and the other horde survival games? You may want to look at Striving for Light: Survival. <u>Note</u>: developer sent a key to my <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4218320-GamingOnLinux/" target="_blank">Steam Curator</a>.</p>
<p>Created by Igniting Spark Games, it's now in Early Access with Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified. It's actually a sort-of spin-off from their previous game Striving for Light.</p>
<p>Their idea was to blend the ideas together from the likes of other popular arena survival games (of which there's now many), while giving you a big skill tree that is procedurally generated. The result is an experience that is certainly similar to Vampire Survivors, Brotato, Soulstone Survivors, Boneraiser Minions and the list goes on and on but different enough that it's quite exciting to play. The amount of combinations you can do during a run is just ridiculous, it's a lot more like Path of Exile.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="IBzyTPzB6PE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c115134795d448c018fb910e74946323.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/IBzyTPzB6PE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Experiment with more than 50 skills in an procedurally expanding skilltree.</li>
<li>10 maps with different enemies, traps and multiple difficulties to unlock.</li>
<li>8 different player characters.</li>
<li>Over 30 weapons to unlock.</li>
<li>Over 20 unique enemies, over 20 unique bosses and 10 unique endbosses.</li>
<li>Use dodge skillfully to avoid and escape attacks.</li>
<li>Everything is hand drawn, self-composed soundtrack with about 1 hour playtime.</li>
<li>Compete in multiple online leaderboards with seasons and private league system.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Definitely one you should take a look at, if you love repeatable games like this. It gets pretty intense. Quite a big surprise actually to me as I wasn't sold on the graphical style they went for it, but that minor point faded away very quickly once I got into the action of it and started customizing my character as I went through the skill tree.</p>
<p>At only £2.49 this is an absolute steal.</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s how to run Diablo 4 on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Diablo 4 is currently in Beta and due to launch soon, so here's how to get it working on Steam Deck. The same steps can be used to get it working on Linux desktop too.</p>
<p>You can see the video here, with the text guide below it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ESXTxFYFa48"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4efd2a7065a2e16ad23ae13281f44a26.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ESXTxFYFa48" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><strong>Text Guide</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Go into Desktop Mode (Steam button - Power - Switch to Desktop).</li>
<li>Download the <a href="http://battle.net" target="_blank">Battle.net</a> launcher in your web browser (Chrome / Firefox etc).</li>
<li>Download <a href="https://davidotek.github.io/protonup-qt/" target="_blank">ProtonUp-Qt</a> from the Discover app.</li>
<li>Inside ProtonUp-Qt, download the new "GE-Proton7-51-diablo_4_beta". Once done, close ProtonUp-Qt.</li>
<li>Inside Steam: hit Add A Game in the bottom left, select Add a non-Steam Game and hit Browse.</li>
<li>Go into your Downloads folder in the file browser, select All Files from the bottom and then select the "Battle.net-Setup.exe" file.</li>
<li>Once added, search for the Battle.Net installer shortcut in Steam. Right click -&gt; Properties -&gt; Compatibility -&gt; Tick the box and select GE-Proton7-51-diablo_4_beta.</li>
<li>Now run it and install it. Once installed, close it, do not login.</li>
<li>Right click on the shortcut again, go to Properties, hit Browse and update the shortcut to point to the "Battle.net Launcher.exe". It's location will depend on where you installed it.
<ul>
<li><u>SD Card</u>: <em>/run/media/mmcblk0p1/Battle.net/</em></li>
<li><u>SSD</u>: <em>/home/deck/.steam/root/steamapps/compatdata/ (then find the most recently created id) /pfx/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Battle.net/</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you will have Battle.Net set up and you can launch it in Gaming Mode, in the Non-Steam section of your Steam Library. You may need to manually bring up the on-screen keyboard with STEAM + X, and you can use a mouse cursor by holding the STEAM button and using the Right Trackpad with Right Trigger as a mouse button.</p>
<p>The Battle.Net UI is cut off, but if you click about along the top of it, the app will flicker into focus giving you the install buttons at the bottom.</p>
<p>After that, you're free to install and run Diablo 4. If you get a GPU error message, just hit OK and it will run.</p>
<hr/>
<p>This is just one possible way to do it. You could also use <a href="https://lutris.net/" target="_blank">Lutris</a> to install Battle.Net but I personally prefer on Steam Deck specifically to keep everything inside Steam if I can.</p>

      <title>Stellaris: First Contact Story Pack and the free 3.7 update are out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox have released the latest DLC for Stellaris with the First Contact Story Pack, along with a free update for all players. Since this is a Story Pack, it's not a full expansion. The idea really is to give dedicated players just that little bit more, good for role-playing and for building up those stories sci-fi fans love so much. This is the kind of thing I've been personally wanting.</p>
<p>The main highlights of it are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New Origins:
<ul>
<li><em>Broken Shackles: </em>You didn’t take to the stars; you were taken <em>to </em>the stars as an alien captive! Now, you and your fellow prisoners have overtaken the ship and found yourselves banding together to survive and thrive as a diverse new community. Can you rise to greatness from this humble origin… and will your former captors take notice?</li>
<li><em>Payback:</em> No one would have believed your world was being watched keenly by intelligences greater than your own - until they actually showed up. But you did not go quietly into the night! Your civilization has repelled a would-be conqueror from space, and with sudden access to their advanced technology, you’re about to discover just what else is out there beyond the stars!</li>
<li><em>Fear of the Dark:</em> As you’ve explored your home system, you’ve always suspected you weren’t alone in the galaxy… especially when one of your planets suddenly suffered an “incident” a while back. A very large faction of your own people have long advocated against tempting fate out in the dark abyss of the unknown. What path will you choose as you find yourself needing room to grow?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New Pre-FTL Interaction Options: What will your role be when the next member of the galactic community tells their origin story? New mechanics allow for a broader range of interactions with pre-FTL civilizations, depending on their level of technology and their awareness of your presence. Will your arrival be celebrated, or met with violent panic?</li>
<li>Cloaking Technology: Nobody saw this feature coming! Equip your ships with cloaking devices to survey in secret or catch a foe unaware; keep subtle tabs on your pre-FTL neighbors with cloaked observation posts. Just be sure your own scanners and intel are strong… you never know which of your neighbors might be lurking in the shadows!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_ZyJWy2yhOI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/721683e79fb4016f754bcac4276233cd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_ZyJWy2yhOI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While I am a fan, and I genuinely appreciate Paradox's commitment to the long-term support of their games, the price is a bit steep for what it offers. Enjoyable? Yes. But, I have to say that even as big a fan as I am of Stellaris, the price just doesn't feel like it matches up to the additions this time around. Origins are, for the most part, statistics tweaks and an adjustment to your start and the politics of your civ. Then we have some new interactions (which are great) for pre-FTL and then cloaking. It's not exactly a lot for £12.79, a price that could get you some entire games, and even Stellaris itself (the whole game) has been priced below that constantly and for a few pounds / dollars more you could get a full Stellaris expansion.</p>
<p>Mechanically with the theme of this DLC, it would have been a much better fit to be in a slightly bigger mini-expansion. Especially with the cloaking tech, which is a fantastic addition and one that no doubt players will love to play with.</p>
<p>Overall, this is one for the most dedicated of fans. It is a good set of additions, don't get me wrong, but not enough that I would suggest a purchase right now unless you're going to buy a bundle of this and other DLC together to get the full experience.</p>
<p>Plus the free update version 3.7 "Canis Minor" was also released.</p>

      <title>Canonical want help testing their Steam snap package for Ubuntu</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you game on Ubuntu or one of their flavours like Kubuntu or Xubuntu? Canonical want your help in further testing of the Steam snap. For anyone confused: there's many different types of packages on Linux. There's deb, rpm, flatpak, snap, appimage and more. Snap is what Canonical (who make Ubuntu) are rolling with.</p>
<p>Writing on their official Discourse forum, developer Ken VanDine <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/steam-call-for-testing/34575" target="_blank">mentioned</a> they're hoping to have the snap of Steam out of Early Access soon and available to everyone.</p>
<p>In the post VanDine mentioned they've been "working feverishly to resolve issues and ensure it works well" and testing has been done across "the most popular Steam titles which should ‘just work’ based on reports on ProtonDB". But now they want more people to get involved to give their reports on how games work.</p>
<p>Details on how to get involved can be seen in the <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/steam-call-for-testing/34575" target="_blank">forum post</a>.</p>
<p>The overall feeling you get from looking online is that snaps aren't particularly popular. However, is it just a case of a few people shouting above the rest? VanDine answered a few of my questions on that and more in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/an-interview-with-ken-vandine-ubuntu-desktop-lead-at-canonical/" target="_blank">an interview with GOL last year</a>.</p>

      <title>It&#39;s itch.io Creator Day where they take no cut of sales</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The game store <a href="http://itch.io" target="_blank">itch.io</a> is having another Creator Day where they take no cut from sales. They also have a site-wide sale for the whole weekend. The Creator Day lasts until 7am, March 18th (UTC), so if you want to give that little bit of extra support to a game developer, now is a good time to do it.</p>
<p>Looking over what's available and on sale right now, here's some quick picks:</p>
<ul>

      <title>WorldBox - God Simulator adds in alliances, ages, clans and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>WorldBox - God Simulator is a fun way to spend a coffee break, giving you a world to mess about with and a big new update is out now to give it a little bit more depth. This is a great casual game that does not take any part of it seriously, it's all about doing whatever the heck you want.</p>
<p>Just recently on March 12th a major update was released. The highlights include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Ages - seasons that last for many years and bring disasters or prosperity to the world. From nightfall to madness, there’s many surprises included.</li>
<li>Alliances - they improves diplomacy by making civilizations unite together against common foes.</li>
<li>New Wars - wars now are more detailed. And you will be able to track how long it has been going on, including the death toll, etc.</li>
<li>Clans - kingdoms can and will be ruled by bloodlines and families.</li>
<li>Plans and Plots - addition to diplomacy, for making it more transparent who’s plotting what.</li>
<li>Music - we added new sound engine. Together with music based on what you’re watching right now and many new sounds!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A game for telling stories as everything unfolds and often it's hilarious chaos. You can be really hands-off with it, or you can truly mess with everyone. In my latest game, I decided to see what would happen if I created three separate civilizations: Humans, Dwarves and Orcs. I gave them all the same opportunities, the same amount of starting people, a few cows and even a couple of cats — which the Orcs didn't appreciate, they killed them…so I nuked them.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3289750131679059872gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3289750131679059872gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>With great power comes great responsibility and clearly I needed to step in, who doesn't like cats?</p>
<p>After that, I decided to put down a bunch of Elves in their place and let the world grow for a little while. That was, until I discovered the power to make plants come to life. It's hard to resist such a hilarious sounding power, and so I used it all around my little Dwarves. Not sure I thought that one through, the Trees went on a murdering spree.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17095282031679060406gol1.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17095282031679060406gol1.gif"/></a></p>
<p>So then of course I had to deal with very angry trees roaming around, so then Napalm had to come out otherwise the trees would ruin everything my other civilizations had built up. I couldn't risk it. Am I the real monster here? No, I am God, I can't do wrong — right?</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3046600911679060510gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3046600911679060510gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Anyway, a good while later once things settled down, I decided to try and make it a bit more peaceful. I gave everyone some chickens and various other animals. Things looked good, they even built some farms and windmills. The world in my box here was coming together. That was, until, the Humans and Elves went to war. This isn't going to end well…</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9833470801679061016gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9833470801679061016gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I think I might have to spawn a Rat King, perhaps add in a few Evil Mages and a couple Demons to see if it makes them all come together for the greater good. What could possibly go wrong? </p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1206560/WorldBox__God_Simulator/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a> with Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Cities: Skylines final expansion is in May, with a bunch of stuff coming soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/paradox-cities-skylines-2-plus-the-sims-like-game/" target="_blank">Cities: Skylines 2 is on the way</a> but Paradox and Colossal Order aren't done just yet with Cities: Skylines. Multiple new content additions were just announced. They said they plan to continue to support the game for the rest of the year, but it seems like that may be it.</p>
<p>They've announced that on March 22nd three new content packs will release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Africa in Miniature</strong></em>: A new world of possibilities set in the African Continent. The first Content Creator Pack from long-time Cities fan, 3D Artist Setonji "Prince Set" Hotonu allows you to explore Africa’s exceptionally diverse architecture, vibrant colors, and unique urban mix.
<ul>
<li><em>Africa In Miniature </em>includes a total of 28 new buildings inspired by the existing urban masterpieces and unique architectural concepts. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><strong>Sports Venues</strong></em>: Sports season never ends in this Content Creator Pack by community modder BadPeanut. From unique stadiums to community sports parks, this Content Creator Pack has everything you need to satisfy your City’s needs for sports!
<ul>
<li>Watch your citizens enjoy their favorite match! All large stadiums have realistic football, baseball, and American football animation - plus some new cool stats for you to look at. Some of them also have built-in public transport options. Do you prefer smaller crowds? Try Community sports parks: they’re smaller and can be placed everywhere.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><strong>Shopping Malls:</strong></em> It’s time for some retail extravaganza! With the Content Creator Pack “Shopping Malls” by community modder KingLeno you can bring your shopping experience to the next level, adding a variety of shopping malls to your City. 
<ul>
<li>This content creator pack offers more than 60 assets, including department stores, shopping plazas, and fast food restaurants to populate your Shopping areas. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus these radio stations too:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>JADIA Radio Station</strong>: The African continent is vast, and its music is diverse. JADIA Radio Station (Just Another Day in Africa) is a collection of 16 tracks from musician Wan Shey who pays homage to his country’s musical traditions, adding new vibes to Cities: Skylines.</li>
<li><strong>80’s Movies Tunes</strong>: This time we’re taking you to the movies! “80’s Movies Tunes” is a Radio Station inspired by the 80’s classics. Let’s dive into the past with more than 15 tracks and around 70 minutes of music.</li>
<li><strong>Pop-Punk Radio</strong>: We created this Radio Station for all the Pop-Punk city builders out there. If you enjoy pop-punk music, then this Radio Station is for you! With 16 tracks and more than 75 minutes of powerful, high-beat tunes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That will be in addition to a free update for all players on the same day named "Hubs and Transport", that improves the transport system for Cities: Skylines base game as well as the After Dark, Snowfall, Natural Disasters, and Mass Transit expansions. </p>
<p>More is to come after that, with a final mini-expansion and more content packs arriving in May.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9605315021679058733gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9605315021679058733gol1.jpg"/></a></p>

      <title>Half-Life: MMod gets a release on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Half-Life: MMod just released on Steam, a mod for the original Half-Life that overhauls many parts of it to create something that feels fresh.</p>
<p>Keeping most changes optional, the point is just to give a slightly more upgraded experience while sticking close to the original game. The point of it really is to add into the original game, giving you more options to get through it and to have a bit more fun. So it's quite the opposite of Black Mesa. So perhaps a good choice for those who want mostly vanilla with some added spice. </p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ercz2xaDSL4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2ebc2ff23b3e21084534b08bfc8fdf8d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ercz2xaDSL4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of what it provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Revised gunplay, dynamic weapon bullet spread, smooth recoil, optional non-hitscan bullets.</li>
<li>Enhanced player and visual feedback.</li>
<li>Minor AI tweaks, more reactive and responsive AI, nearly every character blinks.</li>
<li>New and extra weapon animations.</li>
<li>Built in basic chapter selection system.</li>
<li>Touched up weapon models, animated weapon screens and creature eyes.</li>
<li>New arsenal, special weapon functions ( silencers, addons, fire modes ).</li>
<li>Plenty of bug fixes.</li>
<li>VFX re-design ( explosions, bullet impacts, muzzle flashes, monster effects, etc. ).</li>
<li>Minor sound re-design, additional weapon and monster sounds.</li>
<li>Weapon foley sounds for every single weapon.</li>
<li>Restored HEV voice lines.</li>
<li>Slightly enhanced visuals, detail textures.</li>
<li>Visual, atmospheric and pacing related map tweaks and additions ( work in progress ).</li>
<li>Some additions can be toggled in special settings menu.</li>
</ul>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The 2023 Steam Spring Sale is now live, and with it Valve has put the Steam Deck on sale for the first time.</p>
<p>In all supported regions (including <a href="https://steamdeck.komodo.jp/product/steam-deck/" target="_blank">Asia</a>), you can now pick up a Steam Deck with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" target="_blank">10% off</a>. Just over a year since release seems like a good time for it to be on sale don't you think? On top of that, you can now officially customize your Steam Deck Startup Movie. In the Settings -&gt; Customization, with no system update needed, it's now live. You can buy them with Steam Points, and the system they built supports the custom movies you've been able to add for a while.</p>

      <title>Space colony building sim Starmancer gets a huge content upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After quite a while of waiting, Ominux Games have released The Wilderness update for space colony building sim Starmancer. This is the first proper update to the game since early 2022, and it needed it because it was very Early Access, although it was clearly going in the right direction.</p>
<p>Speaking about the update the developer said: "Leave the comforts of your space station to loot asteroids and derelict ships across the galaxy. Hunt for resources, take on territorial monsters, and avoid alien… probing?! Advance your ship using your newfound space booty and experiment with forbidden technologies. You might even adopt a wandering Space Colonist - but be careful, you never know who or what you might encounter…"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8wF1qpA855A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/592458b155c278a6d369da8eaeebcc70.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8wF1qpA855A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's quite a lot to the update too, they've clearly been busy. There's explorable station and asteroids spread around, lots of new enemies, you can draft a colonist to your bidding, a rebalance of many core mechanics, tons of bug fixes, more cheats and settings to customize to properly personalize the experience and the list goes on.</p>
<p>Nice to see such a big update for a promising game that has Native Linux support.</p>
<p>You can buy it from <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/starmancer?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/starmancer?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1062000/Starmancer/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Upcoming base-building RTS &#39;Dying Breed&#39; set after a WW2 nuclear holocaust</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Set in an alternate timeline where WW2 ended in a full nuclear holocaust, the classic base-building RTS named Dying Breed is worth keeping an eye on. You can even try a demo right now. The world has found peace but there's a strange new energy source emerging from underground, and so naturally a fight is brewing over it with you being able to enter the world as either human or mutant-cyborgs.</p>
<p>The gameplay is something you might have expected to see in the original Command &amp; Conquer or Red Alert — it even has some retro acted briefing videos. It's a classic on some serious steroids, as you fight across different locations simultaneously and it gives you some hero units with unique abilities too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qN-YqktN1to"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d3f5a14052b2aef0d1476fe272acdc9b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qN-YqktN1to" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I'm definitely keen to see a whole lot more from this one, it's nice to see there's some developers out there who will keep trying on these classic RTS experiences which I grew up playing and still very much love now.</p>
<p>Go check out the <em>two</em> demos on <a href="https://sarnayer.itch.io/dying-breed" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2088550/Dying_Breed/" target="_blank">wishlist on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Slime 3K: Rise Against Despot looks like a fun time</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Slime 3K: Rise Against Despot is a fresh announcement from Konfa Games and TinyBuild, a spin-off from their earlier game Despot's Game: Dystopian Battle Simulator that I quite enjoyed. This time it's going to be an action rogue-lite, and it could be pretty chaotic from the screenshots.</p>
<p>More about it: "In an attempt to mass produce artificial pink humans, evil artificial intelligence d’Spot’s gooey formula accidentally mutates, becoming self-aware. Humans, robots, and monsters pounce on you in an endless stream. Luckily, you can grow and develop new weapons to transform everything into mincemeat like a giant gelatinous meat grinder."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5353094001678975896gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5353094001678975896gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strategy. Your decision-making skills are more important than your ability to press buttons at the right time.</li>
<li>Snowball. Enemies are getting twice as strong every minute, which means you have to be even more powerful! Become the ultimate jelly death machine!</li>
<li>Rewards. A huge amount of content unlockable between sessions allows you to constantly experiment with new builds and overcome new challenges.</li>
<li>Fun. It's fun to watch little pink humans pop when you crush them!</li>
</ul>
<p>On <a href="https://twitter.com/Despotism_3k/status/1636301125551902720" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, their confirmed their plan for Linux support on this one too.</p>
<p>“Slime 3K is the next chapter in the Despotism universe, but with a brand new twist,” said Nikolay Kuznetsov, Game Creator, Konfa Games. “We wanted to add an alternative way to explore the world of d’Spot while implementing both new and familiar mechanics to reinvigorate a chaotically compelling gameplay experience.”</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/556967801678975901gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/556967801678975901gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Once they released some footage for a trailer, I'll let you know.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck hitting retail in Hong Kong, Taiwan and later Japan and South Korea</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve's partner Komodo has announced they've teamed up with Acer, as they're bringing the Steam Deck to retail stores in Asia.</p>
<p>This initial extra partnership focuses on Hong Kong and Taiwan with both the Steam Deck and Valve's official Docking Station hitting stores tomorrow, March 17th. They also said the Steam Deck will be available to demo at these stores too, so potential buyers can get a proper look. Here's the locations opening up for Steam Deck purchases:</p>
<p>PREDATOR Proshops in Hong Kong:</p>
<ul>
<li>Golden Computer Centre Shop.</li>
<li>K11 MUSEA Shop.</li>
</ul>
<p>Acer Retail Store in Taiwan:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guang Hua Digital Plaza.</li>
<li>Taoyuan NOVA.</li>
<li>Zhongli NOVA.</li>
<li>Taichung NOVA.</li>
<li>Hsinchu NOVA.</li>
<li>Tainan Rainbow.</li>
</ul>
<p>At some point in the future, Komodo will also be expanding this retail launch into Japan and South Korea. No other details on timing for that was given though.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“We are excited to work with Acer Gaming to continue toward our goal of delivering Steam Deck to the widest range of customers,” said Ricky Uy, CEO of Komodo.</p>
<p>“Acer Gaming cooperates with popular game industry brands to create a complete gaming life experience from offline to online," said Ting-Yang Hsu, General Manager of Acer Gaming. “Through this collaboration with Komodo, we are demonstrating the importance Acer Gaming places on the gaming market.”</p>
<hr/>
<p>Could be a very nice boost for Steam Deck numbers! As I keep saying: we need more people buying it and playing on it, to have more game developers care and support it. Having more game devs optimise directly for it would be great. We still need Valve to expand into other regions too, hopefully they will have more to announce this year.</p>

      <title>Valheim got a big patch with performance upgrades and controller improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valheim continues to get improvements and it's easily one of my favourite survival games, it's just fantastic with a couple of friends. This new update should make it even better.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/3675538825743028462" target="_blank">latest update</a> doesn't have any major changes but it's quite an important one, as it fixes up quite a few problematic parts of it and there's some nice quality of life improvements like:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added alternative controller layout and changed layout to be more readable. Build snapping is a toggle in the alternative layout, and has an icon when active.</li>
<li>Added manual save button to the pause menu that displays last save time.</li>
<li>Crafting menus and quick use bar now have cycling navigation when using gamepad.</li>
<li>You can now use the sticks to move to and from a container inventory from the player inventory directly rather than changing menu focus.</li>
<li>Crafting station is now focused when opening a crafting station.</li>
<li>Language can now be changed without restarting the game.</li>
<li>If a server is unjoinable for version mismatch or other restriction this will shown when attempting to join a game from the server list immediately rather than having to wait for the game to load.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks to the above, playing with a gamepad or on Steam Deck should feel a fair bit better and easier.</p>
<p>Performance can be something of an issue at times, especially for those on lower-powered devices like the Steam Deck. The good news is that they focused a bit more on it with this update:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Performance of distant mountain shadows greatly increased, and added a setting to turn off distant shadows completely. (This may increase performance significantly for players with older graphic cards).</li>
<li>Performance increased while in dungeons.</li>
<li>Performance improved when using many map pins.</li>
<li>Performance improved while using the inventory with many items.</li>
<li>Network stability and performance improvements for crossplay.</li>
<li>Memory optimizations for textures and fonts.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Testing it out once again on Steam Deck, with distance shadows turn off because honestly they're really not needed at all here and running around for a while showed a pretty nice improvement in the performance overall. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18327619901678961697gol1.jpeg"/></p>
<p>A whole bunch of other fixes too:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added Munin to Ribcage locations in Mistlands.</li>
<li>Added saving icon to HUD and delayed the "bad connection icon" when saving.</li>
<li>All game texts have been optimised for better clarity and performance.</li>
<li>Reworked button prompts to a new visual style, added some missing buttons, etc.</li>
<li>Key hints are now displayed in a horizontal line rather than vertical list and visible in all needed contexts.</li>
<li>Kicked players get a proper message.</li>
<li>Menu selection markers should now be displayed correctly in all languages.</li>
<li>Fixed several focus loss scenarios when using a gamepad.</li>
<li>Haldor’s lines are now translated correctly.</li>
<li>Build menu has been widened to avoid overlapping other interface items.</li>
<li>D-Pad should now be usable in all menus.</li>
<li>Controller and keyboard usage of menus improved.</li>
<li>Skills menu should now work correctly with gamepad and show tooltips correctly.</li>
<li>Mistlands boss should no longer escape her room during rare occasions (changes have been made to how ownership of objects work when transferred to another player; specifically checking the positions).</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused projectiles to sometimes miss even though it obviously should have connected.</li>
<li>Durability bar on item in the inventory and action bar is now only visible if the item has been damaged.</li>
<li>Fixed a visual bug that showed servers that were being pinged as offline.</li>
<li>Thatch roof i-corner 45o can now support itself and will protect underlying beams from rain properly.</li>
<li>Thatch &amp; darkwood roof top 26o middle beam point fixed.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Steam Deck and desktop Steam upgraded with LAN transfers out of Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A fresh big stable update to the Steam Client has rolled out for Steam Deck and desktop Steam, bringing with it the useful LAN transfer feature.</p>
<p>This means you're now able to have a PC transfer games and updates across the network to other PCs and to a Steam Deck as well. Could be very useful for really big downloads, especially when you're on limited connections. You can set it so it's only allowed for yourself, friends only or everyone.</p>
<p>Here's how it looks on Steam Deck:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8233881841678960258gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8233881841678960258gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>And how it looks on Desktop when doing the transfer:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10442193991678960303gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10442193991678960303gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>As usual, the changes between desktop and Steam Deck are largely the same since this is a Steam Client update and of course they both pretty much now use the same thing.</p>
<p>Here's the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/3667657526387547990" target="_blank">full details</a>:</p>

      <title>Sci-fi submarine sim Barotrauma floats out of Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Barotrauma, a game that's about exploring the ocean on Jupiter's moon Europa, where many horrors wait below the surface of the water.

      <title>Lancer Tactics announced adapting the tabletop roleplaying game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love your mechs? Lancer Tactics was announced recently, as a video game adaption of the popular crowdfunded tabletop roleplaying game.</p>
<p>The original campaign for the TTRPG pulled in a healthy $432K, so it's not a surprise to see this new crowdfunding campaign to turn it into a cross-platform video game (Linux, macOS, Windows) has been a success already at $94K funding with 16 days left to go.</p>
<p>On the campaign the developer mentioned how they "love this system of modular mechs, and I'm sad and furious at our historical and current politics — let's make a game where you can fight imperialist land-stealing goons by being gay and doing crime in giant robots!". Worth noting this is an unofficial adaption, but approved thanks to Lancer's very easy-going <a href="https://massifpress.com/legal" target="_blank">licensing</a>.</p>

<p>Fun fact: it's being developed with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>. The developer previously created <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/372030/Starship_Rubicon/" target="_blank">Starship Rubicon</a> and <a href="https://crescentloom.com/" target="_blank">Crescent Loom</a>, both of which also support Linux.</p>

      <title>Marble It Up! gets Native Linux support in Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Up for a challenge? Marble-rolling platformer Marble It Up! just recently gained Native Linux support in a Beta.</p>
<p>Announced by game porter and FNA developer Ethan Lee on <a href="https://twitter.com/flibitijibibo/status/1634632058889707520" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, you'll need to force the Steam Linux Runtime on Steam Deck to get it to download after opting into the Beta. On Desktop Linux, just installing it with the Beta selected should be fine.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6vtTBc65ZVc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7de1c7440178d8e1735a64ee9276c625.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6vtTBc65ZVc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Developed by the minds behind the Marble Blast series, if any of you are familiar with that.</p>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Chapters</strong> - Experience the pure joy of rolling in 60 levels filled to the brim with dangerous obstacles, mind-bending paths, brand new hazards, shifting gravity, and flexible power ups - all while taking in the beautifully intricate, geometric visuals!</li>
<li><strong>The Collectibles</strong> - Over 100 unique marbles are just waiting to be collected! Complete chapters, earn medals, find hidden trophies, and play Weekly Challenges to grow your magnificent marble collection! Play for keeps!</li>
<li><strong>The Challenges</strong> - All new game mode: Weekly Challenges. Every week, we break our own rules on a select set of maps. Low gravity? Double jump? No powerups? How about all three? Compete each week for rewards!</li>
<li><strong>The Chase</strong> - Global and friends leaderboards, replays, ghost races, and a rewindable practice mode? Say hello to all the tools you’ll ever need to become the best player in the world and top your friends list!</li>
<li><strong>The Community</strong> - The Steam Workshop is overflowing with fantastic user-made maps from our talented, passionate, and dedicated community! Over 200 levels are roll-ready and available with a few simple clicks!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently noted as Unsupported by Valve on Steam Deck, perhaps this work in the upcoming update and Native Linux port will help bring it up to Verified.</p>
<p>Marble It Up! is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/864060/Marble_It_Up/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Steampunk survival game Volcanoids has been invaded by drones</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I think it might be seriously time to play a whole lot more Volcanoids, with the new Ground Support update adding in special drones you can build and it looks awesome. The update also adds in new achievements, a few performance improvements, Japanese and Dutch translations, audio improvements and lots of bug fixes.</p>
<p>This is the survival game where instead of building up a big sprawling base, you have a steampunk drillship to burrow deep underground with. It's a really clever idea that they keep expanding on during Early Access. These new drones you can build can help with defence, mining and more — you can even build a little fort with them. Check out the new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="x-LrzyT3sAo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2dbc1c3988d1ec2b6e1f74ededbad919.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/x-LrzyT3sAo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Going back to it today, I'm impressed by how far it has come. Even at a 1440p resolution, it's performing so much better than it used to. Some small loading hiccups here and there but other than that, it seems to have progressed nicely. Looks a fair bit better too. If you're after a survival game that you can do in co-op, that's quite different to all the rest, it's worth a look for sure.</p>
<p>The game gets surprisingly spooky at times too. With you always on a timer before a volcano erupts, once it does and you come back up to the smoke seeing all the little lights of various enemies is quite unique.</p>

      <title>Turn-based colony builder on the red planet Terraformers is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a while in Early Access, Terraformers from Asteroid Lab and Goblinz Publishing / IndieArk is officially out now with the 1.0 update. Another great looking game that offers Native Linux support.</p>
<p>You face the challenge of turning the rather barren Mars into a lush thriving planet, capable of supporting a growing number of people. In a way it's similar to Surviving Mars, however it's turn-based instead of real-time and gives you a procedurally generated world to start anew each time.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zb-xnoOt6bI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6cfcd3cadcef63178d0c9ae323f2e69c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zb-xnoOt6bI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of what's new in the 1.0 update include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Found new cities on the nearby moons of Phobos and Deimos.</li>
<li>Construct new buildings, complete new space projects, and research new technologies.</li>
<li>Contend with five new events, including the catastrophic asteroid event.</li>
<li>Two new leaders, each with their own background, skills, and perks.</li>
<li>Weekly Challenge mode - play a specific game each week with modifiers and test your skills in multiple difficulties while having your success streak tracked.</li>
<li>New animations to make cities more lively.</li>
<li>Earn 62 new Steam achievements.</li>
<li>Go back to different instances of your colonies with multiple saves.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Curious about this one, since I'm a big fan of strategy games and I love sci-fi themes like this, I decided to pick it up and see what it was like. I can easily see why so many people like it, it definitely gives off that feeling of needing "just one more turn" so you can keep on expanding. Even though it can be a difficult balancing act on all the resources, the support and happiness of your people and the random events, it always feels pretty chilled out.</p>

      <title>Action-RPG in Early Access &#39;Last Epoch&#39; adds in online multiplayer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A day many players have been waiting for, Last Epoch has finally added in multiplayer amongst a number of other big changes to this action RPG. It's been in Early Access on Steam since April 2019, but also had a Beta outside of Steam back in 2018 so it's been going for some time now but the full release is due later this year and this is a big step towards it.</p>
<p>"Last Epoch combines time travel, exciting dungeon crawling, engrossing character customization and endless replayability to create an Action RPG for veterans and newcomers alike. Travel through the world of Eterra’s past and face dark empires, wrathful gods and untouched wilds – to find a way to save time itself from The Void."</p>

<p>Some of what's in the patch includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Multiplayer!</li>
<li>New 3D models for new and existing Uniques.</li>
<li>New Armor sets for Acolyte, Mage, Primalist, Rogue, and Sentinel.</li>
<li>New Unique Items.</li>
<li>Balance Changes, including almost every skill in the game.</li>
<li>Performance Improvements.</li>
<li>New Music &amp; Sound.</li>
<li>New Player animations, and skill VFX.</li>
<li>New Bone Golem and Manifest Armor models.</li>
<li>New Enemies.</li>
<li>Reworked Zones.</li>
<li>New Monolith Maps.</li>
<li>Bug Fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently, the Native Linux version does suffer from some graphical issues. Like the character classes being pretty much invisible on the character creation screen, aside from that though (which is annoying but not game-breaking) it does seem to work quite well. The bug has been there for over a year, so I sure hope they look to solve it soon…</p>
<p>Looks like the new update has given it quite the surge in popularity too, with it hitting a new all-time high of 40,591 just recently. Before this, it would only see 1-2K players online on an average day.</p>

      <title>Railbound gets Steam Deck Verified with a new update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Railbound looks great, a relaxing puzzle game about fixing train connections and travelling the world and now it's Steam Deck Verified. It released back in September 2022 and it has an Overwhelmingly Positive user score on Steam.</p>
<p>Seems like quite a sweet game overall, although it has less than a thousand user reviews on Steam, so it didn't seem to find a big audience. In the latest patch from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1967510/view/3678916525458877980" target="_blank">March 9th</a> they mentioned these improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Railbound is now Steam Deck verified!</li>
<li>Steam Deck version now supports both gamepad and cursor-based inputs.</li>
<li>Steam Deck version now defaults to Borderless window mode.</li>
<li>&gt; Previously, switching to Fullscreen mode would result in game crashes which is why we left only this option enabled.</li>
<li>Hidden social buttons in the Steam Deck version.</li>
<li>Added commit ID to watermark info in the main menu to help us figure out what was the origin of the current build.</li>
<li>Updated in-game credits.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>200+ puzzles to solve across different parts of the world.</li>
<li>Place, remove and reroute connections so that carriages safely connect to the locomotive.</li>
<li>Various train-inspired mechanics - tunnels, semaphores and more.</li>
<li>Lovely comic-book-esque visuals.</li>
<li>Relaxing original soundtrack.</li>

      <title>NVIDIA Vulkan Beta driver 525.47.13 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Over the weekend NVIDIA released a fresh small update to their developer-focused <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" target="_blank">Vulkan Beta driver</a>. Primarily meant for those who need all the very latest in the Vulkan API world, to help with game development or work on projects like Proton / DXVK / VKD3D-Proton and so on.</p>
<p>Version 525.47.13 released March 11th has these changes included:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Vulkan Video not working on NVIDIA Ada family of GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed the disk cache to handle UTF-8 paths.</li>
<li>Improved robustness of vkCreatePipelineCache with invalid data.</li>
<li>Fixed corruption that may occur when rendering with a previously resolved depth image.</li>
<li>Fixed rare SPIR-V control flow bug that may result in infinite loop.</li>
<li>Fixed the coherency order not being consistent between atomic loads and atomic stores.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The current latest for normal desktop gamers is still the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/nvidia-5303002-mainline-beta-driver-rolls-out-plus-a-new-vulkan-beta-driver/" target="_blank">530.30.02 Beta</a> from February. Once that releases as stable, I'll be sure to let you know. NVIDIA never really give a roadmap as to when to expect things to move from Beta to stable though.</p>

      <title>Slick tactical space RPG &#39;Relic Space&#39; is out in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Relic Space combines together smooth turn-based movement (think like Jupiter Hell) with tactical combat, RPG mechanics and 4X elements. With Native Linux support, this could be your next game?</p>
<p>Taking place in the year 2612, Relic Space features over 40 distinct regions that you can explore while customizing and upgrading your ships. Beyond grid-based, tactical turn-based combat familiar to fans of traditional roguelikes, Relic Space also features realistic damage (think BattleTech) with status effects for individual items. Each weapon, engine or utility item can catch fire, leak power, and generally be buffed and debuffed. Equipment items also affect the ship in unique ways – including manual adjustments for heat and energy levels.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HjDaroAg0ec"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9663c144bbae75164881425f05852e83.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HjDaroAg0ec" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking about the game, developer Jonah Wilberg said "Relic Space is very much inspired by classic roguelikes like Angband as well as more recent fare like Cogmind and Approaching Infinity. But I really push the boundaries of roguelike tradition by mixing in 3D visuals, the narrative depth of classic RPGs, and Newtonian physics. It’s been the challenge of translating physics-based, starship movement onto a hex-grid that has allowed me to really innovate with respect to the core, turn-based combat loop – creating a system that (as I’ve heard from those who played the demo) feels really fresh while still being intuitive. I can’t wait to build on all this with the growing community after the Early Access release."</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Tactical turn-based space combat: Use your tactical skills on a hex grid with fast-paced ‘one-tile-per-turn’ mechanics – inspired by traditional roguelikes but with a fluid, modern feel.</li>
<li>Deep simulation: Realistic combat mechanics simulate damage to individual ship components. Each weapon, engine or utility item can catch fire, leak power, and acquire many more status effects. You will also need to manage heat, energy and fuel levels by making smart movement and equipment choices.</li>
<li>Non-linear exploration: Freely traverse a procedurally generated solar system with handcrafted elements; 4 main factions and 7 minor factions pursue research, trade, construction projects, and other goals.</li>
<li>Flexible development: Use your growing reputation and influence to acquire more powerful ships and equip them with countless weapon and utility combinations. Acquire new piloting abilities through a flexible skill tree, and research relics to unlock new powers and equipment.</li>
<li>Immersive setting: Uncover a rich, branching narrative threaded with endless procedurally generated stories in a detailed setting inspired by hard sci-fi.</li>
<li>Real space: Movement rules based on actual space physics: motion in a straight line is free – but turning, starting or stopping costs energy.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available now in Early Access with Linux support on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1146420/Relic_Space/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. There's also a demo on <a href="https://logophil.itch.io/relicspace" target="_blank">itch.io</a>.</p>

      <title>No true next-gen Steam Deck for &#39;a few years&#39; Valve say</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As expected really, Valve said they don't really expect to see a true next-gen Steam Deck for a few years yet. Speaking to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-community-continues-to-blow-our-minds-valve-talk-the-steam-deck-one-year-on" target="_blank">Rock Paper Shotgun</a>, it's clear Valve are very happy with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/steam-deck-thoughts-a-year-later/" target="_blank">first year of the Steam Deck</a>.</p>
<p>Talking to Valve's Lawrence Yang and engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais, it seems it has been blowing their minds. Something of a surprise though, even to me, is that Yang mentioned how they've noticed that "of the people who've purchased a Steam Deck, 42% of them end up spending the majority of their Steam gaming time on Steam Deck – preferring it over their other devices".</p>
<p>So not only is it still selling like tasty sugar-coated hot doughnuts, with it being in the top 10 of global sellers (based on revenue from <a href="https://steamdb.info/topsellers/2023W01/" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>) where it's up against games shifting multiple millions, plenty of people are sticking with it and even shifting over to it.</p>
<p>One sticking point is more games coming out that don't perform well, and while the Steam Deck is impressive, it all depends on developers actually optimising for the hardware, as Griffais said "it'll depend on how developers approach it" and that "If high-end current-gen titles are able to scale to Deck and be a great experience, it also enables smoother performance on a wider variety of PCs, and improve the experience for the whole playerbase". Yang also mentioned how they've "seen a number of recently released demanding titles perform well on Steam Deck, due to developers targeting and testing on the device.".</p>
<p>As always, the problem is in numbers. If the Steam Deck continues selling well, developers won't be able to ignore it. I've seen many games perform brilliantly, even surprisingly so, when they've clearly had a lot of optimization done on them. Then I've also seen the opposite myself, with games that you would think would also work well simply don't (often these bigger AAA games that primarily seem to target consoles…).</p>
<p>When it comes to a true Steam Deck 2, we're clearly in for a wait, as Yang said "a true next-gen Deck with a significant bump in horsepower wouldn’t be for a few years".</p>
<p><em>Valve don't exactly need much to make the Steam Deck 2 a success — <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/valve-doesnt-need-much-to-make-a-steam-deck-2-a-huge-success/" target="_blank">or do they</a>?</em></p>

      <title>Aethermancer is a new creature collector rogue-lite from the dev of Monster Sanctuary</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems moi rai games are sticking to what they know, with them moving on from Monster Sanctuary (which is still being updated) to their new announcement with Aethermancer.</p>
<p>They said it will include things from Monster Sanctuary they liked including "strategic choices, deep team-synergies and every monster being truly unique and viable" but it will also blend in "roguelite elements, a unique rebirth-system and a resource-based combat system" along with it being from a top-down perspective instead of a side-scroller.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="iuYiigqbP-Q"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0f168b3479607b96ca60138bca64dacb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/iuYiigqbP-Q" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fight ferocious Monsters and divine bosses in turn-based battles where every action has consequences. Adapt your strategy to each combat, consider your synergies, and plan the actions of your Monsters wisely. Harness and manage the four elements of Aether in order to unleash powerful spells. But whatever you do, make sure you watch the HP of your Monsters...</li>
<li>When your Monsters die in combat, you will lose them. Permanently. But you have the power to defy death by using their souls for rebirth. Their skills will be lost in the process, but they may live again as the same Monsters. Never lose hope! Your Monsters will grow stronger from their previous lives as they gain Worthiness with your help.</li>
<li>Impact combat as the Aethermancer. Unlock player classes that allow you to take on different roles. Each player class has distinguishing features that change how you play the game, allowing you to experience the game in your own way.</li>
<li>Stop the encroaching danger of the Void. Use your Aethermancer abilities and explore, sneak, and fight your way through procedurally generated levels with multiple pathways. Keep going until you lose your Monsters.</li>

<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2288470/Aethermancer/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a> and it will have Native Linux support just like their first game.</p>
<p>Love the sound of this, exactly the type of game I love. Going right to the top of my wishlist, what do you think?</p>

      <title>Proton Hotfix updated for Resident Evil 4 remake, Steam Deck needs SteamOS 3.4.6 Preview</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais mentioned that they've updated Proton Hotfix, which should allow the new Resident Evil 4 Chainsaw Demo of the remake to run on Linux and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>On Desktop Linux, simply selecting Proton Hotfix should be all you need as Griffais mentioned on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1633978935947169792" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. For Steam Deck players though, Griffais also <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1633968944041312257" target="_blank">clarified</a> you will need to opt into the Preview update. I covered how to do that and what else was in SteamOS 3.4.6 preview in my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/steam-deck-os-346-beta-adds-doom-eternal-ray-tracing-wo-long-fallen-dynasty-fixes/" target="_blank">previous article and video</a>.</p>
<p>Testing out both, I can confirm on Desktop and Steam Deck the Resident Evil 4 Chainsaw Demo does seem to load up and work with Proton Hotfix, which on Steam Deck is now set as the default but you need to do that manually on Desktop in the Properties -&gt; Compatibility menu.</p>
<p><strong>Desktop Linux:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13490304651678448085gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13490304651678448085gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>However, it's not exactly very stable right now. With MangoHUD enabled, it would instantly crash. I spotted various graphical issues too, like your character randomly being stretched across the screen and at one point it completely froze. So it's far from playable there.</p>
<p><strong>Steam Deck</strong> on the other hand, was far more stable with the AMD GPU and the Mesa drivers but performance is quite problematic right now even with lots of settings turned down (and AMD FSR turned on too). No doubt it will improve as a shader cache is built, and as Proton is updated further.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7464804311678448482gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7464804311678448482gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7320776391678448845gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7320776391678448845gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Nice to see Valve continue to work quickly to improve compatibility but seems there's still some ways to go yet on this particular title.</p>
<p>You can pre-order it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/resident-evil-4-remake?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2050650/Resident_Evil_4/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Prepare to see a lot more of Epic Online Services, with Epic&#39;s new self-publishing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While the Epic Games Store doesn't support Linux or Steam Deck officially, this industry news is something we should all know about with Epic now <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-games-store-launches-self-publishing-tools-for-game-developers-and-publishers" target="_blank">opening up self-publishing</a> along with some new rules for their store.</p>
<p>Just like Steam, developers will be able to put their games up on the Epic Store for $100 per-game. However, they have a rather interesting rule when it comes to multiplayer games. In their announcement, they mention how multiplayer titles "must support crossplay across all PC stores" so that "any store can easily connect with other players, regardless of where the game was purchased".</p>
<p>Their reasoning is <em>sound</em>, as there's no good reason to lock online play per-store, and on Linux in the past the problem was even worse, with certain ports from Aspyr Media and Feral Interactive having multiplayer locked to Linux or Linux and macOS with Windows being by itself. I have absolutely no problem with Epic's online play rule at all, as it's actually <em>great</em> for us players.</p>
<p>Developers publishing on the Epic Store are free to use whatever method they wish for this, which is obviously good but rolling your own cross-play can be expensive and difficult. So, this will be another way for Epic Games to push their <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/en-US/services" target="_blank">Epic Online Services</a> which supports Linux, macOS, Windows, consoles and mobiles and provides the likes of voice chat, achievements, matchmaking and more. Compare that to Steamworks from Valve which, while feature-filled, is for Steam directly.</p>
<p>So for developers publishing on multiple stores for online games we're likely to see a lot more of Epic Online Services, or various other launchers and services being used even on Steam directly. We've already begun to see more of that and it will only continue to be a bigger thing now.</p>
<p>In a chat with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/epic-games-store-self-publishing/" target="_blank">PC Gamer</a>, Epic's Tim Sweeney noted: "They have a classic lock-in strategy where they build these services that only work with their store, and they use the fact that they have the majority market share in order to encourage everybody to ship games that have a broken experience in other stores," Sweeney said. "And we were bitten by this early on with a number of multiplayer games coming to the Epic Games Store. Steamworks didn't work on our store, so they had either a reduced set of multiplayer features or none, or they were just limited to a much smaller audience back in the launch days of the Epic Games Store, so you had a lot of multiplayer games that really felt like they were broken. And remember, Call of Duty went through a debacle launching on the Windows Store a while back in which you could only matchmake with other Windows Store players, and that is not how PC should work.".</p>
<p>Not just an issue for Epic, it's a problem GOG have too and they're much smaller so this rule Epic have is likely to benefit GOG releases as well (as long as their Galaxy API plays nicely with others…).</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see if Valve have any plans to expand Steamworks to be more cross-platform. I've reached out to Valve press to see what they have to say, if anything. Will update if I get a reply on that.</p>
<p><em>What are your thoughts?</em></p>

      <title>Transport Fever 2 has a big free upgrade, plus Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Transport Fever 2 is going strong since the release in 2019. They just launched a console version, and upgraded the PC release with some massive improvements too.</p>
<p>Firstly, thanks to the console work, there's now a new controller interface and they worked on dedicated Steam Deck support too. Masses of other changes were added like reworked and improved vehicle models, plus newly added translations for Italian, Brazilian Portuguese and Korean.</p>
<p>Checking it out fresh on Steam Deck and it's looking good. The new interface is set as the default and it works great.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3653869591678377619gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3653869591678377619gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>On top of that there's <em>multiple</em> big performance and loading improvements, crash bug fixes, lots of modding improvements and the list goes on.</p>
<p><em>You can see all the changes <a href="https://www.transportfever2.com/wiki/doku.php?id=releasenotes" target="_blank">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Their latest trailer is below:</p>

<p>They also just launched a Deluxe Edition that has 3 special maps, additional vehicles and more. If you buy the Deluxe Edition (or upgrade to it), they're also throwing in the Early Supporter Pack until March 16th.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/transport-fever-2?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/transport_fever_2?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1066780/Transport_Fever_2/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.

      <title>FOSS strategy game OpenHV gets a release two years in the making</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do any of you remember OpenHV? <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/09/a-cancelled-old-rts-named-hard-vacuum-gets-revived-with-openra/" target="_blank">Back in 2020</a>, it was announced as an OpenRA-based free and open source RTS, based on designs from Daniel Cook that never made it into a game planned to be called Hard Vacuum but now it's here and it has a massive upgrade.</p>
<p>This is the first proper stable release for nearly two years, and the list of changes and upgrades is ridiculously long that you can see on their <a href="https://github.com/OpenHV/OpenHV/releases" target="_blank">GitHub</a> releases page with all the pre-releases over the last couple of years. What they're trying to do is basically create a good and fully free real-time strategy game, for people who loved the classics from Westwood like Command &amp; Conquer and Red Alert.</p>
<p><em>Since it uses the <a href="https://www.openra.net/" target="_blank">OpenRA</a> game engine, it works great cross-platform.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7879114361678373929gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7879114361678373929gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The resource economy in this one is interesting. You have to scout out for resources, to then deploy a mining unit on each individual resource node which then morphs into a mining tower. Over time this tower will gather resources, and then send out a transport with those resources to your main base but these transports can be <em>destroyed</em> so you have to guard them. It's a nice little spin on the gathering found in classic RTS games.</p>
<p>You might recognise some of the art from another 2D RTS called Rusted Warfare, since they both use share some free assets.</p>
<p>I have to admit some of the gameplay here caught me by surprise. There I am building up a little base, sorting out my resources and along comes an enemy aeroplane and suddenly a whole bunch of pods drop across my base containing little nuisance machine gunners. <em>I think I'm going to really enjoy this one.</em></p>

      <title>Free and open source party game Starship Olympics hits Alpha</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need a fresh party game with simple controls and plenty of mini-games to play? Starship Olympics is free, open source and worth a go. They recently released the first Alpha build, which comes with a whole bunch of improvements and overhauls compared to their earlier releases I covered here some time ago. <em>It was originally called SuperStarfighter.</em></p>
<p>The idea is nice and simple and doesn't need much explaining: in local co-op or against the AI, you play through various mini-games in a different random order each time. The new version offers improved graphics, the overall feel of it should be better and they did some user interface improvement too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15504483121678372148gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15504483121678372148gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><em>Just a quick tip to try it out, hopefully some readers find it interesting.</em></p>

      <title>Atari&#39;s 1981 classic revamp Caverns of Mars: Recharged is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Atari teamed up with SneakyBox to revamp another classic, with Caverns of Mars: Recharged officially out now with Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Captaining a fully armed spacecraft, you progress through 30 unique missions set within three primary "depths" of Mars. Featuring both a Challenge and Arcade mode, it sees you furiously blast through swaths of enemies (and even the environment), sinking deeper into the depths of Mars. Be careful though, while the ship’s ammo is limited the foes certainly aren’t. Featuring a unique local co-op mode, players can team up with one partner assigned to navigation while the other player shoots from an indestructible drone.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="L1L9NIcOcNI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4f918fc4906f2c01a7c5e071cf7a4c6c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/L1L9NIcOcNI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fully Destructible Environments:</strong> Blast your way through obstructions, but be mindful of fuel reserves -- each shot also accelerates your limited time to reach the bottom</li>
<li><strong>Arcade:</strong> Traverse the three depths of Mars in a race to reach the bottom and destroy the reactor, strategically accumulating upgrades that’ll make each run unique.</li>
<li><strong>Challenge Mode:</strong> Progress through 30 unique missions that ramp up the difficulty and deliver bite-sized challenges across navigation, combat, and other scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Power Ups:</strong> Collect weapons that will change your strategy on the fly. Carve a new path with the focused railgun shot or leverage the spread of rapid shotgun blasts.</li>
<li><strong>Local Co-op:</strong> In a unique spin on the gameplay, split the responsibilities while one player navigates and the other shoots from a separate drone in tow.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Really great to see Atari publish more of their classics upgraded like this, especially nice to see a whole bunch of them come with full Linux support too.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2213980/Caverns_of_Mars_Recharged/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Ship of Harkinian, a PC port of Ocarina of Time has a feature-filled upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you love the classic The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time? Clearly a lot of people do, and the PC port Ship of Harkinian just recently had a great sounding upgrade.</p>
<p>All unofficial of course, since Nintendo like to keep a close guard on everything but as usual it hasn't stopped people wanting to play it on other platforms with many upgrades. It's just code too, you still need a copy of the actual game to run it, like a lot of game engine remakes they don't provide the copyrighted assets like art and music. They even do their own Ship of Harkinian Direct (a joke about Nintendo Direct videos), although the last is from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRxZ_WlZI4s" target="_blank">five months ago</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16785328781678295540gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I actually wasn't even aware it existed (and supported Linux), because I don't really follow much Zelda or Nintendo stuff, until it was pointed out in the <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux Discord</a>.</p>
<p>The update from March 1st includes:</p>

      <title>Subnautica gets upgraded and now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Subnautica, the hugely popular watery open-world survival adventure has a fresh update out that notes it's now Steam Deck Verified. It originally launched in 2018 after being in Early Access from 2014. Considering how it was quite a while ago now, it's nice to see this kind of post-release support for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15965073811678294204gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>This isn't just a case of another developer announcing they went through Deck Verified without doing anything, the developer Unknown Worlds Entertainment actually went back and updated some parts to work better including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Steam SDK upgrade.</li>
<li>Steamworks .NET upgraded to 20.1.0.</li>
<li>Virtual Keyboard support for Steam Big Picture mode.</li>
<li>Fixed wrong controller stick dead zones handling (now should be easier to aim using controller).</li>
<li>Fixed occasional black screen on game start.</li>
<li>Refactoring, other fixes and UX improvements (mostly related to controllers).</li>
<li>Fixed black screen in VR after resolution change.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/subnautica?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/264710/Subnautica/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>I'm still yet to play this one, am I missing something big here? Maybe now I might actually jump in and see. It's rated Overwhelmingly Positive on Steam so clearly people love it. Good things come to those who wait then, since I'll now get the best experience huh?</p>

      <title>Free and open source 6DOF flight racer Fly Dangerous has a huge second update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's fast, it gives you six degrees of freedom (6DOF) and it's open source too! Fly Dangerous just had it's second big upgrade since entering Early Access. Eventually, this could be quite something, although it's already pretty impressive. Created originally as a "love letter to the Elite Dangerous racing community".</p>
<p>With this update the developer mentioned they've added in an "enormous amount of new content, bugfixes, quality-of-life updates, new maps, music and game modes and a whole suite of integrations". Just some of what's been added into the game includes a fully rebuilt biome terrain world graph with new biomes, 18 new time trial sprint maps, 5 new time trial circuit maps, 3 new puzzle maps, a new ship collision system, support for OpenTrack head tracking, support for TrackIR head tracking, new camera options, support for ultra-wide displays and lots more.</p>

      <title>Build magical colonies and manage resources with lasers in Scorchlands</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Set in a fantasy world of magic and talking animals, Scorchlands is a peculiar city-builder now in Early Access.</p>
<p>Developed by Ringlab and published by Star Drifters, it's a bit of an odd one that's hard to pin down properly to a genre because it blends quite a few things together but the core of it is building up your colonies for resources. It released into Early Access on February 7th with Native Linux support.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Jneb8Ay66XE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7c239af32f0c65c1f90e12c130fa3244.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Jneb8Ay66XE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Hex grid-based city-building – construct various buildings in your colonies. Each structure's productivity depends on neighboring resources and other constructions.</li>
<li>Complex resource management – it’s not only about extracting materials. Scorchlands takes account of logistics – the movement of resources between colonies and combining them in robust processing chains. And yes, we move resources using LASERS!</li>
<li>Terraforming for the greater good – use magic and technology to change the biomes on procedurally generated maps and exploit the new environment to gain its unique resources.</li>
<li>Technology designed to give fun – there’s no fun in a sandbox if you don’t have the toys to play with. The technology system in Scorchlands is key for player progression and new discoveries open up new ways to play with the game world.</li>
<li>Minimalistic combat system – when you get into a fight, positioning will be the key. Destroy your enemies by surrounding them and placing your forces in optimal locations.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I have a copy and tested it out for a bit to confirm it works great, need more time with it to form a proper opinion but the basic idea behind it seemed quite interesting — certainly not the usual kind of city-builder you're used to. Could be a good one for you to take a look at, although it still has around half a year in Early Access until they think it will be finished.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1090100/Scorchlands/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Currently <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/scorchlands" target="_blank">GOG</a> only has the Windows version.</p>

      <title>Starfield from Bethesda launching September 6</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While we have no idea how well it will work on Linux and Steam Deck with Proton just yet, we at least now have a date. Starfield from Bethesda is releasing September 6th. I'm cautiously optimistic on it, as a massive fan of everything space sci-fi like this, I've wanted to see more games like this for some time.</p>
<p>More about it: "Starfield is the first new universe in 25 years from Bethesda Game Studios, the award-winning creators of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and Fallout 4. In this next generation role-playing game set amongst the stars, create any character you want and explore with unparalleled freedom as you embark on an epic journey to answer humanity’s greatest mystery."</p>
<p>See the new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="raWbElTCea8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9e630b16b71a3b28e6acfe35fadd2eba.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/raWbElTCea8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Naturally, I'll be taking a look at it on release, to let you know how if it works on Linux desktop and Steam Deck. Perhaps it's one of the upcoming titles Valve mentioned in the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/steam-deck-os-346-beta-adds-doom-eternal-ray-tracing-wo-long-fallen-dynasty-fixes/" target="_blank">update notes for SteamOS 3.4.6</a> that they couldn't name directly. It wouldn't surprise me if this is one title Valve are trying to ensure works well before release, given how popular it will no doubt be.</p>
<p><em>Will you be picking it up? </em></p>
<p>You can follow it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1716740/Starfield/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Vangers the open source classic from 1998 continues to be upgraded</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vangers is a thoroughly weird racing role-playing adventure originally released in 1998, and it's still being upgraded.</p>
<p>The developers describe it as: "Mind-altering sandbox game that can be described as a racing role-playing adventure game with a complicated storyline. You’ll find a unique atmosphere, complete freedom and lots of gameplay hours to figure out what’s the game is all about."</p>
<p>Want to see how weird it is? See below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wobNQOl6KHA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7b2530e915c2489f3daf6b736dcc2991.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wobNQOl6KHA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Back in February 2022, it even got a HD revamp to support a higher (by original standards) 1280x720 resolution. This was made possible, as the game's code is open source under the GPL on <a href="https://github.com/KranX/Vangers" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. The HD patch was originally a community effort, and then further refined together with the developers and added to the official game. Nice!</p>
<p>It also just got the first update in quite some time, with a new update going out on March 3rd adding in:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Video fixes for MacOS.</li>
<li>Fixes for memory issues.</li>
<li>Prevented infinite loop when handing out eLeech if Eleerection is the only cycle left.</li>
<li>Prevented "permanent" UI block after using Boot Sector.</li>
<li>Window aspect ratio now calculated dynamically.</li>
<li>Fixed game crash when trying to use Protractor under some circumstances.</li>
<li>Error messages are more informative in certain cases.</li>
<li>Fixed game crash when window height is less than 600.</li>
<li>Prevented unwanted mouse cursor position changes in certain cases.</li>
<li>Fixed texts alignment for game ending screens and items with associated text screens (tabutasks, passengers, poponkas).</li>
<li>Multiple fixes for game chat in multiplayer: init scroll position, alignment, size at different resolutions.</li>
<li>Fixed multiplayer chat closing upon any attempts to type.</li>
<li>Fixed multiple errors in Mechosoma game mode on Necross.</li>
<li>Multiple changes to make working with code easier.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>After trying it out today for the first time, it might be the strangest game I've ever played. Every single part of it is just thoroughly weird.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Honestly, I couldn't be happier with this after enjoying then Castlevania Anime on Netflix. I've been playing it, and it's pretty much exactly what I expected it to be. A themed-area content expansion, with all the gameplay you know and love from Dead Cells. No issues with the way it works, as it continues to be supported nicely on Linux too and it's looking perfect on Steam Deck as well. The new music is a very nice touch too, very fitting and they did a really great job on it overall.</p>
<p>So far it seems other players are enjoying it, as it's rated Very Positive on Steam.</p>

      <title>Dota 2 removes OpenGL support, new hero Muerta now live, big update due in April</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest major update to Dota 2 from Valve has landed, bringing with it the removal of OpenGL support and the new hero Muerta.</p>
<p>Valve mentioned multiple times in the past their plans to continue the modernization of the tech behind Dota 2, and so this update is the one to do it. On Linux, it's now Vulkan only requiring at least AMD GCN+, NVIDIA Kepler+, or Intel HD 5000-series. They plan to go further, with a future update planned to upgrade their SIMD to SSE4.1 that will "allow higher performance in physics, particles, and general gameplay code" which shouldn't really affect many people, as they said nearly all "processors released in the past 10 years support SSE4.1".</p>
<p>The new hero, Muerta, is described as: "With her fearsome trickshots, summoned spirits, and a sidearm to spare, Muerta's knack for taking lives was so impressive, Death himself put her on the payroll. A twin-pistoled engine of dead-eyed vengeance, Muerta shepherds wayward souls to the other side, whether they want to get there or not. And if they need more convincing, she’s ready to reveal her true form as a murderous spectral nightmare if it helps them die a little faster."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6pzlZywudlw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2cc953ce1ddd05da1cef2b7141a01669.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6pzlZywudlw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Muerta's abilities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dead Shot - Muerta fires a ghostly bankshot at an enemy unit or tree. When the bullet strikes, it damages and briefly slows, then ricochets in the targeted direction. The ricochet damages all units that it passes through, stopping when it hits a hero. Heroes hit by the ricochet will run in the direction of the shot.</li>
<li>The Calling - Summons a group of revenants that slowly circle the targeted location. Enemies within the area are slowed and have reduced attack speed. Revenants deal damage and silence enemies as they pass through them.</li>
<li>Gunslinger - Muerta's attacks have a chance to fire a second shot at another target, prioritizing Heroes.</li>
<li>Pierce the Veil - Muerta transforms, becoming immune to physical damage. All of her attack damage is dealt as magical damage. Muerta gains bonus attack damage and phased movement. Muerta can attack ethereal units, but deals no damage to Magic Immune targets.</li>
</ul>
<p>This update also comes with a new mini-game that runs until April 4th: "Muerta needs help getting the right warm bodies in the right fresh graves... and that’s where you come in! You’ll get an assigned target before every Dota game during the Dead Reckoning event. Score points for Kills and Assists. But watch out — your opponent’s out for your blood too, and whoever scores more gets twice the reward!".</p>
<p>Additionally Dota 2 version 7.33 is coming in April, which they've been working on "for a while" that they sound will be quite "ambitious". Will be interesting to see what they've been cooking up…it's not just <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/counter-strike-2-is-reportedly-a-real-thing-and-coming-soon/" target="_blank">Counter-Strike</a> having all the fun huh?</p>

      <title>Deal with a UFO crashing into a small village in Kujlevka, releasing in April</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kujlevka from developer Callback and publisher Crytivo is a quirky adventure about a flying saucer crash landing into a small distant Russian village. Now, they have a new trailer up and a release date teaser for sometime in April.</p>
<p>"Russia, 1992. The ordinary village of Kujlevka is no stranger to challenging times. In this dark and otherworldly period of Russian history, the current financial crisis and rising crime rates appear bleak in comparison. And when a flying saucer crashes into local chairman's house, it’s up to you to meet the aliens. Of all the locations on Earth, this forgotten settlement becomes a bustling center for science, exploration, and the supernatural; you’re merely the poor chap whose home became the saucer’s crash site."</p>

<p>Gameplay:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This isn’t your stereotypical alien encounter. You will be tasked to learn about these otherworldly beings before they can properly study you.</li>
<li>Kujlevka lets you play a role in charting a course through a financially and politically turbulent time in Russian history.</li>
<li>Beyond static dialog and walls of text, you can explore village life in Kujlevka through a mesmerizing atmosphere of the protagonist’s dreams. </li>
</ul>

      <title>Flathub in 2023, they have some big plans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Robert McQueen, CEO of the Endless OS Foundation and GNOME Board President, has <a href="https://discourse.flathub.org/t/flathub-in-2023/3808" target="_blank">given a big update</a> on what's going on with <a href="https://flathub.org" target="_blank">Flathub</a>. A lot of work has been going in towards updating Flathub from a list of apps, into a full build service and app store complete with payment processing. This includes developer verification, user accounts and more.</p>
<p>You might remember <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/flathub-seeks-funding-to-add-payments-donations-and-subscriptions/" target="_blank">my recent article</a> talking about their funding proposal, where Flathub plans to expand the types of monetization they can offer to developers (amongst many other plans) but they need funding to finish up everything. They were asking the Plaintext Group to help with that but <em>sadly</em> they got turned down. That's not the end of it though, the show must go on and they're currently in discussions with <a href="https://nlnet.nl/" target="_blank">NLnet</a> about funding.</p>
<p>For 2023 so far they've been granted $100K from the <a href="https://www.endlessnetwork.com/" target="_blank">Endless Network</a>, but McQueen said they're hoping to to get at least $250K for this year, which is why they're seeking more funding partners.</p>
<p>So what else have the folks involved in Flathub been up to, and what are they planning together? A lot.</p>
<p>First up, some stats were revealed! They have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over 2,000 apps.</li>
<li>Over 1,500 collaborators.</li>
<li>Averaging 700,000 downloads a day.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the post McQueen believes that Flathub has "solved the largest technical issue which has held back the mainstream growth and acceptance of Linux on the desktop" by providing an easy place for developers to publish their work, and making it easy for users to get it. <em>I'm sure Canonical and Snap will have something to say about that…</em></p>
<p>Direct Uploads are in progress too and close to being ready, helping developers with even more automation mentioning "they enable exciting stuff like allowing Electron apps to be built outside of flatpak-builder, or driving automatic Flathub uploads from GitHub actions or GitLab CI flows".</p>
<p>McQueen believes <em>now</em> the biggest barrier for the Linux desktop is <em>economic</em>, and that's why we have fewer developers and apps doing stuff for Linux, noting that "as a community we continue to have a challenging relationship with money". It's true, everyone needs to eat, and you can only do so much as a hobby while working a paying job elsewhere. And so if there's no proper incentive for developers they "would be forgiven for taking their time and attention elsewhere".</p>
<p>This does touch on another good point, talking about how this is an issue for "diverse and inclusive participation", since without everything in place for developers to earn a living on Linux we end up requiring "that somebody is in a position of privilege and comfort that they have internet, power, time, and income—not to mention childcare, etc.—to spare so that they can take part". It's all about "shared success", giving everyone the opportunity.</p>
<p>They're also looking into creating an Advisory Board, so there's some proper governing of everything. This includes moving the legal side of the operation from the GNOME Foundation, who have been handling it, into an independent legal entity.</p>
<p>On top of that there's plans for a form of Flathub Focus Groups, which will be launching at the Linux App Summit in May 2023, and some form of online participation too for you to have your say.</p>
<p>Will ensuring Flathub has everything in place for developers to actually sell apps make a difference? I think it could. Speaking personally, if I'm looking for an app now, Flathub is usually the first place I look, no matter the Linux distribution I happen to be running. It's a nice feeling too, being able to just tell people to "grab it on Flathub", instead of needing to find their exact distribution, version and then find a package for them. Hopefully that idea will keep growing too, so that more developers put their apps and even games on there.</p>
<p><em>What are you thoughts on everything Flathub?</em></p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer - Part 28: Losing My Marbles</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-27-lost-souls/" target="_blank">Part 27: Lost Souls</a></strong></p>
<p>One of the titles that Loki Software released for Linux was <em>Tribes 2,</em> an online multiplayer shooter which was the first game to be released using the Torque Game Engine. Torque 3D would go on prove to be a favourite of a number of independent developers over the next decade, with the engine's maintainer GarageGames stepping in to distribute several of the games produced with it for Linux themselves. This included a game of their own devising, <em>Marble Blast Gold</em>.</p>
<p><em>Marble Blast </em>was first released in 2002, before being updated to <em>Marble Blast Gold</em> in 2003. A six level playable Linux demo was released through the MarbleBlastGoldDemo-1.4.1.sh.bin installer. The goal of the game is to navigate an autonomous marble through a 3D playing world, collecting all of the gems needed and using the power ups provided to overcome the obstacles preventing you from progressing on to the next level.</p>
<p>Anyone who has ever played the free software title <em>Neverball </em>should be familiar with the basic concept, the main difference being that with <em>Marble Blast</em> you control the marble directly, rather than shifting around the floor to roll a ball. These kinds of high reflex games have a way of trying both my nerves and patience before long, but the appeal sure is there for some. The graphics are bright and colourful, while the music and narration remain jovial.</p>
<p>To its credit <em>Marble Blast Gold</em> and the Torque Game Engine powering it do run rather well, even on a computer which would have been well into its operating life by the time the game came out. <em>Marble Blast Gold</em> stayed performant even when set to display at higher screen resolutions such as 1024x768 or when using 32 bit colour depth; the only exception being enabling Stencil Shadows, which does hammer the frame rate something fierce.</p>
<p>I also find the selection of levels in the demo to be puzzling. I would have just included all of the early beginner levels, which introduce all of the mechanics before letting you tackle your first real challenge. The demo can also be a bit obnoxious, with it showing a begging screen imploring you to buy the full game after completing each and every level. Considering the state of the registered version as it exists now, this can feel more than a bit galling.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17659680751676232867gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17659680751676232867gol6.png"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7656394871676232828gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7656394871676232828gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p><em>Marble Blast Gold</em> never saw a retail release, with it just being sold as a digital download through the GarageGames website. The game has been unavailable for purchase since being removed from their store in 2011, and even if you had purchased the full version back in the day, you can no longer verify your key as the registration server is down. While both Windows and Mac saw versions which had the Ignition DRM stripped out, on Linux the game is left unplayable.</p>
<p>Thankfully the <em>Marble Blast</em> community has provided Linux users with a couple of alternate ways to keep playing the game. Marble Blast Web is a port of both <em>Marble Blast Gold </em>and the community made <em>Marble Blast Platinum</em> that allows both games to launch inside a modern web browser. While appearing almost identical, the physics are actually quite different to those found in the original game, having been optimized instead with a view to reaching a wider audience.</p>
<p>A more faithful web version of the game is the Marble Blast Haxe Port, which boasts 99% identical physics, although it gave me some issues with inputting my name. Either gives you access to what amounts to the full version of the game along with full source code available from GitHub, both being the product of clean room reverse engineering. Some interest has even been shown in using these to make new native Linux binaries, but the web versions are more universal.</p>
<p>GarageGames sold alongside <em>Marble Blast Gold</em> another ten games for Linux on their website, including <em>Bridge Construction Set</em>, <em>Orbz</em>, <em>ThinkTanks</em>, <em>Gish</em>, <em>Dark Horizons: Lore Invasion</em>, <em>Zap!</em>, <em>Tribal Trouble</em>, <em>Toribash</em>, <em>FizzBall</em>, and <em>Kachinko,</em> almost all made with the Torque Game Engine. Following the closure of their store in 2011 GarageGames would at least open up the source code to Torque, allowing the engine to continue to enjoy success in Indie and free gaming circles.</p>
<p>The more I explore these early independent Linux games that were distributed and sold through the internet, the more dismayed I have become at how easily they seem to be succumbing to the digital dark age without a physical release to anchor them. Thanks to a tip from one of my readers however, and the help of the original developer, I can now shine a light on another title which otherwise would appear to have been lost to history.</p>

      <title>Paradox announce Cities: Skylines 2, plus a The Sims-like game and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox Interactive just held their own announcement show, and there will be quite a few interesting upcoming games, so here's a round-up.</p>
<p>First up, no doubt many are excited at the idea of it, <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/949230/Cities_Skylines_II/" target="_blank">Cities: Skylines II</a></strong> is official although they did not show off any gameplay it just had a fancy trailer. So nothing to really show there, and no release date hint yet either. Even the Steam page doesn't have in-game screenshots, just screenshots from their own trailer.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WdD66WGBVHM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2c4091888a52af853ea09f831223f9d9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WdD66WGBVHM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“Cities: Skylines reset the bar for city building games when it launched eight years ago, and we are incredibly proud of its impact. We built a thriving community around Cities and introduced many to city building for the first time,” said Mariina Hallikainen, CEO of Colossal Order. "Now, we’ve brought the years of experience we’ve gained to take a new step forward in the city builder genre, again, for our community and new players".</p>
<p>“The Cities brand has been an important part of Paradox’s catalog of games for over a decade. Cities: Skylines is a profound success, selling millions of copies, welcoming more than 5.5 million new players just last year, and setting the foundation for Cities: Skylines II,” said Fredrik Wester, CEO of Paradox Interactive. “With unprecedented amounts of customization and player control, Cities: Skylines II will continue to push boundaries for the city-building franchise.”</p>
<hr/>
<p>They're also now doing their own game like The Sims called <strong>Life By You</strong>, which is not a big surprise because the studio Paradox Tectonic is working with Rod Humble who previously worked on The Sims 2 &amp; 3.</p>
<p>Life By You also only got a short teaser, because it's going to have its own event on March 20th.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZNhV-Gnjdy8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/616725781bcab584a441a260af08f683.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZNhV-Gnjdy8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<hr/>
<p>Harebrained Schemes, known for BATTLETECH and Shadowrun, announced <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1167750/The_Lamplighters_League/" target="_blank">The Lamplighters League</a></strong>, a tactical turn-based strategy game set in an alternate 1933.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JnTjWoFvmzg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f7267b105aec4dc144a0dd8d4e5780a4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JnTjWoFvmzg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“Harebrained Schemes is all about weaving tactical gameplay that challenges your mind with narrative and characters that engage your heart,” said Christopher Rogers, Game Director of The Lamplighters League at Harebrained Schemes. “For years, we’ve been privileged to tell stories in cherished settings like Shadowrun and BATTLETECH. Because The Lamplighters League is set in a new world, it allows us the creative freedom to simultaneously create narrative that supports gameplay and gameplay that supports narrative. We love these characters and hope that players and fans enjoy getting to know them while exploring each one's unique abilities the way we did. I cannot wait to share everything we’ve been working on.”</p>
<hr/>
<p>Since it's Paradox, there were of course going to be some DLC announcements like…</p>

      <title>Base-building, tower defense and digging — Lumencraft has it all</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lumencraft is a pretty gorgeous top-down blending of base-building, where you need to set up defensive towers and a whole lot of digging. Developed with full Linux and Steam Deck support using <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, it's easily one of my indie favourites from this year and it just left Early Access as a full game.</p>
<p>Imagine a bit of Deep Rock Galactic top-down with base-building, and that sort-of sums up the kind of experience to expect from it. Honestly it's good, and you can end up seemingly just blinking and hours have gone by while you're playing. The new update to the full release also brings with it a full single-player campaign with various missions, a new hub area between missions and lots more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LC29HveHImg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5aa734381af715457c857655d4e251f0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LC29HveHImg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Multiple game modes - a story campaign, custom maps created by the developers and the community or procedurally generated levels. The choice is yours!</li>
<li>Defending the underground settlement by direct combat and the use of diversified turrets.</li>
<li>Highly efficient and satisfying digging mechanics (just listen to the sweet sound of crushed rocks and Lumen).</li>
<li>Explosive weapons. Yes, we have dynamite.</li>
<li>Dynamic lights and pixel-perfect interaction with a fully destructible terrain.</li>
<li>Dread atmosphere created through an impactful sound design and a unique 2Dynamic lighting system.</li>
<li>Realistic simulations. Just look at the lava!</li>
<li>Play with your friends in co-op mode either using Steam Remote Play or locally on a shared screen.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can buy Lumencraft on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/lumencraft" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/lumencraft?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1713810/Lumencraft/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Rhythm mini-game collection Bits &amp; Bops gets Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bits &amp; Bops looks sweet! A fun collection of rhythm mini-games, and the developer has upgraded the demo to include Linux support for this upcoming game.</p>
<p>In the update announcement they said: "This release brings the custom engine to Linux! We've tested it for you on the Steam Deck and built in some tailored settings for the best experience straight out of the box. If you're on Linux and you were previously running the Windows build, you may need to manually disable Proton to get the native Linux build (check your compatibility settings)."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ibijA6QPGn0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/58832a2668effa94c65c8058d24681df.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ibijA6QPGn0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It was crowdfunded on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tempolabgames/bits-and-bops/description" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, where the developer pulled in AU$ 173,833 towards development. Linux support was not a sure thing, as back then they initially mentioned it would be tricky to do with their custom game engine but it seems they managed to do it anyway — nice!</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Over 20 unique rhythm mini-games to entertain and challenge you.</li>
<li>Super fun gameplay with simple controls that anyone can learn.</li>
<li>Catchy, upbeat original tunes sure to have you bopping along.</li>
<li>Gorgeous hand-drawn 2D animation that brings everything to life.</li>
<li>A custom game engine with lightning fast response times.</li>
<li>An adorable dog-bear named Bop to keep you company.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Counter-Strike 2 is reportedly a real thing and coming soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's been a whole lot of rumours appearing lately that seem quite credible, with Counter-Strike 2 apparently due soon. It's not entirely clear if this is a full new game, or a big upgrade for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive but either way it's pretty exciting for FPS fans.</p>
<p>One thing being <a href="https://twitter.com/gabefollower/status/1631002572881362954" target="_blank">pointed out</a> is how the NVIDIA driver on Windows added profiles for "csgos2.exe" and "cs2.exe", with it even being named directly as Counter-Strike 2. NVIDIA have, in the past, accidentally let slip a number of other upcoming games that ended up being real. Alone, that wouldn't be exactly solid though.</p>
<p>Now we also have Richard Lewis, esports journalist and broadcaster, <a href="https://richardlewis.substack.com/p/sources-yes-counter-strike-2-is-real" target="_blank">writing</a> how it is in fact very real and some sources with knowledge of it came to them to verify it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Speaking under the condition of anonymity sources with a knowledge of the game’s development told us that indeed there was a new version of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive on its way and that had been worked on for some time. The new version is almost certainly set to be released under the working title Counter-Strike 2 and the tentative release date for the beta is in this month of March with April 1st at the outside.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive originally launched in 2012, and it has seen many upgrades since then. Even so, that's still quite a long time for Valve to support it, and it does show its age in many ways.</p>
<p>While nothing is confirmed yet of course, it's still very exciting. Seems like March and April are shaping up to be very interesting months. Once I hear any more, I'll let you know.</p>

      <title>Factorio gets official Wayland support on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Are you a Wayland user? Do you play Factorio? The latest update should make things a lot smoother for you.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/11h3ule/version_1177/" target="_blank">Version 1.1.77</a> was just released and amongst a whole bunch of their usual bug fixes and scripting updates, noted right at the top was "Added support for Wayland on Linux. To enable it, set SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland in your environment. (thanks to raiguard)". It's nice to see developers who really care about their Linux support like this.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/828195341677873165gol1.jpg"/></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Factorio</strong> is a game in which you build and maintain factories. You will be mining resources, researching technologies, building infrastructure, automating production and fighting enemies. In the beginning you will find yourself chopping trees, mining ores and crafting mechanical arms and transport belts by hand, but in short time you can become an industrial powerhouse, with huge solar fields, oil refining and cracking, manufacture and deployment of construction and logistic robots, all for your resource needs. However this heavy exploitation of the planet's resources does not sit nicely with the locals, so you will have to be prepared to defend yourself and your machine empire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you do try it out, be sure to leave a comment and let us know how it runs. I can imagine this making it better on Steam Deck too where it's currently a Steam Deck "Playable" title, verified on the Native Linux build. On Steam Deck, the main Gaming Mode does use Wayland too.</p>

      <title>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is a Vampire Survivors styled spin-off</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ghost Ship Publishing and Funday Games recently announced a Deep Rock Galactic spin-off named Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor and I need it right now.</p>
<p>Designed very much like the smash hit Vampire Survivors, it lets you explore the world of Deep Rock as a single player survivor-like auto-shooter. They sure are a lot of these games now, however this is building upon a well-established name and Deep Rock Galactic is one of my all-time favourite co-op games, and as a big fan of these horde shooters, I'm keen to give it a run on Linux Desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="h6koRh1v3nU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d782d47e492ea1521828fe5723f44714.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/h6koRh1v3nU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>No doubt it will work great with Proton at release. The Early Access release will have these features ready:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>4 playable characters</li>
<li>+30 weapons</li>
<li>+10 enemy types</li>
<li>1-3 bosses</li>
<li>3-5 biomes</li>
<li>Multiple mission types</li>
<li>A deep progression system of perks, artifacts and upgrades</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From what they said, it will remain in Early Access potentially for up to a year. During this time they plan to add in more of basically everything. Gimme.</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2321470/Deep_Rock_Galactic_Survivor/" target="_blank">out on Steam</a>. </p>

      <title>Meg&#39;s Monster is a cute looking unique short JRPG out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Japanese developer Odencat just released Meg's Monster, a cute looking short JRPG with a rather interesting twist.</p>
<p>Most games start you off with nothing, weak as a thin stick, but here as the monster Roy you start off pretty much untouchable. However, when Roy does get hit, Meg might get a little upset. Here you're watching out for the "mental damage" to Meg, who doesn't want to see Roy get hurt. Sounds like a really interesting spin on it all.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="T7rp819leWg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6320f319b972b039cd11812ac18135e4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/T7rp819leWg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it: "What begins as a relatively simple and heartwarming story about two unlikely friends ultimately expands into something much greater, as Roy and Meg slowly begin to unravel the mysteries surrounding the Underworld and themselves. The result is an emotional journey that, like any good storybook, will remain in your heart for years to come.</p>
<p>Meg's Monster’s retro style and simplicity in presentation quickly unfolds into a challenging, amusing and must-play RPG. The narrative quickly pulls the player into the story whilst at the same time giving a real empathy for the main and central characters. Over 50,000 words of dialogue give a rich and compelling narrative to the many battles that will ensue as you venture forth.  Each battle comes with its own unique mechanics and minigames to master as you duke it out while protecting and keeping Meg happy with her favourite toys. Yes, keeping Meg calm and happy is just one underlying factor, and a nice toy will achieve this, but it’s not that simple!"</p>
<p>Out with Native Linux support <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1783360/Megs_Monster/" target="_blank">on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck OS 3.4.6 Beta adds DOOM Eternal Ray Tracing, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has updated the Steam Deck Preview update branch to bring with it Steam Deck OS 3.4.6 Beta and it's quite an exciting one. It brings an update to the open source Mesa graphics drivers with Mesa 23.1, mainly focused on the Vulkan side of things but DXR Ray Tracing is <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1631478719612321792" target="_blank">coming</a> too but not quite ready yet.</p>
<p>Here's what it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3650768394042637389" target="_blank">changes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed graphical corruption issues with Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty.</li>
<li>Ray-Tracing is now available in DOOM Eternal.</li>
<li>Fixed graphical corruption issues and GPU crashes in several upcoming titles.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A video going over the changes and a quick look at DOOM Eternal with Ray Tracing on Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1c89wGH5XOM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/338b0e660126dfb08843b74e9ff42de7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1c89wGH5XOM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Fantastic work from Valve and Mesa developers working on this. Amazing to see it actually working in a game on Steam Deck like this.</p>
<p>ICYMI: there's some issues with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/apex-legends-banning-linux-players-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Apex Legends bans on Linux</a>.

      <title>The Legend of Heroes: Kuro no Kiseki gets a second Steam release, optimised for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is a bit of an odd one. The Legend of Heroes: Kuro no Kiseki has been released on Steam, for the second time and now it has Steam Deck optimizations too.</p>
<p>Originally released for the PlayStation 4, and then PlayStation 5 and Windows. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1811950/The_Legend_of_Heroes_Kuro_no_Kiseki/" target="_blank">first</a> Windows version on Steam came from Nihon Falcom and Clouded Leopard Entertainment that only supports Traditional Chinese and Korean translations, while this <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2138610/The_Legend_of_Heroes_Kuro_no_Kiseki/" target="_blank">newer one</a> comes from PH3 GmbH, Nihon Falcom and NIS America, Inc supports Japanese. They're both still for sale, which can be confusing. This newer port isn't just about publishers and translations though it also has various enhancements and will <a href="https://twitter.com/nihonfalcom/status/1631086556391051264?s=20" target="_blank">officially</a> get an English translation.</p>
<p>Some of the enhancements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for ultrawide resolutions (as well as the 16:10 ratio of the Steam Deck).</li>
<li>High frame rate support.</li>
<li>Field of view customization (and automatic FOV scaling).</li>
<li>Various graphics options including a real-time graphics options preview.</li>
<li>Full support for keyboard and mouse controls.</li>
<li>Steam Deck optimization.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the Steam Deck side they <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2138610/view/3675538191993632884" target="_blank">said</a>: "Before leaving you to enjoy the game, I’d like to note that we also specifically worked on Steam Deck optimization, to eliminate a particular issue that reduced performance significantly in some areas while running via DXVK." and they added a picture too:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15393826231677781260gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15393826231677781260gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Really interesting to see even more developers optimize their games for Steam Deck. Will have to check this out when the English language patch lands for it, looks quite interesting. It's also great to see more games from Asia continue to arrive on Steam, although in future it would be nice if translations weren't split across multiple purchases.</p>
