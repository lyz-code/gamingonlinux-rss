      <title>Proton Hotfix updated to support HELLDIVERS 2 on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>HELLDIVERS 2 is currently doing really well on Steam with a ton of players, and initially it was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/helldivers-2-is-out-heres-how-to-run-it-on-steam-deck-linux/" target="_blank">quite a nuisance to get working on Steam Deck / Desktop Linux</a>, but now it should run much better.</p>
<p>Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1756048372090499281" target="_blank">mentioned</a> on X (formerly Twitter), that Proton Hotfix was updated to work around the launch issues. So all you'll need to do now is go into the Properties -&gt; Compatibility, tick the box and select Proton Hotfix for HELLDIVERS 2 to get it working properly!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="A Proton Hotfix has just been deployed for a Helldivers 2 launch failure." src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1657120111707574512gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Nice to see once again Valve spring into action to improve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> to get popular games working! Especially interesting that it uses nProtect GameGuard, which is supposed to be Windows kernel-level, so it's surprising it works so easily on Linux systems now.</p>
<p>At time of writing HELLDIVERS 2 has 100,768 players online just on Steam, so it's clearly another big early hit for 2024. And it seems the most popular Sony PlayStation release on Steam so far.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

      <title>Check out Abalon Arena - bringing together turn-based tactics and strategic card play</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From D20Studios, who also made Abalon (formerly Summoners Fate), they're planning to release their next game with Abalon Arena. A fusion of turn-based tactics and strategic card play inspired by Dungeons and Dragons and Magic: The Gathering.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bETaHg8x3Cg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/396d9ade066e111ac9e8b386ba2fa55d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bETaHg8x3Cg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It has a rather long list of features, that should excite any fans of the genre with 20 heroes to choose from like a squirrel hurling druid, which sounds hilarious. Who also wouldn't want to try playing as a psychic lizard wizard? There's also over 400 cards to build up your dream team with.</p>
<p>This isn't just a single-player experience though. While it has a fully featured solo-play system, with a challenging AI, it also has full online play with PvP ranked matches, 2v2 ranked battles, a casual mode, instant replay for showing off, support for asynchronous turn-based multiplayer for those who don't have a lot of time and normal turn-based multiplayer with matches that should only last around 7 minutes. Sounds like a little something for everyone who enjoys turn-based action and deck-building.</p>
<p>There's a demo available with Native Linux <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2352400/Abalon_Arena/" target="_blank">support on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Noir-influenced detective RPG &#39;Pixel Noir&#39; is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Noir-influenced detective mystery RPG? Sounds thoroughly interesting! Pixel Noir has now left Early Access.</p>
<p>Another that was funded on Kickstarter where the developer pulled in $61,212 back in 2015. It took a while to get here, and sadly they lost one of their artists, Shane Stevens, to cancer back in 2020 so this was the last project Stevens worked on which Dave Gilbert of Wadjet Eye Games <a href="https://twitter.com/WadjetEyeGames/status/1755625855882023291" target="_blank">mentioned</a> on X (formerly Twitter).</p>
<p>More about the game: Pixel Noir is a hard-boiled detective RPG set inside a sprawling metropolis, where gangs roam free and coffee cures all. Uncover the truth--recover your sanity as you unravel Pinnacle City’s darkest secrets.</p>
<p>Something happened that night in the hospital, something that cost you your career as a police detective, your sanity, and the life of your partner. Ten years later, you have a chance to set things right. Are the hallucinations that haunt you a clue to what happened that fateful night?</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Uko0zgpbTwk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2ed568967a791ad08ceaa214bc67111a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Uko0zgpbTwk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Solve mysteries as Pinnacle City’s cheapest Private Eye! From missing pets to murder investigations, your detective skills will earn you either fortune or face punches.</li>
<li>Explore Pinnacle City, a wretched hive of scum and villainy, littered with black market trade, grifters, and players of all kinds.</li>
<li>Fight enemies in turn-based combat and unleash devastating combo attacks by teaming up with others in your entourage!</li>
<li>Tune up your gear! Upgrade weapons with modifications to fit your play style.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified!</p>

      <title>I&#39;m terrible at Poker but a deck-building poker roguelike? Balatro has me hooked</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Balatro is releasing on February 20th and if you love card games and deck-builders, you're probably going to need to check this one out. It also has a demo available for Steam Next Fest 2024.</p>
<p>A Poker-inspired roguelike, because while the basics are Poker, you do get plenty of tricks up your sleeve to win big with various special cards. It's weirdly hooked its teeth right into me and the demo thankfully plays just fine on Linux with Proton 8. Absolutely no issues found in my time trying out the demo.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3894868061707477273gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3894868061707477273gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Like any good deck-builder it has special cards, and a card shop to keep changing your deck. What really makes it interesting are the Joker cards, there's 150 of them, each with their own special ability to change how your run goes and you can have multiple of them equipped at once. Like Odd Todd above, which gives me +30 chips for odd ranked cards when played.</p>
<p>There's a lot more to it like special Tarot cards, which can enhanced and change your current cards if you're trying to get a particular hand. These cards, along with the Jokers, can really end up massively changing how your run goes and can suddenly dump a whole lot of chips your way.</p>
<p>Now, this is not Traditional Poker by any sense. It has the basics of it, and you play your hands like it's a Poker game as you aim for a Full House, a Flush and so on but rather than playing other players or bots, you're trying to beat the Blind with the score required getting ever-higher so you need to work on those synergies from your hand with your other special cards to score big.</p>

      <title>Swordhaven: Iron Conspiracy is a party-based RPG from the ATOM RPG team</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AtomTeam are moving on from their Fallout and Wasteland inspired titles ATOM RPG and ATOM RPG Trudograd, onto their next game they just announced with Swordhaven: Iron Conspiracy.</p>
<p>They're channelling a bit of Baldur's Gate here, so perhaps if you're eager for more this might be worth keeping an eye on. In fact, they even say it's directly inspired by the likes of Baldur’s Gate 1, Icewind Dale and other classics.</p>
<p>"You take up the mantle of a lonely adventurer on their way to the barely explored land of Nova Drakonia. During your voyage, you are met by a dying man who trusts you with a peculiar artefact that will involve you in an adventure of a lifetime, and a plot that threatens everything you’ve ever known and loved."</p>
<p>There's no trailer yet as it's still in development but we do have some early shots of it (click them to see bigger):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3067006231707475275gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3067006231707475275gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13411789171707475277gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13411789171707475277gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11638438361707475277gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11638438361707475277gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7763206201707475278gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7763206201707475278gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the planned features include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A flexible combat engine. Experience battle as a tactician in turn-based combat, or hasten the pace with the real-time with pause (RTwP) mode.</li>
<li>A classless roleplaying system: each stat combination provides a unique gaming experience, distinctive dialogues, and novel ways to solve quests.</li>
<li>A classics-inspired yet modern User Interface with large customization possibilities.</li>
<li>A vast, nonlinear world filled with unique NPCs and multi-solution quests that reward exploration, always offering alternative approaches to satisfy any character build.</li>
<li>Dozens of hours of exploration, from quiet village hamlets to hidden temples of the ancients, horrid crypts, bizarre dungeons, and otherworldly locales…</li>
</ul>

      <title>Humble Bundle raised $14 million for charity in 2023 - over $250 million overall</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Bundle</a> announced some new numbers recently, and it's quite impressive to see how much they're actually doing for various charities thanks to all their bundles.</p>
<p>Starting off from very simple beginnings back in 2010 from the crew at Wolfire Games, then being spun into its own company and eventually being acquired by Ziff Davis through IGN it's been through a lot of changes. Initially just running the Humble Indie Bundles, giving various cross-platform games all DRM free — they've since expanded rather a lot with a full store (although it's largely keys for other stores). They also now bundle up basically everything including games, software, music kits, assets for game developers, ebooks and more.</p>
<p>Their new report highlights that through 2023 they managed to raise over $14.4 million USD for over 7,500 charities, thanks to everyone buying from them. This includes the likes of <a href="https://www.preventcancer.org" target="_blank">The Prevent Cancer Foundation</a>, <a href="https://www.charitywater.org" target="_blank">charity: water</a>, <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org" target="_blank">The Trevor Project</a>, <a href="https://www.specialeffect.org.uk" target="_blank">SpecialEffect</a> and many other great causes. Overall they've now raised over $250 million for charities.</p>

      <title>You&#39;re going to need to take mining-shooter BORE BLASTERS away from me</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>BORE BLASTERS is a mining-shooter from Scottish studio 8BitSkull, the same developer that also made Void Scrappers and Fates of Ort, two other games I also quite liked. It seems they're onto something again here!</p>
<p>This could easily end up replacing all those horde survival games I've been playing like Vampire Survivors, Brotato and all the others. It gives a similar sort-of feeling with repeated runs, as you gather upgrades and watch lots of numbers go up but in a rather different setting. Here you're given a gyrocopter with a machine-gun drill to mine underground across various random islands, many with different biomes and creatures and special item blocks to blast through. It's simply delicious and with full Native Linux and Steam Deck support — you need to try it out.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HH-QHeuJBj0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/13997febf9ae7d2488363f0878e09bcb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HH-QHeuJBj0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I like that it's not particularly punishing either. While the fuel mechanic may need some tweaks, if you fail a run you at least get to keep your rewards to continue unlocking more permanent upgrades to just dive in and try some more mining. Nice and accessible.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fast-paced mining action</strong> - Mining has never been so intense and rewarding; the satisfaction of blasting through the depths would make any dwarf grin with delight.</li>
<li><strong>Bite-sized runs</strong> - Runs can be over quickly or last longer, if you’re able to survive. Play for a few minutes or up to 10-15 if you’re an experienced player.</li>
<li><strong>Un-punishing progress</strong> - If you fail a run or need to cancel early for whatever reason, you keep your rewards and resources to spend on upgrades and abilities.</li>
<li><strong>Unlockable characters</strong> - Dive into the narrative of this dwarven steampunk world to complete quests and unlock playable characters with new and unique abilities.</li>
<li><strong>Upgrade your gyrocopter</strong> - Visit the Techsmith and spend your earnings on permanent upgrades to make mining faster, safer, and more satisfying, or discover temporary upgrades buried in the mines to help you out in a pinch.</li>
<li><strong>Endless replayability</strong> - No two runs will be the same, a diverse range of biomes and procedurally generated mineshafts mean you’ll never know what’s ahead.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Linux gaming performance display MangoHud v0.7.1 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>MangoHud is the fantastic tool you can use to display various amounts of performance information while gaming on Linux, it's also what the Steam Deck uses for the HUD too. A new version 0.7.1 is out now!</p>
<p>For reference, it can look a little like this at the top:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8778636231707412724gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8778636231707412724gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>If you like my horizontal layout you can find it on my <a href="https://gist.github.com/LiamDawe/199a3341f0d91d2f306375a76ab4e7f3" target="_blank">GitHub Gist</a>, just copy it into a text file and name it "MangoHud.conf" and place it into "~/.config/MangoHud/".</p>
<p>In the new release these parameters have been changed:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">gamepad_battery</code> has been reworked to <code class="inline-code">device_battery</code>. This parameter currently supports the values <code class="inline-code">gamepad</code> and <code class="inline-code">mouse</code>.</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">time</code> now has a title.</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">fps_metrics</code> takes a decimal value or "avg". e.g <code class="inline-code">avg,0.001</code> and displays the metrics.</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">winesync</code> shows the current implementation of synchronization primitives. E.g ESYNC/FSYNC etc.</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">present_mode</code> shows the current Vulkan present mode or vsync status in OpenGL.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other changes and fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for gpu load on Adreno GPUs.</li>
<li>Added cpu temp for zenpower3 module.</li>

<li>Fixed an issue where no config present wouldn't use default mangohud presets.</li>
<li>Fixed a crashing issue with CS2.</li>
<li>Reworked intel code. Should resolve some issues where mangohud didn't shut down properly when using an Intel GPU.</li>
<li>Fix OpenGL runtime on musl libc systems <a href="https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud/pull/1133" target="_blank">#1133</a>.</li>
<li>Fixed <code class="inline-code">text_outline_color</code> incorrectly using BGR instead of RGB.</li>

      <title>Heroes of Might and Magic II game engine fheroes2 v1.0.12 released</title>
      <author>fheroes2</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dear fans of Heroes of Might and Magic 2 and fheroes2 project supporters! The team is excited to announce a new version of the <em><strong>fheroes2</strong></em> project - <strong><a href="https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2/releases/tag/1.0.12" target="_blank">1.0.12</a></strong> as the first update of this year! The team have made many changes in several aspects of the engine since the last release, and we are happy to share the details with you.</p>
<p>One of the biggest areas where the team has made huge improvements is the <em><strong>AI</strong></em>.</p>
<p>First of all, we have made important adjustments to the AI's performance according to the difficulty level. This is especially noticeable on Easy and Normal difficulties, and this will help players who are struggling with these difficulty levels.</p>
<p>Secondly, the behaviour of the AI heroes has been updated for several Adventure Map objects: for most objects the information available to the AI is now much more fair. Additionally, the AI will now expand its territory much more efficiently.</p>
<p>Lastly, the team made significant improvements concerning the AI's defensive battle tactics and surrender logic. The AI will apply more sophisticated tactics during battles, increasing the challenge for players. Also, now the AI will decide between surrendering or retreating from battles, just like human players do.</p>
<p>All of these changes will make the AI a more formidable opponent for many players.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1390172451707405646gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1390172451707405646gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>The second biggest area of progress is of course the <em><strong>Editor</strong></em>. The team has finished adding all of the objects present within the game into the Editor. We have also updated the new map format to accommodate for future changes and to expand it with new features. Most of the work is now done, but there are several tasks remaining before releasing the brand-new reworked Editor to players and map makers. The fheroes2 Editor is being built with the aim to be much more accessible and easier to work with compared to the original Editor.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12204111821707405667gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12204111821707405667gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>On top of this, the team spent time polishing multiple <em><strong>UI dialogs</strong></em>, improving <em><strong>performance </strong></em>of image and resource loading, fixing <em><strong>logic issues</strong></em> of Adventure Map objects, and updating several <em><strong>translations</strong></em>. In total, more than <strong>50</strong> issues have been fixed in this release.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your invaluable support, and we hope you will enjoy this release!</p>

      <title>Driving survival game Pacific Drive is very cool - here&#39;s the fix for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pacific Drive is a first-person driving-survival game with a demo now available, it's really interesting and nice to see something different but for Steam Deck and Desktop Linux it needs a fix to get working.</p>
<p>More about the game: "Pacific Drive is a first-person driving survival game with your car as your only companion. Navigate a surreal reimagining of the Pacific Northwest, and face supernatural dangers as you venture into the Olympic Exclusion Zone. Each excursion into the wilderness brings unique and strange challenges as you restore and upgrade your car from an abandoned garage that acts as your home base. Gather precious resources and investigate what’s been left behind in the Zone; unravel a long-forgotten mystery while learning exactly what it takes to survive in this unpredictable, hostile environment."</p>
<p>When you try to launch it will give you an error about Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime, but it's easy to install using Protontricks. The method is the same across Steam Deck and Desktop Linux.</p>
<p>For Steam Deck, make sure you're in Desktop Mode. Steam Button -&gt; Power - Switch to Desktop.</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Steam Deck</u> / <u>KDE Plasma</u> - Open the Discover store, in the search box (top left) type in "Protontricks", click it and hit Install (top right). </li>
<li><u>Manual install</u> / <u>GNOME</u> - available via <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/com.github.Matoking.protontricks" target="_blank">Flathub</a>. On GNOME desktops, you can also download via GNOME Software.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then go through these steps once you've loaded it. First, select the game in the list:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11546786881707402762gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11546786881707402762gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>In the next menu just select the default:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1087961421707402796gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1087961421707402796gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>After that select to install a Windows DLL or component:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17266234021707402829gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17266234021707402829gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Then finally on the next screen scroll down to vcrun2019 or vcrun2022 (either should work fine):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5325736261707402893gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5325736261707402893gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It will bring up an extra installer window for vcrun, just go through it and once finished you can close it all and then the game will run just fine.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1458140/Pacific_Drive/" target="_blank">Pacific Drive on Steam</a>. The demo is well-worth a go and the full game launches February 22nd, and apart from the above issue the demo works really well with the current stable Proton 8.</p>

      <title>HELLDIVERS 2 is out - here&#39;s how to run it on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>HELLDIVERS 2 from Arrowhead Game Studios and PlayStation PC has arrived, and it's causing issues for players on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux. Here's some ways you may be able to get it to work.</p>
<p>What's the issue? It's using kernel-level nProtect GameGuard anti-cheat, which seems to be the cause of the problems. It's also causing issues for people on Windows too it seems going by some of the Steam forum posts on it. The developer has even had to put up a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/553850/discussions/2/4206994023681287288/" target="_blank">statement</a> on it and open a dedicated Steam forum for it.</p>
<p>On my Desktop Linux install with Kubuntu 23.10, it actually <em>worked</em> right out of the box with Proton 8.0-5. However, others have been reporting issues with it not launching. While on Steam Deck (current latest Preview), my testing there showed it simply <em>wouldn't</em> launch with Proton 8, Proton 7 or Proton Experimental.</p>
<p>Going by the Proton <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/7486" target="_blank">GitHub report</a> that's open for it, a user <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/7486#issuecomment-1933869055" target="_blank">mentioned</a> they got it to work on their Desktop Linux install with GE-Proton 7-55. So, even though for my desktop it works on Proton 8, trying out GE-Proton 7-55 on Steam Deck and — yep, it works!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10950898721707399746gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The big <u>caveat</u>: you <em>need</em> to launch it with this GE-Proton 7-55 in <u>Desktop Mode</u>, something about nProtect GameGuard doesn't run in Gaming Mode. You also need to tap the screen to get controls on Steam Deck to actually work.</p>
<p>So regardless of being on Desktop Linux or Steam Deck, if you try out GE-Proton 7-55 you <em>should</em> be able to get in-game.</p>
<p><em>I have not tested online play with a group yet, only solo play.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p>How to install GE-Proton:</p>
<p><strong>Download ProtonUp-Qt</strong></p>
<p>For Steam Deck, make sure you're in Desktop Mode. Steam Button -&gt; Power - Switch to Desktop.</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Steam Deck</u> / <u>KDE Plasma</u> - Open the Discover store, in the search box (top left) type in "ProtonUp-Qt", click it and hit Install (top right). Alternatively on Steam Deck if you have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/decky-loader-makes-steam-deck-plugins-even-easier-with-new-installer/" target="_blank">Decky Loader</a>, you can also try the "Wine Cellar" plugin.</li>
<li><u>Manual install</u> / <u>GNOME</u> - head to the <a href="https://davidotek.github.io/protonup-qt/" target="_blank">official website</a>, scroll down and pick your favourite download option either AppImage or <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/net.davidotek.pupgui2" target="_blank">Flathub</a>. On GNOME desktops, you can also download via GNOME Software.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Using ProtonUp-Qt:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Launch ProtonUp-Qt.</li>
<li>Make sure it's set to Steam at the top, click Add version and scroll down to select to install GE-Proton7-55.</li>
<li>Reload Steam to update the compatibility layer list.</li>
<li>In Steam:
<ul>
<li><u>Desktop</u>: right click a game and go to Properties.</li>
<li><u>Steam Deck</u> / <u>Big Picture Mode</u>: find the game in your library, go to the little cog on the right and then select Properties.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Compatibility menu -&gt; Tick the box, select GE-Proton from the drop-down menu.</li>
</ul>
<p>My original video of how to do it on Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6doaQNnHR60"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/37b4fc871ab3188f385a1c60a2e0949c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6doaQNnHR60" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<hr/>
<p>Given how much effort it is to get working, and with absolutely no guarantee it will continue working due to this kernel-level anti-cheat that could update and break it any time (as really, it shouldn't work at all), it's <strong>not</strong> something I will actually recommend anyone purchase. I would consider going for a different game for sure.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental gets improvements for The Finals, TEKKEN 8, Black Desert Online</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a new update to Proton Experimental for Steam Deck and Desktop Linux, bringing in some fixes for various games. Here's what you need to know. There's a few different versions of Proton so if you're confused check the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton beginner's guide</a>.</p>
<p>First of all, Valve are noting that <strong>Black Desert Online</strong> (although now it's just called <strong>Black Desert</strong>) is now playable as of this release.</p>
<p>On top of that both <strong>The Finals</strong> and <strong>TEKKEN 8</strong> have some fixes that were previously <em>only</em> available via Proton Hotfix, so they're now in Proton Experimental too.</p>
<p>A few Proton Experimental regressions were also fixed including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Space Enginners</strong> is again able to connect to a server.</li>
<li><strong>Diablo IV</strong> no longer has window focus issues after opening a browser on a Steam Deck.</li>
<li><strong>Disgaea 5</strong> no longer crashes during intro cinematic if MovieType was set to 2.</li>
<li><strong>Resident Evil 2</strong> no longer behaves weirdly when the window dragged around in windowed mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this release Valve also improved support for input devices with 8+ axes.</p>
<p>There's also an improvement in compatibility noted for <strong>OpenComposite</strong>, something I hadn't heard of before but the <a href="https://gitlab.com/znixian/OpenOVR" target="_blank">project page</a> describes it as: "OpenComposite OpenXR (previously known as OpenOVR - OpenVR for OculusVR - but renamed due to confusion with OpenVR) is an implementation of SteamVR's API - OpenVR, forwarding calls directly to the OpenXR runtime. Think of it as a backwards version of ReVive, for the OpenXR compatible headsets."</p>
<p>Full changelog for Proton can <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">seen on GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Beta now lets you actually close controller info panels with controllers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A bit of an oversight in the Steam Client is that their newer Controller info panels that appear before a game launches couldn't be dismissed with a controller - but now they can. </p>
<p>Valve updated both Steam Desktop and Steam Deck with the new Beta, but to be clear, you could always dismiss panels on the Steam Deck (Gaming Mode) and Big Picture Mode - this is mainly for Steam Desktop (and when in Desktop Mode on Steam Deck). Specifically, panels like this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/842988271707327220gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/842988271707327220gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Kick back! Huh? When you plugged a controller in, you still needed to wrestle your mouse to click okay. But not any more. It can now be dismissed properly via controller. <em>The above screen was added back in the stable <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/valve-gives-steam-a-nice-upgrade-for-controller-friendly-games/" target="_blank">November 2023 update</a>.</em></p>
<p>Main Steam Client Beta (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053/view/4047116236901935091" target="_blank">changelog</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed double notifications when friends go online or in-game</li>
<li>Fixed collapse state of friends list and chat group sections not being properly remembered.</li>
</ul>
<p>Big Picture Mode</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issues with popup menus and other popup dialogs</li>
</ul>
<p>Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Controllers can be used to dismiss/continue when controller support information panels appear before a game's launch.</li>
<li>Fix for Gyro enable button not being respected.</li>
<li>QoL Gyro Calibration button available in Controller Config Quick settings, and in the Gyro section of the Controller Layout Editor.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a fresh problem though that's been around for a few weeks in the Steam Beta on Linux, where Big Picture Mode just doesn't seem to actually grab controller input for some people. It was <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/10406" target="_blank">reported on GitHub</a>, and testing today with my Xbox controller only the Xbox button works - no other button does. So BPM is a bit broken right now. Hopefully Valve will fix that soon.</p>
<p>Steam Deck got an extra fix for some broken pop-up menus like in the game Properties menu (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4064004735504576851" target="_blank">changelog</a>):</p>
<blockquote>

      <title>Crusader Kings III is about to get a lot of extra exciting content</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox Interactive have announced Chapter III of Crusader Kings III, a set of expansions that will bring in some rather exciting sounding additions to the popular grand strategy game.</p>
<p>Chapter III comes in the form of a cosmetic pack, two main expansions and an event pack that will be released across 2024. The first part, Couture of the Capets, is available <em>now</em> that adds in new fashions and styles inspired by French royal culture in the High Middle Ages (13th century).</p>
<p>What else is coming:</p>
<ul>
<li>Legends of the Dead - Turn yourself into a figure of legend in this Core Expansion, where great feats and effective propaganda can enhance the power of your bloodline through the centuries. Direct the course of your dynastic legend through Court Chroniclers, and use your growing reputation to build a lasting material legacy. But beware of the growing threat from distant lands as the Black Death builds a legendary legacy of its own. This will be arriving on March 4th.</li>
</ul>
<p>Trailer for the expansion is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vWUlPnbXUW4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/afa33680c44dc2fb3b9b733cad77d547.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vWUlPnbXUW4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>And more…</p>
<ul>
<li>Roads to Power - The majesty of the Byzantine Empire takes center stage in this Major Expansion. Rule from Constantinople through a new Administrative Government form and experience various Byzantine-themed events and flavors. Or, be truly daring and live a life where your noble reputation is not tied to the land, roaming the map as an adventurer for hire. </li>
<li>Wandering Nobles - Building on the travel system introduced with Tours &amp; Tournaments, this event pack introduces a new Travel Lifestyle and new ways and reasons to travel - incidents and stories related to roaming far from the safety of your court.</li>
</ul>
<p>“It’s very exciting to be able to talk about our plans for 2024,” says Crusader Kings III Game Director Alex Oltner. “We’ve been working hard on trying to find ways to introduce major historical content like the Black Death and the Byzantine Empire’s distinct form of government into CKIII, and we know that our fans have been wanting these as well. Chapter III promises to be one of the biggest phases in the game’s history.”</p>
<p>Looks like you can't buy them individually, as they're all bundled together as Chapter III. It's going to cost you a bit too with it set at $43.98 / £38.48 / €43.98 for the full bundle.</p>
<p>You can buy Crusader Kings III from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/crusader-kings-iii?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158310/Crusader_Kings_III/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Diablo game engine devilutionX fixes up multiplayer in v1.5.2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The modern cross-platform Diablo game engine devilutionX has a new release available, and although small it does have some important fixes. What does it do? DevilutionX is a port of Diablo and Hellfire that strives to make it simple to run the game while providing engine improvements, bugfixes, and some optional quality of life features.</p>
<p>A bonus for Linux / Steam Deck fans of course is that it has a Native Linux version - so hopefully a better experience.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10869421641707313531gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10869421641707313531gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The fixes in v1.5.2 are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Multiplayer</p>
<ul>
<li>Unable to join game due to invalid player data</li>
</ul>
<p>Translations</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve rendering of Chinese/Japanese/Korean texts</li>
</ul>
<p>Gameplay</p>
<ul>
<li>Hellfire items not saving their identified state</li>
</ul>
<p>Stability / Performance / System</p>
<ul>
<li>Stash corrupting when converting a hero between Diablo and Hellfire</li>
<li>Amiga: Incorrect rendering of things behind transparent elements</li>
<li>Android: Game locking up when switching sound output</li>
<li>Fedora: Unable to locate BZIP2</li>
<li>Manjaro: Unable to locate libsodium</li>
<li>Xbox: Game crashing unexpectedly</li>
<li>Xbox: Improve performance</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>See more on the <a href="https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>. But you do need to buy a copy of Diablo to run the full game with it - which you can <a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/diablo?as=1636858786" target="_blank">purchase from GOG.com</a>. For Linux you can install the game engine via <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/org.diasurgical.DevilutionX" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.</p>
<p>Is it now the best way to play the original Diablo? Let me know what you think in the comments.</p>

      <title>Arms Race returns to Counter-Strike 2, custom sticker placement, Zeus skin and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve finally put out a big update to Counter-Strike 2, bringing with it a much needed boost with a new game mode, new types of skins and more.</p>
<p>Arms Race has officially returned! The quick-fire mode where you get two kills to progress onto a new weapon, or steal opponents progress with a knife kill (and now the Zeus too) and eventually get to the final knife to get that winning kill. Good fun so it's nice to see it back.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5637588211707312048gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5637588211707312048gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - CS2 Arms Race on Linux</em></p>
<p>On top of that there's a new weapon sticker system, allowing you to place stickers by dragging and dropping them around the weapon to get your perfect placement. Plus you can add up to five stickers to a weapon now too.</p>
<p>There's more. The first CS2 case has arrived, The Kilowatt Case, adding 17 community-designed weapon finishes and the all-new Kukri knife. No dobut that knife will excite a lot of CS2 fans! Heck, even the Zeus now has its first weapon finish, something players have been begging for. Additionally the Zeus now recharges in 30 seconds in all game modes.</p>
<p>What else? Oh there's a new Ambush Sticker Capsule (featuring 21 community-created stickers), the NIGHTMODE Music Kit Box (featuring six new Music Kits), an XP Overload icon next to player names if they have earned all their normal weekly XP and Agents with unique end-of-match animations now do their thing during victory and defeat.</p>
<p>According to developer Timothee "TTimo" Besset on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@TTimo/111890512855786311" target="_blank">Mastodon</a> "the update also ships with continued performance improvements to the vulkan render path", so that's great too!</p>
<p>See all on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/armsrace" target="_blank">special update page</a>.</p>
<p>What do you think to this update? Let me know in the comments! Personally, I'm looking forward to the next-generation Danger Zone, I really hope they bring it back. With all the updates to the base game of CS2, they could do a lot more with Danger Zone now.</p>

      <title>Half-Life remake Black Mesa hits over 100,000 Steam reviews to Overwhelmingly Positive</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Quite an impressive milestone for an incredible game overall! The Half-Life remake Black Mesa has managed to cross over 100,000 user reviews on Steam. It's rated Overwhelmingly Positive thanks to everyone leaving their thoughts. And going by the <a href="https://steam250.com/top250" target="_blank">Steam Top 250</a> list it's currently number 155 of the most highly rated games on Steam ever.</p>
<p>Not exactly surprising though, given how loved Half-Life is and Black Mesa is a pretty incredible remake all-around with some fantastic attention to detail.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5885837401707309954gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5885837401707309954gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Black Mesa is rated Steam Deck Playable, and it has a Native Linux version - but you're better off using Proton as it's been left with numerous bugs.</p>
<p>Would you say people first starting off in Half-Life should jump into Black Mesa? Or are you a die-hard for the actual original which recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/half-life-25th-anniversary-update-brings-half-life-uplink-steam-deck-support/" target="_blank">had its own big 25th Anniversary Update</a>? I'm still amazed Valve actually allowed Crowbar Collective to do a remake like this.</p>

      <title>Open source simulation game OpenTTD has a big new v14 update coming </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>OpenTTD, an open source simulation games based on Transport Tycoon Deluxe is getting close to a big new release, with version 14 bringing many new features and improvements. <em>The second Beta was released on February 4th.</em></p>
<p>While it was originally based on Transport Tycoon Deluxe and retains the familiar feel of the classics, it's very much expanded into its own game. It's also entirely standalone, so you don't need anything extra to play it. Just grab OpenTTD and away you go.</p>

      <title>From Glory To Goo is a new base-building RTS where you defend against gooey aliens</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From Glory To Goo is a new upcoming real-time strategy game from Stratagem Blue that has me a little excited, and so far the demo seems to work quite well on Linux. Specifically, you'll need <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/ge-proton-8-29-and-ge-proton-8-30-released-with-eac-fix-and-tekken-8-fix/" target="_blank">GE-Proton</a>, because otherwise the tutorial videos don't work.</p>
<p>I'm a huge sucker for these types of RTS games! You start off on a random world with nothing but your starting building that drops down from space, and then continue to expand across the map for resources. Eventually waves of little Goo enemies will appear, so you have to encase your base in walls and turrets to keep them at bay, while you build up an army to take the fight to the Goo directly.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OlMu4XIrGJ0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e7cc5a2583eb94ec397bb1de5c31dc26.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OlMu4XIrGJ0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While the UI could use a little work, the basics are all there and it seems like a great idea.</p>
<p>As you expand across the map you can find wreckage from previous planetary expeditions, native Aliens you can ally with or destroy and various other secrets. Not only that but there's plenty of feature additions outside of just the planetary building an exploration. There's an upgrade system where you need to send resources back up to your colony ship to eventually unlock more to build, there's different captains to pick with various buffs, multiple factions to choose with different units and buildings and more.</p>
<p>Definitely worth keeping an eye on and trying out the demo, which the developer keeps improving based on feedback from various players.</p>
<p><em>The developer plans to launch into Early Access sometime early this year.</em></p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2607060/From_Glory_To_Goo/" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>World War Z disables Vulkan on Steam Deck (but you can get it back)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Saber Interactive have updated the co-op zombie shooter World War Z, and now they've disabled being able to pick the Vulkan API on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>It seems some users were reporting crashing issues with the game, as noted on the Steam <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/699130/discussions/0/4032476411664147690/" target="_blank">forum post</a>. A user emailed into GamingOnLinux to note they noticed that just recently after this forum post that now they can no longer pick Vulkan. And after contacting Saber Interactive support they said it was "disabled to improve the stability of the game".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4518233931707221235gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4518233931707221235gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>So somewhere along the lines either an update to the game, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> or the Mesa graphics drivers introduced issues for the game. For now out of the box, Vulkan just can't be picked on Steam Deck. This also means you <em>can't</em> use the in-game FSR 2.2 either, because it's only available with Vulkan in World War Z. Well, until you <em>disable</em> the Steam Deck check that is. Like you <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/skyrim-special-edition-updated-with-steam-deck-support-ultrawide-res-bug-fixes/" target="_blank">can do with Skyrim</a>, you can set this launch option in the game Properties to get it all back:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">SteamDeck=0 %command%</code></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15877342631707222009gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15877342631707222009gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>As for some people, it seems Vulkan <em>is</em> actually more stable.</p>
<p>This change only affects Steam Deck. Testing it myself on Desktop Linux and you can still pick Vulkan normally with the default being DirectX 11.</p>
<p>World War Z is available from:</p>

      <title>Apple&#39;s 2014 Game of the Year puzzler Threes! now on Steam with Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another great game to add to your collection is here with Threes!, originally a mobile game now upgraded an enhanced for the PC and it's available now on Steam.</p>
<p>This was Apple's 2014 Game of the Year, and it won a Apple Design Award too. It was quite a big thing back when it released. It was so popular in fact, that like a lot of mobile games, there was a bit of Attack of the Clones that went on. The developers even wrote their own <a href="https://asherv.com/threes/threemails/#letter" target="_blank">blog post</a> to address it. If you've heard of 2048 — it cloned this. This is the <em>original</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20910090771707219956gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20910090771707219956gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's a number swiping game that just keeps on going, as you move number blocks around you try to make multiples of three (see what they did there?). It just gets bigger and bigger, a game for calming the mind and you can spend as much or as little time with it as you want. No timers or any nonsense.</p>
<p>Coming with full Steam Deck support too which the developer <a href="https://twitter.com/AsherVo/status/1752782105678070101" target="_blank">mentioned</a> on X (formerly Twitter):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="Whew, Threes for Steam is DONE!  It's got: + Full Controller/Keyboard Support + Full Steam Deck Compatibility + Cloud Saving + Achievements + New Night Mode Music" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15964431231707219571gol1.png"/></p>
<p>So we can expect it to run great on desktop Linux too with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1818570/Threes/" target="_blank">out on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Proton Hotfix gets Persona 3 Reload performance improvements for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you find the performance of Persona 3 Reload to be a little lacking, perhaps try out the latest Proton Hotfix update that Valve just released. For Steam Deck players, you may also want to be on the Preview update branch which also <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/steam-deck-steamos-3514-preview-persona-3-reload-improvements-and-more/" target="_blank">recently had a performance fix too</a>.</p>
<p>Valve's Pierre-Loup Griffais <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1754673249399767359" target="_blank">posted</a> on X (formerly Twitter):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19706842071707218690gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Post text: "A Proton Hotfix with additional performance improvements for Persona 3 Reload has just been deployed."</p>
<p>To change the Proton version used for a game:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Steam:
<ul>
<li><u>Desktop</u>: right click a game and go to Properties.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Compatibility menu -&gt; Tick the box, select Proton Hotfix from the drop-down menu.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can buy Persona 3 Reload from:</p>

      <title>Life by You the Sims-like from Paradox delayed until June</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Life by You from Paradox Tectonic / Paradox Interactive has suffered a fresh delay and will now not hit Early Access until June. Originally planned to launch in September last year, it moved to March this year and now moved again to June 4th.</p>
<p>What actually is it: very much a The Sims like game but designed for a fully open-world and highly moddable. The full open-world with no loading screens and real-language conversations set it quite apart from EA's long-running series.</p>
<p>Paradox Tectonic's General Manager, Rod Humble, announced it in a video below</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QQLu09M_YGY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b2dfb6dc5eda42e56960b46d1e086a8a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QQLu09M_YGY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can see their previous Let's Play below for an early look:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ocqPVeN0QYA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/496333bf55a6d108990831f1eb28fe52.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ocqPVeN0QYA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Like a lot of recent Paradox games, it will only be officially available for Windows. Hopefully it will run nicely with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> so we can get some Life by You on Linux / Steam Deck without too much fuss. Although since it will be Early Access, rough edges are to be expected.</p>
<p>Will it dethrone The Sims 4 though? It still sees regular content updates and on Steam it sees well over 40,000 players peak each day but I'm sure plenty of The Sims fans will be checking it out eager for something different.</p>
<p>Is it something you'll be trying?</p>

      <title>The new Skate from EA will be coming to Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The next-generation Skate is now confirmed to getting a PC release on Steam, so thankfully you won't have to deal with the EA App directly. It was already <a href="https://twitter.com/skate/status/1430938091834023941" target="_blank">confirmed</a> some time ago to be coming to PC (a first for the series), but confirmation that it will be on Steam means it should be nice and smooth to get running on Desktop Linux and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>News about it coming to Steam though only appeared recently in the below video from December 21st, which it seems went largely unnoticed until recently when the team also <a href="https://twitter.com/skate/status/1753116400061682070" target="_blank">posted</a> about it on X (formerly Twitter) to confirm it there as well with a clip from the longer video.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="iXdQp0fmhCE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/37cde28076dd2e2bbe22ef459dbd42fe.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/iXdQp0fmhCE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Also announced in the video is that it will have cross-platform and cross-progression play, good news for players (or if you have friends) across multiple platforms.</p>
<p>Technically Skate 4, it's just going to be called <em>Skate</em>. (the dot is included). It will be free to play at release, so I'll likely give it a go and report back on what compatibility to expect for Linux / Steam Deck.</p>
<p>We do have a few skating games on PC nowadays including Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2, Session: Skate Sim, Skater XL but no doubt many will be looking forward to <em>skate</em>.</p>

      <title>NonSteamLaunchers for Steam Deck expands automatic game shortcuts for more stores</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NonSteamLaunchers is a project to help you easily install various external launchers / game stores on Steam Deck like EA App, Battle.net, Amazon, GOG Galaxy, Ubisoft and more. Recent releases have much improved automatic shortcut creation in your Steam Library.</p>
<p>It can be a bit of a nuisance to set up all these extra stores, and remembering what games you actually have available so NonSteamLaunchers can make it all just that little bit easier.</p>
<p>The feature first <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/nonsteamlaunchers-for-other-stores-on-steam-deck-adds-automatic-game-shortcuts/" target="_blank">introduced in January</a>, NonSteamLaunchers now has a scanning system to automatically add game shortcuts into your Steam Library from all these launchers. Initially quite limited, the last few releases have expanded what launchers / stores it's able to do it for. As of version 3.8 released a couple of days ago it can now scan and add shortcuts for Epic Games, Ubisoft Connect, EA App, Gog Galaxy, Battle.net and Amazon Games.</p>

      <title>Super Pocket Taito Edition Review - Licensed Linux Retro-gaming on a Budget</title>
      <author>Pengling</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Blaze Entertainment's latest Evercade-compatible device makes for an excellent entry to licensed emulation on Linux. <em><strong>NOTE:</strong> Personal purchase.</em></p>
<p>Originally launched in 2020, the <a href="https://evercade.co.uk/" target="_blank">Evercade</a> line is seemingly not often mentioned in Linux-gaming circles, even though the consoles are Linux-based - I find this curious, since in my experience Linux gamers generally tend to be supportive of projects that make use of our software of choice. With a focus on (usually multi-game) cartridge releases instead of digital ones, specifically covering retro and retro-style titles, the platform has seen steady support over the last few years, and now has a sister-brand called <a href="https://www.hypermegatech.com/" target="_blank">Hyper Mega Tech!</a>. This new offshoot offers a line of lower-priced Evercade-compatible handhelds that contain a selection of officially-licensed pre-loaded games, under the name of Super Pocket. I discovered these devices whilst perusing videos about interesting and unusual handhelds recently, and when I saw that they're Evercade-compatible I was intrigued - and, of course, I ended up getting one. I couldn't resist - I might just have an addiction to portables...</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9589767191707132506gol12971.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9589767191707132506gol12971.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>The iconic Space Invaders monster looms forth!</em></p>
<p>At the time of writing there are two versions of the Super Pocket - the Capcom Edition (containing 12 games) and the Taito Edition (containing 18). Though both versions of the Super Pocket offer excellent game-collections, for me the Taito one has more titles overall that are my sort of thing - and the fact that it includes both Bubble Bobble and The NewZealand Story on the same device is a <em>big</em> selling-point for me. Reason being, for Brits who grew up during the 1980s and 1990s home-microcomputer boom, these two Taito titles occupy the same cultural-space that Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros. 3 do for gamers in North America and Japan, except they were available on just about every system going. With the exception of Space Invaders '91, the included titles are all the original arcade versions, not any of the later home-console conversions that so often appear in licensed collections like this, which is really nice to see!</p>
<p>The Taito handheld includes <em>Bubble Bobble</em>, <em>Cadash</em>, <em>Chack'n Pop</em>, <em>Don Doko Don</em>, <em>Elevator Action</em>, <em>Football Champ</em>, <em>Growl</em>, <em>KiKi KaiKai</em>, <em>The Legend of Kage</em>, <em>Liquid Kids</em>, <em>Operation Wolf</em>, <em>Puzzle Bobble</em>, <em>Rastan</em>, <em>Space Invaders</em>, <em>Space Invaders '91</em>, <em>The Fairyland Story</em>, <em>The NewZealand Story</em>, and <em>Volfied</em> (all arcade games, except for Space Invaders '91, which is a Mega Drive title). Meanwhile, the Capcom device includes <em>1942</em>, <em>1943</em>, <em>1944: The Loop Master</em>, <em>Bionic Commando</em>, <em>Captain Commando</em>, <em>Final Fight</em>, <em>Forgotten Worlds</em>, <em>Ghouls 'n' Ghosts</em>, <em>Mega Man</em>, <em>Street Fighter II': Hyper Fighting</em>, <em>Strider</em>, and <em>Wolf of the Battlefield: MERCS</em> (also all arcade games, except for Mega Man, which was originally released for the NES).</p>
<p>Compared to the pricing of the other currently-available Evercade machines (£130 for the Evercade EXP handheld which offers TATE mode for vertical games, and £90 for the Evercade VS home-console which supports up to four players), the Super Pocket at £50 makes for the cheapest way <em>by far</em> to get into much of the Evercade library if you're interested in doing so. The Super Pocket is compatible with most Evercade cartridges (which cost £18 each), though at the time of writing, the game Cathedral, on the Alwa's Awakening/Cathedral twin-pack does not work on these machines, and Future Wars on the Delphine Collection 1 cartridge has been reported not to work on at least some units, as well. Even with those caveats, you still get access to the vast majority of the library.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13968035391707132507gol12971.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13968035391707132507gol12971.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>The console itself.</em></p>
<p>The machine is made from a nice-feeling matte-plastic with a black front panel and a green back, with the buttons on the front and back contrasting in line with this colour-scheme. I'm not quite sure why they went with black-and-green for the Taito machine - it looks more like something that I would associate with Gremlin Graphics' Zool than with Taito, whose classic logo typically used red, yellow, or orange with a splash of white, and whose later iconic triangular logo was blue-and-white. Still, it looks really nice, and evokes a strong 1980s/1990s feel, which is clearly what they're going for considering the release-years of the included games. It's compact but feels good in the hand, and the controls are mostly excellent; The d-pad is superb and feels very definite when you push a direction, and the buttons are somewhat clicky and rather reminiscent of those of the Game Boy Advance SP.</p>
<p>The only real issue is with the L1/L2 and R1/R2 "shoulder" buttons on the back, which are incredibly awkward to press, and would be much better if they stuck out a little more and were less firm and clicky than the buttons on the front of the unit - however, as far as the built-in games go, you're not likely to be using the shoulder-buttons, so it's only a potential issue when using certain Evercade cartridges (and, indeed, on the Super Pocket Capcom Edition, which I'm told does use the rear buttons for some of its games). That said, these buttons are bad, and not fit for purpose if you're planning for this to be your only Evercade-compatible device and intend to pick up games that use them. This is quite surprising considering how good the rest of the controls are, which makes this particular element feel like an afterthought. Since the Super Pocket handhelds are numbered, implying more to come, hopefully future revisions can fix these buttons in some way.</p>
<p>The battery lasts for 4 hours, which is about the baseline for most handhelds today. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it lives up to the claimed time exactly! It's always nice to see a company not exaggerating this - well done, Blaze.</p>
<p>The screen is pretty good for a device that only costs £50. It's not top-of-the-line or anything (there's a tiny bit of light-bleed at the top-left edge on my unit, but this sort of thing doesn't tremendously bother me for a device in this price-bracket, and I never notice it during gameplay and barely notice it in the menus), but it doesn't need to be considering that the hardware is intended for very old games that were made for displays that weren't perfect themselves. The only feature, or rather lack thereof, that makes it stand out is that there's no way to change the brightness, which is something I've never seen before on any backlit display. Luckily, it's not set either too bright or too dim - it's perfectly fine for the task at hand. Games look nice on it, although even if you use the system's "Pixel Perfect" display option, there are always some soft-edged scaling artifacts (which is particularly noticeable on the vertical titles that are included) and "shimmering" when scrolling, which I presume is because the Super Pocket's 320x240 resolution is lower than any of the other Evercade consoles out there; Again, though, for £50 I'm much more willing to let it slide than I would be if a more expensive device did this.</p>
<p>It's worth pointing out that the price-point of the Super Pocket also means that there's no multiplayer or TV-out functionality, as other Evercade consoles have - this is purely a single-player console.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4396064371707132507gol12971.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4396064371707132507gol12971.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Remember these games? They're back, in cartridge form!</em></p>
<p>I picked up a handful of cartridges with my device, some of which (particularly the arcade-game collections) include titles that have not seen a re-release on current PC-gaming platforms at the time of writing, and they're an ideal fit for a device like this, especially since most Evercade cartridges include multiple games. Unlike the retro systems that inspired the Evercade line, you can hot-swap cartridges while the system is powered on, as long as a game isn't running at the time, which is very convenient and something that I became accustomed to back in the days of the Nintendo 3DS. However, it's probably worth being somewhat cautious after saving and exiting a game, just to be on the safe side, as, much like the cartridges of the NeoGeo Pocket Colour, Nintendo 3DS, and Nintendo Switch, they're flash-based rather than using mask-ROMs.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6930365091707132508gol12971.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6930365091707132508gol12971.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Retro presentation for retro games.</em></p>
<p>For those who remember Ocean Software's famous home-microcomputer budget tape range, The Hit Squad, the way that the cartridges are packaged is something of a callback to that - they come in cute little boxes with co-ordinating artwork and collectible numbering, to hook you if you're inclined towards collecting and displaying them all. They're also colour-coded, with red boxes representing retro console/handheld and native titles, purple representing arcade games, and blue representing software originally made for home computers. And, unlike full-priced releases for major platforms, you also get a full-colour manual as well, which contains details about the games and those behind them. (Note that, though Evercade cartridges on the standard consoles display an information-page replicating the relevant part of the manual before you jump into a game, this does not happen on the Super Pocket machines - on those, your chosen game loads immediately without showing anything else first.)</p>
<p>Just like those curated collections of tapes, so too are the Evercade's cartridges curated, and this is one of their great strengths. You'll typically select a cartridge on the basis of a few games that interest you, and end up discovering other games you like along the way. This has happened to me with every single cartridge I've picked up so far. Moreover, not only do the collections sometimes include games that were never released in English before, or finished versions of "lost" titles that weren't released at all during their time, sometimes they'll also come with little bonus surprises like art-cards and posters (I've also heard that some offer stickers too, though I haven't come across any of those myself yet), which I was absolutely delighted by - it reminded me of when older games would include these little goodies, which of course is the intent. I'll definitely be displaying these!</p>
<p>When you load up a cartridge, the menus are well-presented, displaying the games using either their original key-art or arcade-flyer in a scrolling horizontal format; This reminded me of the likes of EmulationStation, though it's not quite as snappy and responsive (it feels like there's some room for improvement here, but it's not a huge issue). It's easy to switch between the Super Pocket's selection of built-in games and those on a cartridge by pressing the Menu button located just under the screen, which will let you access either one of the gaming options, as well as the system's Settings menu.</p>
<p>The emulation is, as anyone who's familiar with <a href="https://evercade.co.uk/credits/" target="_blank">the usual suspects from the Linux emulation scene</a> will already know, pretty much spot-on. I'm actually pickier about this than most, because even though I'm an emulation enthusiast, at one point I was also a major real-hardware-only stickler whilst waiting for the emulation of certain systems I knew well to improve (I'm the sort who wouldn't put up with inaccurate SNES audio emulation or incorrect Z-fighting in PlayStation emulators); Those improvements became reality before too long, and what's presented by the Super Pocket (and by extension the wider Evercade line) is more than good enough for me. I suspect that folks without specialised emulation knowledge would never notice any difference compared to their memories of the real thing. The only downside I found is that you can't remap the controls on this device, though given the price, size, and form-factor this didn't bother me like it otherwise would - they're aiming for a no-fuss console experience, after all.</p>
<p>The Super Pocket (and its Evercade kin) won't be for everyone, especially in a world where it's competing against low-cost emulation handhelds that seem to multiply by the month and don't require cartridges, but if you're looking for a simple Linux-based way to get into retro-gaming (plus some modern indies made in the retro style), where some of the money goes back to the rights-holders for the games and you get some neat little artifacts to use and display, then this is a damn fine place to start. Even with the awful shoulder-buttons, I've been left very impressed by the entire experience and its presentation, inside and out.</p>
<p>If you're interested in picking one up, Blaze Entertainment lists their worldwide retailers for the Evercade and Super Pocket lines <a href="https://evercade.co.uk/retailers/" target="_blank">here (Evercade)</a> and <a href="https://www.hypermegatech.com/retailers/" target="_blank">here (Super Pocket)</a>.</p>
<p>Did you know that the Evercade devices are Linux-based? Are you interested in grabbing one? And are there any retro or indie games that you'd like to see come to the platform? Please share in the comments, below!</p>

      <title>Orange Pi Neo gaming handheld to come with Manjaro Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Shown off during the recent FOSDEM 2024 event, it seems the Manjaro Linux team have buddied up with hardware vendor Orange Pi for the Orange Pi Neo gaming handheld.</p>
<p>The system has not been fully announced by Orange Pi directly as of yet, but the Manjaro Linux team put <a href="https://twitter.com/ManjaroLinux/status/1753619695800844579" target="_blank">various</a> <small>(1)</small> <a href="https://twitter.com/ManjaroLinux/status/1754381527385817545" target="_blank">posts</a> <small>(2)</small> on X (formerly Twitter) and they have a <a href="https://neo.manjaro.org" target="_blank">dedicated page</a> on their website for the Orange Pi Neo that goes over the specifications.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3585672711707133192gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3585672711707133192gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>We haven't seen many jump into Linux for handhelds like this yet aside from the Steam Deck. We would've had the AYANEO Next Lite, which was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/ayaneo-next-lite-with-a-customized-steamos-like-holoiso-fully-revealed/" target="_blank">announced with HoloISO</a>, but they <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/ayaneo-next-lite-no-longer-ships-with-steamos-like-holoiso-linux-windows-11-instead/" target="_blank">reversed course back to Windows</a>. So it's good to see another that will be coming to market to further push Linux in the gaming space!</p>

<p>The decision to go with Manjaro isn't that unexpected either, considering it's the Linux distribution Valve still <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/steamdeck/testing" target="_blank">suggest</a> right now for developing specifically for the Steam Deck without having one (as SteamOS and Manjaro are both Arch Linux based).</p>
<p>Seems like it could be quite an interesting device, definitely worth keeping an eye on! Curious to see more on it, especially since it's an all-in-one device with Orange Pi usually being known for their small boards.</p>

      <title>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor hits Early Access on February 14th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What could be my next favourite horde survival game and an off-shoot of one of the best online co-op games around, Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is launching in Early Access on February 14th.</p>
<p>Taking the basics of Deep Rock Galactic and merging them in with the auto-shooting horde survival elements from Vampire Survivors, their previous demos were a lot of fun to play through so I'm pretty excited for this one. It's somewhat unique for this genre too being set across multiple stage runs with you needing to extract from each map, and then dive down deeper.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nBvTr3nBN5A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0ce1e383884a33d96312107541b0a0e5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nBvTr3nBN5A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>At the initial Early Access release they will have 4 classes, 40 weapons, 20 enemy types, 3 biomes and a deep progression system with plans to continue expanding on all of it for the 6-12 months of the planned development.</p>
<p>The previous demo worked great with Proton!</p>

      <title>Steam Deck SteamOS 3.5.14 Preview - Persona 3 Reload improvements and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released SteamOS 3.5.14 Preview for Steam Deck, which comes with performance improvements for the new Persona 3 Reload amongst other things.</p>
<p>Since it's currently in Preview if you wish to try it you need to go into the System settings, and change the System Update Channel to Preview in the drop-down box. Here's what's changed (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4064004264594106055" target="_blank">changelog</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improved performance of ray-traced reflections in Persona 3 Reload.</li>
<li>Slightly improved corner tracking on Steam Deck OLED trackpads.</li>
<li>Fixed a possible session crash when connecting an HDR display.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare session crash on application exit.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Don't go expecting some kind of miracle though, ray tracing on Steam Deck is pretty tough.</p>
<p>Additionally a Steam Deck Beta update was also released with these changes (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4064004264594243144" target="_blank">changelog</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed misc. regressions in the screenshot manager.</li>
<li>Fixed transparency and blur on header and app details play bar.</li>
<li>Fixed graph height on downloads page.</li>
<li>Fixed wide game images sometimes failing to load.</li>
<li>Fix custom logo positions sometimes not applying on app details pages.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Horde shooter Black Dragon Mage now has a demo, plus developer blog on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Black Dragon Mage is an upcoming dark fantasy, action-roguelite, top-down horde shooter (think like Vampire Survivors) and there's a demo out now. Plus the developer had some words to say on developing with the Steam Deck in mind.</p>
<p>Fans of any of these bullet-heaven horde games will likely enjoy this one, and from my time spent playing the demo it was a lot of fun unlocking various upgrades and weapons to become god-like with power. A little rough around the edges, with some balancing needed to be done but very promising so far!</p>
<p>Writing about developing the game to ensure it works great on Steam Deck, the developer <a href="https://handheld.quest/posts/why-indie-devs-should-get-a-steam-deck/" target="_blank">wrote up a blog post</a> going over it talking about how the "Steam Deck is a Dev Dream come true", and it was interesting to read from a non-dev perspective too, on how they used the performance tools to help emulate lower-performance systems quickly and easy for testing. They even discovered a Proton <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6861" target="_blank">bug</a> which affected even the likes of Starfield. Worth a read!</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="gEwq9Jhulrk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1e317236a365ee0982f65076b6938e0c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/gEwq9Jhulrk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decimate legions of demonic enemies</strong> with magic projectiles and area damage that only grows more powerful. Decipher the weaknesses of <strong>ancient and mysterious boss enemies</strong>, and bring them to their fall.</li>
<li><strong>Grow your might!</strong> Launch increasingly large volleys of fireballs, or icy orbs that leave frosty mines and freeze foes on contact, blast the undead with your arcane beam staff or harness the dark and chaotic power of the void itself! All primary weapons can be modified through stats, but also offer special upgrade paths called <em>Masteries</em> to unlock their full strategic potential and add to build variety.</li>
<li><strong>Forge your own path</strong> by experimenting with your own combinations of your core arsenal &amp; powerful <strong>ARPG-style defensive and offensive abilities</strong> such as the <em>Shield of Frost</em>, <em>Summoned Flameswords</em>, <em>Spiral Strike</em>, <em>Fiery Pentagram!</em> and more!</li>
<li><strong>Level-up</strong> your attributes, weapons and abilities with every character level during a run, customize and tweak your build until it reaches dizzying heights of power; every run marks a new beginning!</li>
<li><strong>Turn the environment to your favor</strong> using your <em>(often outrageously explosive!)</em> strategic genius, outmaneuver your foes by leading them into deadly traps! Laugh as you watch them hurl across the battlefield... <em>Fools!</em></li>
<li><strong>Endure</strong> the relentless waves, or...</li>
<li><strong>Perish</strong> and return stronger by unlocking <strong>meta-upgrades and fresh weaponry</strong> in the <em>Hall of Relics</em> with the gold you've gathered during your tireless runs! Grab a new hat for your mage! One even lets you turn a portion of fallen enemies into bombs that can chain-explode...</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Right now it's being tested worked well in Proton, but it <em>might</em> have a Native Linux build at launch but the developer said right now it runs better with Proton due to input issues.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2207230/Black_Dragon_Mage/" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>They really did it - Valve added Dwarf as an official Steam tag</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a little mini-campaign from the likes of the crew behind Dwarf Fortress and Deep Rock Galactic, Valve added some new official Steam store tags for games.</p>
<p>Releasing a <a href="https://twitter.com/KitfoxGames/status/1752723419500560601" target="_blank">statement</a> on X (formerly Twitter) the Kitfox Games account (who publish Dwarf Fortress) put up an image post on January 30th noting how Valve initially said no to adding a Dwarf tag. However, Valve would add it officially if people started using it on Steam. In the post Kitfox also mentioned how the likes of elf, centaur, wizard and more aren't tags.</p>
<p>Well, fast-forward to February 1st, and Valve did an initial little <a href="https://twitter.com/KitfoxGames/status/1753167600836816941" target="_blank">joke</a> adding <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/tags/en/Elf/" target="_blank">Elf</a> as a full Steam tag and the official Steam account quickly <a href="https://twitter.com/Steam/status/1753194307815920031" target="_blank">replied</a> to joke "Oh whoops, wrong button!" and then linked to the also new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/tags/en/Dwarf/" target="_blank">Dwarf</a> tag.</p>
<p>So there we have it, now as of February 1st have both Dwarf and Elf as official Steam tags.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4159692521706876531gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4159692521706876531gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You can see a list of tags along with the dates they were officially added on <a href="https://steamdb.info/tags/time/" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From the team that gave us Alwa's Awakening and Alwa's Legacy, Elden Pixels have announced the release date for their latest gorgeous looking adventure platformer with A Void Hope launching February 29th.</p>
<p>"A Void Hope takes you on an atmospheric narrative adventure to find a cure for a collapsed city. Follow the story of a tormented couple as they try to decipher reality from nightmares and evade the shadowy threats lurking in the dark."</p>
<p><span style="background-color:var(--article-main-background); color:var(--font-color); font-size:16px">I really enjoyed their first time games, some tightly designed platforming in wonderful looking worlds. And it seems with each new game they've been upping the production values too and this looks like it could be really interesting to run through. </span><span style="background-color:var(--article-main-background); color:var(--font-color); font-size:16px">There's also a new trailer:</span></p>

      <title>Linux remains above macOS on the Steam Survey for January 2024</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The monthly Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey is here for January 2024, and while there was a drop for both Linux and macOS we're still seeing Linux be firmly in second place on Steam now. Interestingly, this month we saw both English and Simplified Chinese (the two most popular languages on Steam) fall with Russian seeing the biggest language jump (+0.60%).</p>
<p>Here's the operating systems overall:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 96.52% +0.12%</li>
<li>Linux 1.95% -0.02%</li>
<li>macOS 1.54% -0.09%</li>
</ul>
<p>With our updated graph found on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">our Steam Tracker</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12358756561706871202gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12358756561706871202gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Who honestly thought it would happen so soon? A couple of years ago it was thought to be impossible to see Linux overtake macOS. Of course, then we had the Steam Deck come along - which has a full Linux desktop mode, which has been what's pushing the numbers up.</p>
<p>Here's the most popular Linux distributions on Steam:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 42.12% +1.59%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 7.76% -0.09%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS 64 bit 6.80% -0.24%</li>
<li>Freedesktop SDK 23.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 5.82% +0.60%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 21.2 64 bit 3.63% -1.07%</li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 3.48% -0.16%<img src="https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/public/images/trans.gif"/></li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 2.76% -0.27%</li>
<li>Other 27.64% -0.35%</li>
</ul>
<p>From the survey we can also see that 70.49% of people on Linux use an AMD processor, and 42.18% on Linux use the Steam Deck so the majority have stuck with SteamOS but it seems a few are using a different Linux distribution on their Deck.</p>

      <title>Earthbound &amp; Undertale inspired action-adventure Dreamed Away hits Kickstarter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This isn't the first time I've covered Dreamed Away, as I genuinely think it looks like it will be a really interesting game and not only can you try it out with the demo but you can now support it on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1680398230/dreamed-away" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>. Inspired by some classics the developer played and loved like Chrono Trigger, Earthbound and Zelda: A Link To The Past and newer games like Everhood and Undertale — this is their own take on an emotional action-adventure game.</p>
<p>More about it: "Dreamed Away challenges our perception of reality and immerses players in the gripping tale of two siblings irrevocably separated by circumstances beyond their control. It delves into the realms of love, doubt, and fears, exploring the enigmatic legends of the Celtic lands of Brittany, France."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_EzyW0bYuLw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6de077f79b858f95818b64f202f34041.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_EzyW0bYuLw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer is looking to get 20,000 to finish the game. The game will have Native Linux and Steam Deck support. Looks like a great one to support.</p>
<p>Check out the demo available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1919900/Dreamed_Away/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and see the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1680398230/dreamed-away" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> to support development.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Trying it out brought up an interesting issue. Initially it gave an <em>empty</em> download on my desktop, but it did download just fine on Steam Deck. Checking on SteamDB, it turns out the developer accidentally set the Linux content just for Steam Deck, a special feature Valve added before the Steam Deck launch allowing developers to put up specific Steam Deck content. The developer quickly <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2742790/history/?changeid=22133647" target="_blank">solved it</a> and now the demo installs fine on desktop and Steam Deck. The opposite issue happened with the game Demon Gaze Extra, where the developer <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/valve-says-a-few-games-being-blocked-from-installing-on-steam-deck-was-just-a-technical-issue/" target="_blank">accidentally blocked</a> Steam Deck installs.</p>

      <title>Time to blow the dust off your VR headset - Metro Awakening is coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Metro Awakening has been announced from Vertigo Games, and will be the first full VR entry into Metro. So clearly it's time to blow the dust off your VR headset and clean away the spider webs.</p>
<p>I joke – a little, there hasn't been all that many truly great PC VR releases that I've seen recently. I still feel completely spoiled by how exceptionally good Half-Life: Alyx was to play through. Still probably my top 5 gaming experiences ever.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's a bit more about Metro Awakening: "Metro Awakening is a story-driven first person adventure built exclusively for VR that blends atmospheric exploration, stealth and combat in the most immersive Metro experience yet.</p>
<p>The year is 2028</p>
<p>The survivors of nuclear Armageddon cling to existence in the buried subways of the Moscow Metro – civilization’s last refuge and tomb, where ghosts and spirits haunt the living in this man-made purgatory.</p>
<p>You are Serdar, a doctor braving the darkness, crippling radiation and deadly threats of the Metro in the search for your wife and the medication she so desperately needs. As your courage and sanity are pushed to the limit you must learn to walk the line between life and death, the spirit and the material world, and awaken the being you will become…"</p>
<p>Announcement trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="n-wQbO5H5tM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ab8b25a71646386b6ccded9267623eb7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/n-wQbO5H5tM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lose yourself in a journey of spiritual awakening in this chilling, supernatural origins story from Metro creator Dmitry Glukhovsky</li>
<li>Experience Metro’s tense, heart-pounding gameplay in VR for the first time as condensation clouds your mask, ammo and filters run low and your torchlight flickers and dies in the darkness</li>
<li>Wield a signature arsenal of hand-made weapons, don your gas mask, and venture into the depths of the Metro where desperate bandits, mutants, and worse haunt your every step</li>
</ul>

<p>VR on Linux still has a number of issues, but with all the rumours around the new Valve VR headset — I'm still hoping Valve will improve it on Linux. If you use VR on Linux, what are your top issues you want to see solved this year?</p>

      <title>Sonic x Shadow Generations announced with a Sonic Generations remaster</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gotta go fast! Sonic x Shadow Generations was just announced by SEGA that is technically two games, so here's all you need to know for the upcoming PC release.</p>
<p>The first part of the game has you play as Shadow the Hedgehog in a brand-new story campaign featuring a host of new abilities and powers: "When Shadow’s old nemesis, Black Doom, reemerges and threatens to take over the world, Shadow must journey into his own past, confront painful memories, face familiar foes, and unlock new powers to save the world and prove why he’s known as the Ultimate Life Form!"</p>
<p>On top of that Sonic x Shadow Generations also comes with a remaster of Sonic Generations that SEGA say has "newly remastered versions of iconic 2D and 3D stages with upgraded visuals and bonus content".</p>
<p>Announcement trailer below:</p>

<p>No doubt it will be playable on Desktop Linux with Proton, and hopefully perform well enough on Steam Deck but time will tell. </p>
<p>You can wishlist and follow <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2513280/SONIC_X_SHADOW_GENERATIONS/" target="_blank">Sonic x Shadow Generations on Steam</a>. Releasing in Autumn 2024.</p>
<p>Sonic will always have a special place in my gamer heart, and it's actually one of the reasons I'm so into gaming. A quick little personal history lesson for you: when I was younger I was in hospital for a while, and the nurses / doctors (not sure exactly who) that looked after me arranged for a TV with a Sega Mega Drive and surprised me one day by wheeling it in. Safe to say playing through Sonic in hospital left a lasting impression. I didn't get to keep it though, sadly, but then a parent surprised me by taking me to buy it when I left the hospital. Good times.</p>

      <title>Palworld hits 19 million players in less than two weeks - beating the latest Pokémon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Palworld continues being an absolutely ridiculous success for developer Pocketpair, as they've announced it's hit 19 million players in less than two weeks.</p>
<p>Going by their post on X (formerly Twitter) they sold 12 million copies on Steam, and saw 7 million players on Xbox where it's available on Game Pass (people can buy it too). Technically, this means it's actually grown a <em>lot</em> faster than even the latest Pokémon games Scarlet and Violet that took <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2023/230207_4e.pdf" target="_blank">7 weeks</a> to hit 18.2 million units. Not a particularly fair comparison though, I will admit, with Palworld being available across multiple platforms.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5025168701706784163gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5025168701706784163gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Palworld post on X</em></p>
<p>Palworld is rated Steam Deck Playable by Valve as it has issues with small text, needing to bring up the keyboard manually, manual graphics configuration is required and some features may not be accessible via controller. It's rated Platinum on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1623730" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> too, and I can confirm it works really nicely on Desktop Linux with Kubuntu 23.10.</p>
<p>A new patch was also just released today, click in below for the patch notes:</p>
<details class="spoiler_container"><summary class="spoiler_header">Patch notes, click me</summary>
<div class="spoiler-content">
<p>▼Major Fixes<br/>
・Fixed an issue where the game would crash under certain conditions<br/>
・Fixed an issue where if another player's pal/base pal had HP 30% or less, it could be captured by using a sphere.<br/>
・Fixed an issue where enemy pals would get stuck in walls due to charge attacks.</p>
<p>・Implemented the first fix for an issue where the game would always crash and save data would be corrupted when the guild's total number of pals captured reached around 7000.<br/>
*The game no longer crashes even if the total number of captured objects exceeds 7000.<br/>
However, save data that has already been in this state (in the case of a server, the server's world data) prior to this update will still be unable to load.<br/>
We are continuing to work on fixing this issue permanently.</p>
<p>▼Key Configuration<br/>
・Added support for mouse side keys and numeric keypad in keyboard key configuration.<br/>
*Further improvements are currently planned, such as support for interact key configuration.</p>
<p>▼Player Issues<br/>
・Fixed an issue where players on dedicated servers and co-op (online) were receiving damage twice.<br/>
・Specifications have been changed so that you can move at extremely low speed even when you have exceeded the weight limit.<br/>
・Players will no longer pass through walls when dismounting.<br/>
・Fixed an issue where capture power strengthened by Lifmunk Effigies was reset when using memory reset drugs.<br/>
・Fixed an issue where armor could be equipped in the wrong slot.<br/>
・Adjusted camera positions of several Pals to make it easier to see when mounted.</p>
<p>▼Base Issues<br/>
・Specifications have been changed so that Pals who are manually assigned to a breeding farm will not become hungry and their manual assignments will not be removed.<br/>
・The key to lift Pals has been changed from F → V (Pad: X → Y) in order to prevent accidents.<br/>
・Reduced the speed and range of fire spreading on wooden buildings.<br/>
・Fixed an issue where manual work assignments could not be set at all under certain circumstances.<br/>
・Fixed an issue where extremely high-level Relaxaurus would attack the base during raids.<br/>
・Added several measures to prevent base Pals from getting stuck.<br/>
・Fixed an issue where Pals would get stuck while transporting items and would drop them on the spot.<br/>
・Fixed an issue where Pals at the base would continue to cut down trees that were already cut.<br/>
・Fixed an issue where Pals at the base were on the verge of death due to unexplained falling damage.<br/>
・Fixed an issue where Pals at the base would float under some conditions.<br/>
・Fixed an issue where if a farm was built on the second floor or above, work pals would be unable to move on the floors below.</p>
<p>▼Other<br/>
・Corrected incorrect text<br/>
・Measures have been added to prevent cheating and stealing other players' Pals.<br/>
・Many other minor fixes such as the addition of a UI key guide.</p>

      <title>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach has a new trailer but no indication of a PC release yet</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Yes, that's the official title now. Death Stranding 2: On The Beach and a generously long new trailer was released during Sony's January State of Play.</p>
<p>As a huge fan of the first game, with it being one of the most memorable gaming experiences I've had in recent years, I can't wait to play through On The Beach. Sadly, that's going to be a good while away. The PlayStation release isn't until 2025, and after that we will still have quite a while to wait before any possible PC release as they'll of course want to stretch out the PS5 game sales of it before moving on.</p>
<p>Trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6cs-A1rNvEE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c9ff724da45e34aa8df1f30daf789eae.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6cs-A1rNvEE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I'm certain it will come to PC at some point, and thanks to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> we should hopefully have a good time with it on Linux. If not, I'm sure Valve will get some fixes in quickly for such a high-profile release like they've done with numerous previous releases.</p>
<p>For reference from the original Death Stranding console release to it arriving on PC it took about 8 months. Let's hope there's no Epic Store exclusive issues with it so we get an easy Steam release.</p>
<p>Are you as excited as I am for Death Stranding 2: On The Beach?</p>

      <title>Godot Engine 4.3 will have official Wayland support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>2024 is clearly the year of Wayland on the desktop, and now Godot Engine will have official Wayland support with an upcoming new release.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/86180" target="_blank">work</a> spearheaded by contributor Riteo was merged into the main code of Godot Engine ~19 hours ago, so it's set for the Godot 4.3 release that will happen later this year. The latest Godot release is 4.2.1, with 4.3 getting a second development snapshot release back in <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-3-dev-2/" target="_blank">early January</a>.</p>
<p>Godot creator Juan Linietsky <a href="https://twitter.com/reduzio/status/1752458561341235543" target="_blank">posted</a> on X (formerly Twitter):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17391785061706703538gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17391785061706703538gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Quote from the picture: "Finally, I'm happy that Godot 4.3 will officially support Wayland! Incredible work by Riteo! The new DisplayServer in Godot 4.0 allows dynamically selecting the backend too!"</p>
<p>Why is this work important? Current Godot games run on Wayland thanks to XWayland, this removes the need for it since the games could run through Wayland directly and it gives Godot access to more Wayland features for advanced window management, and hopefully removing any quirks from games being run via XWayland.</p>

      <title>Celeste gets a 3D makeover in Celeste 64 for the sixth anniversary</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Celeste is easily one of the most popular indie platformers ever made, and it's still going strong six years later. To celebrate, the developers put up a 3D version with Celeste 64: Fragments of the Mountain. The original has an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam from close to 80,000 user reviews.</p>
<p>This new version of the game was made by the original developers in under 2 weeks, which is meant to be considered more like a Game Jam game as they experimented with 3D.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14138656011706700769gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14138656011706700769gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Seems it was mainly designed for gamepad, so make sure you have one ready for the best experience. Just like the original, it's quite challenging to get through and quite nicely brings over the original into 3D. So it will be fun to see what else they come up with in future.</p>
<p>It's available free on <a href="https://maddymakesgamesinc.itch.io/celeste64" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and they even released the source code on <a href="https://github.com/ExOK/Celeste64" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. It's using a mixture of licenses with the content (like art and audio) under a proprietary license, there's FMOD too but the rest seems is open source.</p>
<p>What do you think to this? Let me know in the comments.</p>
<p>Their next upcoming game is Earthblade, a "2D explor-action game in a seamless pixel art world" that's due out sometime this year.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 8-29 and GE-Proton 8-30 released with EAC fix and TEKKEN 8 fix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As usual for a new release of GE-Proton, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/ge-proton-8-28-released-with-ulwgl-support-for-non-steam-games/" target="_blank">GE-Proton 8-28</a> came with some issues, and so some hotfixes are available bringing it up to GE-Proton version 8-30.</p>
<p>This is why I usually remind people to only use GE-Proton when they actually need it for specific games, because it sees far less testing than the official Proton from Valve. It's good when you need it though but generally best to stick to what's official for less unexpected issues.</p>
<p>For GE-Proton 8-29:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>hotfix: updated proton bleeding edge to include tekken 8 online match disconnect fix</li>
<li>updated vkd3d-proton</li>
<li>fix issue with drive_c symlink during prefix creation when using ulwgl (it's now possible to run scripted game installations using ulwgl and proton-ge)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And then GE-Proton 8-30:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>fixed EAC not getting loaded. During my ULWGL changes I accidentally made it so steam games werent running using steam.exe inside the prefix... which of course broke EAC games. The code snippet involved is needed so that non-steam games don't try to run using steam.exe and thus dont create the Steam_API error. woops. fixed now.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Changelogs from the <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases" target="_blank">GE-Proton GitHub page</a>.</p>

      <title>Age of Empires IV gets a fix for Steam Deck / Linux online play desyncs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Age of Empires IV just got a fresh 2024 patch and excitingly, it gets an official fix for Steam Deck / Desktop Linux multiplayer problems.</p>
<p>This has been a long-standing issue. Single-player was fine, but when trying online play the game would desync at some point. So unless you went through some manual <a href="https://gist.github.com/reneklacan/7825b82723bf0534cbd2eae014e121ca#file-aoe4-mp-fix-sh" target="_blank">fixing</a> (which didn't work for everyone), it just wasn't playable online for Steam Deck / Desktop Linux players with Proton.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.ageofempires.com/news/age-of-empires-iv-patch-9-2-628/" target="_blank">patch notes</a> for the update released January 30th it notes clearly "Fixed an issue causing desyncs on Steam Decks when playing online." amongst fixes and improvements across various other areas of the game. Nice to see more Xbox Game Studios published titles getting improvements for us. What a time to be alive.</p>

      <title>Qualys discovers glibc flaw that could enable attackers to gain full root access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, here's another reminder to keep your PC up to date. Despite Linux being known for security, it's not perfect (no software is) and researchers at Qualys have discovered multiple vulnerabilities in the GNU C Library.</p>
<p>They said the issues were confirmed on Debian (versions 12 and 13), Ubuntu (23.04 and 23.10), and Fedora (37 to 39) but that other distributions are also likely affected by it.</p>
<p>What they said sounds a little alarming noting "four significant vulnerabilities" with the first being noted as CVE-2023-6246, which is the most severe as it allows "local privilege escalation, enabling an unprivileged user to gain full root access". Two more issues were discovered during this noted as:</p>
<ul>
<li>CVE-2023-6779 (glibc): This vulnerability involves an off-by-one heap-based buffer overflow in the __vsyslog_internal() function.</li>
<li>CVE-2023-6780 (glibc): This is an integer overflow issue in the __vsyslog_internal() function.</li>
</ul>
<p>But they said actually triggering those "appears more challenging than CVE-2023-6246" and so "exploiting them effectively is likely to be more complex". Another memory corruption issue was also discovered, but they didn't note a CVE number for it.</p>
<p>More about the most severe of the group CVE-2023-6246:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This vulnerability identified is a heap-based buffer overflow within the __vsyslog_internal() function of the GNU C Library, also known as glibc. This critical function underpins the widely-used syslog() and vsyslog() functions. The buffer overflow issue, traced back to the introduction of glibc version 2.37, poses a significant threat as it could allow local privilege escalation, enabling an unprivileged user to gain full root access through crafted inputs to applications that employ these logging functions. Although the vulnerability requires specific conditions to be exploited (such as an unusually long argv[0] or openlog() ident argument), its impact is significant due to the widespread use of the affected library. Interestingly, a similar issue was reported in December 1997 in an older Linux libc version.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See <a href="https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-threat-research/2024/01/30/qualys-tru-discovers-important-vulnerabilities-in-gnu-c-librarys-syslog" target="_blank">their full article</a> on it for more info. Nice to see a responsible disclosure with the researchers sending all the details to the relevant people.</p>

      <title>What to Expect From Wine on Wayland in 2024</title>
      <author>pleasereadthemanual</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Collabora, the company responsible for developing Wine's Wayland driver and getting it into Wine proper, has just published <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/wine-on-wayland-a-year-in-review-and-a-look-ahead.html" target="_blank">Wine on Wayland: A year in review (and a look ahead)</a>.</p>
<p>So far, they've landed support in Wine for Wayland in these areas:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Basic window management (fullscreen, maximization, resize, etc)</li>
<li>Software rendering (i.e., GDI)</li>
<li>Mouse support, including mouselook</li>
<li>Keyboard support, including keymap handling</li>
<li>Vulkan, including Direct3D through WineD3D/Vulkan or DXVK</li>
<li>Basic support for HiDPI</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2024, Collabora wants to focus on upstreaming support in these areas:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Emulation of display mode changes through compositor scaling</li>
<li>OpenGL support</li>
<li>Improved positioning of transient windows (popups, menus, etc)</li>
<li>Even more window management (e.g., minimization)</li>
<li>Clipboard and drag-and-drop</li>
<li>General robustness improvements, bug fixes, code improvements</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And once those are out of the way, these features would be "great to have eventually":</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Support for system DPI auto-detection and, ideally, per-monitor DPI handling in Wine core</li>
<li>Integration with the upcoming Wayland color-management (and hdr) protocol</li>
<li>Cross-process rendering</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's possible to <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/wine#Wayland" target="_blank">enable the still-experimental driver if your Wine build supports it by editing the Wine registry.</a></p>
<p>Either way, the Wayland driver is a big deal. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/xorg-is-dead-long-live-wayland-red-hat-enterprise-linux-rhel-dropping-xorg/" target="_blank">With RHEL going so far as to deprecate X11</a>, we've seen a lot of developments across the Linux space in supporting Wayland recently.</p>
<p>Have you tried the Wayland driver already? What features does it need before you would consider using it in place of the XWayland version? OpenGL support seems like a big one. Or are you sticking with X11 for the foreseeable future?</p>

      <title>Stardew Valley 1.6 bigger than expected - now in bug-fixing and polishing stage</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The next major update to the wonderfully calm Stardew Valley looks like it's coming soon, as the developer noted it's now moved into the "bug-fixing and polishing phase".</p>
<p>Writing on X (formerly Twitter), Eric "Concerned Ape" Barone <a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1750962107682857258" target="_blank">mentioned</a>: "1.6 ended up being a little larger in scope than originally planned. I'm done adding major new content to it now, though, and it's in a bug-fixing and polishing phase until it's ready for release. Thx for your patience. It'll be fun to see everyone play it!" and in a follow-up reply <a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1750963860444749939" target="_blank">noted</a> it's likely to come to PC first.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20630893911706629992gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20630893911706629992gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Should you make a new save for it? Barone also <a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1750967542607487486" target="_blank">mentioned</a>: "it'll be fine to play on an old save, but I'd probably recommend a new save just to experience everything in context, otherwise you'll unlock a bunch of stuff right away when you load up your old save".</p>
<p>Stardew Valley has Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Are you going to be jumping in again when version 1.6 releases? Incredible it has gone on for so long, and still one of the most popular games on Steam with a peak player count in the last day of 41,904. That's nuts. More than the likes of Red Dead Redemption 2, Terraria and many other well-known games.</p>

      <title>Build a powerful character in Into the Necrovale a new Action RPG</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Into the Necrovale is a new Action RPG from Casey Clyde and Tribal Storm that's just hit Early Access, and so far it seems like a really fun time for players that love building up a unique character. <em>Note: key from KeyMailer.</em></p>
<p>Being the work of a solo developer it's pretty impressive! With 5 different zones to battle through, plus an end-game area that gives you runs of increasing difficulty, I could easily see myself spending a lot of hours running through it.</p>
<p>Here you're exploring the dark dungeons, taking down all sorts of enemies and building up a character. It's all about the items — over 300 of them. Instead of building a character through levels and unlocked abilities, you swap around all your items to make a different build. Giving you the option to experiment easily and change your entire build whenever you want.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="PbkJ_F5ovm0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1bf0da79e1257feb744cfee00483b1db.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/PbkJ_F5ovm0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's all about repeating runs, and unlocking more of the game as you go. As you enter the first section you having nothing but your hands, but eventually you'll have a ton of different items. The game keeps expanding too, as you unlock various different vendors at the safe area.</p>
<p>The combat is pretty challenging too, and fast, it really will keep you on your toes in the small rooms as enemy waves spawn and surround you. Certainly got the blood pumping! The Hope mechanic is an interesting one too. You use Hope to unlock things, but if you lose too much Hope your character will suffer so it's a constant balancing act there.</p>
<p>Into the Necrovale has Native Linux support and seems to work great on my Kubuntu 23.10 desktop. The Steam Overlay didn't work unless I ran it with <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope" target="_blank">Gamescope</a> though which was a little odd. If you like dungeon crawling RPGs, this is one to check out!</p>

      <title>Dwarf Fortress Adventure Mode to be more approachable for new players</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Adventure Mode for Dwarf Fortress is approaching and the team has outlined some of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/3973931474165976101" target="_blank">their plans</a> for it, like making it much more approachable for newer players and giving it a fresh coat of paint.</p>
<p>In the post they mention how difficult it is to do such a mode in a game like this, because it's a sandbox game at its core so it has no direction, it's random and cracks will show. So they're continuing to update it to improve the visuals and interface to make it clearer and better for newcomers - just like they're doing with the Fortress Mode.</p>
<p>They're adding in combat animations, various combat icons, new menus, improvements to how towns are handled for places like shops, cleaning up how property is recognised, tightening up the city side of the experience to give new players some grounding, old adventure menus will also be fully converted for mouse + keyboard and more.</p>

<em>Pictured - Dwarf Fortress, Fortress Mode</em></p>
<p>One area that will also change is the difficulty modes. In the original there's three modes Demigod, Hero and Peasant. The confusing thing is the harder the naming sounds, the easier it is, as it's supposed to represent your power. They're going to tweak them so that the "Demigod" mode gives players more instructions and ongoing help - more like a tutorial mode. Plus they will also "tweak the Hero level encounters with gods to something that strikes a balance again, leaning toward a more epic feeling", "expand dungeons and temple relic hunting to facilitate more direction for Demigod characters" and "provide more healing options". The Peasant mode will remain as a sandbox, with Hero mode having a mixture and be an in-between difficulty.</p>
<p>Adventure Mode is currently planned to release in April, with a Fortress Mode update due out soon. When the Adventure Mode update released the Fortress Mode will also get some additional benefits like the addition of portraits, a whole new soundtrack and site map visuals on embarking.</p>

      <title>Game Boy homebrew scene alive and well thanks to the open source GB Studio</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GB Studio is a free and open source cross-platform game engine, that allows you to make fully-features games for the classic Nintendo Game Boy. One of the first gaming devices I ever owned, some really fond memories there of staying up late at night with the completely ridiculous magnifier attachment that had lights on it. How far we've come huh?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah — I know. <em>This isn't Linux gaming. </em>But it's open source and it's awesome! And you can run GB Studio on Linux and there's a new version that was just released too!</p>

      <title>Spec Ops: The Line gets delisted on Steam - you can still buy it elsewhere for now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Spec Ops: The Line from YAGER / 2K has been unexpectedly removed from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/50300/Spec_Ops_The_Line/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, as the store page is now delisted so it won't show up in searches and it can no longer be purchased.</p>
<p>It's not clear <em>why</em> it has been done, and no announcement has been made on it anywhere that I can see officially. So we're left to speculate for now. When this usually happens it's often some rights that expired that they don't wish to relicense or update the game to remove it like music, which Spec Ops: The Line had a fair few big names in so that's quite likely. <strong>Update 31/01/24</strong>: as I suspected, it's some licenses not getting renewed as per the statement sent to <a href="https://kotaku.com/spec-ops-the-line-steam-delisted-removed-2k-licenses-1851209947" target="_blank">Kotaku</a> notes - "Spec Ops: The Line will no longer be available on online storefronts, as several partnership licenses related to the game are expiring".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14554433781706610094gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>While the gameplay wasn't exactly all that special, but what many praised it for was the narrative as the developer tried to make it more meaningful than a lot of other shooters. For many it left a lasting impression so it's a shame if it will eventually be removed from other stores too.</p>
<p>For now at least you can still buy it from:</p>
<p><s><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/spec_ops_the_line" target="_blank">GOG</a> (80% off until February 6th)</s> - now delisted as of 31/01/24, 16:30 UTC</p>
<p><s><a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/spec-ops-the-line?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> (keys will likely run out)</s> - Humble have now removed their offer as of 01/02/24.</p>

      <title>Proton Hotfix gets updated for TEKKEN 8 online play on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>TEKKEN 8 is the latest fighting game from Bandai Namco Studios and it worked pretty great on Steam Deck / Linux at release except for online multiplayer - but that should now be solved.</p>
<p>The problem is that online matches would disconnect — every time. Valve looked into it and now a fresh update is available for Proton Hotfix that Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1752165582332739871" target="_blank">mentioned</a> on X (formerly Twitter):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="A Proton Hotfix is now live for the Tekken 8 online disconnect issues and is selected by default for the game." src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17489180311706609358gol1.png"/></p>
<p><em>Image text: "A Proton Hotfix is now live for the Tekken 8 online disconnect issues and is selected by default for the game."</em></p>
<p>Since it's now set by default, you shouldn't need to do anything but run the game. If you previously forced a compatibility option on it, you should uncheck the box and let Valve switch it over for you. If you don't see it happening automatically you can select Proton Hotfix yourself in the compatibility options.</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer Part 38: The Stagnant Demesne</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-37-dashing-through-the-snow/" target="_blank">Part 37: Dashing Through the Snow</a></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>When I first got the original Linux port of <em>Doom</em> working it was done to satisfy my curiosity, as at that point, I had no intention of playing through the whole game yet again. This being <em>Doom</em> though I soon found myself drawn in, and before long I was back facing the Icon of Sin at the end of <em>Doom II</em>. There were some oddities I encountered. I was unable to complete "E4M6: Against Thee Wickedly" without the no clipping cheat, as the bars blocking the exit failed to rise even after defeating the Cyberdemon.</p>
<p><em>The Ultimate Doom</em> was only supported on Linux through the use of a fan patch, but <em>Doom II</em> proved buggier. While perched on a ledge towards the end of "MAP14: The Inmost Dens" I saved, causing me to clip into the floor on reload. Then there was that one area in "MAP24: The Chasm" that segfaulted every time I entered it. Finally the boss battle on "MAP30: Icon of Sin" broke when I loaded my save file, with no new enemies spawning in allowing me to snipe the demon's brain at my leisure.</p>
<p>Most documentation on this bug suggests the game should instead crash, but I was able to continue playing and win the game. Doubtless none of these problems would have happened had I been using LxDoom, which also has proper binary compatibility with <em>Final Doom</em>, but it was more interesting this way. This also made me inclined to try playing all of <em>Heretic</em> and <em>HeXen</em>, a feat I had never managed up to that point. Would I encounter any more issues with these early source ports?</p>
<p>Andre Werthmann's Linux Heretic proved solid with just a couple of exceptions. Every time I reached one of the boss levels the soundscape descended into a cacophony that could not be tamed even by fiddling with the volume slider in the sound settings. The only solution I found was going outside of the game to lower the system volume from Aumix, and then raising the volume slider inside <em>Heretic</em> to compensate as best I could. This did not break the game, but it did make things unpleasant.</p>
<p>The other snag I encountered was with moving platforms that loop the "stnmov" sound effect, as they could also cause all of the other sound effects in the vicinity to break. This only came up a few times during the course of the campaign, but it created a great deal of chaos with the crushers in the starting room of "E4M3: Ambulatory". I notice that the Linux <em>Doom</em> source code has a function that forces the "stnmov" sound among others to play one at a time, but Linux Heretic lacks this.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4763627131706556764gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4763627131706556764gol6.png"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6185772191706556766gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6185772191706556766gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>Beyond that I just have a few gripes with a couple of the changes that Werthmann made, the most irksome being the decision to remap the keys used to scroll through the inventory to "K" and "L" as opposed to the square brackets that are still listed on the help screen. Thankfully this can be reversed by uncommenting the "-DORIG_INVKEYS" flag in the Makefile while building your own Linux Heretic binaries. I also disabled the text blurb on launch by removing it from the d_main.c file.</p>
<p>My abiding observation of <em>Heretic</em> is that it is the rare shareware game where the second and third episodes are in fact greater than the first. It was from here that I was having enough fun to bother looking for all of the marked secrets, which was the right move; getting familiar with how Raven Software likes to hide secret areas and how to read the automap becomes a necessary skill for solving the puzzle hubs in <em>HeXen</em>, but the automap colour scheme does leave something to be desired.</p>
<p>This goodwill sadly does not carry through to the final two retail expansion episodes, which descend into tedium far too quickly. "E4M1: Catafalque" gives "E4M1: Hell Beneath" from Thy Flesh Consumed a run for its money in terms of punishing the player, giving as unwelcoming an introduction as you could ever hope to find. Beyond that the expansion just becomes a slog, having nothing new other than the sheer vastness of the hordes of monsters on offer to bring to the table.</p>
<p>The drawn out Maulotaur fights can at least be subverted by using the Tome of Power and the Gauntlets of the Necromancer to leech off the Maulotaur's health, cushioning his blows to the point you just have to hold down the fire key and wait. You will also develop a special hatred of the Ophidians by the end of the campaign, a role the Slaughtaurs in <em>HeXen</em> are more than happy to fill come the sequel; the Disciples of D'Sparil though are far more aggravating than the Bishops in <em>HeXen</em> could ever aspire.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was just due to my lack of prior exposure, but the <em>Heretic</em> soundtrack also seemed to carry over to "VoxWare Synth" even better than the <em>Doom</em> music did, although this may just be due to the work of composer Kevin Schilder being more blaring and bombastic than what Bobby Prince came up with. Kevin Schilder would return to craft the MIDI soundtrack for <em>HeXen</em>, and thanks to an unassuming tarball on an archived website, I will get to actually experience that under Linux.</p>
<p><strong>Carrying on in Part 39: Beyond Heretic</strong></p>

      <title>Eidos-Montréal cut nearly 100 staff with new Deus Ex reportedly cancelled</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hopes for a new Deus Ex have been dashed, with the Embracer Group owned Eidos-Montréal confirming that they've cut 97 people go as the mass-layoffs continue. This is just another in a long list of developers and publishers cutting staff and cancelling projects, all while the Embracer Group try to reduce their costs. It's also another in a long list of just industry-wide layoffs lately.</p>
<p>Confirming the staff news <a href="https://twitter.com/EidosMontreal/status/1752027685293801632" target="_blank">on X</a> in an image post below:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For the last 17 years, our teams at Eidos have worked on some of the most beloved brands in the industry, combining deep storytelling and innovation into unique games. We have created memorable multi awarded experiences that we are proud of and we know our teams members have put their heart and soul in all of them.</p>
<p>The global economic context, the challenges of our industry and the comprehensive restructuring announced by Embracer have finally impacted our studio. The difficult decision has been made to let go 97 people from development teams, administration, and support services.</p>
<p>We are working to support all impacted personnel through this transition. These very talented, highly experienced people are entering the employment market, and we want them to find their next projects and are helping to do so.</p>
<p>As we navigate these difficult times, the well-being of our team is our priority and the continuous commitment to creating games that players will be able to enjoy in the nearby future.</p>
<p>To our players... it's often times not just the games but the game makers as well that we all celebrate and admire. Our commitment is always to making the best games for our amazing fans and even with this restructuring change, we continue to fight on to deliver those awesome experiences for us to share together. Thank you for your continuing support and well wishes.</p>

      <title>First world war turn-based strategy RPG &#39;All Quiet in the Trenches&#39; hits Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's something a little different for you: All Quiet in the Trenches recently hit Early Access on Steam, blending together a narrative turn-based strategy RPG with a first world war setting. It has Native Linux support but no Steam Deck rating just yet.</p>
<p>More about it: "In the game, you're playing as a German Unteroffizier - a sergeant - on the Western Front of World War One. You're responsible for a handful of soldiers and have to make meaningful decisions. You lead them in battle trying to strike a precarious balance between the ambitions of your superiors and the survival of your men. Your actions will not change the war.

      <title>Never Grave from the Palworld developer looks a lot like Hollow Knight</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pocketpair formed another studio called Frontside 180 that are working on Never Grave: The Witch and The Curse, which looks a whole lot like Hollow Knight. This might ease the wait for Silksong huh?</p>
<p>While it may look a lot like Hollow Knight for the style it's actually quite a different game overall. Plenty of elements of it feel like Dead Cells, but there's a hint of Skul: The Hero Slayer with a possession mechanic too and there's even a whole village-building element to it. There's also going to be online co-op support for up to 4 players. Overall it does actually look quite good:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rE6bcrTWOVo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c26f23b9b997193a9fc19ea53e53f26e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rE6bcrTWOVo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Metroidvania x Roguelite with an emphasis on exploration.</li>
<li>Sophisticated and tactilely designed player character controls.</li>
<li>Possession system where hats can possess enemies and use their unique abilities.</li>
<li>Traditional Japanese hand-drawn limited animation is used for character 2D animation.</li>
<li>Thickly painted backgrounds with depth, as if you are travelling through a world of picture books and cut-out pictures.</li>
<li>Learn actions such as double-jump from artefacts to explore new areas.</li>
<li>Constantly changing play style depending on the synergy of "traits" associated with magic and items.</li>
<li>Intense battles with tough bosses. It will take more than just memorizing boss patterns to defeat them without taking damage...</li>
<li>Rebuild your village. Strengthen yourself through building and production to prepare for the next adventure.</li>
<li>Explore different terrain each time you play through procedurally generated dungeons.</li>
<li>Multiplayer support. Up to four players can delve into the dungeon together!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Due to enter Early Access sometime in Q1 2024. This will make Pocketpair's 4th game to be in Early Access following Craftopia, AI: Art Impostor and Palworld that are all currently in development.</p>
<p>There's a demo available now which in my testing seemed to work quite well on Desktop Linux with Proton 8.0-5.</p>

      <title>KONAMI update the METAL GEAR SOLID Steam collection with Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As KONAMI continue to improve the recent releases of METAL GEAR SOLID - Master Collection Version, METAL GEAR SOLID 2: Sons of Liberty - Master Collection Version and METAL GEAR SOLID 3: Snake Eater - Master Collection Version they've now added Steam Deck support.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6001752471706529403gol1.jpg"/><br/>
Pictured - METAL GEAR SOLID 2: Sons of Liberty - Master Collection Version, Credit: Konami</em></p>
<p>Currently, only 2 and 3 have been updated to note it, but the 1st may not be far behind.</p>
<p>METAL GEAR SOLID 2: Sons of Liberty - Master Collection Version and METAL GEAR SOLID 3: Snake Eater - Master Collection Version have updates that note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ver.1.4.1/Ver.1.4.1D releases Jan. 29th, 2024.<br/>
The version for users playing on Steam Deck™ will be noted as Ver.1.4.1D in the game.</p>
<p>Ver.1.4.1/Ver.1.4.1D Patch Notes<br/>
Please check the list of changes below for details on the main improvements and fixes in this patch.<br/>
Fixes of previously known issues are marked with an asterisk.</p>
<p>- Added Steam Deck™ support</p>
<p>-  Fixed an issue where inputs via the keyboard were registered for the game even when the Alt key was held down*</p>
<p>- Fixed some other minor issues</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not clear <em>exactly</em> what they've done for Steam Deck support, as annoyingly they don't say. Although we can see on SteamDB (<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2131650/depots/" target="_blank">example</a>) that they now have dedicated content depots for the Steam Deck so they've likely tweaked some in-game resources to work better. Valve has also put them back through verification and they're now showing up as Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>The original SteamOS-like Linux distro HoloISO now dead, replaced with immutable version</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a while of no updates to the actual ISO download of HoloISO, the creator of this SteamOS-like Linux distribution has announced the original is now dead. As it's being replaced by the newer immutable HoloISO.</p>
<p>The developer put up a <a href="https://github.com/HoloISO/holoiso/releases/tag/6-psa" target="_blank">PSA</a> (public service announcement) on the original HoloISO GitHub page, and archived it so it will no longer see any updates at all and you cannot get support for it. They said the new immutable HoloISO is now "ready to be used as a daily-driving distribution".</p>
<p>What is an immutable operating system? Think like SteamOS and Fedora Silverblue. The idea is to give a read-only filesystem that gets replaced on updates. It's supposed to keep things more secure and stable, plus easier updates since it just replaces the main system.</p>
<p>HoloISO itself is designed to give you a close-enough version of SteamOS to use on other systems, and so the new immutable HoloISO should <em>hopefully</em> be more reliable. <em>It's what AYANEO were going to put on the AYANEO NEXT LITE but <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/ayaneo-next-lite-no-longer-ships-with-steamos-like-holoiso-linux-windows-11-instead/" target="_blank">they've since backtracked</a>.</em></p>
<p>There's no current way to upgrade an existing HoloISO system to the new way it's run, but the developer mentioned they're currently figuring out the best approach to it. <strong>Update</strong>: 30/01/24 - version 1.1 now release supports migrating.</p>
<p>New releases will be on <a href="https://github.com/holoiso-staging/releases" target="_blank">this GitHub</a> with issues reporting on a <a href="https://github.com/holoiso-staging/issuetracker" target="_blank">separate GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>SteamOS-like ChimeraOS 45 released with HDR &amp; controller support for many more handhelds</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ChimeraOS is a top choice for people who want a SteamOS-like Linux distribution to run on gaming handhelds, or a couch gaming PC. The latest release is out now with ChimeraOS 45 bringing big changes.</p>
<p>The developer mentioned it took extra long since the Steam Deck OLED had released and that "many changes in gamescope and Steam that caused unexpected behavior in a lot of devices". So they needed time to go through all the issues.</p>
<p>This release comes with Linux kernel 6.6.10, Mesa 23.3.3 and has Open Gamepad UI v0.28.0-3. Some of the other big inclusions in this release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Implemented HDR for supported games.</li>
<li>Kernel carries patches made by our awesome community, thanks everyone!</li>
<li>Redesigned the gamescope-session package to simplify implementing quirks and bug fixes across all sessions. All sessions now use a common session script and device-quirks file. The session names have changed as well, so when downgrading from v45 to v44-1 and below, a chimera-session command is required. Upgrading should have no issues. <code class="inline-code">gamepadui</code> is now <code class="inline-code">steam</code>, <code class="inline-code">gamepadui-with-qam</code> is now <code class="inline-code">steam-plus</code>. The log for each session is now <code class="inline-code">~/.<session-name>-stdout.log</session-name></code>.</li>
<li>Included distrobox for awesome new possibilities.</li>
<li>Removed Feral <code class="inline-code">gamemode</code> daemon.</li>
<li>Added cpupower CLI tool for managing cpu power profiles.</li>
<li>Added controller support for AYANEO Kun, AYANEO Slide, Lenovo Legion Go, OXP OneXFly, OXP 2, OXP2 Pro, AYN Loki MiniPro, and GPD Win Mini.</li>
<li>Added optional event configuration for HandyGCCS that supports putting the controller into "Nintendo" mode. Users will need to manually edit their handygccs.conf to enable this.</li>
<li>Added EDID override for the AIR plus that enables more refresh rates. Enable firmware overrides to use this.</li>
<li>Added equalizer settings for Lenovo Legion Go and ROG Ally that drastically improves the sound stage. For both devices, a new "device" will be present in the audio menu. Ensure the default audio device is at maximum volume before switching for the best performance.</li>
<li>Enabled the hid-steam driver. Steam Deck and Steam Controller users can now use their controllers on the desktop in "Lizard Mode", emulating a keyboard and mouse automatically.</li>
<li>Enabled Vulkan support for some older intel iGPU's. YMMV.</li>
<li>Added PowerStation Daemon to manage power settings and switched OpenGamepadUI to using it as a backend. Changing settings and loading power profiles in OpenGamepadUI should now be much faster and more reliable.</li>
<li>Improved support in OpenGamepadUI for PlayStation controllers. This change may cause duplicate input devices in some situations. If this occurs, manually update to v0.29.2 or above using the settings menu in OpenGamepadUI.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

Steam Big Picture Mode</em></p>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added support for ROG Ally BIOS 330+. The ROG Ally no longer needs firmware overrides for audio to work on any BIOS version.</li>
<li>Removed xpadneo and xone drivers and replaced them with xpad and created xonedo (xone dongle only) for managing xinput devices. This should resolve many of the input related bugs users were experiencing.</li>
<li>Fixed night mode.</li>
<li>Fixed game artwork overrides not being applied in some cases.</li>
<li>Fixed error in the Chimera web app when Epic Games credentials expire.</li>
<li>Fixed multiple crash conditions in HandyGCCS.</li>
<li>Various fixes for devices that don't detect as "card0" have been made.</li>
<li>Fixed some scripting errors in controller-wake. This is still disabled by default. If you have this enabled and are experiencing issues with sleep, try disabling it.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with some network cards.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Relaxing settlement builder with simulated citizens Folklands now has a demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love your city / village building sims? You should take a little look at Folklands, a relaxing settlement builder with simulated citizens that you need to take care of.</p>
<p>The developer, Bromantic Games, recently put up a new demo to get ready for Steam Next Fest. Their previous demo had a lot of placeholders with this new demo having a graphical update, plus tons of other improvements and content additions. Part of what has my interest is that you'll not only be able to play solo, but you'll also be able to play online with or against others. Nice to see more village builders have that in.</p>
<p>A recent trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DlpVomPJStc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4a55645af4f9467098d7fae54ac9b734.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DlpVomPJStc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Collect &amp; Refine Resources - Settle down in uncharted lands, and harvest its resources. Refine raw materials into processed goods to build and expand your settlement. Create production chains that enhance or combine materials to create even more advanced products as the needs of your settlement grows.</li>
<li>Trading &amp; Dimplomacy -  Establish trade routes with the nearby kingdoms to stock up on resources you don't have, or become a trade hub supplying goods and resources. Trade with one of the 3 kingdoms in singleplayer or with other players in multiplayer.</li>
<li>Overcome Adversity - Face different challenges as your settlement grows. Manage the production and distribution of necessary resources to combat and prevent the dangers of fire, sickness and crime.</li>
<li>Never the same twice - A procedurally generated world tuned to your liking, guarantees that you will never play the same game twice. Adapt to the surrounding terrain and the availability or scarcity of resources to ensure a growing and happy settlement!</li>
<li>Build a peaceful thriving settlement or enable the optional disasters or conflict mode for additional challenges.</li>
<li>Planned Steam workshop support will let you create or install new content or modify the game rules to your liking.</li>
<li>Please your citizens to attract different types of people and trade with the neighboring kingdoms.</li>
<li>Play with or against your friends or enjoy a relaxing settlement building experience alone.</li>

      <title>Former dev on Stardew Valley reveals their life-sim Sunkissed City</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From developer Mr. Podunkian, who previously worked on Stardew Valley, a new life-sim is coming named Sunkissed City and it looks rather colourful and inviting. It's been teased for a while and only recently actually getting an official name, along with a Q4 2024 release date.</p>
<p>The inspiration from working on Stardew Valley is clear but hopefully it will be different enough to find an audience. The developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2175840/discussions/0/4138312860563712326/#c4138312860565004796" target="_blank">mentioned</a> on Steam they worked on SV from the 1.4 update onwards. There's no trailer yet for Sunkissed City but a few screenshots make it look rather nice.</p>
<p>"Welcome to your new life in Apollo City, a sun-kissed seaside metropolis that's pumping with funky vibes and quirky characters.</p>
<p>As a fresh hire for the monolithic Pico corporation's new "Peco Pioneer" pilot program, you've been tasked with fostering a relationship with Apollo's vibrant community and putting in a good word for Pico's new eco-focused initiatives.</p>
<p>But all is not well in these bustling streets. The local wildlife has begun to behave more aggressively, the waters are devoid of life, monsters are pouring out from the sewers, and that's not to mention the constant migraines everyone's been having lately." — Steam Blurb</p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10428277401706281996gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10428277401706281996gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Enjoy a fresh start in Apollo City! - The city is a big place packed with a myriad of opportunities to occupy the days and nights of your new city life! Tend to DIY gardens set up by a local band of "plant-punks", spend a quiet afternoon in the park soaking up a good book, or schmooze it up with the locals over coffee at the Weird Dog Cafe. Snap photos of the wildlife around the city and its surrounds. Try your hand at fishing up "the big one" at Marin Shores. Forage for delicious edibles on a hike at Pinnacle Peak. Or perhaps a daring dive into the city's monster infested sewers is more your speed? You could always take up a gig sorting out shipments at the Pico warehouse for some extra cash.</li>
<li>Reinvent yourself! - With endless, deep customization options, you can be whoever you want to be. Pop into Threads to scope out the next piece of your new favorite fit, or get a complete makeover at Salon Flamingo. Make your clothing items your own with hundreds of different colors, patterns and material combinations. Give your living spaces your personal touch with a variety of fun, functional furniture pieces, or liven up your walls and floors with dozens of wallpaper and flooring types.</li>
<li>Socialize with the cityfolk! - Apollo City is home to a host of kooky characters to get to know (and love!). Build up your relationships with the locals and they'll open up to you with their daily successes and hardships. Brighten their day by gifting them hand-crafted presents (or maybe even some things you found in the trash...), and help them navigate their sometimes-messy lives in Apollo. You never know when they'll repay the favor. And if you're on the market to find that special someone, perhaps you'll find others in the city looking for the same!</li>
<li>Take back Apollo! - Work with the Keby, mysterious, prank-loving forest creatures, to tackle the various maladies afflicting the city and take back Apollo from the forces draining it of its color!</li>
<li>Explore the city with friends! - Sunkissed City features both online and split-screen multiplayer cooperative modes for you to enjoy your new city life alongside friends and family. Customize your experience with per-player difficulty and accessibility options to tailor the experience to groups of any gaming ability!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Flathub now has over one million active users</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ah, Linux, you gotta love it right? There's numerous different ways to do the same thing. One of those that people like to argue about is packaging and how to install things on Linux. <a href="https://flathub.org" target="_blank">Flathub</a> with Flatpaks at least seem to be popular and it keeps growing. </p>
<p>Cassidy James Blaede just wrote up an official <a href="https://docs.flathub.org/blog/over-one-million-active-users-and-growing/" target="_blank">blog post</a> going over some numbers, and it's quite impressive to see. To date it shows that Flathub has served just about 1.6 billion downloads, has over 2,400 apps (850 of which are Verified by the author) and there's now over 1 million active users too. Their <a href="https://flathub.org/statistics" target="_blank">public dashboard</a> has some pretty fun stats.</p>
<p>One of the big reasons for the growth no doubt is the Steam Deck, which has a full KDE Plasma desktop mode in SteamOS, and has Flathub for all the extra apps and games you can install. A point that was touched on in the blog post noting that some of the most popular downloads on Flathub are emulators and game launchers.</p>
<p>It's not just Steam Deck though with Flathub being included out of the box across the likes of Clear Linux, Endless OS, KDE Neon, Linux Mint, Pop!_OS, and Zorin OS and Fedora 38.</p>
<p>I think Flathub is great personally, it's often made it far easier to tell people where to grab something that's actually up to date. Telling people "it's on Flathub, install via GNOME Software or KDE Discover" makes Linux a lot easier.</p>

      <title>THE FINALS freezing on Linux? Here&#39;s ways you can fix it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>THE FINALS has been working on Linux and Steam Deck for a couple of weeks now, and personally I've been having a fantastic time with it. It can crash a fair bit though but luckily here's some possible solutions I've tested working.</p>
<p>No matter the Proton version used, it seems on some Linux systems it will just completely freeze up. There's no specific point it will do it. Sometimes in the menu, sometimes in the middle of a game (annoying when you're doing well).</p>
<p><strong>Issue 1</strong></p>
<p>One way to stop it crashing is to increase your vm.max_map_count setting. For some distributions, it can be quite low by default. For example on Kubuntu 23.10 (upgraded from 23.04) mine was set by default to only <em>65530</em>. You can check your current setting with this terminal command:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">cat /proc/sys/vm/max_map_count</code></p>
<p>It's easy to test a new setting <em>without</em> doing a permanent system change simply by running this command in a terminal:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=2147483642</code></p>
<p><em>That number is just a very high suggestion <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/7317#issuecomment-1896238857" target="_blank">mentioned</a> on GitHub. It's what the Steam Deck has it set at. People playing Star Citizen, as an example, have been setting it to 16777216.</em></p>
<p>After that, you should hopefully no longer see it crashing. You'll need to do that on each reboot.</p>
<p>For a permanent change you can edit the "/etc/sysctl.conf" file, add "vm.max_map_count=2147483642" to the bottom and then run:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">sudo sysctl -p</code></p>
<p>Which should keep the change.</p>
<p><strong>Issue 2</strong></p>
<p>Another problem is that if your CPU supports AVX-512, it may crash for you too. A workaround there is to add "clearcpuid=304" to your kernel boot arguments. This will stop AVX-512 being used.</p>
<p>For systems that use Grub boot loader (Ubuntu / Arch and others): you'll need to edit Grub (usually found as "/etc/default/grub") with your favourite text editor for this. Find the "GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT" line and add clearcpuid=304 into it. Then to ensure it's updated:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg</code></p>
<p><em>Fedora seems to use "grub2-mkconfig".</em></p>
<p>And reboot, and it should then work.</p>
<p><strong>Proton Version</strong></p>
<p>You may also find Proton Hotfix works better, as <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/7317#issuecomment-1897318332" target="_blank">mentioned</a> on GitHub recently it has a fix for voice-chat crashing. To do so go into the Properties -&gt; Compatibility menu for the game in your Steam Library. <em>This is the only change that should needed on Steam Deck.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p>Hopefully that gives you somewhere to start seeing less freezing and crashing issues in THE FINALS on Linux.</p>
<p>I've also been <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">livestreaming it on Twitch</a> with the Movemaster, so give me a follow.</p>

And that Sony PlayStation titles now release on PC often like this too. Good time to be a gamer for sure.</p>
<p>That said, for Steam Deck players, the first game was really tough on the Steam Deck, I will be very interested to see if this can get anywhere close to at least 30FPS. Desktop Linux players of course have a lot more options.</p>

      <title>Beginner-friendly factory sim shapez 2 now has a demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>shapez 2 is a huge expansion over the original 2D shape-cutting factory sim, now in full 3D with a lot more features and there's now a demo available to try it out.</p>
<p>A top-down factory-building game where you extract and process geometric shapes. Each shape is its own set of building-blocks that your factories can take apart, stack, paint and put back together in unique ways. Build and automate to produce distinct shapes and solve the production challenge of each goal. I must admit, it looks pretty great - love what they've done with the idea. Check out the recent trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0VO_52LJ268"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/95d1a2afb300507942c52c325258bf32.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0VO_52LJ268" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Unlike some other similar factory building games, there's no form of enemies. Just pure factory building and automation here. Designed to be beginner-friendly there's no time-limits and resources are unlimited so the limit is very much your imagination to design and redesign as much as you want.</p>
<p>Some of the features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi-Layer 3D Factories</strong>: Design and optimize your factories in a whole new dimension.</li>
<li><strong>Trains</strong>: Connect distant stations with a network of space trains.</li>
<li><strong>Research System</strong>: Unlock buildings, mechanics &amp; upgrades in the all-new tech tree.</li>
<li><strong>New Shape Mechanics</strong>: Discover new shapes types with unique properties and logic.</li>
<li><strong>Blueprint Library</strong>: Save, load, export and share factory design blueprints with anyone.</li>
<li><strong>All-new Visuals</strong>: Build factories and stations in a stunning immersive space environment.</li>
<li><strong>Fluids</strong>: Use different types of liquids to process shapes or boost production.</li>
<li><strong>Animated Open Buildings</strong>: See exactly what's happening inside buildings in your factory.</li>
<li><strong>Undo/Redo</strong>: Up to 50 undo/redo operations.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The Early Access release is planned for later this year.</p>

      <title>Enshrouded is the latest open-world hit on Steam - how it runs on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Enshrouded is another big Early Access open-world game to arrive on Steam, and it's already doing some big numbers. So how does it run on Steam Deck / Linux? Here's an initial starting report for you.</p>
<p>On both Steam Deck and Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 23.10) it works out of the box with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/proton-80-5-brings-more-hdr-gaming-to-linux-steam-deck-plus-lots-of-fixes/" target="_blank">Proton 8.0-5</a>, and all parts of the game I can tell so far work as expected. So the good news out of the way — yes it does run. This is great, because it's another popular game with currently close to 70,000 people playing it.</p>
<p>For Steam Deck (tested on the Steam Deck OLED), it runs and gamepad input works just fine and the character name input even brings up an on-screen keyboard. The developer also seems to have given it tweaked graphics settings, so it appears some testing was done prior to release. That's where the good news stops. The performance is just — poor. Even on the <em>lowest</em> possible settings, you're not going to get anywhere near a smooth 30FPS even at the basic start of the game with nothing going on. Add some buildings, more action and more players in co-op and it gets worse.</p>
<p>Here's my Steam Deck initial report video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7MU3H4wXndo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d78b7bc3e46b40d399682274084ee40f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7MU3H4wXndo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>For now, on Steam Deck, I simply won't recommend it at all.</em></p>
<p>As for Desktop Linux testing with an AMD Ryzen 5800X and an AMD Radeon 6800XT, testing on the "Balanced" graphics setting at 2560x1440 its performance seems to be reasonably okay. Ranging between 80FPS to 100FPS depending on what you're doing. Very much playable you would think.</p>
<p>Something still feels <em>off</em> with it though. Even though that should be enough to make it feel smooth, it doesn't feel like it's actually anywhere near that when running around. It's performance is just odd, which I've seen repeated by players on Windows too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12301958881706195062gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12301958881706195062gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11802062471706195063gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11802062471706195063gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's Early Access, so of course that means it's unfinished and will have plenty more time in the oven to fix up issues and add in new content. The developer plans for at least one year in Early Access, so hopefully plenty of performance improvements will come during that time.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203620/Enshrouded/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Roblox now helping fund Blender development</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.blender.org" target="_blank">Blender</a> continues to be a true massive success story for open source, pulling in funding from all sorts of big names and now even Roblox is helping to fund it.</p>
<p>As posted on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7156053005350428672/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> by Stefano Corazza, Head of Roblox Studio, who mentioned "So proud to announce that Roblox joined the Blender Foundation’s Development Fund as a corporate Silver member! Blender is one of the most commonly used tools by the Roblox creator community, and I personally love it. To make the use of Blender and Roblox Studio even more seamless we have released an open source plugin as well."</p>
<p>They also shared a press announcement with <a href="https://www.blendernation.com/2024/01/24/roblox-joins-blender-development-fund/" target="_blank">BlenderNation</a> where Corazza additionally said: "Blender is the most popular external tool used by Roblox’s creator community today. Every day, thousands of creators import vivid and detailed 3D content from tools like Blender into their Roblox experiences.</p>
<p>We are thrilled to be supporting the Blender Foundation’s work delivering world-class 3D tooling and are excited to see closer integration continue to drive high-quality creation on Roblox. Roblox also presents a fantastic opportunity for the Blender Community to find new opportunities for their creativity by creating and selling 3D avatar items for rich immersive 3D experiences."</p>
<p>As a Corporate Silver Member, Roblox will be paying at least €12K a year to Blender to support further development. Joining the ranks of Activision, Google, Adobe, Epic MegaGrants, AMD, AWS, Meta and plenty more also supporting Blender.</p>
<p>The open source plugin info is on the <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/reference-roblox-integration-for-blender/2546753" target="_blank">Roblox Dev forum</a>.</p>

      <title>Earl vs. the Mutants is basically Vampire Survivors with vehicles and it&#39;s hilarious</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you love quick-fire action and the randomised upgrade mechanics made popular by Vampire Survivors, you might want to try out the demo for Earl vs. the Mutants. Tested on Linux with Proton 8, it works great.</p>
<p>While a lot of games inspired by VS don't actually do a lot different — this clearly does. You get to drive and boost yourself around big open maps, mow-down hordes of mutants and gun them down with vehicle-mounted weapons. This is probably going to be quite popular.</p>
<p>"Create unique and powerful builds by combining vehicle-mounted weapons, attack and support drones, level-up based upgrades, and game-changing temporary powerups! If you can survive long enough, go head-to-head against bosses to earn their vehicles."</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>QUICK RUNS:</strong> Enjoy casual gameplay with runs averaging 10 minutes.</li>
<li><strong>DYNAMIC BUILDS:</strong> Each attempt is different, powered by an expanding list of in-run upgrades.</li>
<li><strong>PROGRESSION:</strong> Make progress across runs via unlocked vehicles and stat-based permanent upgrades.</li>
<li><strong>VEHICLE COMBAT:</strong> Move FAST and crash into mutants head on! Colliding with enemies is half the fun, not something to be avoided.</li>
<li><strong>3D ENVIRONMENTS:</strong> Navigate the 3D terrains strategically, using the elevation to jump over enemies and hide behind mountains.</li>
<li><strong>BOSS BATTLES:</strong> Survive an onslaught of mutant waves, then face off against their formidable bosses.</li>

<p>Do you stick with the Stable Steam Client or like me do you live on the wild side and basically always stick with the Steam Beta? It's good to see Valve be so dedicated to constantly improving the Steam platform as a whole, they're always tweaking something to try and make it better for players.</p>

      <title>AYANEO NEXT LITE no longer ships with SteamOS-like HoloISO Linux - Windows 11 instead</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We were so close to seeing another gaming handheld ship with Linux out of the box that isn't the Steam Deck, but it seems AYANEO with the AYANEO NEXT LITE weren't convinced enough and so they've changed their minds.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/ayaneo-next-lite-handheld-announced-with-steamos-linux/" target="_blank">Originally announced</a> as shipping with SteamOS, but then clarified later it would be HoloISO, which is a Linux distribution that's pretty close to SteamOS. AYANEO aren't <em>entirely</em> dropping it though, as they will still be offering HoloISO Linux (it's like SteamOS), but the device will now instead ship with Windows 11.</p>
<p>Writing on X (Twitter) they put out a <a href="https://twitter.com/AYANEO__/status/1750393456789430320" target="_blank">statement</a> and here's the relevent bit copied out of the image:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Following the announcement of the operating system for AYANEO NEXT LITE, players and friends have shown great interest and engaged in lively discussions. Some players provided feedback indicating the continued preference for a Windows operating system. "Real Gamers, Know Gamers," and in response to this valuable feedback, we are pleased to announce that AYANEO NEXT LITE will come pre-installed with the genuine Windows 11 64-bit Home Edition operating system. Of course, players can still choose to install HoloISO on their own. AYANEO's official website provides HoloISO system images that are officially adapted and compatible for players to download and experience. The streamlined and efficient HololSO system aims to offer players a more convenient game management, smooth and stable gaming performance, lower overall power consumption, and native compatibility with both controllers and touchscreen operations. This approach aligns with the gaming habits of handheld device users, providing players with a richer selection of operating systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Real Gamers, Know Gamers huh? That's…a peculiar thing to say here.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8879924451706179026gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8879924451706179026gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>This is a shame to see, as this could have helped to continue the Linux push for gaming. At least they will still be offering it up for download, but as we long-timers know, most people don't generally change their operating system on any device. </p>
<p>Hopefully sometime soon Valve will finally properly release SteamOS 3 for other hardware vendors, as SteamOS carries more weight to it than community-rebuilds like HoloISO. A lot of it is in the name, as players and hardware vendors would likely be more confident with SteamOS directly.</p>

      <title>The Pokémon Company confirm investigation into Palworld</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this could be about to get interesting, as The Pokémon Company have actually released a statement in regards to all the speculation about Palworld amid many claims of copying Pokémon's homework.</p>
<p>So far, there's no really solid proof that I can see of any actual direct copying (or of any AI use that people keep claiming too). There's a good few similarities to a few Pokémon, but lots of the examples people keep sharing around don't have me overly convinced. </p>
<p>Here's what The Pokémon Company said (<a href="https://corporate.pokemon.co.jp/media/news/detail/335.html" target="_blank">source</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Inquiries Regarding Other Companies’ Games</strong></p>
<p>We have received many inquiries regarding another company’s game released in January 2024. We have not granted any permission for the use of Pokémon intellectual property or assets in that game. We intend to investigate and take appropriate measures to address any acts that infringe on intellectual property rights related to the Pokémon. We will continue to cherish and nurture each and every Pokémon and its world, and work to bring the world together through Pokémon in the future.</p>
<p>The Pokémon Company</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>They didn't name Palworld directly, likely as that might put them in hot water if nothing comes of it.</em></p>
<p>Really, this reads a bit like a "please stop emailing us" statement. It was obvious they were going to look into it. Nintendo and The Pokémon Company are notoriously tough on taking action and they already started <a href="https://twitter.com/ToastedShoes/status/1749711480050827433" target="_blank">wiping traces</a> of a Pokémon mod for Palworld. Even Nexus Mods have <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/14924" target="_blank">said</a> they will not be hosting any such mods.</p>
<p>Again, they cannot take action just because it's a game that has monster catching in it. Pokémon don't own that idea, they can't. They could only take action for actual plagiarism. And as a whole, Palworld is actually objectively a very different game to anything Pokémon has put out.</p>
<p>In other news, Palworld crossed <a href="https://twitter.com/Palworld_EN/status/1750350702000607389" target="_blank">8 million</a> copies sold now.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA 550.40.07 Beta driver released with fixes for VRR and Wayland</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 24/01/24 20:07 UTC</strong>: An NVIDIA developer messaged me to clarify the changelog oddness:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For this Beta release, we pulled a diff against the current Production release 535.154.05 since that captures everything from the previous production branch R535 to this new production branch R550 including the changes from R545. Enterprise customers are often not tracking the New Feature Branches like R545 so we do it this way to avoid our partners missing release highlights. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've given them feedback that it's not ideal for normal desktop consumers to do it like that, which they're hoping to improve in future. Ideally, giving us a simple way to see just the changes since the <em>last</em> release would suffice.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>NVIDIA has today launched the <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/Download/driverResults.aspx/218153/en-uk" target="_blank">550.40.07</a> Beta driver for Linux which includes numerous important fixes, so you might want to jump in and give this one a thorough gaming test.</p>
<p>I have to be careful checking over NVIDIA driver releases, as <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/nvidia-53515405-for-linux-brings-a-few-bug-fixes/" target="_blank">they keep</a> copy-pasting changelogs from previous versions. In this case, they've again copied over lots of the changes from previous driver releases. So keep that in mind. A fair few notes of what's listed were also in the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/nvidia-driver-5452902-out-for-linux-plus-other-releases-due-to-security-issues/" target="_blank">545.29.02</a> driver released back in October 2023. NVIDIA aren't really making it clear lately exactly what's new in each driver - which is frustrating. I have again tried to reach out to NVIDIA to find out what's happening with the changelogs lately.</p>
<p>Scanning over previous releases, it looks like <em>these</em> specifically <em>may</em> be actually <em>new</em> to this driver:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that sometimes caused Wayland applications to run at less than one frame per second on Maxwell, Volta, and Pascal series GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused an intermittent drop in desktop framerate.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused "Flip event timeout" messages to be printed to the system log when displays are hotplugged when nvidia-drm is loaded with the <code class="inline-code">fbdev=1</code> kernel module parameter.</li>
<li>Fixed intermittent Xid errors on Horizon Zero Dawn, Metro Exodus, Forza Horizon 5, and Halo Infinite.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which prevented the "NoMaxPClkCheck" mode validation token from working on single-link TMDS (e.g. DVI, HDMI) outputs.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that allowed VRR displays to be driven below their minimum refresh rate, resulting in a blank or flickering image.</li>
<li>Added an application profile to improve Kwin performance on hybrid GPU systems by setting OGL_DEDICATED_HW_STATE_PER_CONTEXT=ENABLE_ROBUST.</li>
<li>Updated the build process for NVIDIA kernel modules to honor the INSTALL_MOD_DIR Kbuild environment variable.</li>
<li>Added support for R8, GR88 and YCbCr GBM formats.</li>
<li>Optimized the X driver headless framerate limiter to more closely mimic upstream behavior and prevent it from activating in inconvenient situations. Added a new X config option "LimitFrameRateWhenHeadless" to disable the headless framerate limiter.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented Gamescope from running when using the NVIDIAOpen GPU Kernel modules.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented the installer package from being unpacked on systems where zstd is not installed, when /tmp is mounted noexec.</li>
<li>Use transparent huge pages when available for the .text section. This is done through madvise() calls, and requires CONFIG_READ_ONLY_THP_FOR_FS.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression that prevented setting backlight brightness levels.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could lead to UI corruption in nvidia-installer on systems with more than one initramfs file per kernel.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused games built on the Source 2 engine to hangwhen running under Xwayland.</li>
<li>Changed the name visible in /proc/devices of NVIDIA devices and the NVIDIA control device from "nvidia-frontend" to "nvidia" and "nvidiactl".Scripts which parse /proc/devices (such as udev rules) may need to be updated. Note that the conventional /dev device paths like /dev/nvidia0 and /dev/nvidiactl remain unchanged.</li>
</ul>

<li>Fixed a bug that caused games built on the Source 2 engine to hang when running under Xwayland.</li>
<li>Added experimental HDMI 10 bits per component support; enable by loading nvidia-modeset with `hdmi_deepcolor=1`.</li>
<li>Added support for HDR signaling via the HDR_OUTPUT_METADATA and Colorspace per-connector DRM properties when nvidia-drm is loaded with the`modeset=1` parameter.</li>
<li>Added support for PRIME render offload to Vulkan Wayland WSI.</li>
<li>Added support for the CTM, DEGAMMA_LUT, and GAMMA_LUT DRM-KMS CRTCproperties. These are used by features such as the "Night Light"feature in GNOME and the "Night Color" feature in KDE, when they are used as Wayland compositors.</li>
<li>Added beta-quality support for GeForce and Workstation GPUs to open kernel modules. Please see the "Open Linux Kernel Modules" chapter in the README for details.</li>
<li>Added initial experimental support for runtime D3 (RTD3) power management on Desktop GPUs.  Please see the 'PCI-Express Runtime D3 (RTD3) Power Management' chapter in the README for more details.</li>
<li>Added support for the EGL_ANDROID_native_fence_sync EGL extension and the VK_EXTERNAL_SEMAPHORE_HANDLE_TYPE_SYNC_FD_BIT andVK_EXTERNAL_FENCE_HANDLE_TYPE_SYNC_FD_BIT Vulkan external handle typeswhen the nvidia-drm kernel module is loaded with the modeset=1 parameter.</li>
<li>Added experimental support for framebuffer consoles provided by nvidia-drm. On kernels that implement drm_fbdev_generic_setup anddrm_aperture_remove_conflicting_pci_framebuffers, nvidia-drm will install a framebuffer console when loaded with both `modeset=1` and `fbdev=1`kernel module parameters. This will replace the Linux boot console drivenby a system framebuffer driver such as efifb or vesafb.<br/>
<br/>
Note that when an nvidia-drm framebuffer console is enabled, unloading nvidia-drm will cause the screen to turn off.<br/>
 </li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to allow installing the driver while an existing NVIDIA driver is already loaded.</li>
<li>Added support for virtual reality displays, such as the SteamVR platform,on Wayland compositors that support DRM leasing. Support requires xwayland version 22.1.0 and wayland-protocols version 1.22, or later.Tested on sway, minimum version 1.7 with wlroots version 0.15, and also on Kwin, minimum version 5.24.<br/>
<br/>
Note: Before xwayland 23.2, there is a known issue with HDMI displays where the headset will fail to start a second time after closing SteamVR. This can be worked around by unplugging and replugging in the headset.<br/>
 </li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented VRR (Variable Refresh Rate) from working with Wayland.</li>
<li>Changed the name visible in /proc/devices of NVIDIA devices and the NVIDIA control device from "nvidia-frontend" to "nvidia" and "nvidiactl".Scripts which parse /proc/devices (such as udev rules) may need to be updated. Note that the conventional /dev device paths like /dev/nvidia0and /dev/nvidiactl remain unchanged.</li>
<li>Added support to the NVIDIA VDPAU driver for running in Xwayland. Please refer to the "Xwayland support in VDPAU" section of the README for further details.</li>
<li>Added libnvidia-gpucomp.so to the driver package. This is a helper library used for GPU shader compilation.</li>
<li>Removed libnvidia-vulkan-producer.so from the driver package. This helper library is no longer needed by the Wayland WSI.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 has a 64bit and Vulkan update for Linux in testing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve are still updating Team Fortress 2 (TF2), and a bigger technical update is currently in the works that will bring 64bit and Vulkan support to the Linux version.</p>
<p>Currently, TF2 on Linux uses ToGL, Valve's original DirectX to OpenGL translation layer. Like what Valve did with their other older games, this update will instead use the vastly newer DXVK, which translates DirectX to Vulkan. Together 64bit and Vulkan support should make the game run much smoother. <em>Eventually, the Windows version should be 64bit too.</em></p>
<p>Not only that, it's also bumping up TF2 to use the newer Steam Linux Runtime 3.0 "Sniper", making it work better on modern Linux distributions.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20344173191706099056gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20344173191706099056gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - TF2 on Linux</em></p>
<p>You can try it out right now under the "x64_linux_test" Beta branch on Steam, which is now public, but you will not be able to connect to public servers or do matchmaking. It's purely for local testing and benchmarking. On top of that the Team Fortress 2 Dedicated Server is also being updated to go along with it (Steam App ID: 232250).</p>
<p>Good to see more TF2 updates really are coming.</p>
<p>TF2 is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Palworld hits 7 million sales, smashes Counter-Strike 2&#39;s all-time peak and gets a roadmap</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Palworld has continued to smash records, and it has now become the number 2 on Steam for the record of peak-players as it crosses 7 million sales. There's also now a fancy roadmap.</p>
<p>It only recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/palworld-overtakes-counter-strike-2-for-most-players-on-steam-and-hits-5-million-sales/" target="_blank">jumped over Counter-Strike 2</a> for currently online players, but now it has <em>also</em> rocketed past CS2 on the record of peak-players overall with 1,864,421 versus CS2's all-time peak of 1,818,773 giving it the true number 2 spot on Steam which you can see on <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/?sort=peak" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>. Absolutely incredible numbers for a brand new Early Access game.</p>
<p>A new roadmap has also been <a href="https://twitter.com/Palworld_EN/status/1750103684971987108" target="_blank">shared</a> by the developer on X:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10833728241706096346gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10833728241706096346gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>From the image:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>There's also already a Steam Deck performance <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/palworld/mods/27" target="_blank">mod</a> available, although it does reduce the visual quality a <em>lot</em> and it's already not especially great visually on Steam Deck to get it around 30FPS. It currently has a Steam Deck Playable rating and works just fine on Desktop Linux with Proton.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Core Keeper is a rather wonderful game about underground mining, crafting and exploration and it's about to get a big new Lunar New Year event along with some new permanent features to improve the game.</p>
<p>The event itself runs from January 31st - February 13th sending you off on a hunt for lost red envelopes, filled with Lucky Coins that can be traded for a range of new items, including decorative Paper Lanterns, Mystic Knot Tassels, Wall Paper Lanterns, Guardian Beast Statues, and a brand new piece of headgear – the Dragon Mask.</p>
<p>On top of that various new permanent features (non-events) will be added including fan-requested quality of life improvements, including major changes to wall &amp; floor tiles to streamline building and customisation, improvements to chests and planter boxes, additional performance optimisations and more. Even Discord Rich Presence is being added in.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer which teases the event and a brand new boss:</p>

      <title>Godot Engine gets a free Nintendo Switch port for game devs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's one less reason for game developers to skip over using the free and open source <a href="https://godotengine.org" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, as it now has a free port available to bring games over to the Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>You may remember recently that W4 Games, a company set-up by some of the Godot team, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/godot-43-dev-1-brings-major-rendering-changes-plus-w4-games-on-console-suppor/" target="_blank">announced</a> their own console port availability that has a cost attached to it which at a basic minimum would be $800 a year for a single console. Many felt the price was too much but, since it's all open source, anyone else could come up with a porting solution and now they have — for the Nintendo Switch at least.</p>
<p>RAWRLAB Games announced the free Godot Engine port for authorised Nintendo Switch developers, supporting projects made with Godot versions 3.5.x and 4.1.x. Features of the port:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·<strong> Complimentary access</strong>: Available at no cost to all authorised Nintendo Switch developers.<br/>
· <strong>License</strong>: The source code is distributed under the MIT License, offering broad usage and modification rights.<br/>
· <strong>Software provisioning</strong>: The software is provided "as is," without any implied warranty or support of any kind.<br/>
· <strong>Basic functionality included</strong>: This port includes only basic functionality.<br/>
· <strong>No C# or GDNative/GDExtension</strong>: Only GDScript is supported. Native extensions are not supported, but you can try to convert them into internal modules.<br/>
· <strong>Optimization Level</strong>: It is important to note that the port is not highly optimized but is adequately efficient for most small to mid-sized game projects.<br/>
· <strong>Expandability</strong>: Having access to the source code, developers with C++ knowledge have the opportunity to add and integrate additional functionalities as needed.<br/>
· <strong>No support provided</strong>: This port is provided without support. Developers are encouraged to engage with the community on the Nintendo Developer Portal for collaboration and assistance. We recommend partnering with <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/platform/consoles.html#:~:text=need%20to%20know-,Third%2Dparty%20support,%C2%B6,-Console%20ports%20of" target="_blank">porting companies</a> for medium or large-sized projects.<br/>
· <strong>Access Procedure</strong>: Access can be requested through the Nintendo Developer Portal.</p>

      <title>Proposed Windows NT sync driver brings big Wine / Proton performance improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Zeb Figura of CodeWeavers <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240124004028.16826-1-zfigura@codeweavers.com/" target="_blank">has proposed</a> a Windows NT synchronization primitive driver to help performance of running games and applications designed for Windows on Linux with Wine / Proton.</p>
<p>As per the RFC (request for comments) posted onto the Linux kernel mailing list Figura notes: "This patch series introduces a new char misc driver, /dev/ntsync, which is used to implement Windows NT synchronization primitives."</p>
<p>Then giving some background on it: "The Wine project emulates the Windows API in user space. One particular part of<br/>
that API, namely the NT synchronization primitives, have historically been implemented via RPC to a dedicated "kernel" process. However, more recent applications use these APIs more strenuously, and the overhead of RPC has become a bottleneck.</p>
<p>The NT synchronization APIs are too complex to implement on top of existing primitives without sacrificing correctness. Certain operations, such as NtPulseEvent() or the "wait-for-all" mode of NtWaitForMultipleObjects(), require direct control over the underlying wait queue, and implementing a wait queue sufficiently robust for Wine in user space is not possible. This proposed driver, therefore, implements the problematic interfaces directly in the Linux kernel."</p>
<p>Figura did a presentation on it at the Linux Plumbers Conference in 2023 that you can see below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NjU4nyWyhU8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/77edce484c538b915ff3e93bddcf8d33.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NjU4nyWyhU8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What kind of performance difference might we see with something like this? The difference depends on your hardware and what you're trying to run but some FPS examples were given from multiple users including:</p>

<p><em>What hardware and software each was tested on was not noted.</em></p>
<p>Some impressive numbers but again it's hardware dependent, but even so any performance uplift would be welcome, so hopefully the patch series gets some good comments and approval after any tweaks are done that may be needed. Looks like we could end up seeing a nice future performance improvement for Linux and Steam Deck gaming with Wine and Proton.</p>

      <title>Railway network designer Rail Route releases February 22nd and over 100K copies sold</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rail Route from developer Bitrich is currently in Early Access and they just announced their plans for the big 1.0 release to happen on February 22nd. Rail Route has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Playable and a demo is available too if you wish to try it first.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1124180/view/3988567539067416013" target="_blank">announcement</a> they also mentioned they've crossed over 100,000 sales! It's been through some pretty huge improvements during Early Access across ~20 major updates. They've also confirmed more updates are planned to come after the 1.0 update.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12460610441706027310gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12460610441706027310gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>With its minimalist design it may look quite simple and inviting, but it's quite a complicated beast once it gets going. Having to manage and automate many different train-lines is no simple task to get right, and you can end up sinking dozens of ours at a time into it. A really interesting building sim overall.</p>
<p>You get a lot of freedom with it too building up from scratch as you gradually unlock new tech and resources to build the ultimate rail network across real-world city maps. There's a lot of different ways to play it too, the choice is yours from getting everything running perfectly on time and just endless tweaking or high-pressure, time-sensitive scenarios.</p>
<p>You can buy it on:</p>

      <title>The Universim god-game city-builder 1.0 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Universim from Crytivo has finally released, what they call a "new breed of God Game" where you guide a civilisation from nothing up to the stars. It comes with Native Linux support and it is rated Steam Deck Playable, although the Steam Deck rating is from 2022.</p>
<p>From a successful Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign in 2014, and then an Early Access on Steam in 2018, it's been a long time coming. A game I've played on and off over the years, always liking what I saw but it was far from complete. The big 1.0 release brings in an absolute <em>ton</em> of content including new buildings, space exploration, new planets, aliens, new quest lines and the list just keeps on going. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7212295931706026458gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7212295931706026458gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>This is a game that will truly suck away endless hours of your time, not just because there's now a lot to it, but even getting a basic civilization going will take quite a few hours. A joy to watch everything grow though, and it's quite a pretty game too. Nothing realistic looking, with Crytivo opting for a much more casual colourful style to it - although the planets themselves look pretty great.</p>
<p>If you want something resembling a city-builder, but you want something a bit different, The Universim is an interesting choice with all the god powers at your disposal. It's a pretty relaxing game, although there's times when it can be a bit intense when you're dealing with different disasters, the overall theme of the game keeps it remaining mostly calm. The narrator is a nice touch too which guides you through the game, giving you quests and hints. There's not really another game quite like it.</p>
<p>Release trailer viewable below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lyWUUHzGyJE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d72f4d80ab0c227f99d76cc6eafdf743.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lyWUUHzGyJE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>God-like Gameplay: Play as a deity guiding the Nuggets, a sentient species, through their evolution from the Stone Age to the Space Era.</li>
<li>Nuggets’ Civilization Dynamics: Observe the Nuggets' daily lives, from eating and drinking to mating and conflicts.</li>
<li>Technological and Era Advancement: Progress through a research tree with over 200 advancements.</li>
<li>Planetary Exploration and Management: Discover and colonize a vast array of procedurally generated planets. Each planet offers unique ecosystems and challenges.</li>
<li>God Powers and Influence: Wield 15 God Powers like tornadoes, earthquakes, lightning strikes, and more. Use these powers to guide, protect, or discipline the Nuggets.</li>
<li>Ecological Impact and Management: Manage the delicate balance of your planet's ecosystems. Your decisions, alongside the Nuggets' actions, have real environmental consequences, influencing global climates.</li>
<li>Mysterious and Humorous Narrative: Engage with a story-rich game narrated with humor. Unravel the layers of a deeper cosmic story that challenges your perception of being a deity, revealing unexpected twists about your true role.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Something I have noticed in the 1.0 release with the Linux version is that the main menu is a bit broken, with lots of ghosting and graphical issues with menus. The actual game itself is fine, just the main menu is graphically messed up and it appears to be the same on macOS. Hopefully they will fix that soon. Performance once actually in game seems pretty good though!</p>

      <title>SteamOS alternative Bazzite v2.2 out now with lots of enhancements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need something similar to SteamOS for your desktop or handhelds like the Steam Deck? The latest release of Bazzite with <a href="https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite/releases/tag/v2.2.0" target="_blank">version 2.2</a> sounds like it just keeps getting better.</p>
<p>Technically <em>not</em> a Linux distribution, and they don't call Bazzite a Linux distro. It's more of a community-rebuild based on Fedora Linux using <a href="https://github.com/ublue-os/main" target="_blank">ublue-os/main</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ublue-os/nvidia" target="_blank">ublue-os/nvidia</a> with <em>lots</em> of extras included. It's still not yet something for beginners, with their install experience gradually improving. But for people who love to tinker, this could be a bit of fun.</p>
<p>The 2.2 release includes some big changes like a new modified fsync kernel with enhanced hardware support, HDR and more. You also get Nintendo HID support, a Webapp Manager, Pods as a default feature which is great for managing distrobox/containers, improvements to Steam Deck support, patches to Gamescope pulled in from ChimeraOS and tons of tweaks to both the GNOME and KDE desktop environments available. Plus lots of bug fixes.</p>

<p>Bazzite started as a project to resolve some of the issues that plague SteamOS, mainly out of date packages (despite an Arch base) and the lack of a functional package manager.</p>
<p>Despite this project also being image-based, you are able to install any Fedora package straight from the command line. These packages will persist across updates (So go ahead and install that obscure VPN software you spent an hour trying to get working in SteamOS). Additionally, Bazzite is updated multiple times a week with packages from upstream Fedora, giving you the best possible performance and latest features - all on a stable base.</p>
<p>Bazzite ships with the latest Linux kernel and SELinux enabled by default with full support for secure boot (Run ujust enroll-secure-boot-key and enter the password ublue-os if prompted to enroll our key) and disk encryption, making this a sensible solution for general computing. (Yes, you can print from Bazzite)</p>
