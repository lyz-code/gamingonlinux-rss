      <title>War Thunder gets BattlEye anti-cheat enabled for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>War Thunder from Gaijin Entertainment <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/war-thunder-is-moving-away-from-easy-anti-cheat-to-battleye/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced back in December 2024</a> that they would be changing the anti-cheat, which continues to be rolled out in stages. They're moving from Easy Anti-Cheat to BattlEye, both of which support Linux platforms and War Thunder did <em>already</em> support Linux.</p>
<p>As of the latest update posted January 24th, they noted "BattlEye anti-cheat has been enabled for Linux", so players on Linux / SteamOS / Steam Deck should be good to <em>continue</em> playing. The update is noted on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat compatibility page</a>.</p>

<p>It's great to see Gaijin Entertainment have kept up their Linux support for this game for so long. Showing many others how it can be done successfully, unlike <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/grand-theft-auto-v-gets-battleye-anti-cheat-breaks-online-play-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GTA Online</a>, which also uses BattlEye but Rockstar are choosing not to enable it.</p>
<p>War Thunder remains wildly popular too with a 24 hour peak of 87,363 players, and that's just on Steam, the game is available direct from the developer and on consoles.</p>

      <title>The Last of Us Part I added AMD FSR3.1 Frame Generation and Super Resolution</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For those interested in maximising game performance on Linux / Steam Deck, The Last of Us Part I just got another major tech upgrade. v1.1.4 released January 24th, further enhancing the graphical options available.</p>
<p>Patch notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Feature Support</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for AMD FSR3.1 Super Resolution</li>
<li>Added support for AMD FSR3.1 Frame Generation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>[Hometown] Fixed rendering issue that could appear on TVs when using NVIDIA DLSS or AMD FSR</li>
<li>[The University] Fixed issue that could occur when interacting with a generator while enemies were still present</li>
<li>[Bus Depot] Fixed issue where Joel's flashlight would turn on when inspecting certain artifacts despite being in direct sunlight</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Accessibility</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Text to Speech issue where "M" key was not being read when assigned to a function</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Now it might make the experience even better on Steam Deck, depending on your settings. As we've seen before, unless the game is already performing somewhat well, Frame Generation can seriously mess with the frame timings.</p>

      <title>Airships: Lost Flotilla is a perfect time-killer where you can make some ridiculous ships</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Airships: Lost Flotilla is a steampunk themed auto-shooter just released from David Stark, an offshoot of their other game Airships: Conquer the Skies and it's simply great. <em>Disclosure: the publisher Metaroot sent me a key.</em></p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of Vampire Survivors, Brotato and all the others that have come along that in some way fit into this bullet heaven genre, you probably already know a lot of what to expect from a game like this. You go through waves of enemies against a timer, trying to survive to make it to the next wave, so you can upgrade and keep pushing further.</p>
<p>Here you're piloting a steampunk airship of some sort, and gradually adding more weapons and buffs to make the most ridiculous build you possibly can. Like a ship that has a cannon, a giant saw blade and…tentacles (because why the hell not it looks cool!).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6214210641737738706gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>When you manage to complete a wave, you then get to go through various ship upgrades. This could be entirely new weapons, ability buffs you can repeatedly train, weapon level upgrades and other modules to install. There's quite a <em>lot</em> to pick from, and you really can make some varied builds once you start unlocking more ships that have more space on them. Bigger isn't always better though. The smaller ships are speedy, while the bigger ships are sluggish and quite challenging to play as.</p>
<p>Trying out all the hundreds of different combinations has been exceptionally fun, the key to this game really is the variety in all the builds to keep trying something new.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15789400431737740546gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Weapons having two different upgrade paths for each of them is a nice touch too. So even if you pick the same weapons one run, you could upgrade them an entirely different way in another run.</p>
<p>After going through the upgrades, it's time to pick a path across the map. This part is what I really like about the game, because it makes you think and try to plan a little. Each location offers up something different in terms of risk versus reward. You might want to pick an easy path just to get further, or risk it for more research and different types of rewards available to progress in other ways.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="GIPgpacnFQ0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c68bc0720c9f9f856a815ebd3a064c14.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/GIPgpacnFQ0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Once you get further in, the game opens up a little more too with all the different types of enemies with their various weapons and attack patterns. Then add to that there's some environmental interactions too like clouds that can help reduce fire but also visibility, sandstorms that push you around and more.</p>
<p>The boss battles can be pretty insane too, and thoroughly challenging. The game as a whole is pretty challenging though, although I've been playing it on the middle difficulty which does feel about right.</p>
<p>Quite accessible too since not only does your ship auto-fire but you can make it so it powers forwards by itself, with you only needing to control left and right. Easy one-handed gaming.</p>
<p>While it's not much to look at, with some truly basic artwork for a lot of it, Airships: Lost Flotilla is a perfect time-killer for when you've got a few minutes spare but it can easily sink your entire evening.</p>
<p>Airships: Lost Flotilla has Native Linux support and Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Explore outer space with your word-finding skills.</p>
<p>You are dealt a handful of letters and must make words on an empty grid. Letters replenish with oxygen after you use them, and so you have to make new words, to find new oxygen. The grid might not be empty anymore but don't fret, it is as boundless as the universe itself. Oxygen on the other hand...</p>
<p>In Mission mode, set your own difficulty with 28 unique modifiers and try to beat the game by mining up resources.</p>
<p>In Journey mode, set out to explore the galaxy. Stop at various space stations to acquire and upgrade items to help you along on your wordy journey. Stretch your web of words as far as possible and discover as many planets as you can.</p>
<p>Plays entirely with the mouse. A run may last for a couple of hours. Features a save system.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Nexus team continue building up their newer cross-platform open source Nexus Mods App that will eventually replace Vortex. Version 0.7.2 was released recently further expanding what you can do with it.</p>
<p>With this update the UI has seen some further refinements like the Games, Loadouts, and Health Check pages to bring them up to date along with a bunch of new icons. They've also made improvements to how they handle File Conflicts. For players of Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord, they've added in support for the Bannerlord Software Extender.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15109160921737722879gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Other changes and known issues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Technical Changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Free users will now see a modal prompting them to upgrade to Premium when clicking the "Download all" buttons for Collections. Downloading mods individually is still possible.</li>

<li>Reduced the number of log messages to make troubleshooting issues easier.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p><strong>Known Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stardew Valley (Native Linux version) is not detected when installed via Heroic Launcher on Linux. The Windows version of the game can be used instead until this issue is fixed.</li>
<li>Bundled mods included with collections do not appear in the UI but are still applied to your game.</li>
<li>The success rating for collections is not showing the correct value.</li>

      <title>Games to claim from Prime Gaming, Jan 24 edition round-up for SteamOS Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's the up to date list of games available on Amazon Prime Gaming for January 24th, and what compatibility you can expect for Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck.

<p>I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"/> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play. Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now.</p>

      <title>Palworld gets a roadmap including co-op crossplay, world transfers for Pals and an ending</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Palworld developer Pocketpair have recently revealed a fresh roadmap of what's to come for the popular monster catching survival game. There's still no update yet on the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/palworld-dev-details-the-patents-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-for/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo and Pokemon lawsuit</a>, hopefully we'll see a resolution to that sometime soon.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/109465341737717092gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">To celebrate the first anniversary they've revealed their upcoming plans which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>CO-OP Crossplay.</li>
<li>World Transfers for Pals.</li>
<li>World Tree / Ending Scenario.</li>
<li>Further ways to strengthen and improve Pals.</li>
<li>Various new content such as new Pals and technologies.</li>
<li>Game Collaborations (Including Terraria).</li>
<li>Improvements to world object placement.</li>
<li>Improvements to base Pals.</li>
<li>Improvements to optimization.</li>
<li>Improvements to UX.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you missed it the developer also recently launched <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/palworld-developer-pocketpair-launches-pocketpair-publishing/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pocketpair Publishing</a>.</p>
<p>Palworld works on Linux Desktop with Proton, and Valve rated it Steam Deck Playable (it has a lot of issues). Would be nice if Pocketpair would also work on improving how it runs on Steam Deck where it would be a really good fit if they put some effort into it.</p>
<p>It's continued to see a lot of players since the recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/palworld-feybreak-v0411-is-out-now-and-its-a-huge-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Feybreak update</a> with it seeing a 24 hour peak player count of 96,808.</p>

      <title>Base-building survival game Necesse gets a big update and Free Weekend</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Necesse is an impressive open-world base-building survival and adventure game from developer Fair Games ApS, with a big update out now and you can try it free this weekend. There's also a 35% discount if you want to keep it.</p>
<p>The game has full Native Linux support and Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified. So if you've been stuck for something to play, this could be a great pick for you to game away your weekend.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0n5zR0_sW40"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/89f4d98a040be6946962230d6cb1aa74.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0n5zR0_sW40" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Writing about the update the developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I talked about in the last update, we've focused more on making the progression and exploration less repetitive. This time around we’ve added new hazards to the snow, swamp and desert caves. The Deep caves will receive a similar treatment in a future update.</p>
<p>In the spirit of the Free Weekend and co-op play, we’ve also added 4 new staves that specialize in buffing your allies. But if you prefer to play solo, you can also give them to your settlers. If you enjoy playing a supportive playstyle, then these staves are for you!</p>
<p>And other smaller changes, like a new critter when exploring the caves along with a new crop and some food. This will make it harder to run out of food while deep in the caves :)</p>
<p>Some of the other features in this update include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Hoverboard now better handling and a dash ability!</li>
<li>Several gravel tiles that couldn't be crafted before, are now craftable.</li>
<li>More gems will now drop from the crystal mini biomes.</li>
</ul>

      <title>DOOM: The Dark Ages launches May 15 with a new trailer and developer video</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>id Software and Bethesda Softworks have revealed more gameplay for DOOM: The Dark Ages, plus it's now set for release on May 15th. Although, like many bigger developers, you can get it a few days early if you buy the more expensive edition of the game for Advanced Access on May 13th.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8KyA7bf4IB0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c532b0b356f87d7f21071f1be93d32e6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8KyA7bf4IB0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>If you want a longer look at the game they also have a developer video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FGFuaVUI6_E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6555745d418def9a90f2c57e76811db3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FGFuaVUI6_E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Something to note, is that the game <em>requires</em> a GPU with Ray Tracing capabilities, even on their minimum settings. As they announced in a <a href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-EU/article/doom-the-dark-ages-pc-specs" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> they said: "Note: DOOM: The Dark Ages requires a hardware ray tracing-compatible GPU to play on PC, including Minimum Specifications. Details on Path Tracing specifications will be revealed at a later date."</p>
<p>They say it's using a new generation of their idTech game engine, idTech8, which takes "full advantage of modern hardware on all platforms, idTech8 ushers in a new era of gameplay performance and visual fidelity featuring all-new dynamic interactive ray-traced lighting and shadows, higher-fidelity image quality, increased gore and destruction and so much more".</p>
<p>Sounds quite exciting, if your PC will run it, as it has the "largest environments ever in a DOOM game" to date with dragons and great big mechs. This might be a bridge too far for the Steam Deck though. Hopefully there won't be any issues with normal Desktop Linux via Proton.</p>
<p>Here's the specifications they've given:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><u><strong>MINIMUM (1080p/60 FPS/Low Video Settings)</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>OS:</strong> Win10 64Bit / Win 11 64Bit</p>
<p><strong>CPU:</strong> AMD Zen 2 or Intel 10th Generation @3.2Ghz with 8 cores / 16 threads or better (examples: AMD Ryzen 7 3700X or better, Intel Core i7 10700K or better)</p>

      <title>FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH broken on Linux with NVIDIA GPUs but works with AMD GPUs like Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sad news for NVIDIA GPU owners on Linux who want to play FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH, which just released on Steam yesterday as it appears broken. Works on Linux for those with an AMD GPU like the Steam Deck though.</p>
<p>According to the developer of VKD3D-Proton, the Direct3D 12 to Vulkan translation layer used by Proton, this is an NVIDIA driver bug that has been reported to NVIDIA already. As developer Hans-Kristian Arntzen said on <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/8408#issuecomment-2610069931" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The RTX issues are known. It's a driver bug and it has been reported to NV with bug number 5059946.</p>
<p>I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out a reasonable workaround, but to no avail.</p>
</blockquote>

<em>Image credit: hjpaul7 on <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/8408#issue-2807113474" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</em></p>
<p>NVIDIA do have a new 570 Linux driver coming soon to support the new GeForce RTX 50 series, which should be coming on January 30th. However, some have spotted an early build of the 570 driver and tested it and <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/8408#issuecomment-2611708530" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a> that it does not fix it (but it's not clear if that's a complete driver).</p>
<p>The good news for everyone else, is that it does work with an AMD GPU (including the Steam Deck with SteamOS). However, if you're on a SteamOS-like distribution, you might need to tell the game you're not on a Steam Deck, otherwise it will give you low visuals. Set this launch option:</p>

      <title>Proton Hotfix updated to get THE FINALS working again on Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recent updates to THE FINALS ended up breaking it on Linux / Steam Deck, but Valve have pushed out a new update to Proton Hotfix to get it working again.</p>
<p>Lots of reports came flowing into <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/2073850" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> about it being broken, and on Valve's GitHub too where yesterday a Proton developer <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/7317#issuecomment-2608576332" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noted</a> Proton Experimental's Beta version got a fix that should help (with reports showing it did). So now Valve have updated Proton Hotfix and set it as the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/891390/history/?changeid=27141418" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">default</a> for THE FINALS. So you shouldn't need to do anything, except untick any Proton version you may have forced on it previously.</p>
<p>Testing it myself today on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu) and yup, all working just fine again.</p>

<p>Unlike normal Proton version and Proton Experimental, Valve don't generally announce changes for Proton Hotfix since it's not used too often and only in certain special cases like this where they're not ready to update the other main Proton versions. See <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">more in my guide on all the Proton versions</a>.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental updated with fixes for Battle.net, Atelier Resleriana, Dirt Rally 2 and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve updated Proton Experimental for January 22nd with a bunch more fixes for gamers on Linux, SteamOS and Steam Deck. Like the Battle.net update issue that came up recently that was fixed in a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/ge-proton-9-23-released-with-a-battlenet-fix-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent GE-Proton update</a> too. <em>Confused on all the Proton versions? Go and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">read my guide explainer</a>.</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Noted as now playable with this update:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stronghold Crusader: Definitive Edition Demo.</li>
<li>Atelier Resleriana: Forgotten Alchemy and the Polar Night Liberator.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Other fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed non-Steam battle.net installations.</li>
<li>Fixed desync issue with 60FPS AVPro videos in VRChat.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Fixed Proton 9 regressions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed performance degradation in Dirt Rally 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nice to see Valve continue to fix issues with apps people add into Steam like Battle.net, since you can install various third-party standalone stuff using Proton too.</p>

      <title>GDC 2025 survey shows PC game development growing with lots interested in Valve&#39;s Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest Game Developers Conference (GDC) survey has been released, and it gives a rather glowing overview of how great things are for PC gamers with lots of developers working on games.</p>
<p>With the survey including over 3,000 game developers and industry professionals, they've managed a decent enough sample size. What's really interesting though, is that PC game development is not just alive and well but expanding. As they said last year only "66% of developers reported that they were working on games for PC", but this year "that number climbed up to 80%".</p>
<p>Another interesting point here is that while the Steam Deck was <em>not</em> listed as an option, of those who picked "Other", the survey saw "44% of them wrote in Steam Deck as a platform they’re interested in". <em>They didn't state how many filled out Other though.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2096528541737662408gol1.jpg"/><br/>

<p><em>PC in this case means Windows specifically since Mac and Linux are separated. The industry still generally writes PC as meaning Windows. Maybe one day we'll break away from it. <strong>Update 8PM UTC</strong>: Image updated to their newer corrected version for some text.</em></p>
<p>Developers still don't seem all that keen on AI as well with "30% of respondents reported that they believe that generative AI is having a negative impact on the games industry, which is a 12% increase from last year". However, there's plenty that are using AI as GDC note: "More than half of developers surveyed (52%) work for companies that have implemented generative AI and one-third (36%) personally use them. Respondents within Business and Finance Roles in companies were most likely to use Artificial intelligence tools (51%), followed by Production and Team Leadership (41%) and Community, Marketing and PR (39%)".</p>
<p>Layoffs continue to hit hard too with "11% of developers reported being laid off in the past year".</p>
<p>Going by the results 4% of developers are using the free and open source <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> for their current game, with the majority currently sticking to Unity and Unreal both at at 32%. 13% said they use other proprietary tools and then there's CryEngine at 0.2% and O3DE at 0.1%.</p>

      <title>over the hill is an offroading exploration game announced by the art of rally devs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The devs of art of rally, Funselektor Labs along with Strelka Games have announced over the hill, a new offroading exploration sim where you can bring a friend along for the ride.</p>
<p>With graphics quite similar to art of rally, they're not going for realism but sticking with the colourful style they're known for and I think it looks wonderful. They're continuing the nostalgia trip too with it focusing on the "golden age of offroading" they say that gives you access to "iconic vehicles from the 60s to 80s".</p>
<p>Check out the announcement trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hFi39URiesI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5e7868c0e97a883b9d6eb917fcc0aa0b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hFi39URiesI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Highlights:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>a world of discovery - Discover portals to travel to new areas, and complete objectives to unlock new vehicles, upgrades, customizations, and cosmetics, with many combinations to try. Who knows, maybe you’ll find some hidden gems along the way.</li>
<li>multi or single player - Take a friend or go on a solo tour. Challenge yourself, collaborate with up to three friends, or just enjoy the sights - the world is your oyster.</li>
<li>adapt and overcome - Take on the elements with dynamic weather, day/night cycles, and realistic terrain deformation. Find solace in nature, even when you’re stuck in the mud.</li>
<li>Fancy a break? Gather your friends around the campfire, grab a hot cocoa, and catch up on the day’s events.</li>
<li>it’s about the journey - The best stories never start at the end. With so much to explore and uncover, it’s all about the cruise. Complete all the objectives, unlock the many customizations and upgrades, and discover everything the wilderness has to offer. Just take your time and find peace in the minimalistic serenity.</li>
<li>capture the beauty - Grab stills of your favourite landscapes with the built-in photo mode. We can’t wait to follow your journey. You never know what you may discover just over the hill.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems you'll probably need Proton to play it on Linux.</p>
<p>This one is going right into my wishlist.</p>

      <title>Linux &#39;fascinates and terrifies&#39; the dev of DEAD LETTER DEPT. but they&#39;re supporting it anyway</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mike Monroe / Belief Engine are approaching the release of DEAD LETTER DEPT., a thoroughly creeping looking typing game and it's coming with Linux support. <em>Disclosure: the developer emailed over a pre-release key for the game.</em></p>
<p>What is it? An unusual typing game that revolves around you taking a temp job while you get situated in a new city, being tasked with the data-entry work of typing up various words and addresses written on the mail &amp; letters that were not able to be successfully delivered- due to bad handwriting or other reasons unknown. As the days pass on, strange stories begin to emerge from the mail you review. Sometimes it feels like they're talking directly to you.</p>
<p>The developer summed it up as:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In terms of game mechanic themes, you could say DEAD LETTER DEPT. is relative to other horror games like Home Safety Hotline and The Mortuary Assistant, in which you are tasked with a job to accomplish but with rising complications as the story and tensions progress. Details lie under the surface, for those willing to look.</li>
<li>Horror wise, it is a technological ghost story with the focus being on building mood, dread, atmosphere, and the fear of the unknown.  There is certain programming in DEAD LETTER DEPT. that I specifically kept unpredictable for certain occasions, as I wanted the game to feel haunted even during it's own development.</li>
<li>The mail in each playthrough is intelligently randomized, meaning no two playthroughs are quite the same. A typical playthrough can run around 2 hours, with multiple endings to encounter.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<p>Writing about the Linux / SteamOS support for the game in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1627350/view/693091765959262378" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam the developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's a long story really. What began as a casual investigation into making sure the game functionally runs on Steam Deck, turned into: 'Oh, the game appears to run surprisingly well on Linux???' Frankly I anticipated random filesystem explosions and graphical razorblades to have to solve for this, like with any port. But nope? It's been tested on 4 different distros (Zorin, Arch, Ubuntu, and the SteamOS of course) and appears to run pretty identical to its Windows counterpart. So I think that's cautiously optimistic enough results to try.</p>
<p>Frankly making a Linux version automatically solves a MASSIVE GAMEBREAKING VIDEO CODEC issue if the game would be run under Proton (on the Steam Deck), so I might as just publish a Linux version.</p>
<p>I realize the Linux user demand for this game isn't necessarily huge (to be fair I haven't listed it as Linux supported yet either), but I'm willing to give it a fair shot. Linux fascinates and terrifies.</p>

      <title>Adventures of a Cat in Space is an upcoming musical adventure starring Arthur Darvill</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Adventures of a Cat in Space sounds like an exciting one to keep on your radar. An upcoming musical point and click adventure game starring Arthur Darvill (Doctor Who, Broadchurch, Legends of Tomorrow and more).</p>
<p>Commissioned by <a href="https://www.thespace.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The Space</a>, Adventures Of A Cat In Space is a collaboration between family music specialists Little Seeds Music, and narrative game developers Tall Story Games (Heir of the Dog, Lucy Dreaming). Players take on the role of a cat stranded in space after an unexpected mishap. To make their way back to Earth, they must explore a vast and colourful array of planets, solve puzzles, and unlock songs that will help guide them home. They are aided in their quest by the ship’s computer, voiced by Olivier award winning actor and musician Arthur Darvill, who also performs the game's main theme song. </p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LX9fJXmz6wI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/97aa2d49410f58107228c6d505833c33.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LX9fJXmz6wI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release: Adventures Of A Cat In Space has been commissioned and funded by The Space, who were established in 2013 to fund the creation of new digital cultural content and provide free training, mentoring and online resources for organisations, artists and creative practitioners. Harmeet Chagger-Khan, Head of Digital Innovation for The Space says: “Adventures of a Cat in Space is a charming and funny, interactive game filled with catchy tunes that you’ll be singing for days.  The Space is delighted to support the project which sees Little Seeds venture from traditional music and storytelling into the gaming world to excite and engage younger audiences and families in new ways."</p>
<p>A demo will be released on 24th February 2025, ready for Steam Next Fest and it will have Native Linux support. The developer sent me over an early demo key, and the theme song is already firmly stuck in my head. This is going to be a good one, nice and family friendly too.</p>

      <title>Paradox announce Stellaris 4.0 will be a big overhaul sometime in Q2 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox Interactive have announced that a big free Stellaris 4.0 update is coming later this year, and it's going to overhaul quite a lot. There's no date set for it yet but it will be sometime in Q2 2025, and will launch along with another major paid expansion.</p>
<p>This was originally announced <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/281990/view/577123891031310365" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">January 16</a>, with a follow-up first part to go over some more changes on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/281990/view/515199938040168701" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">January 23rd</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8090741021737636412gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Stellaris, credit: Paradox.</em></p>
<p>As any Stellaris player will know, the game has grown to such a scale that there's so many moving parts, there's a lot that can break and performance can be an issue in the late game too with all the calculations the game is doing. So thankfully performance is going to be a big focus of it too.</p>
<p>To help players understand the game one thing that has been announced is the new compendium, allowing you to search through all sorts of things that will be in nice neat categories. They've been iterating over their tooltip system too, and this will all work together to give you all the info you need on every concept in the game. Sounds useful.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6165305121737636640gol1.png"/></p>
<p>There's also going to be improvements to the Ship Designer as they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve taken the Ship Roles that were introduced in the 3.6 ‘Orion’ update and made selecting one part of the basic ship design flow and giving them a better representation than a scrollable text list. Some pain points of ship design, like the Auto-generate changes button blocking saving, have been removed, and in general it’s a faster and easier process to create a general ship design.</p>
<p>We’ve added a “Custom” role for veteran players that want to design the ship from scratch, or you can take one of these generated templates and modify them to suit your needs before saving.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More updates to help newer players are coming as well, as the game does quickly get quite complicated, so they're making numerous quality of life improvements to make the game flow easier to understand.</p>
<p>On the subject of game-flow, they're converting events that don't need you to pick any options from a game-interrupting pop-up into a simpler "toasts or notifications". However, you'll be able to adjust it, as they're adding a Message Settings screen to change how you wish to view them all across notifications, toasts, pop-ups and auto-pause for each type. They also said that "Certain event chains that are not particularly loved have had (or will have) a bit of adjustment as well".</p>
<p>There's so much more like improvements to galaxy generation, and a big one they have in other Paradox games with Focus Trees, will make a sort-of appearance but tweaked for how different and dynamic Stellaris is. Instead of a set tree, they're going to add in "suggested tasks that fall into Conquest, Exploration, or Development aspiration categories".</p>

      <title>Palworld developer Pocketpair launches Pocketpair Publishing </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Palworld developer Pocketpair are not slowing down, as they just launched their own video game publisher with Pocketpair Publishing.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pocketpair Publishing provides comprehensive support for game development through funding, development assistance, and publishing for indie game developers and small studios. Pocketpair Publishing promises to take a hands-off approach, providing as much support as developers need without overstepping or imposing strict conditions on the development process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/976035971737635846gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Their first published game has been announced as a brand new horror game from SURGENT STUDIOS, founded by British actor and video game developer Abubakar Salim. More from the press release:</p>
<p>From John "Bucky" Buckley, Head of Pocketpair Publishing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At Pocketpair, there is nothing we love more than games, and Pocketpair Publishing is our latest venture to help the world enjoy gaming even more. Game development comes with many challenges, but we want to ease that process as much as possible and provide an environment where creators can pursue their dreams.</p>
<p>We are pleased to be able to support SURGENT STUDIOS’ new title as our first step. We deeply sympathize with their original ideas and passion and are honoured to help them realize their vision. We will respect the autonomy and vision of developers and work together to make great games for people all over the world.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope that more creators will be able to realize their dreams through Pocketpair Publishing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From Abubakar Salim, CEO of Surgent Studios:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We noticed a pattern in the entertainment industry, and Pocketpair has given us the opportunity to make a horror game about it. Both Surgent and Pocketpair are well-versed in taking risks. This game will be short and weird, and we think players will be interested in what we have to say.</p>
<p>We’re still in earnest conversation about further projects set in the Tales of Kenzera universe, but this will be a standalone piece: a mile marker between where we’ve come from and where we’re going.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nice to see that Pocketpair are using their success with Palworld to help other developers, even in the face of the Nintendo lawsuit that's ongoing.</p>

      <title>Linux kernel 6.13 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One missed earlier this week while I was running around Wales, Linus Torvalds announced the release of Linux kernel 6.13.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">In the release <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2025/1/19/281" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> Torvalds said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So nothing horrible or unexpected happened last week, so I've tagged and pushed out the final 6.13 release.</p>
<p>It's mostly some final driver fixes (gpu and networking dominating - normal), with some doc updates too. And various little stuff all over. The shortlog is appended for people who want to see the details (and, as always, it's just the shortlog for the last week, the full 6.13 log is obviously much too big).</p>
<p>With this, the merge window for 6.14 will obviously open tomorrow. I already have two dozen pull requests pending - thank you, you know who you are.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some highlights of what's new:</p>
<ul>
<li>A proper fix for data corruption on 64GB Steam Deck models. Plus a few other miscellaneous kernel improvements for Steam Deck APU support.</li>
<li>A fix for AMDGPU when running Steam games and YouTube videos together, to prevent a system hang with multiple monitors.</li>
<li>Case-insensitive support for tmpfs. An interesting one that can help Wine, Proton and Flatpak as noted:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The use case for this feature is similar to the use case for ext4, to better support compatibility layers (like Wine), particularly in combination with sandboxing/container tools (like Flatpak).<br/>
<br/>
Those containerization tools can share a subset of the host filesystem with an application. In the container, the root directory and any parent directories required for a shared directory are on tmpfs, with the shared directories bind-mounted into the container's view of the filesystem.<br/>
<br/>
If the host filesystem is using case-insensitive directories, then the application can do lookups inside those directories in a case-insensitive way, without this needing to be implemented in user-space. However, if the host is only sharing a subset of a case-insensitive directory with the application, then the parent directories of the mount point will be part of the container's root tmpfs. When the application tries to do case-insensitive lookups of those parent directories on a case-sensitive tmpfs, the lookup will fail"</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights continued:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new AMD 3D V-Cache optimizer driver to help X3D processors improve performance.</li>
<li>Improvements to Apple M1 device support.</li>
<li>The open source NVIDIA driver Nouveau got DRM panic support for nv50+ cards.</li>
<li>Improved support for various <em>older</em> Apple devices including phones, Apple TV, iPad and more.</li>
<li>Platform profile support for Dell laptops with new WMAX thermal interface, present on some Alienware X-Series, Alienware M-Series and Dell's G-Series laptops.</li>
<li>V3D driver for Raspberry Pi gets "Super Pages" support to help performance.</li>
<li>Added support for the Corsair Void headset family.</li>
<li>Lots more new hardware support as usual.</li>
</ul>
<p>As usual I'm just searching through and cherry-picking random bits here. It's a ridiculously long read as always with thousands of changes across all areas. See more in the <a href="https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v6.x/ChangeLog-6.13" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">full changelog</a>.</p>
<p>Is there a particular addition you're excited to see that made it into Linux kernel 6.13? Let me know in the comments.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck sales drop hard following the Nintendo Switch 2 announcement (updated: Valve fixed it)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 11:21AM</strong>: it's possible the weekly global top sellers list is having issues, as it's been pointed out some clearly top selling games vanished from the last week. I've reached out to Valve to see what's up.</p>
<p><strong>Update #2 8:07PM</strong>: seems Valve got the message, and they've updated it. The Steam Deck on the weekly global top seller for the week beginning January 14th was actually <strong>4th</strong>, not 47th.</p>
<p>With that in mind here's an updated corrected version of the positions over time for you:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4897488031737662833gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4897488031737662833gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>So we can back to saying I'm right, nothing will dethrone it except a Steam Deck 2.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Valve's Steam Deck with SteamOS has been consistently in the top sales charts on Steam since release, but recently it dropped down rather hard following the Nintendo Switch 2 announcement.</p>
<p>I've been tracking the sales over time and have posted a few times about how well it was doing. However, the week during which the Nintendo Switch 2 was announced, it really has dropped down massively to the lowest point since the original release back in February 2022.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind the global Steam sales charts are for revenue, not numbers sold, the Steam Deck is generally higher anyway since it's the equal cost of multiple sales of the most expensive games. Still, it's an interesting look into how the Steam Deck is doing overall and still means usually it's selling a lot considering the games it's up against sell often hundreds of thousands and millions.</p>
<p>Here's how it's position in the weekly global <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topsellers/global/2025-1-14" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">top sellers list</a> has changed:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7485795531737628534gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7485795531737628534gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>I guess I need to admit here I was wrong then don't I? Back in July 2024 when I last looked at this I said "<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/will-anything-dethrone-the-steam-deck-probably-not/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Will anything dethrone the Steam Deck? Probably not</a>", seems the Switch 2 did it.</p>
<p>Sales dropping was bound to happen eventually though, one way or another, and I do fully expect it to bounce back, but it's just surprising to see it drop down so drastically like that.</p>
<p>This won't cause any alarm bells to ring at Valve HQ though, they probably expected this to happen too. I don't expect them to speed up any work on a Steam Deck 2 due to this either. Valve clearly have a plan, especially with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS coming to more devices</a>, and they're still waiting for a truly next-generation APU to slot into a Steam Deck 2.</p>

      <title>The devs of Celeste have cancelled their follow-up game Earthblade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Extremely OK Games, creators of the popular platformer Celeste, have <a href="https://exok.com/posts/2025-01-22-earthblade-final-update/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> that their follow-up game Earthblade has now been cancelled. This was announced in a news post on their official website yesterday, January 22nd.</p>
<p>In the post titled "Final Earthblade Update" written by developer Maddy Thorson they mention clearly "Late last month, Noel and I made the difficult decision to cancel Earthblade". They said the decision was made in December but they waited until now to announce it.</p>
<p>As for why? Their team had a breakdown in communication with Pedro Medeiros, who they said is was "a founding member of EXOK, longtime friend &amp; collaborator, and art director of Earthblade and pixel/ui artist on Celeste and TowerFall". The issue: "a disagreement about the IP rights of Celeste" which they said they won't be going into publicly.</p>
<p>Medeiros has moved onto their own game with <a href="https://saint11.art/games/neverway/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Neverway</a>. Worth noting that Medeiros did post on X back in November 2024 that they had left EXOK:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19758198891737626172gol1.png"/></p>
<p>The decision to cancel Earthblade, the post from Thorson makes clear, was made by Maddy Thorson and Noel Berry. As for why? Multiple reasons it seems. The game wasn't as far along as they had hoped, along with the pressure of Celeste's success: "Celeste's success applied pressure on us to deliver something bigger and better with Earthblade, and that pressure is a large part of why working on it has become so exhausting".</p>
<p>Other members of their team have moved on now too, so Thorson and Berry are going back to smaller-scale projects and have begun prototyping again.</p>

      <title>AMD reveals AMDGPU Composition Stack, a fork of Wayland&#39;s Weston compositor for advancing the Linux desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With many Linux desktops now running Wayland quite nicely, it seems it's time to keep pushing ahead. AMD have revealed what they call the AMDGPU Composition Stack (ACS).</p>
<p>This is a fork of Wayland's Weston compositor with some "additional advanced features". It all sounds pretty exciting when you look at what AMD developer Shashank Sharma noted on the <a href="https://gitlab.com/acs-wayland/weston/-/wikis/home" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitLab Wiki</a> page with these being the primary goals:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>To act as a staging area for Weston/Wayland features to be opensourced to mainline.</li>
<li>To act as a reference compositor for AMD's advanced graphics and display feature development.</li>
<li>To provide a middleware compositor which extracts the best out of AMD Display and Graphics HW (We don't mind being biased to AMDGPU HW)
	<ul>
<li>To host some of the AMD HW specific code, which can't be merged in weston mainline due to its bias towards AMD HW.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To be utilised in full stack opensource delivery vehicle for AMDs commercial solutions and products.</li>
<li>To be the space where AMD specific in-house SW tools (performance tweakers, multimedia players, 3D games, profiling tools etc) can be saved in future.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<em>Picture credit: AMD</em></p>
<p>As noted on the Wiki page some initial features added include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>VRR / Freesync.</li>
<li>MPO using underlays.</li>
<li>Color Management and Wide gamut support.</li>
<li>ACS media-player app.</li>
<li>Fullscreen HDR video playback.</li>
<li>Multi-seat config support.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's also a basic video player included to "demonstrate some of these advance feature in a video playback context".</p>
<p>This was announced on the dri-devel <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/dri-devel/2025-January/486833.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">mailing list</a>.</p>

      <title>SDL 3 officially released for game devs plus an SDL 2 to SDL 3 compatibility layer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) is a popular free and open source library for developers that handles audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick and graphics with SDL 3 now available. Plus a new SDL 2 to SDL 3 compatibility layer.</p>
<p>Much like they already have <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/sdl12-compat" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">sdl12-compat</a>, which allows you to use SDL 2 if you're stuck on SDL 1, they've also released <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/sdl2-compat" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">sdl2-compat</a> for people stuck on SDL 2 to get the benefits of SDL 3.</p>
<p>There's a huge amount of new features and overall improvements including (taken from the SDL 3 <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-3.2.0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release post</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/APIByCategory" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Extremely good documentation</a>: We've spent a ton of effort writing and revising the API reference.</li>

<li>More consistent API naming conventions. Everything is named consistently across the API now, instead of different subsystems taking different approaches. Also, we've tended toward more descriptive names for things in SDL3.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/README/main-functions#main-callbacks-in-sdl3" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Main Callbacks</a>: optionally run your program from callbacks instead of main().</li>

<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_OpenAudioDevice" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Logical audio devices</a>: different parts of an app can get their own unique audio device to use.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_CreateAudioStream" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Audio streams</a>: handle buffering, converting, resampling, mixing, channel mapping, pitch, and gain. Bind to an audio device and go!</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_PLAYBACK" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Default audio devices</a>: SDL3 will automatically manage migrating to new physical hardware as devices are plugged in, ripped out, or changed.</li>

<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/BestKeyboardPractices" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Better keyboard input</a>, for all your keypress needs.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_StartTextInputWithProperties" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Customizable virtual keyboards</a> on iOS and Android.</li>

      <title>Windows compatibility layer Wine 10.0 out now bringing Wayland and ARM64EC support, new FFmpeg multimedia back-end</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The big release is here! The Windows compatibility layer Wine version 10.0 is officially out now bringing lots of big new features. Wine is a major part of what powers Valve's Proton, enabling thousands of Windows games to run on Linux.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some highlights of what's new includes (compared with Wine 9):</p>
<ul>
<li>ARM64EC support</li>
<li>Wayland support that's enabled by default.</li>
<li>An FFmpeg-based multimedia back-end as an alternative to the GStreamer backend. Still experimental though, but should hopefully begin to improve Media Foundation support (good for gaming).</li>
<li>Much improved High-DPI support.</li>
<li>Network sessions are supported in DirectPlay.</li>
<li>An initial Bluetooth driver.</li>
<li>Support for the Dvorak keyboard layout.</li>
</ul>
<p>And lots more! Full changelog on the <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/releases/wine-10.0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Wine GitLab</a>.</p>
<p>Eventually we will see Valve update Proton as well to move it onto Wine 10 and see Proton 10 later this year.</p>

<p>GE-Proton 9-23 is out now as the latest update for the community-maintained version of Valve's Proton that pulls in lots of quick-fixes for Linux, SteamOS and Steam Deck. <em>Confused on all the Proton versions?

      <title>Cats vs Cthulhu is a weird and charming survivor-like with unique movement</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In a genre full of clones and copycats, Cats vs Cthulhu is a very unique bullet-heaven survivor-like where you bounce around the arenas trying to avoid all the enemies while collecting everything to power up. Note: developer sent a copy to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4218320-GamingOnLinux/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">our Steam Curator</a>.</p>
<p>Here instead of running around, you fling yourself around at different angles and speeds to either avoid or smash into every weird creature that comes along. While also trying to collect stars and since you're a cat, fish and boxes to power yourself up during a run and unlock more cats and arenas. It's seriously weird but ridiculously charming and entertaining.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8lTcPmIVbDU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ae71c0b3bb52e494f640e204acbd61d1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8lTcPmIVbDU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Dozen of cats to choose from - Every cat has unique attributes. Recognize their strengths and weaknesses and adjust your build accordingly.</li>
<li>Buy yourself something comfortable and powerful - Increase your attack speed, improve your durability or unleash the power of the rainbow! Upgrades, People, Upgrades!</li>
<li>Injection of Love - Eat your weapons to gain permanent buffs.</li>
<li>Meta-Progression - While fighting Cthulhu you collect cardboards, which you can then use to buy new cats or arenas.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer told me "It's a small game but I poured my soul into it". It's a fantastic little coffee-break game that's nice and different. As the waves go on and you power up, along with the different enemy types it really does get rather chaotic.</p>

      <title>Roll the dice to make crazy combos instead of collecting cards in the roguelike Die in the Dungeon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Build up a deck of dice in Die in the Dungeon, where all your dice have a different purpose that you stack up together to make crazy combinations. As a big fan of games like Slay the Spire and Dicey Dungeons, this looks like a really fun mixture that's probably going to suck away lots of my time when it arrives.</p>
<p>More: "In Die in the Dungeon, each dice represents a different action, from basic ones like attacking or healing to boosting other dice or copying their abilities. Improve the quality of your dice, combine them and acquire powerful relics to defeat the monsters that dwell in the dungeon! Find great synergies by combining dice with unique abilities to create powerful and bizarre decks!"</p>
<p>The developers announced it's set for launch on February 21st with a brand new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5geKorczBrI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/df67c3240b6dd4234eb5c66c238ea95f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5geKorczBrI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Craft your deck from an ever-growing collection of dice.</strong><br/>
	Every dice has its purpose, with tons of combinations to discover and exploit. On top of that, special properties and upgrades will ensure no single dice feel exactly the same.</li>
<li><strong>Explore the dungeon and its unwelcoming inhabitants.</strong><br/>
	Forged by strong magic, the walls and floors of the dungeon shift continuously, creating a brand new experience in every run. Thankfully, encounters are not always hostile, but never let your guard down... it’s all a game of risk and reward down here.</li>
<li><strong>Discover powerful synergies by choosing from a myriad of relics.</strong><br/>
	Stack their powers and use them to boost your dice and board slots, multiplying the power of your combinations and becoming unstoppable. But don’t get too greedy, the stronger a relic is, the bigger their drawbacks will affect you and your deck.</li>
</ul>

      <title>On a massive space station spiraling out of control the action roguelite Katanaut is full of cosmic horrors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a demo now available, Katanaut is an action roguelite set aboard a massive space station spiraling out of control. It looks like it has some great action, and it's pretty grim.</p>
<p>More: With the station slowly spiraling out of control, and its once-human inhabitants twisted into terrors, you’re the unlucky one tasked with uncovering what is going on... assuming you’re able to survive the station's violent halls with souls-like combat.</p>
<p>Check out the new demo trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6X56abT6DSc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4e2fd5923836497d062f9f8def06bd72.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6X56abT6DSc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Diverse Builds | Experiment with different weapons, guns, and abilities to create a strategy that matches your style, or something completely unexpected.</li>
<li>Unique Challenges | Experience a unique mixture of hand-crafted and procedurally generated levels where it could be a quick and easy run, or an intense onslaught of surprises.</li>
<li>Unlockable Arsenal | Roguelites aren't roguelites without unlockable items! Katanaut offers a vast number of weapons, skills, and perks waiting to be discovered and upgraded.</li>
<li>High-Stakes Combat | Got quick reflexes? We serve up speedy fights where playing smart and thinking quick can make all the difference.</li>
<li>Pixel-Perfect Design | Experience a pixel-art universe where all the details are refined and designed by hand. All to inspire the unsettling beauty of this cosmic nightmare!</li>
<li>Synthwave Soundtrack | Our soundtrack brings immersive energy to every battle and simultaneously aims to paint the vibe of the station’s darkest corners – all made by one immensely talented musician!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I tested out the demo on Kubuntu Linux 24.10 with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the latest Proton 9.0-4</a> and it works without issues. Giving a definite Dead Cells meets Dead Space vibes from this one. With very fast-paced combat and a nice mixture of great lighting with pixel-art it looks great in motion. One to try out and keep an eye on.</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Depending on what driver series you go for, you will need to check what the next version up is that has fixes. NVIDIA listed these Linux driver versions as safe:</p>
<ul>
<li>550.144.03 (released today)</li>
<li>535.230.02 (released today)</li>

<p class="plain-list-title">535.230.02 Linux <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/drivers/details/239545/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Updated the kernel module build process to use CONFIG_CC_VERSION_TEXT from the Linux kernel's Kconfig to detect the compiler used to build the kernel. This may help select the correct compiler on systems where the kernel was built with a compiler other than the default one.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented kernel modules linked using precompiled kernel interface files from loading on recent Debian systems.</li>
<li>In linux-next commit 446d0f4849b1, intended to be included in Linux kernel 6.12, output_poll_changed is removed from struct drm_mode_config_funcs. Do not implement the function pointer member when not present to ensure the driver can compile with newer kernels. Populating modes for DRM connectors during hotplug events will not be supported with r535 and kernels containing the relevant commit.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Windows users need at least 553.62 or 539.19.</p>

      <title>Cubic Odyssey announced as a fusion of Minecraft and No Man&#39;s Sky</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a style that's a fair bit similar to Minecraft with an expansive universe seen in the likes of No Mans Sky, the recently announced Cubic Odyssey from Atypical Games and Gaijin Network Ltd looks pretty darn fun.</p>
<p>An open world multi-planet adventure that blends in all sorts. Planet and space exploration, crafting, vehicle building, quests and an "epic story of saving the galaxy" – it seems to have just a little bit of everything. <em>It was bugging me where I've seen the idea before, turns out it was slightly similar to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2016/10/stellar-overload-the-block-based-adventure-fps-is-now-on-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Stellar Overload</a> from 2016 that is no longer for sale and another called Outerverse.</em></p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="pESTJPDZmmk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c0107dbf08e8abe0f5f06903baf8880b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/pESTJPDZmmk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I love the idea of it, but I have to be blunt, that combat looks pretty <em>weak</em>. Everything else about it looks and sounds great, especially with it having co-op support too.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cubic Odyssey starts right after a crash landing on the surface of a distant planet. A player mines resources, refines materials, and builds everything from tools and outposts to vehicles and starships that give access to free exploration of the galaxy. Every star seen in the sky or in space is the light of a star system. Each star is orbited by planets filled with life, with shifting day-night cycles, bustling NPC cities, pirate outposts, and dangerous ruins waiting to be discovered. The ultimate goal here is to stop the Red Darkness, a spreading galactic infection that mutates wildlife, consumes planets, and threatens all living beings.</p>
<p>The game features seamless ground, air and space traversal, with a brief slice of this experience shown in an announcement trailer. Experience warp jumps between star systems, cruise at blazing fast speed between planets, use the planetary speeders to travel on planets, and explore the underground caves on foot. Players will also be able to join forces with others in an optional co-op mode to take down massive enemies, initiate orbital laser strikes, or build cooperative megastructures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“We’re happy to support the creativity of indie game developers and were thrilled by the scope and ambition of Cubic Odyssey”, - comments Anton Yudintsev, founder of Gaijin Entertainment.</p>
<p>“We intend to build a boundless open world where every planet, every system, and every moment is yours to shape”, - says Andrei Lopata, CEO of Bucharest-based Atypical Games.</p>
<p>You'll need Proton to play it on Linux.</p>

      <title>THREAT VECTOR is an action sci-fi horror FPS coming from KillPixel Games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>KillPixel Games, one of the dev teams responsible for WRATH: Aeon of Ruin, have announced their next game with THREAT VECTOR. Seems it will have Linux support like WRATH too.</p>
<p>About the game: "In 2197, an interplanetary mankind encounters a rogue planet passing through the solar system. Beneath its frozen surface lurks a discovery that threatens all of humanity.  As the human race is brought to the edge of extinction, a failing AI locates a remaining hypersleep pod within lunar orbital Theia's crisis unit chamber. Once awakened, the last surviving soldier must journey across the solar system to secure the THREAT VECTOR."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/49690231737034858gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>They've so far only released a short teaser video on the game, which doesn't give away much and doesn't really show any gameplay but even so, it has me rather excited because it seems like it's going to be incredibly creepy. Story from their Steam page noted above sounds interesting too.</p>
<p>Check out the first teaser below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="9GULXgdgMhk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2732f1c955fb1f2243d96575f3fa4667.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/9GULXgdgMhk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>THREAT VECTOR has a laser focus on the core elements that make classic shooters timeless:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>ENGAGING COMBAT</strong></p>
<p><strong>&gt;</strong> easy to learn, hard to master; varied, dynamic and refined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>EXCELLENT LEVEL DESIGN</strong></p>
<p><strong>&gt;</strong> succinct and elegant levels are infused with the rich history of classic FPS design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>GRIPPING ATMOSPHERE</strong></p>
<p><strong>&gt;</strong> ambience and mood so thick you can cut it with a knife.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Neutralize the murderous mechs, augmented animals and antisocial aliens that menace lunar bases, orbital facilities and space stations across the solar system with an arsenal of ballistic weaponry, including shotguns, carbines, precision rifles, explosive launchers and high-tech, experimental weaponry.</p>

      <title>Popular diorama builder Tiny Glade is getting better Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tiny Glade is a gorgeous and relaxing diorama builder about doodling castles and all sorts all over the screen, it's seriously impressive and they've announced work is ongoing for improving it on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>More about it: "Tiny Glade is a relaxing free-form building game. Tap into the joy of making something pretty with no management, no combat, or wrong answers - just kick back, doodle some castles, and turn forgotten meadows into lovable dioramas. Explore gridless building chemistry, and watch the game carefully assemble every brick, pebble and plank, adapting to your whim. Draw a path through a building? A door pops up! Raise the building? Columns and beams line up to support it."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20737348231737032793gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>In an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2198150/view/547850400377602109" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam the developer mentioned working on "controller support &amp; improving the experience on Steam Deck". It's not coming in one big patch though, and instead will come as and when each bit is ready.</p>
<p>One such patch is already out now adding "an alternative mode for camera rotation and zoom" which "should improve the Steam Deck experience, and if you’re on PC, and you’ve been struggling with the camera suddenly yeeting itself as you try to rotate, we recommend checking it out too".</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you want to make backups of your game saves, the free and open source tool Ludusavi is an essential item to put in your toolbox. The developer just put up a new release, v0.28.0, which includes a bunch of fixes and new features.</p>
<p>Cross-platform so you can run it on Linux (including Steam Deck), Windows and macOS. Fully featured with the ability to detect thousands of games across Steam, GOG, Epic, Heroic Launcher, Lutris and more. It has a full user interface, as well as command-line tools. Useful for backing up to another drive or anywhere else like somewhere on the cloud.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8158414311737030861gol1.png"/></p>
<p>For this release here's the new features added:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>On Linux, for Lutris roots that point to a Flatpak installation, Ludusavi now checks <code class="inline-code">$XDG_DATA_HOME</code> and <code class="inline-code">$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code> inside of the Flatpak installation of Lutris.</li>
<li>Custom games now let you specify installed folder names. This can be used to satisfy the and path placeholders in cases where Ludusavi can't automatically detect the right folder. For more info, <a href="https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi/blob/v0.28.0/docs/help/custom-games.md" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">see the custom games document</a>.</li>
<li>On the "other" screen, there is a new option to skip backups when saves are only removed but not added/updated. This can be useful because uninstalling a game may cause some of its data (but not all) to be removed, but you may not want to exclude that data from your backups yet.</li>
<li>CLI: <code class="inline-code">config show</code> command.</li>
<li>CLI: The <code class="inline-code">backup</code>, <code class="inline-code">restore</code>, <code class="inline-code">cloud upload</code>, and <code class="inline-code">cloud download</code> commands now support a <code class="inline-code">--gui</code> option for graphical dialog prompts.</li>
<li>CLI: The <code class="inline-code">backup</code> and <code class="inline-code">restore</code> commands now support a <code class="inline-code">--dump-registry</code> option, which includes the serialized registry content in the output. This may be useful if you're consuming the <code class="inline-code">--api</code> output to back up with another tool, but don't have a good way to check the registry keys directly.</li>
<li>CLI: The <code class="inline-code">find</code> command now supports <code class="inline-code">--fuzzy</code> and <code class="inline-code">--multiple</code> options. This is also available for the <code class="inline-code">api</code> command's <code class="inline-code">findTitle</code> request.</li>
<li>CLI: The <code class="inline-code">wrap</code> command now supports several options from the <code class="inline-code">backup</code> command: <code class="inline-code">--path</code>, <code class="inline-code">--format</code>, <code class="inline-code">--compression</code>, <code class="inline-code">--compression-level</code>, <code class="inline-code">--full-limit</code>, <code class="inline-code">--differential-limit</code>, <code class="inline-code">--cloud-sync</code>, <code class="inline-code">--no-cloud-sync</code>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's some other behaviour changes and bug fixes too.</p>

      <title>Intel and NVIDIA drivers holding back a public SteamOS release, Valve not trying to compete with Windows</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>During CES, Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais <a href="https://www.frandroid.com/marques/valve/2462758_il-y-a-12-ans-de-travail-pour-en-arriver-la-interview-de-pierre-loup-griffais-developpeur-de-steamos-los-phare-du-steam-deck" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">spoke to Frandroid</a> about SteamOS, Steam Deck and more and there's some interesting bits in there about the future. In case you missed it recently Valve announced a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">public beta of SteamOS is coming as 'SteamOS expands beyond Steam Deck'</a>.</p>
<p>The interview on Frandroid is in French, but here's some <em>Google-translated</em> info for you. On the subject of SteamOS for everyone, it appears that issues with both Intel and NVIDIA drivers are part of what's holding up the release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:start"><strong>One of the promises was to release SteamOS for everyone, how difficult is it to release it now?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:start">“I think there are a couple of factors. One is that on some platforms, the support is still very basic. Intel, it works a little bit better than before, but our driver teams and Intel are working on it. NVIDIA, the integration of open source drivers is still pretty nascent. There’s still a lot of work to be done on that side… So it’s a little bit complicated to say that we’re going to release this version when most people wouldn’t have a good experience.”</p>
<p style="text-align:start">“And then there’s the ease of installation. We had an installer for SteamOS 2, but here we started with the Steam Deck so everything came straight out of the box, so the process right now is basic. Unlike some community alternatives that add this layer of installation that accompanies users. We haven’t done that yet.”</p>
<p style="text-align:start">“It’s just a matter of priorities.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:start">So it's all in progress and they're working on it together with various driver teams. Eventually the situation should be solved.</p>
<p style="text-align:start">Anyone who uses NVIDIA on desktop Linux will know how badly Steam Big Picture Mode currently works, so this is not exactly a big surprise to me. When I switched over to an AMD GPU, it was like a night and day difference.</p>
<p style="text-align:start">As for the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/lenovo-legion-go-s-with-valves-steamos-is-official-expected-to-launch-in-may/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Legion Go S that will use SteamOS</a>, an interesting note here is that Valve / Lenovo will be using the open source tool <a href="https://github.com/ShadowBlip/InputPlumber" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Input Plumber</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:start"><strong>Are the works of Bazzite, ChimeraOS, Nobara also profitable for you?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:start">“Sometimes yes. A lot of their work is integration, where they use things that the community has developed to create a much more streamlined installation and support experience than our development trees. But there are also quite a few components that are originally developed by the community that we use. For example, on the Legion Go S, we use a component called Input Plumber to manage the controller.”</p>
<p style="text-align:start">"We're not too interested in inventing our own sauce [<em>sic</em>]. If something is already done and meets our standards of performance and functionality, we use it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you're hoping that SteamOS is going to be the Windows-killer that other news sites keep reporting on, Valve have much calmer words to say about that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:start"><strong>Back in the Windows 8 days, Gabe Newell accused Microsoft of killing the PC ecosystem. Is SteamOS the Windows killer developed by Valve?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:start">"I don't think the goal is to have a certain market share, or to push users away from Windows. If a user has a good experience on Windows, there's no problem. I think it's interesting to develop a system that has different goals and priorities, and if it becomes a good alternative for a typical desktop user, that's great. It gives them choice. But it's not a goal in itself to convert users who already have a good experience."</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:start">Valve are also leaving the door open for a future Steam Machine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:start"><strong>Are Steam Machines still in sight, or are portables your priority?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:start">"Right now, we're focused on handhelds. But as our work expands our ability to work on other platforms and have a good experience in different form factors... We've already done a lot to make these consoles connectable to screens, connectable to a controller..."</p>
<p style="text-align:start">"We're not there yet to give priority to a Steam Machine. But in collaboration or internally, it's an open door to the future."</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:start">So in other words, they're just focused on providing a good experience for their own Steam ecosystem. Users moving over if they see it works better for them is nice to have, but they're not trying to directly compete against Windows completely (yet…).</p>

      <title>WebScreen is a customizable open source mini-screen that sits on your monitor to show notifications and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>WebScreen is an upcoming mini-screen that can sit on top of your monitor like a webcam, allowing you to customize it to get notifications and all sorts so you don't miss anything while you're busy (like playing video games). <em>It was announced a while ago, which I missed, but the developer emailed over the press details on it recently.</em></p>
<p>What is it? As they explain: "WebScreen is a customizable secondary display that sits atop your monitor, like a webcam, providing critical notifications, reminders, and visuals right in your line of sight. Whether you’re deep in a game, focused on work, or streaming, WebScreen lets you see what matters most without the constant urge to check your phone or disrupt your workflow. Featuring a vibrant AMOLED display and powered by an ESP32-S3 microcontroller, WebScreen fits seamlessly into any setup and can be personalized to display only the information you want to see."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19709020691736949727gol1.png"/></p>
<p>The device is fully open source too. It's already certified by the <a href="https://certification.oshwa.org/us002702.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">OSHWA</a> along with various bits on <a href="https://github.com/HW-Lab-Hardware-Design-Agency" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>I quite like the idea of it, as I do have a habit of checking my phone constantly. It's clearly something I don't need, but do I want it? Yes, yes I do. The whole thing is built to be as flexible as possible allowing you to run all sorts of applications directly on the device so you never miss a thing with apps built via JavaScript.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Specifications</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Display:
	<ul>
<li>High-quality AMOLED display.</li>
<li>240 x 536 resolution.</li>
<li>16.7 M colors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Processor: Powered by an ESP32-S3 microcontroller.</li>
<li>Connectivity:
	<ul>
<li>USB Type-C, configured via WebSocket.</li>
<li>Wi-Fi and Bluetooth support.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Programmable platform: Easily create custom apps in JavaScript and run them directly on WebScreen via a microSD card.</li>
<li>Mounting: 1/4-inch mount on bottom, 1/4-inch screw on top for attaching a webcam.</li>
<li>Size: 74 x 80 x 53 mm (2.9 x 3.15 x 2.08 in).</li>
<li>Weight: 53 g (0.13 lbs).</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">From their press info they included an <strong>FAQ</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What types of content can WebScreen display? Apart from gaming alerts, WebScreen can display<br/>
messages, social media updates, real-time stats, and custom animations or logos.</p>
<p>Is WebScreen customizable? Yes, you can tailor WebScreen to show the information that matters most to<br/>
you.</p>
<p>Does WebScreen require an internet connection? While WebScreen can operate as a standalone display<br/>
for static content, certain dynamic features like social media updates or game stats will require an internet<br/>
connection.</p>
<p>Can I develop my own apps for WebScreen? Yes, we encourage developers to create and share their own<br/>
applications for WebScreen.</p>
<p>What is the goal of the WebScreen Crowd Supply campaign? To fund the final development and mass<br/>
production of WebScreen, making it available to a wider audience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They've announced that a <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/hw-media-lab/webscreen" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Crowd Supply campaign</a> will be launching in early March. Which is like Kickstarter for hardware. See more on the <a href="https://webscreen.cc/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">official site</a>.</p>

      <title>Impressive colony building sim Songs of Syx is getting ready to leave Early Access with a big new Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Songs of Syx is a deep and engrossing colony-building sim from Gamatron AB that has steadily improved with new updates since the 2020 release into Early Access but the 1.0 release is finally approaching. <em>Songs of Syx has full Native Linux support.</em></p>
<p>The developer has put up an opt-in Beta v68 which will release for everyone sometime soon, and as usual it's another big update where the dev didn't entirely keep track of all the changes. Sounds like this will be the last update before it leaves Early Access, with a 1.0 patch planned with more big features and a possible price rise too (so you may want to grab it now).</p>
<p>This time they did spend a bit longer editing their update video though, so it should at least give you a nice overview (but they really need a better microphone):</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="T3pODHjm1Us"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/725361df40a2ae4484bf2313abb105af.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/T3pODHjm1Us" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<details class="spoiler_container"><summary class="spoiler_header">Full patch notes, click me to open</summary>
<div class="spoiler-content">
<ul>
<li>New event mechanics &amp; new and refined events.</li>
<li>Better and more error resistant saving</li>
<li>Baths consume coal at a predictable rate</li>
<li>Changing room materials do not crash saves</li>
<li>new and improved bonuses and stats for regions</li>
<li>new and improved road and path generation for the world.</li>
<li>new mechanics for world pathing and trade partners.</li>
<li>More state is saved when a room is copied or broken. Such as radius, and logistics settings.</li>
<li>Stage &amp; Arenas now have fixed sizes, but come in different shapes.</li>
<li>Some visual candy for the woodcutter. Increased storage for them.</li>
<li>Mines and refiners have differently sized output storage, bigger in general.</li>
<li>Pastures do not get penalised for their surrounding fence, which will make indoor pastures better.</li>
<li>new sprites for dirt and blood for portraits</li>
<li>new tutorial cut scenes</li>
<li>new titles icons</li>
<li>Barber is more space efficient.</li>
<li>Hospitals need fabric to function, and give 10% recovery. Opiates is optional and gives an extra 40% recovery.</li>
<li>The import depot is now a potential pull source.</li>
<li>New list for room construction projects.</li>
<li>You can now easily swap punishments for captives, they will not go into exile. Also fixed some general weirdness with punishment rates.</li>
<li>Pools now need direct canal access and will suck water out of the system.</li>
<li>Woodcutters, farms, orchards and pastures now operate on base fertility, and will instead get an additive boost from sweet water.</li>
<li>The old boost to knowledge from libraries is scrapped. Instead Libraries have their own separate tech point system.</li>
<li>The tech tree has been remade visually with some new helpful information.</li>
<li>The tech tree has been remade and rebalanced, quite a bit of thought has been put into it: All industries now have the same possible maximum boost at the same cost, making it viable to specialise in whatever.</li>
<li>All industries have different times to shine, mimicking human evolutions. Farms are best at first, then comes mines, refiners and finally workshops that are best late game. In have all the same value.</li>
<li>Army supply depot has been remade. It no longer stores supplies, but instead loads carts depending on demand, and leaves for the edge of the map. Considerable logistics is needed for large armies.</li>
<li>Rooms no longer breaks when they are fully degraded. This is because I can now track monument degrade.</li>
<li>Awe, harmony, etc. is scrapped. Instead all monuments have their own aura. This is so that monuments can be expanded upon.</li>
<li>Some rooms like markets lets subjects register their surroundings.</li>
<li>Pools work the same way as roads in terms of fulfilment.</li>
<li>Improved rendering speed significantly, which will also increase game speed.</li>
<li>New improved work assignments. Plebs will automatically change workplace based on their building preference. There's also the possibility to assign individual rooms to specific races. This is not an absolute tool, more of a hint, but it's working pretty well.</li>
<li>Refactored the region development code. City hall is built with government points, generated by nobles.</li>
<li>Excess world workforce generates denari.</li>
<li>Growable taxes are only shipped on their harvest day.</li>
<li>Admins are repurposed. An admin combats mid/late game overhead that will come creeping. Overhead increases exponentially.</li>
<li>The old noble offices no longer exist. Instead, when you've appointed a noble, you assign them to an office manually. These offices are split between different industries and regional management. The former boosts a limited amount of workers. The latter will result in Gov Points that are used to upgrade regions.</li>
<li>Export depots have spoilage</li>
<li>Events for regions</li>
<li>Ores generate differently on the city map. You get 100% deposits, but only enough for 30 workers without world deposits. This is to make self-sustaining early games possible.</li>
<li>Consumption of edible goods added to the UI.</li>
<li>New world battle mechanics. Better and more stable engine, with more options, such as defending a city with an army on top, assist you allies, and more.</li>
<li>Got rid of the false virus flag.</li>
<li>Enhanced the tutorial.</li>
<li>REgion buildings rebalanced and fixed.</li>
<li>Organization in regions is gone.</li>
<li>Added 'Worth' to regions. It's a function of mineral deposits, fertility and area. It is used by the AI to estimate how much they want the region.</li>
<li>Showing your net worth in the treasury UI.</li>
<li>Showing a factions net worth in their UI.</li>
<li>net worth includes worth of your population as slaves. Each pop is worth their upbringing time x the cheapest food in Syx x 2. This was bugged before with the average price of food, which could be very high.</li>
<li>Fixed broken power calculations, which were a cause of raider and AI strangeness.</li>
<li>Retirement fulfilment based on your total amount of retires.</li>
<li>Threat is renamed into Rivalry, and is not counted towards your trade.</li>
<li>You get penalised bad for failing to protect your vassals.</li>
<li>Vassal tribute slightly decreased. Their armies will attack your enemies though.</li>
<li>You get a trespassing penalty from moving armies in un-allied territory.</li>
<li>If you have an army in a distant faction's territory, they are allowed to declare war on you.</li>
<li>Factions that are at war with you, yet can't reach you, will continue to be at war with you until you make peace.</li>
<li>When signing peace, you sign a peace with all factions you are at war with.</li>
<li>Peace deals are less powerful. To get some cash from it, you seriously need to threaten the AI by having armies in their territory.</li>
<li>Factions must break off their agreements until neutral before they can declare war.</li>
<li>Wars decrease the opinion of your allies over time, along with city loyalty and region loyalty.</li>
<li>Neutral factions will station their armies by your border.</li>
<li>Raiders may cross through any other faction to attack you.</li>
<li>Raiders will demand more unique and varied things.</li>
<li>Raiders will on occasion destroy a trade partner instead of you.</li>
<li>Minimum opinion is needed for trade, pact and ally. This is so you know what opinion is expected to upkeep your stance.</li>
<li>Factions with low opinion, that can not attack themselves will "poison" all other factions against you. Given enough time, war will break out.</li>
<li>Factions that can't reach you, but wants to kill you, can give their armies to a neighbour at war. They can not start wars though, other than "poisoning" your neighbours.</li>
<li>Increased flattery from emissaries.</li>
<li>Fortifications have different and better ways of being destroyed. Enemies can scale the walls if the outer tiles are broken. This means the thickness of walls is only used to station troops on.</li>
<li>Drastically decreased the strength of every structure that is not fortifications, to emphasise their important.</li>
<li>I have a hugely genius plan to improve the importance of fortifications for 1.0. Just wanted to mention that.</li>
<li>It could also be possible to shift the map when you are invaded to the invasion spot. That is, move all buildings away from the invasion spot, which would allow you to make better use of archers and artillery (think about that will you)</li>
<li>Friendly fire from archers reduced.</li>
<li>Trees only block 50% of projectiles, and are no longer a real obstacle.</li>
<li>Fertility changes. Fertility now goes from 0.5-1.2 in bonus. Irrigation goes from 0.5-1.0. So irrigation is mandatory for all maps. You get free irrigation close to natural water places.</li>
<li>Annoying sudden confusion of divs in formation fix.</li>
<li>Div movement 'stuttering' fix.</li>
<li>Defenders on walls get "high ground" advantage in melee combat. This is x2 on grand fortifications. This should give the defender a clear advantage.</li>
<li>Pathing for divisions improved</li>
<li>Intanglement for divisions improved</li>
<li>New setting for ranged units where they will not move to attack targets</li>
<li>UI for battle improved.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's a really very impressive game, one that regularly sees hundreds of people playing it at the same time on Steam. It also has an Overwhelmingly Positive overall user rating with players putting hundreds of hours into it.</p>

      <title>Discord screen-sharing with audio on Linux Wayland is officially here</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Finally, Discord stable has a new release available, and it officially brings full screen-sharing with audio on Linux with Wayland. Initially <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/looks-like-discord-finally-fixed-linux-screen-and-audio-sharing-with-wayland/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">arriving in their Canary testing client</a>, and then <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/discord-canary-on-linux-breaks-wayland-screen-sharing-support-for-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">being pulled due to bugs</a>, it's now officially here.</p>
<p>However, it's <em>not</em> available in the Flathub release just yet. It's supported in the plain downloads from Discord and the Snap package, but the Flatpak via Flathub needs some <a href="https://github.com/flathub/com.discordapp.Discord/issues/483" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">other fixes</a> to be implemented before the Flathub release is updated.</p>
<p>There does seem to be another caveat with the release, in that it only works if the application you're using goes through PulseAudio. If the app has been updated to go direct to PipeWire it may not work yet. But hey, this is great progress.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7058646401736942239gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p><em>I've tested it working on Kubuntu 24.10 with the latest release download from the Discord website.</em></p>
<p>At least with this update more of you can join Discord chats and share whatever you want, good for when you're gaming with a bunch of friends and need some help and various other reasons why people might use it.</p>

      <title>Positively rated immersive-sim FPS Fortune&#39;s Run is on hold as the developer is going to prison</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Announced originally during the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/08/fortunes-run-is-an-upcoming-retro-styled-hard-scifi-shooter-worth-watching/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Realms Deep event in 2021</a>, and later released into Early Access on Steam in 2023, Fortune's Run is a highly rated immersive-sim FPS but now its future is uncertain. <em>The game is playable on Linux with Proton and is rated Steam Deck Playable by Valve.</em></p>
<p>While a brand new update is out now adding in quite a lot, this looks like it may be the last update for quite a long time. The developer posted an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240/view/532087801681805318" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam, noting they've been "sentenced to prison for the next 3 years". This is not some recent development as their case is "about 5 years old now". They don't go into specifics other than mentioning they were "a very violent person".</p>
<p>Since "Dizzie" is the only developer on the project, it's not clear what will actually happen to the game now. They're clear they want to finish it though, once they get out of Prison that is.</p>

      <title>Forest Reigns is a post-apocalyptic FPS set in Paris from former Stalker devs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Forest Reigns looks like a beautiful blend of gameplay with elements of Stalker, Crysis and Fallout wrapped up in a neat package. Announced by Ukrainian studio VG Entertainment, which has former developers from Stalker team GSC Game World. <em>You'll need Proton to play it on Linux.</em></p>
<p>This sounds like everything I want in a modern single-player FPS.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Five years after the forest emerged, civilization is no more. It isn’t just part of the environment—it’s a living intelligence with almost unlimited power that is deadly to those who harm it but curious to others.</p>
<p>Dive deep into its mysteries and uncover why nature has chosen to fight back.</p>
<p>Will you confront its fury, battling fierce creatures and navigating treacherous traps? Or will you adapt, harnessing the Forest’s power to turn it against your enemies? The choice is yours!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

      <title>Jan 14th Steam Beta fixes Linux issues, a Steam Deck WiFi crash, View In Library added to Downloads page</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a nice fresh Steam Beta (January 14th) for Steam Deck and Desktop PCs squashing some bugs and adding in some new options.</p>
<p>Thankfully, you can once again get back to the Library page of a game that is downloading which Valve forgot to add when they revamped the currently downloading item, along with an option on all games in your Downloads to have a View in Library option in the right click menu (nice!).</p>
<p>These changes are just for Steam Deck:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Allow child accounts to adjust the brightness of the screen.</li>
<li>Fixed a case where bluetooth devices would sometimes show as a generic device under Settings-&gt;Bluetooth instead of showing as their specific type (e.g. gamepad/headphones).</li>
<li>Fixed a rare crash that could happen when scanning for WiFi devices under Settings-&gt;Internet.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>While all these are for everyone including Desktop Steam:</p>
<blockquote>

      <title>Scribbly comic-book styled Heroes of the Seven Islands is a party-based RPG inspired by 90s games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a demo now available, if you love turn-based dungeon crawling RPGs like something out of the 90s, be sure to go and check out Heroes of the Seven Islands.</p>
<p>The developer calls it "A (poorly) hand-drawn tribute to Classic Role-Playing Video Games and Comic Albums". I think the style has a lot of charm to it though, reminds me of some classic Flash animations I used to love watching. A "comfy yet challenging" non-linear adventure experience awaits you in this one, filled full of side-quests to distract you.</p>
<p>Check out their latest trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lgNOB2Ut21U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5b7b6c6d87b5ea060f892d1a5e23298e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lgNOB2Ut21U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A terrible event has just occurred...</p>
<p><strong>Furax The Indestructible</strong>, fleshless carcass and soulless body, has arrived through an inter-dimensional rift in the colorful, carefree world of Émeyralia, to spread <strong>SADNESS</strong> and <strong>DESPAIR</strong>. Nothing seems to be able to stop him: his influence grows daily, many disciples join him and<strong>NIGHTMARE CREATURES</strong> appear on every continent.</p>
<p>According to the prophecy, only <strong>THE ORACLE</strong> could defeat him, but he retired centuries ago. To find him, the 7 keys held by the 7 rulers of the 7 islands of the Emerald Archipelago must be gathered. <strong>Four heroes</strong>, the bravest of the brave, are chosen for this quest. The future of Emeyralia is in their hands.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Inspired by Might and Magic 3-8, but it's point-and-click.</li>
<li>Turn-based yet fast combat system.</li>
<li>Hundreds of (poorly) hand-drawn unique illustrations.</li>
<li>Play the main quest or explore the open world and start side quests.</li>
<li>Discover 7 biomes with villages, cities, dungeons, caves, forests and so on.</li>
<li>Dungeon Synth Music.</li>
</ul>

      <title>The Stop Killing Games petition is back in the UK to sign</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Announced back in early 2024, the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Stop Killing Games</a> campaign was launched to try and persuade governments across the world to change the law on games being shut down and taken away from you.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">As the website notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An increasing number of videogames are sold as goods, but designed to be completely unplayable for everyone as soon as support ends. The legality of this practice is untested worldwide, and many governments do not have clear laws regarding these actions. It is our goal to have authorities examine this behavior and hopefully end it, as it is an assault on both consumer rights and preservation of media.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Part of this is due to what happened to The Crew. Ubisoft said in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/241560/announcements/detail/1647635183971594594?snr=2___" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">2018</a> they had no plans to shut it "any time soon", then in December <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240408045029/https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/the-crew/the-crew/news-updates/mOR3tviszkxfeQCUKxhOV/an-update-on-the-crew" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">2023</a> announced that it was being delisted with servers closing March 2024. So everyone was left with a broken game. I should note here, that in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/the-crew-2-and-the-crew-motorfest-are-getting-offline-modes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">September 2024</a> Ubisoft did announce offline modes were coming to The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest but I haven't seen any update on that yet.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">From YouTuber Ross Scott of Accursed Farms, there <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/uk-government-replies-to-petition-about-requiring-publishers-to-keep-games-working/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">was a UK petition on this last year</a>, which the UK government responded to at the time and closed the petition. But now it's back again, to hopefully get a better answer. From the Stop Killing Games website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While we originally launched this last year, it ended prematurely due to Parliament dissolving and the government misunderstood what was being requested, so it was never completed or answered satisfactorily. This time it's been relaunched under a new Parliament and reworded for clarity, so it should maximizes our odds of getting a conclusive answer as to whether the UK will consider acting on this issue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you're in the UK and want to support it you can do so on the <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/702074/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">official government petitions website</a>. Once it hits 10,000 signatures, the government are supposed to respond. If it hits 100,000 then it could potentially get debated in Parliament.</p>

      <title>Vulkan Quake port vkQuake 1.32 adds external WAD, WAD3, and Half-life format support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>vkQuake is an advanced port of id Software's Quake using Vulkan instead of OpenGL for rendering. It's impressive, one of the best ways to play, and the recent update sounds pretty delightful.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">There's some general fixes and improvements in vkQuake <a href="https://github.com/Novum/vkQuake/releases/tag/1.32.0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">v1.32.0</a> like:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Novum/vkQuake/issues/755" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#755</a>: A <strong>VERY</strong> important, long-standing bug in the GPU Memory allocator fixed by <a href="https://github.com/Novum" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">@Novum</a>, that could create all kinds of graphics corruption and even random crashes. This may solve some problems seen on MacOS and Radeons for quite some time.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Novum/vkQuake/issues/747" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#747</a>: Fix occasional Vulkan crashes when taking screenshots.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Novum/vkQuake/issues/752" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#752</a> , <a href="https://github.com/Novum/vkQuake/issues/761" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#761</a>: MD5 models now manage 32bit textures correctly for both skins and fullbrights.</li>
<li>Linux Appimage is kept using <code class="inline-code">mad</code> instead of <code class="inline-code">mpg123</code> for mp3 support in order to ease compatibility.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And now onto the more exciting part, what's been added in this release. The additions here should make for a fun time for modders that's for sure.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Novum/vkQuake/pull/753" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#753</a>: Add external WAD, WAD3, and Half-life format support. This <strong>great</strong> addition was brought by <a href="https://github.com/Toodles2You" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">@Toodles2You</a>, many thanks.<br/>
	This feature was also added to <a href="https://github.com/sezero/quakespasm" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Quakespasm</a> !</li>
<li>Removed most of the size limits for models, the one remaining is a 32K limit on model vertices. (from Ironwail)</li>
<li>Code cleanups.</li>
<li>Library updates.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Mighty Marbles is a sweet physics-based toy playground out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's one missed from the Christmas break. Mighty Marbles from developer James Oliver has released with Native Linux support. For those of you who love your more casual games, and one that could be great for a younger audience, it reminds me of various different marble board games I played when I was much younger. There's a nice level of detail here too.</p>
<p>Mighty Marbles has 4 unique courses, each featuring 9 levels for a total of 36, plus alternate game modes and over 50 marbles to collect, Mighty Marbles will keep you rolling for a good while. The developer also showed it off on Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7D95F3_v5po"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/31a3ea9cb16910f1e093fb806ee614e8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7D95F3_v5po" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>CONTROLS - Each level is a playground of diverse puzzles, each with its own unique set of controls. Fear not; an intuitive on-screen controller showcases how to navigate each puzzle, granting you the freedom to switch between challenges at your whim!</li>
<li>PUZZLES - Prepare for a series of interconnected puzzles in every level, each presenting distinct challenges that put your mastery of physics to the test. Losing your marble leads to a swift rescue thanks to the adorable Bobby Copters, getting you back in the action quickly.</li>
<li>MODES - After completing the courses, unlock exciting new modes! Test your skills in Collector Mode, where you’ll navigate challenging paths to collect every coin and face new obstacles. For the ultimate test, try Hardcore Mode—where the bobby copters are on strike, and every move counts!</li>
<li>COURSES - The levels are organized into courses. Each course has 9 levels sharing the same theme with new puzzles introduced each level. Initially for early access there are 3 courses, toybox, machines and mini golf. Additionally each course can be played with different game modes to explore new and challenging ways to play.</li>
<li>COLLECT - No marble game is complete without the joy of collecting marbles! Completing fast times on each course and each mode will unlock new and exciting marbles. Once collected, these marbles become yours to choose from, allowing you to personalize your experience by selecting any of your acquired marbles before embarking on a course.</li>

      <title>GOG joins the European Federation of Game Archives, Museums and Preservation Projects</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> made a press announcement today to note they've joined the European Federation of Game Archives, Museums and Preservation Projects (<a href="https://efgamp.eu/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">EFGAMP</a>).</p>
<p>Nice to see a continued and expanding focus on preserving games, while some publishers continue entirely shutting their games years after release and preventing people playing them.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“GOG was created with video game preservation in mind”, said Maciej Gołębiewski, Managing Director at GOG. “Classic games and the mission to safeguard them for future generations have always been at the core of our work. Over the past decade, we’ve honed our expertise in this area. <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/gog-preservation-program" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="">The GOG Preservation Program</a>, which ensures compatibility for over 100 games and delivers hundreds of enhancements, is just one example of this commitment. We were thrilled to see the Program warmly received not only by our players but also by our partners and the gaming industry as a whole”.</p>
<p>Gołębiewski further explained that GOG’s role in preservation extends beyond its platform. He highlighted, “As a European company, we feel a responsibility to lead in preserving gaming heritage. Joining EFGAMP reinforces this commitment. Our next step is to expand institutional collaboration with museums and governmental and non-governmental organizations worldwide. We hope our experience will contribute meaningfully to their efforts. We are also discussing exciting new game preservation projects, which we look forward to sharing soon”.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="IetvbdoeIhg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f95df8e1dd866c26474c125da6143c85.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/IetvbdoeIhg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“GOG brings a unique perspective to EFGAMP as a European leader in digital game distribution”, said Andreas Lange, COO of EFGAMP. “Their experience in making classic games accessible to modern audiences complements the work of our existing members by bringing further digital expertise to our collective efforts. As GOG distributes classic games worldwide, GOG is a fantastic addition to EFGAMP, whose members are primarily rooted in the cultural heritage sector”.</p>

      <title>Co-op horror game KLETKA managed over 100K sales in a month</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developers of KLETKA, a strange co-op horror game about travelling in a hungry living elevator, have announced some stats and it seems they've done well. KLETKA has a Native Linux version that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/horror-scavenging-game-kletka-is-like-lethal-company-but-an-elevator-wants-to-eat-you/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I wrote about last month</a>.</p>
<p>While there were<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-saw-a-record-breaking-nearly-19-000-games-released-on-steam-in-2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> record-breaking 19,000 games</a> released on Steam in 2024, not many of them actually had people buy and play them so it's nice to see some developers getting a little hit on their hands.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1699480/view/523079968283951724" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam the developer put up an image that noted they sold 135K copies. This is across a single month with it only being released on December 13th, 2024. And in that time they've released 6 updates to fix bugs and improve the gameplay.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10140206481736853286gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>It hasn't reached the heights of Lethal Company in terms of player numbers though, still remaining relatively small.</p>

<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-44-the-legend-of-kobo/" target="_blank">Part 44: The Legend of Kobo</a></strong></p>
<p>For a time the term "multimedia" was one of the hottest buzzwords in the computer software industry. Although this boom would begin to recede with the bursting of the dot-com bubble, a number of individuals and firms staked both their futures and careers on the creation of bespoke interactive experiences, often in the service of marketing more established businesses and brands. Enter Lost Boys, an outfit based in the Netherlands intent on doing exactly that.</p>
<p>Their most lucrative client was the Dutch brewer Dommelsch, for whom Lost Boys created a number of on brand sports games which were once distributed for free on the Dommelsch website. One of these was <em>Roll'm Up</em>, a pinball game first distributed in 1997 for Microsoft Windows. Lost Boys themselves would then release <em>Roll'm Up</em> standalone, bringing it over to MacOS, Linux, and even BeOS to highlight the cross platform nature of their Lost Platform multimedia framework.</p>
<p>To install <em>Roll'm Up</em> I utilized the RPM package created by Australian Linux columnist John Murray, who largely seems to have taken over the hosting of the game after the Lost Boys website was taken down around 2002. Where this game excels is in the confidence of its presentation, with boisterous sound effects being matched up with smooth and colourful animations. When put against the popular X windows games of the day, <em>Roll'm Up</em> certainly was a shock to the senses.</p>
<p>The Lost Platform even boasts support for integrated video playback, as demonstrated by a short film playable by selecting the about screen. Bear in mind that <em>Roll'm Up</em> predates the arrival of the SMPEG library, which became Loki Software's solution for playing video clips in their games. Even as late as 2002 video playback could still prove a sore spot under Linux, with BioWare having to forgo Bink video support in their initial Linux port of <em>Neverwinter Nights</em>.</p>
<p>More than anything else, <em>Roll'm Up</em> offered up a reasonable surrogate for any recent Linux converts who still found themselves itching to play a round of <em>3D Pinball for Windows - Space Cadet</em>, the pinball table first created by Maxis which was included with several releases of Microsoft Windows. Curiously enough that game would later be ported over to Linux in 2021 by the process of decompliation and reverse engineering, and today is even playable from within your web browser.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16637601281736798605gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16637601281736798605gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10123018851736798606gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10123018851736798606gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Was there anything else like it for Linux? A few free software alternatives do exist, but they all have their own caveats. The best of these by far is <em>Emilia Pinball</em>, a full 3D engine which allowed for the creation of a handful of pinball tables which even boasts support for hardware acceleration through OpenGL. I was unable to get the 0.3.1 version of <em>Emilia Pinball</em> to build for me from the source tarball, but I was able to install it by rebuilding a source RPM package created for Fedora Core instead.</p>
<p>This release included two tables, although more would be added in later years, with the project still seeing the occasional burst of activity. Also worth noting is <em>Spinball</em>, a finalist from the CS 248 2000 Video Game Competition, in addition to the half baked effort that was <em>Linball</em>, and finally a pinball table created for use with the Crystal Space 3D engine. None of these provide the fantastic level of polish that <em>Roll'm Up</em> offers, allowing the game to still stay relevant for many years after its initial release.</p>
<p>What has not aged as well is the game's function as an advertisement. As well as the expected prominence of the sponsor's brand and product, included was even a system where players could accrue "Dommelsch points" that could be exchanged for the purchase of actual beer from the brewery. While now just being a broken system in the game, the ability to acquire alcohol through a free piece of software does raise eyebrows, especially since I know it got into the hands of children.</p>
<p><em>Roll'm Up</em> also once sported an online high score table which has since been taken down, but an archive of the "Hall of Fame" from June 2001 shows that the top spot was held by one Alexander Babych, who managed to achieve an eye watering score of 894016643 along with 681142181 Dommelsch points. <em>Roll'm Up</em> also features a local multiplayer mode, where as many as four players get to take sequential turns competing for the greatest score.</p>
<p>It is a shame that Lost Boys were never able to uncouple their efforts even more, as I cannot help but feel that the games would shine even brighter if allowed to be taken on their own. Lost Boys would at least later find more honest work, with them creating educational software for the Anne Frank House as well as the Maritime Museum in Rotterdam, along with a few other corporate clients, before the eventual closure of the studio. If only there was a way to disrupt the flow of time.</p>

      <title>DXVK v2.5.3 released with more improvements for Windows games on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Philip Rebohle has released DXVK version 2.5.3 bringing more improvements for this tool that translates Direct3D 8 / 9 / 10 / 11 to Vulkan. <em>DXVK is included as part of Valve's Proton.</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">This release includes a tweak for people using it on Windows too. As noted in the changelog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to address feedback regarding issues with variable refresh rate displays, performance and HDR, exclusive full-screen mode was reintroduced as an option. It remains <strong>disabled</strong> by default, but users can enable it by setting <code class="inline-code">dxvk.allowFse = True</code> in the <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/wiki/Configuration" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">configuration file</a>.</p>
<p>As usual, this option has no effect on non-Windows platforms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why would someone use it on Windows? Especially for older games, it can end up giving a nice performance increase on modern hardware. Don't you just love open source? Everyone can benefit!</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Apart from that here's all the general fixes and improvements:</p>
<blockquote>

<li>Fixed a potential issue with handling <code class="inline-code">NaN</code> tessellation factors in D3D11 hull shaders.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with D3D9 shader validation that would cause valid shader code to be rejected in some situations.

      <title>Minecraft gets new pigs, wildflowers and ambient features in the latest Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mojang have released the first Snapshot (a Beta) of the next Minecraft update, and with it there's a bunch of new features included for explorers.</p>
<p>Snapshot 25w02a includes <em>two</em> new Pig variants for cold and warm areas. It's just a bit of fluff to make animals from different biomes stand out a bit more but still cute. Who doesn't love piggies?</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8584837861736782580gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I quite like the new ambient features they've added in this Snapshot too including falling leaves, leaf litter (decorative block) and wildflowers. The Mojang devs said: "On your next expeditions into forests, dark forests, and wooded badlands, listen out for the crunch of leaves underfoot. Leaf litter makes a rustling sound when you walk through it and can be used to decorate other blocks. In meadows, birch forests, and old growth birch forests, you will instead find wildflowers. These yellow and white flowers can be crafted into dye and have four growth stages that speed up with bonemeal. Place them at different angles to have your builds bloom in different patterns!</p>
<p>On top of that, all the trees in the Overworld will also have matching leaf particles falling from them. "</p>

<p><em>The world should at least feel that little bit more alive.</em></p>
<p>Additionally the Lodestone is getting a simpler recipe to help you find your way home.</p>
<p>See the full <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-25w02a" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a> for more.</p>
<p>I'm really happy to see Minecraft continue to evolve and expand. Microsoft seem to have mostly left Mojang to continue building it as they please with some fun stuff being added over the last few years. And with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/mojang-give-an-update-on-the-future-of-minecraft-development/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changes to how they will do updates</a>, we should hopefully see additions more often now.</p>

      <title>DEFICIT is an exciting looking new FPS with chaotic close-quarters combat</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer ITEM42 recently announced DEFICIT and it's not often I feel I really need a game after seeing a trailer but DEFICIT looks juicy. Not a whole lot has been revealed just yet since it's a fresh announcement. But you will need Proton to play it on Linux, SteamOS and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Designation:</strong> [Carrie]. <strong>Location:</strong> [Project Sidereal]. </p>
<p><strong>Assignment:</strong> under the instruction of your shady benefactor known only as <strong>[The Client]</strong>, you must steal the <strong>[Interpolator]</strong> and use it to escape the sprawling research labs of Project Sidereal.</p>
<p><strong>Project Sidereal</strong> is housed within <strong>Hadrian's Wall</strong>, a maze of concrete warrens and liminal installations policed by the seasoned officers of the <strong>Oversight Taskforce</strong>. </p>
<p>Sneak past them, turn their defensive systems against them or take them head-on: the best path through the manifold dangers of Project Sidereal is yours to choose. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the announcement trailer from January 10th:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_t0WFYYBe1A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/01de99782c67c727fee3c3165040c4fb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_t0WFYYBe1A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Single-player campaign FPS with an emphasis on chaotic close-quarters combat, creatively lethal tools and environmental havoc</li>
<li>Exploration: take the direct route or find the path less travelled through the warrens of Hadrian's Wall</li>
<li>Open wormholes to terrifying frontier realities on valid surfaces to navigate otherwise impassable liminal spaces</li>
<li>Face a medley of adversaries: haphazard Oversight Officers, ruthlessly precise Servitor mechanoids and frangible UAVs</li>
<li>Hammers, screwdrivers, paintcans, bricks, batons, pistols, SMGs: any item makes for a tremendous weapon in the hands of a skilled freelancer</li>
</ul>

      <title>NTSYNC driver for improving Windows games on Linux with Wine / Proton should finally land in Linux kernel 6.14</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After waiting quite a while on it and some rewrites, it looks like the NTSYNC driver code to help Windows games running on Linux will be pulled in and enabled in the Linux kernel. </p>
<p>Developer Elizabeth Figura posted version 7 of the <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20241213193511.457338-1-zfigura@codeweavers.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">kernel patch</a> back in December 2024. As a reminder, here's how they explained it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Wine project emulates the Windows API in user space. One particular part of that API, namely the NT synchronization primitives, have historically been implemented via RPC to a dedicated "kernel" process. However, more recent applications use these APIs more strenuously, and the overhead of RPC has become a bottleneck.</p>
<p>The NT synchronization APIs are too complex to implement on top of existing primitives without sacrificing correctness. Certain operations, such as NtPulseEvent() or the "wait-for-all" mode of NtWaitForMultipleObjects(), require direct control over the underlying wait queue, and implementing a wait queue sufficiently robust for Wine in user space is not possible. This proposed driver, therefore, implements the problematic interfaces directly in the Linux kernel.</p>
<p>This driver was presented at Linux Plumbers Conference 2023. For those further interested in the history of synchronization in Wine and past attempts to solve this problem in user space, a recording of the presentation can be viewed here:</p>

<p></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The performance uplift when using this versus the current upstream Wine <em>could</em> be pretty significant in some games. As Figura noted from the earlier patches, which are from different people on different hardware:</p>

<p>Something to note is that this is aimed at replacing earlier solutions of esync and fsync, which did already improve performance, but this being in the kernel will give the improvements for everyone including eventually plain Wine as well as Valve's Proton.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.14-NTSYNC-Driver-Ready" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Phoronix</a> noted that they expect it will arrive in Linux kernel version 6.14 due out sometime in March. Going by other developer comments, it certainly seem like it will finally land.</p>

      <title>Icewind Dale 2 completable in Infinity Engine remake GemRB, plus Baldur&#39;s Gate II: Enhanced Edition now playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GemRB is a game engine remake of Infinity Engine used in games like Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, Icewind Dale, Baldur's Gate 2: Shadows of Amn and Icewind Dale 2.</p>
<p>The developers behind this open source community project just released GemRB 0.9.4 noting that "It brings two exciting major developments. First, for the first time ever, one is now able to play Icewind Dale 2 from start to end. That marks the last original game to reach this status. BG2EE support has been experimental and is not yet ready for wide use, but as of this release it is now playable enough to welcome testers and power users to bug hunting adventures (manually set GameType to bg2ee). Besides that the release features several improvements to pathfinding, audio and ease-of-use for other projects."</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Own a PlayStation and someone is hogging the TV? Stream it to another device like a Steam Deck or Desktop PC with the cross-platform open source chiaki-ng project. I used to use this a fair bit with my now-retired PlayStation 4 and it really is a fantastic project.</p>

      <title>NonSteamLaunchers tool for installing popular game stores working on better Desktop Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NonSteamLaunchers gained popularity as one of the go-to solutions for installing more stores directly on Steam Deck, and the latest release has begun to improve how it works on normal Desktop Linux too.</p>
<p>It works for the likes of Amazon Games, Battle.net, EA App, Epic Games, GOG Galaxy, Rockstar Games Launcher, Ubisoft Connect and plenty more.</p>
<p>In the v3.9.9 release the developer noted they're "Slowly working towards better compatability for different distros" and the latest changes in that regards sound pretty good including:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-<strong>Slowly working towards better compatability for different distros</strong>: Added some dependency checks for the bash script so that certain distros can know what they need for the NonSteamLaunchers.sh to run. Just simply Zenity, Steam, curl, wget etc. It isnt much but could help, i am still researching and looking to add more compatibility in this area.</p>
<p>-<strong>Fixed UMU shortcuts</strong>: for some reason, UMU shortcuts werent being built correctly since the last update and adding the compat tool and extra commands when they werent supposed to, this has seemingly been fixed now. I reccomend highly that you delete your UMU shortcuts made by NSL and let NSL remake them again! Be sure to open up the Desktop Version and Stop and Restart the scanner.</p>
<p>-<strong>Added Desktop Notifications</strong>: Desktop now has notifications with Icons whenever anything is added to steam!! Neat! This will help in whether knowing anything is added, i should have added this sooner!</p>
<p>-<strong>Added HoYoPlay to the Scanner</strong>: should get your HoYoPlay games, similar to battle.net</p>
<p>-<strong>Added VK Play to the Scanner</strong>: Still needs some work, but you can now scan for your VK Play Games for the most part. Still working on this to make it better but feel free to try!</p>
<p>-<strong>Fixed some logic in the Plugin Updater</strong>: The Desktop Version allows you to also update or install the decky plugin version. Some of the logic was wonky but has now been fixed. It shouldnt update or prompt you unless you need it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Steam Deck plugin for Decky Loader also had some improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-<strong>Reorganized the Decky Plugin</strong>: The Plugin can now know what launchers are installed and are indicated by red and green lights, ive also made pages so that way the list doesnt become long for the launchers and the streaming sites as i continue to add more launchers and websites.</p>
<p>-<strong>Added VK Play to the Plugin and it scanner</strong>: You can now install VK Play straight from the plugin along with with using its scanner for your VKPlay games. This still may need some work but for most games its working.</p>
<p>-<strong>Added HoYoPlay to the scanner</strong>: You can now scan or your HoYoPlay games in the plugin version! yay! Genshin Impact and ZZZ now have their own shorcuts lol :). Its similiar to battle.net because i want you to be able to know if there is an update for their games since they update alot.</p>
<p>-<strong>Fixed UMU shortcuts</strong>: as above, for some reason, UMU shortcuts werent being built correctly since the last update and adding the compat tool and extra commands when they werent supposed to, this has seemingly been fixed now. I reccomend highly that you delete your UMU shortcuts made by NSL and let NSL remake them again! Delete your shorcuts and run the manual scan or auto scan!</p>
<p>-<strong>Also fixed some logic in the NSLPlugin.desktop</strong>: this file was also a bit wonky so i updated its logic, hopefully in both instances they will now allow you to update correctly. If you are absolutely unable to update the plugin for any reason, simple delete the plugin from decky loader and re-run the NSLPlugin.desktop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the Steam Deck plugin, it seems you still need to manually download it since the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/nonsteamlaunchers-gets-booted-from-steam-deck-plugin-store-decky-loader/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">developers between Decky Loader and NonSteamLaunchers previously had a falling out</a>.</p>

      <title>Even with SteamOS coming to more systems Bazzite has no plans to go anywhere</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We recently had the exciting news that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve plans to expand SteamOS onto more devices</a>, starting with supporting more handhelds, which caused plenty of people to be curious about the future of the popular SteamOS-like <a href="https://bazzite.gg/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bazzite</a> Linux.</p>
<p>A lot of people have been waiting for Valve to release SteamOS properly to try Linux because they've seen how good it is on Steam Deck, so it's great to see that begin to be answered. Part of what made Bazzite so popular though is that it's an easy to use SteamOS-like while people were waiting on SteamOS.</p>
<p>The founder of Bazzite, Kyle Gospodnetich, took to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bazzite/comments/1hwqad5/psa_bazzite_isnt_going_anywhere/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Reddit</a> to assure people it's not going anywhere:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been getting asked this a lot so I just wanted to drop a pin to help squash any speculation here.</p>
<p>The Bazzite team is extremely excited for the upcoming expanded launch of Steam OS. Obviously, none of us would be here if not for Valve lighting the way. That being said, we strongly believe Bazzite has a continued role to fill in a post-Steam OS future. A desktop release of Steam OS appears to still be a long way away, and handheld support is almost surely going to be focused on partnered devices first and foremost, and not on the breadth of devices we support today.</p>
<p>Additionally, the first builds of Bazzite were designed for the Steam Deck, which of course runs Steam OS. Bazzite was born out of supporting users with Steam OS in the Steam Deck Discord, and is designed to make up for some of the shortcomings of Steam OS, such as immutability preventing package installs when needed, lack of printing, lack of secure boot, lack of drive encryption, and so on. We also ship a number of helpers and extra packages to make non-Steam gaming easier and faster to get up and running, and are in a position to more quickly work with the community on improvements -- all of which will continue to differentiate us.</p>
<p>It's also important to note that Bazzite is a project and a delivery mechanism, not a product. Developers and users alike can fork, contribute to, and expand Bazzite. This is what makes us Cloud Native and what we're trying to push for the Linux desktop.</p>
<p>We will continue to build Bazzite out long into the future. Thank you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, there you have it, the future of Bazzite continues to be bright. So you can use it without worries.</p>

      <title>Prime Gaming January 11th 2025 edition round-up for Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A little later than I planned, but here's the up to date list of games available on Amazon Prime Gaming, and what compatibility you can expect for Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck. Each week Prime Gaming, part of what you get with a subscription to Amazon Prime, add and remove various games you can claim to <u>keep</u>.</p>
<p>I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"/> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play. Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now.</p>
<p>Here's the current list as of January 11th, 2025:</p>

<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Face your Destiny!<br/>
<br/>
In Andergast, whose inhabitants are considered to be notoriously superstitious, King Efferdan awaits a state visit from high-ranking dignitaries. For centuries the kingdom has been at odds with neighboring Nostria, but now first steps are being undertaken toward a lasting peace. But a plague of crows troubles the king, for the birds are acting with unusual aggressiveness, even attacking humans. Moreover, there are those among the citizens of Andergast who swear that the crows are bringing them dark nightmares. As the belligerent creatures infiltrate even the castle itself, the king seeks a skilled bird catcher - an opportunity for young Geron to prove that the reputation for ill luck that has followed him since childhood is undeserved. Following an audience with the king, the prestigious task is assigned to him. However, not only does his task prove unexpectedly difficult, but it also turns out to be the first step of the greatest adventure of his life, which will lead him to the borders of the charted lands of Aventuria and beyond.<br/>
<br/>

In addition to the popular pen &amp; paper adventures, TDE has also inspired a series of successful computer games.

      <title>Thoroughly charming adventure game The Night of the Rabbit added Linux / Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Night of the Rabbit from Daedalic Entertainment originally released in 2013 and has some pretty glowing reviews, and recently Daedalic gave it a proper Native Linux / Steam Deck version too. Bit of a surprise to see, especially with the Linux version coming with the first update to the game since 2013.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>And, just today, another patch went up to fix various issues.</p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lose yourself in a tale of magic and wonder, where anything is possible and where nothing is quite as it seems: join young Jerry and follow a peculiar white rabbit to the wondrous realm of Mousewood, a land where critters can speak and where mystery abounds.<br/>
<br/>
It is here that Jerry’s dream of being a magician comes true, though a haunting, sinister force casts a long shadow over the forest. Someone offers the residents of Mousewood a deal of their lifetime - tickets to the greatest magic show that the world has ever seen. But the price is steep, as they'll have to stake their most precious possessions and also their lives.<br/>
<br/>
As the shadows grow deeper, the residents of Mousewood have only Jerry to turn to. On an adventure full of laughter and tears, joy and fear, the young boy will face the ultimate trial, leaving behind the world he once knew, and his childhood, too, will become a thing of the past.</p>
<p><strong>Key Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Story-driven exploration/adventure: The Night of the Rabbit was conceived, written and designed by Matthias Kempke, who believes that games design is all about creating new worlds to be explored by players.</li>
<li>Multi-layered story: it starts out in a light-hearted and funny way, but soon shift to a dramatic and thought-provoking tone over the 20 hours of gameplay.</li>
<li>Original character and world design: the animal people who populate the game were originally developed in short stories written by game creator; these stories are included as the in-game bonuses.</li>
</ul>

      <title>VKD3D-Proton bug fix v2.14.1 released for Direct3D 12 to Vulkan translation</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>VKD3D-Proton, the tool that Valve's compatibility layer Proton uses to translate Microsoft Direct3D 12 to Vulkan, has a new bug-fix release out now.</p>
<p>From the release notes for <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/tag/v2.14.1" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">v2.14.1</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a bug-fix release which resolves some regressions introduced in 2.14.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix a crash on start-up which affected GPUs without sparse support. E.g. Intel iGPU or Turnip.<br/>
	Crash could happen even if that GPU was the secondary GPU on the system.</li>
<li>Fix a memory allocation issue affecting NVK.</li>
<li>Fix a CPU performance regression issue affecting Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered on NVIDIA GPUs.<br/>
	This fix might improve CPU performance in other games too, but unverified.</li>
<li>Not a regression fix, but add a <code class="inline-code">no_upload_hvv</code> workaround for Arma Reforger to workaround weird asset loading behavior.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8521167911736520544gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em></p>
<p>The update will eventually land in Proton Experimental and then a stable Proton version, if it's not already in Experimental yet.</p>
<hr/>
<p>If you're curious on how to upgrade, you <em>don't</em> actually need to do anything. Valve's official Proton and GE-Proton use VKD3D-Proton directly, and so they both pull in updates in their new releases. However, for those who like to live on the <em>wild</em> side, you <em>can</em> upgrade the VKD3D-Proton version in Proton yourself. Do it at your own risk.</p>
<p>To do so you can just overwrite the existing VKD3D-Proton files with the release download of the latest VKD3D-Proton. You can find your Proton install <em>somewhere</em> like this (depending on your Steam Library drives):</p>
<p>For Proton 9 and Proton Experimental:</p>
<p><code>path-to-your/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Proton x.x/files</code></p>
<p>Proton 8 and below:</p>
<p><code>path-to-your/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Proton x.x/dist</code></p>
<p><em>Where x.x is whatever Proton version installed you wish to give a new VKD3D-Proton.</em></p>
<p>Inside there you will see "lib" and "lib64", for 32bit and 64bit. Inside each of those, there's a "wine" folder and inside there is a "vkd3d-proton" folder and that's where you replace the d3d12.dll files with new versions. If you mess anything up, one way to ensure it gets reinstalled cleanly is just to remove the "/dist" or "/files" folder and verify the files in Steam.</p>

      <title>Mecha Comet looks like a fun little modular Linux handheld</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another handheld! Although not a gaming handheld like you may have been thinking. The Mecha Comet is a small handheld modular Linux computer around the size of a phone. For GamingOnLinux readers who love tinkering, it looks like quite a fun little device.</p>
<p>Powered by Mechanix OS (Debian Linux based) it has an interesting modular snap-on front-face that allows you to change the inputs on the device. Extensions for the front include a gamepad, keyboard and GPIO (general-purpose input/output) for you to make your own.</p>

<p>For the operating system you get full access to Debian packages, and of course people can port it over to whatever distro they like. Their team said their Mechanix Shell is built in rust and supports GPU rendering on Wayland, plus they built an open source UI framework to build on top of their shell. The hardware is designed to be easy to repair and extend too.</p>

      <title>System76&#39;s COSMIC Alpha 5 is here with a new media player, VRR improvements and lots of fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hardware vendor System76 continue building up their new Linux desktop environment, COSMIC, with a fifth alpha now available for testing. Their Rust-based desktop environment is primarily being made for their own Linux distribution Pop!_OS, but with proper support for users on other distributions too.</p>
<p>The first big addition is the new COSMIC Media Player that's now the default, which uses Vulkan for rendering and VAAPI for decoding (where available) for efficient video playback. Cycling through apps via Alt+Tab will go through in the order they were last active, there's improvements to Variable Refresh Rate (VRR), a new User Settings page and you can open links in the COSMIC Terminal.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7170840511736510029gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7170840511736510029gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - COSMIC Alpha 5: showing user settings, video player and Firefox.</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Various other improvements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>New files can now be saved to a new folder.</li>
<li>Ability to rename files using file search.</li>
<li>Show Hidden Files toggle no longer resets after selecting Show Details.</li>
<li>The calendar applet now reflects time zone changes.</li>
<li>Added libnvidia-egl-wayland1 to prevent Steam hanging and XWayland performance.</li>
<li>Support for Linux kernel 6.12.</li>
<li>Lots of bug fixes.</li>

      <title>Terry Cavanagh dev of VVVVVV / Super Hexagon announced a collection of experimental games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Terry's Other Games is coming in February, pulling together a bunch of games Cavanagh has developed over the last 20 years or so updated for modern platforms. Cavanagh previously developed VVVVVV, Super Hexagon and my favourite Dicey Dungeons.</p>
<p>What you get is a little look behind the curtain of various ideas. Some big, some small and plenty of weird.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LArYzU3FqPQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f85662e5ede5f6cb38ca9b7504f167a3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LArYzU3FqPQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello there! I'm Terry Cavanagh, and I'm a game designer. Maybe you've played some of my games before? I made the C64-inspired gravity-flipping platformer VVVVVV, the minimal action game Super Hexagon, and the dice placement dungeon crawler Dicey Dungeons.</p>
<p>Those are my commercial releases. But I've been making games since I was a kid, and along the way I've worked on a lot of stuff! Most of these games are very hard to get running nowadays, even some of the ones that are only a few years old - computers change and things slowly break.</p>
<p>Making these other games has always been a really important part of how I work, and they include some of my very favourite projects. So I decided to bring some of the best of them together in one big easy-to-play collection, as "Terry's Other Games"! It's a little window into what making indie games has been like for me, from where I started to where I am now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could be fun if you like your more experimental stuff.</p>

      <title>Google and The Linux Foundation team up for &#39;Supporters of Chromium-based Browsers&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Google together with The Linux Foundation have announced Supporters of Chromium-based Browsers, a new initiative to fund future development of the entire Chromium ecosystem. It already has a few big names joining in including Google, Meta, Microsoft and Opera.</p>
<p>"With the launch of the Supporters of Chromium-Based Browsers, we are taking another step forward in empowering the open source community," said Jim Zemlin, executive director of the Linux Foundation. "This project will provide much-needed funding and development support for open development of projects within the Chromium ecosystem."</p>
<p>The idea is to provide what they call a "neutral space" where various industry leaders and developers can work together to support various Chromium related projects and collaborate. The Linux Foundation say it will follow an "open governance model" that they've successfully established with other initiatives.</p>
<p>According to Google, their developers accounted for around 94% of Chromium code commits in 2024. They have "no intention of reducing this investment" but the initiative will help contribute "towards the health of the Chromium ecosystem and financially support a community of developers who want to contribute to the project, encouraging widespread support and continued technological progress for Chromium embedders".</p>
<p>What they're not saying though is that Google have likely done this partnership due to the US Department of Justice (DOJ)'s <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp81ppr3l9go" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">demands</a> for Google to sell off Chrome. A decision on which is supposed to be reached by the Summer this year. This is quite probably a step towards uncoupling the future of Chrome and Chromium from being a mostly-Google thing in preparation for whatever happens there.</p>
<p>Considering how Chrome has close to 70% of the browser market globally (Statcounter), along with the Chromium Embedded Framework being everywhere, this is a good thing no matter what in my opinion to have more companies and people get a proper say in the future of the web.</p>

      <title>Sid Meier&#39;s Civilization VII is Steam Deck Verified with the Linux version ahead of release on February 11</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Quite a nice surprise! Sid Meier's Civilization VII from Firaxis Games / 2K has been given the green tick of approval from Valve, as it's now <img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Steam Deck Verified ahead of release.</p>
<p>This verification was done on the Native Linux version too, so we're looking good to go for the February 11th release. Or, February 6th, if you have Advanced Access from one of the more expensive editions.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15557439461736447708gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The developers have been giving out quite a lot more detail on it recently through various first-look videos and deeper dive blog-style posts. Like the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1295660/view/508443269496045927" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Diplomacy, Influence, &amp; Trade post</a> on January 8th where it all sounds really interesting. The changes to the Diplomacy mechanic compared with the previous iteration sounds fun, which is less about what you can offer and more about your overall relationship with a new Influence currency. You get various actions that require this Influence currency including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Endeavors</strong>: These are mutually beneficial actions between two empires. For example, you can initiate a "Research Collaboration" request, giving both players Science per turn.</li>
<li><strong>Sanctions</strong>: These are negative actions against another empire. If you choose to "Hinder Military Production," you decrease the other player's military production output (and incur a Relationship penalty).</li>
<li><strong>Treaties</strong>: Longer-lasting decisions that have utility, such as a treaty to have "Open Borders" or to "Improve Trade Relations."</li>
<li><strong>Espionage</strong>: High-risk, high-reward actions that give you a bonus or inflict a negative effect on another empire, with a chance for your actions to be revealed. Getting caught engaging in espionage reduces your relation with your target and decreases how much Influence you earn for a time. An example of this is to "Steal Technology."</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a lot of detail on the ins and outs of it that's worth a read!</p>
<p><em>If you don't hear from me after February 11th, I've probably got sucked a bit too much into Civilization VII.</em></p>
<p>Will you be picking it up? Have you pre-ordered? Let me know in the comments.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems like making a dock for handheld gaming PCs is now some rite of passage for accessory and hardware vendors, as even Razer have jumped in now with the aptly named Razer Handheld Dock Chroma.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">It even has quite a reasonable price, especially when compared with the official Steam Deck Dock from Valve, but there's plenty others about that are much cheaper. For $79.99 / €89.99 you'll get:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>6-in-1 Connectivity:</strong> Equipped with a gigabit ethernet port, multiple USB connections, and HDMI out, enabling a comprehensive gaming setup.</li>
<li><strong>100W Power Passthrough:</strong> Designed to charge devices quickly, keeping them ready for action at any moment.</li>
<li><strong>Rugged </strong><strong>Portable Design:</strong> Constructed from durable aluminum, the dock is foldable for easy transportation.</li>
<li><strong>Razer Chroma RGB Lighting:</strong> Features customizable RGB lighting options for added flair.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19974971561736432592gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19974971561736432592gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17121808031736432593gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17121808031736432593gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The backing stand hinge is adjustable on the angle and can fold right down making it quite portable, and the RGB lighting is customizable via a dedicated hardware button so no need for extra software.</p>
<p>My main concern is the cooling situation, that high stand <em>might</em> get in the way of fan intakes, hopefully they've thought of that though. I remember some earlier docks I tried with the Steam Deck covered a lot of the intake. Other than that, looks quite nice!</p>
<p>It releases January 30th.</p>

      <title>Can 2025 please be the year more games add Text and UI Scaling</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I get it, you worked hard for hours and days and weeks on your incredibly cool-looking interface for your game. You made it so all the text perfectly lines up everywhere and picked a slick looking font, but it's all too darn small.</p>
<p>Even worse when it's some pixel font. Again, I get it, I do understand the <em>why</em>. You think it looks cool and it fits in with the theme of the game, and yes it does <em>look</em> cool but not only is it small but it becomes pretty <em>terrible</em> to actually read.</p>
<p>So, I am begging you, all of you game developers making something, can we set 2025 as the year you truly think about and actually add in some text and interface scaling? And if you use a pixel style font, <em>always</em> include an alternative clear font.</p>
<p>It's bad enough when some games text is so small I'm physically pulling myself closer to my PC monitor, which I'm already quite close to, but massively worse when playing on a smaller handheld screen. From the Steam Deck to the ASUS ROG Ally and all the others, it's a big problem. Made even worse when you decide to dock your handheld to a TV or monitor (or a living room PC), where you're expecting to sit back and relax a bit, I can't read a damn thing in a lot of games when doing that.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17328879551736431676gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Game devs, I'm <em>begging</em> you, please add text and interface scaling into your games.</p>
<p>While we're at it, if your game interface has transparency on it, please (begging you again) add an option to remove this with a solid background. I want to be able to read all the cool stuff your teams worked hard on, stop making it even more difficult again.</p>
<p>Sure, my eyesight is not exactly the best, but I do religiously wear my glasses and with them on I do have rather clear vision (and I do regular check-ups to ensure my glasses are correct too — I like to see in HD). This is a <em>huge</em> accessibility problem in gaming. Think about this too: add into it the ageing population, with more and more older folks continuing to play games, this situation is only going to get worse as the years go on.</p>
<p>It's something I hope more game reviewers focus on too, or at least actually mention in every review if a game has any scaling, something that seems to be quite rarely mentioned. At least players can begin to make more informed decisions. Heck, it would be lovely if stores (hi Valve / Steam) had a way to show if a game has accessibility options for developers to fill out. Things like that would really be ideal, and put more of a focus on it for developers to actually think about it more too.</p>

      <title>Freejam studio closing with Robocraft and Robocraft 2 shutting down</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>End of an era for another game studio, as Freejam - developers of Robocraft and the in-development Robocraft 2 - are closing and so both games will also be shut down.</p>
<p>Robocraft is a online PvP battle arena where you customize vehicles and build them block-by-block. It was quite popular when it originally released but over the years the players numbers saw a steady decline. Since mid-2020 it saw less than 1,000 concurrent players max each day and only continued to lose players.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19528115681736424197gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Robocraft</em></p>
<p>The announcement was shared in their <a href="https://discord.com/channels/194767680849313792/194767680849313792/1326527159862300717" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Discord</a>, here's what they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s with a heavy heart that we have to tell you all that we’re ceasing production on Robocraft 2 and closing Freejam as a studio. With the current market conditions and the server costs required to keep a game like RC2 running, we’re simply unable to launch or sustain development. We will spend some time sunsetting both Robocraft 1 and 2, as well as Cardlife over the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Freejam has been a family to all of us, and you have been part of that. Your feedback and thoughts have always driven us forward, but beyond this, the community’s passion is a massive part of what has made working at Freejam such a pleasure.</p>
<p>We especially want to recognise all of the Admins and Moderators who have helped us over the years, ensuring that the community and the game is a welcome place for everyone. Your time, energy, support and so, so much patience has made a world of difference.</p>
<p>From all of us at Freejam, thank you so much for joining us on this journey.</p>

      <title>Bazzite the popular SteamOS-like Linux gets expanded NVIDIA support in Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're wanting something similar to SteamOS right now that has much wider hardware support for your gaming handhelds like the Lenovo Legion Go, ASUS ROG Ally, GPD, Ayaneo or even your laptop / desktop then Bazzite is likely one of the best choices.</p>
<p>And now for desktop / laptop users with NVIDIA GPUs, you can try out the latest Bazzite Beta which finally includes expanded support for the Steam Deck-like Gaming Mode (which uses Steam's newer Big Picture Mode).</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Noted in an <a href="https://universal-blue.discourse.group/t/new-bazzite-deck-nvidia-images/6139" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> Bazzite creator Kyle Gospodnetich mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As of today, bazzite-deck-nvidia is now available as a beta thanks to improvements in the latest Nvidia drivers. While this is very clearly not a stable experience everyone should jump on, this should at least give our users something to play with and a tool to help report the remaining bugs to Nvidia.</p>
<p>Some important caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most bugs present here cannot be fixed by us, please do not report them to us if they’re already known issues. See our Discord and/or GitHub issue tracker.</li>
<li>This will not allow Nvidia eGPUs on handhelds. Due to issues caused by installing the Nvidia drivers this support most likely won’t come until NVK is ready to replace the proprietary driver.</li>
<li>Only nvidia-open will be supported by these images. That means no GTX 9xx or 10xx support.</li>
<li>If the UI is laggy, go into desktop mode and open steam settings in the desktop client and make sure <code class="inline-code">Enable GPU accelerated rendering in web views</code> is enabled in the interface settings (enabling this can cause graphical glitches in the steam UI in desktop, Big Picture Mode and gamemode), then return to gamemode.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm seriously tempted to acquire another handheld just so I can test stuff like Bazzite on it. I don't want to mess with the SteamOS install on my Steam Deck since it's properly official and supported. Perhaps I should look into one.</p>

      <title>Raspberry Pi 5 gets a 16GB model now on sale</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Raspberry Pi 5 has expanded with a new 16GB edition joining the 2GB, 4GB and 8GB models for those who need that extra bit of room. Ready for you to run more intensive applications, games and Linux distributions.</p>
<p>It's available for around $120 / £114.90 depending on where you buy it from.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15878670771736421814gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Talking a little on why they did this model now:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re continually surprised by the uses that people find for our hardware. Many of these fit into 8GB (or even 2GB) of SDRAM, but the threefold step up in performance between Raspberry Pi 4 and Raspberry Pi 5 opens up use cases like large language models and computational fluid dynamics, which benefit from having more storage per core. And while Raspberry Pi OS has been tuned to have low base memory requirements, heavyweight distributions like Ubuntu benefit from additional memory capacity for desktop use cases.</p>
<p>The optimised D0 stepping of the Broadcom BCM2712 application processor includes support for memories larger than 8GB. And our friends at Micron were able to offer us a single package containing eight of their 16Gbit LPDDR4X die, making a 16GB product feasible for the first time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally they've announced the new Carbon Removal Credits system, where you can pay $4 giving you "the option to mitigate the emissions associated with the manufacture and disposal of a modern Raspberry Pi" which they're doing in partnership with <a href="https://un-do.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">UNDO</a>.</p>

      <title>Maze Mice from the dev of Luck Be a Landlord blends maze-running, time-freezing and bullet heaven together</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>TrampolineTales developer of the popular Luck be a Landlord slot machine deck-builder just announced Maze Mice and it really sounds unique.</p>
<p>You've played maze-runners before, and no doubt a good few bullet heaven games that spawned from Vampire Survivors and games that stop time until you move right? Well, this combines all of them together. If you're after something quite different, that allows you to go at your own pace thanks to the time-stopping, this one might be for you.</p>
<p>“Following Luck Be a Landlord, I hope players will rejoin me on this new adventure with Maze Mice,” said Dan DiIorio, lead developer and founder of TrampolineTales. “I wanted to make a new kind of roguelike bullet heaven that stayed both familiar and welcoming. The cat-and-mouse chase keeps things recognizable, and the time-stopping twist equalizes the playing field for all players!”</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wQaFUv0UADI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5003cd2df48c877eb819e574d38f4a98.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wQaFUv0UADI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Navigate the labyrinthian nooks and crannies of a once-cozy attic as a tiny mouse while staying one paw ahead of ferocious felines. Luckily, in this attic, time only moves when you move! Stand still to stop time, giving the resilient rodent ample opportunity to sketch the safest route ahead. Hoard precious upgrades hidden around each winding twist and turn to stay alive. </p>
<p>Scramble toward safety and collect upgrade dots to gain experience and unlock powerful upgrades. Bundle up in a Tiny Sweater for extra health, turn on the Vacuum to attract nearby items (cheese, please!), and gobble up Popcorn to temporarily avoid damage. Deploy Flame Trails, Knitting Needles, Hairballs, and other pesky provisions to send cats screeching! </p>
<p>Stay nimble to maneuver through the attic’s tricky side entrances, plotting the perfect path to the nearest dots. Escape the clutching claws of different kinds of felines, including curious Chasers and ghostly Phasers. Survive the chaos with tiny whiskers intact, or get caught and take a trip to the Big Mouse House in the sky.</p>
<p>Unlock permanent upgrades and add an adorable array of animal characters to the roster, including mice, rabbits, and guinea pigs, each with their own starting upgrades. Dash through a retro, top-down pixelated world rife with charming details and sway to the sounds of a tail-swishing soundtrack from Vincent Colavita, composer of Luck be a Landlord.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not particularly sold on the art style but like a lot of games I've played over the last few years, the gameplay might be enough to sucker me in for some hours.</p>
<p>Maze Mice will be available on Steam sometime in 2025. Languages supported include: English, French, Italian, German, Spanish - Spain, Danish, Portuguese - Brazil, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Spanish - Latin America, Traditional Chinese, Portuguese - Portugal, Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai, and Arabic. </p>

      <title>OrangePi Neo gaming handheld with Manjaro Linux now due out in Q1 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While announcements on the OrangePi Neo gaming handheld that will ship with Manjaro Linux have been a bit quiet lately, it's still coming and they've updated their launch plan for it to be available in Q1 2025.</p>
<p>The Manjaro Linux team haven't been doing big standalone progress announcements, but they have been regularly updating a dedicated post on their Discourse Forum.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2152255881736346854gol1.png"/></p>
<p>The latest <a href="https://forum.manjaro.org/t/development-q-a-orangepi-neo-01/156450/85" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reply</a> from Manjaro Linux Project Lead, Philip Müller, was posted <em>early</em> December 2024 noting these hardware tasks are currently being worked on:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>To confirm the heat dissipation components,</li>
<li>Adjusted and optimized screen and other components are assembled into the whole machine for verification and confirmation,</li>
<li>Plan to change the thin glass cover plate,</li>
<li>Complete machine to be assembled, verification test,</li>
<li>The structure of the partially modified mold is to be verified.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://forum.manjaro.org/t/development-q-a-orangepi-neo-01/156450" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">main post</a> was also updated at the <em>end</em> of December 2024 to note it's planned to ship globally, sometime in "Q1 2025", so we should see it before the end of March 2025. Müller also added to the post to note the last few weeks of 2024 they were expecting to see these improvements to the unit from their hardware partners at OrangePi:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Update the battery to support 1C fast charging. The battery will still be 50Wh.</li>
<li>A new power adapter to support 1C fast charging will be added.</li>
<li>Optimize sound quality and sound volume of the Speakers</li>
<li>Further optimizations to overall thermal design of the device. This will include:
	<ul>
<li>optimizing the structure to ensure better heat dissipation.</li>
<li>lower FAN noise.</li>
<li>cooler surface temperatures on touchscreen and chassis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>On the software side Müller noted lots of work was going into optimising KDE Plasma 6.2 for the OrangePi Neo, along with various code being upstreamed to the Linux kernel.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Current expected pricing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Base Model 7840u 16GB / 512GB will be 499$ or 4099 CNY.</li>
<li>Base Model 8840u 16GB / 512GB will be 599$ or 4499 CNY.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://neo.manjaro.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">official page</a> for it is a bit outdated, as it doesn't even list the 8840u model yet.</p>
<p>What compatibility to expect from it? Well it's a Linux device so it will run games in a similar way to the Steam Deck. Either Native Linux games, or Windows games via Valve's compatibility layer <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>
<p>Along with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/lenovo-legion-go-s-with-valves-steamos-is-official-expected-to-launch-in-may/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lenovo Legion Go S with SteamOS</a>, and Valve announcing an <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">upcoming SteamOS Beta for more handhelds</a>, it's a busy year for Linux gaming.</p>

      <title>Funded in 5 minutes - the open source modular mini computer &#39;Pilet&#39; is on Kickstarter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Funded within 5 minutes, soulscircuit are clearly onto a winner here with their upcoming Pilet open source modular mini computers powered by the Raspberry Pi 5.</p>
<p>Something I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/i-will-admit-i-had-a-nerdgasm-at-the-portable-pilet-mini-consoles-from-soulscircuit/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">covered here on GamingOnLinux back in early December</a>, because they really do look like a lot of fun. Even though I have no need, I really want one! Coming in two different form factors there's the Pilet 5 and Pilet 7. They both share similar internals, it's mainly about the screen size for what you wish to do with it. The Pilet 5 is more like an all-in-one PC console while the Pilet 7 is more like a tablet.</p>
<p>As they explain: "Pilet is a retro-futuristic, open-source mini-computer powered by the Raspberry Pi 5. With 7-hour battery life and fully modifiable hardware and software, it's built for tinkerers, creatives, learners, and coders who want total freedom. Escape the limitations of closed devices and locked-down systems and bring the fun back into computing."</p>
<p>Check out their video on it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Xe-sZGGoloA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/19d8d13c9d16f0341903630a4e684e92.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Xe-sZGGoloA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Raspberry Pi 5: Pilet is powered by the latest Raspberry Pi 5, bringing performance boost alongside advanced features like PCIe and NVMe support.</li>
<li>Long battery-life: With a seven-hour battery life, you're free to take your Raspberry Pi projects anywhere, no longer bound to the desk.</li>
<li>Open Source: Unlike modern iOS/Android tablets and computers that are closed and offer no room for hardware customization, Pilet runs on open-source hardware and software, giving you full control. After launch, we’ll release full schematics, PCB files, CAD files, and source code—giving you the freedom to tweak and modify both the hardware and software.</li>
<li>Simple, Practical Design: We've embraced the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle to minimize unnecessary complexity. No extra drivers or hardware hassles—just straightforward, 3D-printable, and fully customizable components.</li>
<li>Modularity: Pilet’s modular design encourages creativity. You can design and build your own modules, whether it's for cameras, sensors, or actuators. We’re also working on modules like LTE and NVMe.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Have a look on the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/soulscircuit/pilet-opensource-modular-portable-mini-computer/description" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign</a>. At time of writing the campaign is fully funded and is pulling in funds rapidly approaching £100K. The minimum pledge for the hardware is about £162 which gets you the Pilet 7, or about £173 for the Pilet 5.</p>

      <title>Deadlock from Valve drops fixed two-week update cycle to move onto larger updates</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While developers at Valve continue building up the invite-only Deadlock, their next-generation MOBA, they're changing up how they do updates for the game.</p>
<p>In an announcement in the official Discord a developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As we start 2025 we are going to be adjusting our update schedule to help improve our development process. While it was very helpful for us in the beginning, we've found that our fixed two-week cycle has made it more difficult for us to iterate on certain types of changes internally, as well as sometimes not giving enough time for the changes themselves to settle externally before the next update came around.</p>
<p>Going forward, major patches will no longer be on a fixed schedule. These patches will be larger than before, albeit a little bit more spaced out, and hotfixes will continue to be released as needed. We look forward to fleshing out the game in the new year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems like a perfectly sane idea. Having such a short set schedule must have been pretty limiting for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2696217871736338600gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Deadlock</em></p>
<p>Hopefully at some point during 2025 we'll see Deadlock get a proper public release. As right now you still need to be invited by someone who already has access on Steam. Even so, it's still doing really well with a peak of 18,389 concurrent players in the last 24 hours.</p>

      <title>Heroes of Might and Magic II open source game engine fheroes2 v1.1.5 released</title>
      <author>fheroes2</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dear supporters of the fheroes2 project and fans of Heroes of Might and Magic II! We are excited to announce the release of the latest version of the fheroes2 engine - <a href="https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2/releases/tag/1.1.5" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>1.1.5</strong></a>! This update introduces a variety of exciting changes and new content. Let's dive into the details!<br/>
<br/>
The last release includes important changes to the game’s <strong>passability rules</strong>. The team has fixed several places where passability was incorrectly set for certain objects. These improvements bring the logic even closer to the original game and may even unblock specific scenarios during gameplay. <em>Please note: to apply these changes, you’ll need to start a new game on the same map.</em></p>
<p>We constantly improve the overall gaming experience. In this release, we have added a small but valuable feature for map creators and touchscreen users: <strong>Virtual Numpad support</strong>. You can now input desired numbers without having to endlessly click on arrows - making the process much smoother and more intuitive.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16895362751736336909gol1.png"/></p>
<p>This update also brings enhancements to the <strong>AI</strong>. We have improved the AI's castle reinforcement logic, the logic for <strong>monsters evading attacks</strong>, refined the <strong>retreat behavior for archers</strong>, and fixed an issue with incorrectly estimated attack values for hypnotized monsters. These incremental improvements make the <strong>AI</strong> smarter without compromising performance or logic.<br/>
<br/>
The team has added the ability to <strong>edit multiple Adventure Map action objects</strong> in the Editor. This includes editing <strong>spells</strong> in Shrines and Pyramids, configuring <strong>resource amounts</strong>, and selecting which <strong>skills</strong> appear in the Witch's Hut. These improvements give map makers much greater control, enabling them to create unique maps tailored to their vision.</p>
<p><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3651093731736336927gol1.png"/><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12939051281736336937gol1.png"/><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9630347431736336959gol1.png"/><br/>
<br/>
As we look to the future, we are laying the groundwork for a major expansion. With the help of an artist, this release introduces a <strong>new variants</strong> of the <strong>Lean-To</strong> object, <strong>Stone Liths</strong> and <strong>Observation Towers</strong> marking the beginning of new content additions. Adding more variety to these objects allows map makers to craft maps with distinctive landscapes and reduces repetitive object usage, enhancing overall creativity.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21018545121736336996gol1.png"/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7489495061736337051gol1.png"/><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Besides the Editor changes the team has added extra in-game information for touch devices, expanded translation support, and refined UI elements across various windows.<br/>
<br/>
<em>The upcoming Resurrection expansion, based on a future campaign, requires not only development work but also significant contributions from artists, UX designers, composers, and map creators. To move forward with this, we will be updating our documentation in the coming weeks to outline clear tasks and goals. This effort will help drive the project forward and provide an even better experience for players. If you are interested in contributing or collaborating, we encourage you to reach out to us on social media.</em><br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for your continued support. We hope you enjoy the latest version of the engine!</p>

      <title>Monster Hunter Wilds will have two more open Beta test dates in February</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Giving you a chance to see how well Monster Hunter Wilds will run on your Steam Deck or Desktop Linux system, there's going to be two more open Beta tests during February.</p>
<p>This new Beta will keep everything from the first which includes Character Creation, Story Trial and a Doshaguma Hunt. But it will also add in hunting for a returning monster from the series Gypceros. They say other new content will be revealed later. For participating you'll be gifted an "Open Beta Test Bonus Pendant" and a "OBT 2 Bonus Item Pack". You can even use save data from the first open Beta. Don't expect progress to carry over to the full game though.</p>
<p>Announced today the dates are (times are approximate and may change):</p>
<ul>
<li>February 6th 2025 7:00pm - February 9th, 2025 6:59 pm (Pacific Time)</li>
<li>February 13th, 2025 7:00 pm - February 16th, 2025 6:59 pm (Pacific Time)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>In UTC time they start 3am the following day (Feb 7th, Feb 14th).</em></p>

      <title>SMITE 2 gets a free to play launch date for January</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Titan Forge Games have announced that SMITE 2 is going free to play on January 14, after their paid-for Early Access period comes to a close. The game will still be in Early Access just open for everyone. It currently has a Steam Deck Playable rating, and appears to work well on Desktop Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The announcement was short and to the point simply noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SMITE 2 is going FREE TO PLAY on January 14!</p>
<ul>
<li>45 Gods</li>
<li>Joust &amp; Duel</li>
<li>Assault Alpha</li>
<li>and SO MUCH MORE!</li>
</ul>
<p>Mark your calendars and get ready to enter into the next era of the Battleground of the Gods!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would have thought they would be making a bigger splash about it, not even a new trailer or anything. It probably hasn't hit the level the publisher Hi-Rez Studios was hoping for. It only usually regularly seeing around 1,600 concurrent players, which is tiny for a MOBA. Perhaps the free to play release will see it surge.</p>
<p>Most recent update trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="T_2R-P53Yfs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e74a281e958d06cf2c9bb8e1e4aa52b7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/T_2R-P53Yfs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it: "SMITE 2 is the easiest MOBA to start playing, with features like auto-build and auto-level so you focus on fighting. But the full depth of MOBA gameplay awaits, letting you find your own path to victory across item building, map control, tactical brilliance, or simply outplaying your foes. Compete in a variety of game modes, including Ranked, where you’ll climb the leaderboards and become a true god in the SMITE 2 community."</p>

      <title>Challenging Chess-like roguelike Passant will have full Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Passant: A Chess Roguelike is an upcoming Chess-like roguelike that will challenge your brain, and it's going to have full Steam Deck support at release.</p>
<p>This is definitely not normal Chess by any sense of the word normal. The rules can be twisted in your favour and special unique pieces can be used to change the whole game. In Passant you build your board by earning powerful pieces with unique rules, items to change the tide of battle, and badges which can synergise with your board to deliver victory. Beat match after match of increasing difficulty until you can beat the final boss and become a grandmaster.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="KddOdIhA6WA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/adc70579c637613137572ce533e9ac3b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/KddOdIhA6WA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Writing in an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/3353100/announcements/detail/523079515133445215" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> on Steam the developer said: "This is an announcement that Passant will fully support the Steam Deck. I've built the game from the ground up to work on the steam deck and controllers and I've been mainly testing the game this way."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">How it expands Chess:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unique pieces, such as the Archbishop, Dragon Knight, Dragon King and more!</li>
<li>Rule changes, such as Atomic Chess, Reflecting Bishops and Zombie Pawns.</li>
<li>Items that can be used once to give you an advantage, such as freezing a piece, demoting a piece to a pawn, or promoting one of yours to a queen!</li>
</ul>
<p>It makes use of the open source Fairy-Stockfish chess variant engine to ensure you get a good challenge.</p>

      <title>Horse Runner DX is a wholesome endless-runner where you play as a herd of different horses</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Taking elements from the likes of Alto's Adventure, BIT.TRIP RUNNER, Dino Run, Canabalt and others we have a new wholesome looking endless-runner with a twist in Horse Runner DX. Made with MonoGame, it has Native Linux support and fully supports the Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>Here you're not just controlling on character, but a herd that you build up as you go. Each of them acts like an extra life for you and they all have different power-ups that will change your run. It's a pretty clever little casual game. And worth a look if you're after something a bit more laid-back.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mG9NP7nMlhk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1e19ad15a77b2f5f9e11bd065289ad2f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mG9NP7nMlhk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking about Steam Deck support the developer said: "The game has been extensively tested on the Steam Deck, runs perfectly and looks simply beautiful on the deck's screen. The graphics are pixel-perfect and run at a stable 60 FPS. Input via the integrated Steam Deck Controller is wonderfully responsive. All input methods are also supported on the Steam Deck, and you can switch between them at any time while playing."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Simple &amp; Tight Controls - The simple one-button controls are super accessible and let you perform perfectly timed jumps. You control the lead horse, all other horses follow you automatically.</li>
<li>Herd-Building - After each level, choose an additional horse to join your herd. Each horse functions like an extra life and has a specific power-up that changes the gameplay.</li>
<li>Tricky Challenges - Complete challenges to earn rewards and push your platforming and strategy skills to the limit. At first the challenges are simple and easy to complete, later ones require good planning.</li>
<li>Cute Pixel Art Graphics - Feel like you're back in the old days - with honest, straightforward gameplay, colorful, sharp pixel graphics, and if you want, even the look of an old TV.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I wasn't particularly sold on the idea originally myself. However, this is definitely a don't knock it until you've tried it type of game. </p>
<p>A demo is available on Steam.</p>

      <title>Valve confirms a public beta of SteamOS is coming as &#39;SteamOS expands beyond Steam Deck&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the announcement of the<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/lenovo-legion-go-s-with-valves-steamos-is-official-expected-to-launch-in-may/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Lenovo Legion Go S as the first third-party SteamOS device</a>, Valve have now <em>officially</em> announced that SteamOS Linux is expanding beyond the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Exciting times ahead, as a great many people have been wanting Valve to finally release a proper SteamOS Linux download. And so, Valve will answer the calls, with a Beta.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8447743031736277232gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>As Valve said in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/529834914570306831" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With Lenovo's announcement at CES 2025 of the Lenovo Legion Go S, we are pleased to share that their "Powered by SteamOS" model is the first handheld officially licensed to ship with Valve's SteamOS. We built this operating system to provide a seamless user experience optimized for gaming, while retaining access to the power and flexibility of a PC. SteamOS is the same operating system we run on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Deck</a>, and the team is making updates to ensure it fully supports the Lenovo Legion Go S and provides the same seamless experience customers expect.</p>
<p>In addition, the same work that we are doing to support the Lenovo Legion Go S will improve compatibility with other handhelds. Ahead of Legion Go S shipping, <strong>we will be shipping a beta of SteamOS which should improve the experience on other handhelds</strong><strong>, and users can download and test this themselves</strong>. And of course we'll continue adding support and improving the experience with future releases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Emphasis ours.</em></p>
<p><strong>Update 21:05</strong>: after publishing, Valve tweaked the above quoted text (I've corrected the quote). It <em>originally</em> said "we will be shipping a beta of SteamOS which should improve the experience on other <strong>devices</strong>" but they've now changed the ending to say "other <strong>handhelds</strong>". <em>Clearly right now they're trying to keep expectations a little in check.</em></p>
<p>The rest of the post is an FAQ with details most people who have a followed SteamOS, Linux and the Steam Deck will already know. Like how you have a full desktop mode where you can install anything — including other stores.</p>
<p>People have long joked about the "Year of the Linux Desktop", and while this might not be it exactly, 2025 is truly shaping up to be a really transformative year for Linux gaming as a whole. There's a great many Linux distributions out there, some a bit similar to SteamOS (like the popular Bazzite), but having Valve put out SteamOS themselves is sure to hook a few more people in to try it out. Now we just need that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/new-steam-controller-2-and-vr-controller-designs-got-leaked/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Controller 2</a> to appear…</p>
<p>If you missed it, we also have the announcement that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/geforce-now-is-getting-full-steam-deck-support-with-a-native-app/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GeForce NOW is getting full Steam Deck support with a native app</a>, hopefully one that's not locked to the Deck, so all SteamOS installs can make proper use of it.</p>
<p>Now I'm even more hopeful that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/steamos-moving-from-steam-deck-to-more-handhelds-gives-me-hope-for-better-anti-cheat-compatibility/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the anti-cheat problem will get corrected</a> so games will stop blocking Linux platforms. Remember to follow <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our new anti-cheat page</a> for compatibility. It will also be interesting to see how the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Linux user share on Steam</a> changes over time with this.</p>
<p>Valve also did a tiny <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> Experimental update today (January 7th) that includes a one-line fix that doesn't need a whole article: "Fixed Killsquad freezing on character selection screen". Seems like a lot more people are about to find out just how good Proton is at running Windows games on Linux systems soon.</p>
<p>Be sure to follow our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/SteamOS/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS tag</a> (there's an RSS feed on all tags too!) to keep up with the latest.</p>
