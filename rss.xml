      <title>Smash everything with your balls in BALL x PIT releasing October 15</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you have the balls to go deep into a bottomless pit? Well, you'll find out on October 15 when fast-paced fantasy roguelite BALL x PIT releases.</p>
<p>BALL x PIT is one of my favourites that I played during the last Steam Next Fest, with it's delicious fast-paced combat that sort-of blends together Arkanoid / Breakout with Vampire Survivor like elements into something truly weird and challenging. Add to that the mini city-building aspect to it and there's a lot to like about it and I can't wait to play more of it. I certainly wasn't alone in loving it, as it was actually the 12th most-played demo from the entire Steam Next Fest event in June.</p>
<p>See the new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="GB5v8BAn97Q"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/de2b2d8eeff2b371c717f516f5accc01.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/GB5v8BAn97Q" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Fuse Your Balls</strong></p>
<p>The Ball Fusion system encourages explosive experimentation with over 60 randomized balls to equip and combine during your journey. Discover overpowered combinations and unexpected synergies from hundreds of possible outcomes. Load up, lean in, and let the spit hit the fan! </p>
<p><strong>Build New Ballbylon</strong></p>
<p>Expand New Ballbylon with over 70 unique buildings that provide gameplay bonuses and unlock further power-ups, new characters, and more! As your community grows, task homebound heroes with automated tasks to keep the resources coming while you dive deeper into the pit. </p>
<p><strong>Discover New Realms</strong></p>
<p>Face legions of diverse enemies within the pit, battling through barren deserts, frozen caverns, savage forests and more. Each region offers its own unique set of hazards on top of hordes of increasingly challenging foes and mighty, screen-filling bosses. </p>
<p><strong>Recruit Fellow Hunters</strong></p>
<p>As you explore the pit you’ll encounter fellow treasure hunters eager to add their skills to your expedition. Each character has unique, upgradable mechanics that totally change the way you play the game. Experimentation and adaptation are crucial to the success of New Ballbylon!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The demo, which is still live, works perfectly with Proton 9.0-4 on Linux systems.</p>

      <title>Change the world around you with unique spells in the colourful puzzle game Rhell: Warped Worlds &amp; Troubled Times</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a spell system that somewhat reminded me a little of the amazing Baba Is You for how you change the world to win, the upcoming Rhell: Warped Worlds &amp; Troubled Times looks damn fun.</p>
<p>With a semi-open world design you get to freely roam around, with the only limit being the current spell combinations available to you. You'll come across lots of different obstacles including blocked paths, hazards, movable objects and more that you'll overcome by unlocking different spells. What makes it really interesting (aside from the incredibly vibrant style) is the spell system itself. You get up to 40 different runes, and then craft unique spells by mixing keywords together. They said there's "over 102 million permutations in total" and so lots of ways to beat the open-ended puzzles.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6jEmPHQlOwE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fa311212e47a5db1ee515e4a22d34472.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6jEmPHQlOwE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“We’re excited to introduce Rhell, a fun puzzle adventure that encourages players to experiment, inspires creativity, and offers a fresh take on the puzzle genre,” said Simon Byron, Managing Director, Yogscast Games. “Alongside the depth of storytelling and puzzle-solving, players will feel drawn to Rhell's emotional development as she goes in search of answers and restores normality to the toon-like world.”</p>
<p>There's a demo available on Steam right now and it works perfectly with Proton 9.0-4.</p>

      <title>You absolutely have to try the expanded demo of Moonsigil Atlas</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Moonsigil Atlas is easily one of the most unique deck-builders around, and the latest major update to the demo has me hooked. You have to try it.</p>
<p>A game we've covered here at GamingOnLinux a few times because it's just so cool. Deck-building where you don't fuss around with an energy system, or limited action points. Instead, you play your cards down in a physical space, with each having their own shape that you need to fit onto the board. Even if deck-building isn't usually your thing, if you love strategy and puzzle games you might even find this win you over.</p>
<p>This twist on having to position your cards, along with the enemies messing with the board too, just adds such a fun dynamic to the genre that I can't help but keep coming back to the demo.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8iscwsdG4tc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/478b7218f0370226669c8edc6516b8c7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8iscwsdG4tc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Just some of what's been added to the fresh demo update includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eclipse levels</strong> for additional difficulty modifiers once you've beaten the demo.</li>
<li><strong>New encounters</strong>, including Astral Card Packs and new forms of infusing.</li>
<li><strong>Improved visuals</strong> for the player character and encounters.</li>
<li><strong>Even more</strong>, including starting boons, character mastery, run history, Astral Dust, new cards, and a lot of small quality-of-life improvements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can get a surprising amount of hours out of the demo with all of this.</p>
<p>I will be amazed if this isn't a big hit when it's released. It has Native Linux support too.</p>

      <title>Dark fairy-tale metroidvania Well Dweller looks incredible, probably a must-have for Hollow Knight fans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dark fairy-tale metroidvania Well Dweller is the next game from Kyle Thompson who also made the highly rated Crypt Custodian and Islets. Kyle is continuing to team up with Top Hat Studios, Inc. for publishing too.</p>
<p>Here you play as Glimmer, a tiny bird armed with a matchstick who must burn the wicked queen to save his family before they become part of her royal gown. It was revealed during the recent Nintendo event but it will be releasing for Windows as well, so Linux / Steam Deck fans can play it with Proton.</p>
<p>The artwork on the monsters is what really pulled me into this one, those are some seriously freakish looking creations. Looks like the boss fights will be quite intense in this one.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="J1e29j2DzqU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/231257477d7e801dc1a9529f1700770e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/J1e29j2DzqU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More details from the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Venture forth into a whimsical but morbid fairy-tale landscape, and battle terrifying beasts whilst gaining new abilities to expand your world. Discover secrets, mysteries, and the riddles that rot in the underbelly of this wretched queendom.</p>
<p>The dark nooks and crannies throughout shelter powerful trinkets that are key to survival, and a cast of charming characters and allies - all trying to make their own way through the Queen’s twisted world - await befriending along your journey. Go camping with Ilda, a tiny mouse on the run from the Queen’s grasp. Explore an abandoned castle with Looter, a mysterious scavenger who searches the queendom for the best wares to steal.</p>
<p>Many more encounters and discoveries await along the way, punctuated by beautiful, hand-drawn medieval-style fairy-tale illustrations.</p>
<p>Not every fable or fairly-tale has a happy ending, and an imposing collection of beast and royally-sized challenges await. Step into the tiny shoes (or feathers) of Glimmer, and perhaps, just perhaps, you’ll be able to re-unite all your sheltered siblings, snatched from the nest one night in a turn of events that lead to the coming of an unlikely, little hero....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No release date is being given yet other than sometime in 2026.</p>

      <title>Is This Seat Taken? is a wonderful cosy logic puzzle game where you move people around</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Is This Seat Taken? is a game I've absolutely adored since trying the demo in February and it's officially out now with Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>A truly lovely cosy puzzle game about playing matchmaker, as you get people to swap seats across various locations to ensure that everyone is happy. The idea behind it is simple and it's really easy to get into thanks to the wonderfully charming art style too. Like all good puzzlers it will start you off slow, but don't let the simple style deceive you, later levels do get a bit on the challenging side but it is all pure logic. Everything makes sense, you just have to fit it all together.</p>
<p>Doesn't take forever to get through either at around 4-8 hours depending on how good you are at it. Check out the launch trailer for it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="TnpOai12xgY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fbf8984a2483dfa22760fe46ceef47f5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/TnpOai12xgY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"We are thrilled to finally release our debut game," says Ausiàs Dalmau Roig, cofounder of Poti Poti Studio. "We have worked hard over the past two years to bring you Is This Seat Taken? and we hope you enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed making it!"</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Play seating matchmaker to please picky characters.</li>
<li>Discover each character’s unique traits—relatable, outlandish, and everything in between.</li>
<li>Piece together satisfying puzzles with no timers or leaderboards.</li>
<li>Unlock fun new scenarios as you progress—from bus rides to banquets!</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>
<p>They've done it a little weirdly though, instead of just putting up an opt-in Beta it seems you need to request a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2398450/discussions/0/598534283538470240/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">special Beta Steam key</a> to actually get access to it. Probably just so they're not overwhelmed with feedback on it. Once they see it working well enough, the update will be released for everyone.</p>
<p>Nice to see more improvements coming for these classic retro games.</p>

      <title>Become a raging mom trapped in an arcade nightmare in V&#39;s Rage releasing in September</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>V's Rage is a hand-drawn arcade adventure inspired by the great arcade classics of the '80s and '90s that has no single genre.</p>
<p>The developers just recently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2167530/view/497203291915027188" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> that for the September 2nd release that the "Steam Deck, Linux and MacOS versions are finally ready for launch". Nice to see even more games are actually being tested and supported on Linux platforms directly. This one looks completely nuts too.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="sPvNtpH0xsk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ccff44f387c9e25186522e7c0890fe49.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/sPvNtpH0xsk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>MANY GENRES. ZERO MERCY.</strong></p>
<p>V’s Rage is a hand-drawn arcade adventure inspired by the great arcade classics of the ’80s and ’90s.</p>
<p>Expect frantic combat, absurd enemies, and gameplay rules that change with every stage. Each level throws you into a new experience: Beat ’em up, Shoot ’em up, Run and Gun, Side-scroller.</p>
<p>Learn, fail, swear, repeat. No tutorials, no guidance. Just pure, classic arcade</p>
<p><strong>BETWEEN ARCADE CABINETS AND ’80s ANIME</strong></p>
<p>V’s Rage is rooted in the spirit of old-school coin-ops like Final Fight, Altered Beast, and Parodius.</p>
<p>Its visual style is a hand-drawn explosion of ’80s anime energy, a nostalgic tribute to iconic characters like Lum and Ranma.</p>

      <title>The Minecraft-like free and open source game VoxeLibre v0.90 brings dynamic settings and new fire spreading</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>VoxeLibre is a great free and open source sandbox game, a Minecraft-like built on top of the Luanti (Minetest) game engine and a big new release v0.90 is out.</p>
<p>Bringing with it some more advanced features, you can now dynamically adjust the game settings while playing. There's a lot more that's new with this release including a brand new fire spread system, which they said is "more predictable and a single starting point can't burn too large an area – although they can still go quite far".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7028447631754907716gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Some more of what's new includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blazes have been renamed to Fire Elementals with improved behaviour and they said to expect new elemental mobs in the upcoming releases as it's a whole new class of mobs now.</li>
<li>Potions can now stack up to 16, and the duration / power of some potions were increased to be more useful.</li>
<li>The Ghast mob was reworked with a new model, new textures and improved behaviour.</li>
<li>A whole new set of Deepslate tools have been added.</li>
<li>Mobs that pick up armour from the ground will now drop it again when they die.</li>
<li>New golden decorative blocks were added.</li>
<li>Improvements the the creative mode inventory sorting.</li>
<li>Various other bug fixes and improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p>See more in the <a href="https://git.minetest.land/VoxeLibre/VoxeLibre/src/branch/master/releasenotes/0_90-the-dynamic-release.md" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>
<p>To get it you need to install Luanti and find VoxeLibre in the built-in content database downloader.</p>

      <title>Debian 13 trixie released with Linux kernel 6.12</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Debian 13 trixie has been released following years of working, bringing lots of new software updates for the popular Linux distribution. Your choice of desktop environment with GNOME 48, KDE Plasma 6.3, LXDE 13, LXQt 2.1.0, and Xfce 4.20. Each with their own set of major changes and new features since the last releases available in Debian.</p>
<p>Quite an important release since it moves to use a 64-bit <em>time_t</em> ABI, supporting dates beyond 2038. It also gained HTTP Boot support, hardening against ROP and COP/JOP attacks on amd64 and arm64, and they're making real progress towards reproducible builds of packages. Additionally, this release adds official support for Debian on riscv64 allowing you to run it on RISC-V hardware.</p>
<p>Debian 13 is supported fully until August 9th, 2028 - after that it moves to a separate LTS team until June 30th, 2030.</p>
<p>See more in the release <a href="https://www.debian.org/News/2025/20250809" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> and <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/release-notes/index.en.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>
<p>Are you a Debian user? What's your favourite new feature in Debian 13? Let us know in the comments.</p>
<p><em>It also powers many other Linux distributions like Ubuntu and so also Linux Mint, Pop!_OS, Zorin and others.</em></p>

      <title>Steam&#39;s Performance Monitor now supports showing CPU temperature</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a small update to the Steam Beta Client to continue working on the newer Performance Monitor.</p>
<p>A feature that has been a wonderful addition to Steam, meaning less third-party software is needed just to get some system performance info. I'm a big fan, although for now I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-use-mangohud-for-linux-game-performance-monitoring/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">still use MangoHud</a> since it has more configurable options. The latest update to the Steam Performance Monitor has added support for displaying the CPU temperature on Linux and Windows.</p>
<p>On Windows it needs a kernel driver, whereas on Linux it appears to just work out of the box. For Windows Valve said "The driver is only installed and running when Performance Monitor is visible at full CPU detail levels" unless you disable it in the settings.</p>
<p>So now the full display looks like this (top left in the below picture):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15872626891754685617gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15872626891754685617gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
Game pictured - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">PEAK</a></p>
<p>Two other changes in the Beta are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed mouse input being offset on macOS when running certain games on high dpi displays.</li>
<li>Fixed game overview window failing to load if there is an issue loading data for popular or favorite guides.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam for ChromeOS Chromebooks is being killed off</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another one for the Google (and Valve) graveyard, this time it's Steam for Chromebooks as it's being killed off early next year.</p>
<p>The project has been in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/steam-on-chromebook-is-now-in-beta-with-amd-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Beta since November 2022</a>, and sadly it's coming to an abrupt close on January 1st, 2026 where installed games will no longer be playable. It will just be entirely gone. As reported by <a href="https://9to5google.com/2025/08/07/steam-chromebook-2026/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, when you now go to install Steam on ChromeOS a message will pop up noting "The Steam for Chromebook Beta program will conclude on January 1st, 2026. After this date, games installed as part of the Beta will no longer be available to play on your device. We appreciate your participation in and contribution to learnings from the beta program, which will inform the future of Chromebook gaming."</p>

<p>A shame but not exactly surprising, the Beta never really went anywhere with not much effort seemingly being put into it to push it further. I've barely heard much at all about it since the 2022 Beta release.</p>
<p>Plus, with all the <a href="https://9to5google.com/2025/07/14/chromeos-experience-android/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reports</a> on Google looking to in some ways combine Android and ChromeOS together, their focus is clearly elsewhere.</p>
<p>Did any of you use Steam on ChromeOS / Chromebooks?</p>
<p><em>I've reached out to Valve to see if they have anything to add.</em></p>

      <title>Cleaning Up! is an upcoming wholesome and satisfying game about tidying</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a demo available, Cleaning Up! looks like pure joy if you love making things sparkle.</p>
<p>A game all about tidying the mess you find with vacuums, brushes, mops, sprays and more. You're a cleaning gig worker taking on a variety of quests from a hoarder's apartment to an old haunted mansion. There's plenty of variety in the locations and what you'll be doing, including running away from ghosts and solving puzzles.</p>
<p>FromUnbound Creations which is the same developer that made Rain on Your Parade, Just Crow Things, Headliner: NoviNews, HEADLINER and more.</p>
<p>With perhaps a similar feel to other more casual games like PowerWash Simulator, here you also get upgrades too. Grow your prestige to earn cash, allowing you to upgrade tools and purchase new outfits. The developer said the game is "very low-pressure" though, with the ability to revisit levels with new tools to get a better score.</p>

      <title>Linux GPU Configuration And Monitoring Tool (LACT) gets expanded support for older AMD GPUs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Linux GPU Configuration And Monitoring Tool (LACT) version 0.8.1 has been released, giving you more options for getting the best performance out of your GPU. Since we have no proper GPU control panels on Linux, tools like LACT are a must-have.</p>
<p>This latest release notes it has full V/F curve editing for older AMD GPUs. As the developer said "The RDNA1, Vega and Polaris GPU generations now expose all of the voltage/frequency points in the UI, and not just the minimum and maximum values like previously". With an example shot from a Vega 56:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1522264651754659750gol1.png"/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Some other enhancements include profile hooks to let you specify custom commands for profile activation, the app now supports translations, there's improved functionality to enable/disable AMD overclocking, the Lowest/Highest performance levels are now applied correctly when combined with custom clock settings on RDNA GPUs, there's more detailed GPU cache info reporting on AMD and they also fixed extra NVIDIA information (such as ROP count) fetching on multi-GPU systems.</p>
<p>Plus some bug fixes and other smaller tweaks to the UI.</p>
<p>See more in the <a href="https://github.com/ilya-zlobintsev/LACT/releases/tag/v0.8.1" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>

      <title>DOOM Eternal gets modding and DOOM: The Dark Ages gets an endless arena mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Big updates for id Software games DOOM Eternal and DOOM: The Dark Ages have landed and they both sound pretty great.</p>
<p>For DOOM Eternal, the PC Mods Update update enables you to grab over 650 mods made by the community. It includes a new launcher, after being in Beta since last year. The new launcher for DOOM Eternal gives you quick access between the base game and mods. This includes a built-in modding browser, as it does not use Steam Workshop. They've also expanded the DOOM Eternal: idStudio modding tool to include content from all base campaign maps, along with some PvP asset packs, DLC1 &amp; 2 content wads and a Graveyard asset pack for beginners</p>
<p>I've tested and the new launcher does <em>not</em> run with Proton 9.0-4, which is the current stable Proton. However, it did load up fine with<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/proton-10-0-2-beta-brings-even-more-gaming-improvements-to-linux-steamos-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> the recent Proton 10.0-2 Beta release</a>. To actually download any mods though, it does <em>require</em> a Bethesda account. Logging in and downloading mods with Proton 10 also works.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20955130481754659038gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20955130481754659038gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9575600441754659040gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9575600441754659040gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Testing a quick mod for a demo and yep - all working just fine on Proton 10.</p>

      <title>Farlight 84 is now broken on Linux, SteamOS / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Farlight 84 has relaunched with a massive new upgrade that brings a first-person mode, but it's sadly now broken on Linux, SteamOS / Steam Deck.</p>
<p>It's not entirely clear if this is an anti-cheat issue, or if it's something that Valve now need to fix in the Proton compatibility layer for the fresh update. You can load into the menus just fine, but it will rapidly crash and quit to your Steam Library barely a few minutes into a match.</p>
<p>I'm hoping it's just another <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/hunt-showdown-1896-broken-on-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck-due-to-easy-anti-cheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hunt: Showdown 1896 situation</a>, or the numerous times THE FINALS gets momentarily broken instead of being actively blocked like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/ea-respawn-now-block-apex-legends-from-running-on-linux-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Apex Legends</a> and many others. The bug has been <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6717" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">logged</a> on Valve's Proton GitHub page for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5315821181754597264gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Currently, their Discord support team are simply telling people "the game does not support running under Linux" and just tell people to use Windows. I've sent off an email to their press team to see if we can get a <em>clearer</em> answer.</p>
<p>For now, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat page</a> is listing it as broken until we see what's going on. Be sure to keep an eye on that page for any changes to this and other games. Anti-cheat is proving to be a constant nuisance for gaming on Linux. One day I really hope Valve can solve this repeating issue.</p>

      <title>Terra Nil gets a bit less chill in the free Heatwave Update out now plus a big discount</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In Terra Nil you're tasked with restoring life to barren environments and things have begun heating up in the new free update. Named Heatwave, the free expansion brings an entirely new region to bring back to life with sandy deserts, salt pans, canyons and floodplains. </p>
<p class="plain-list-title">What's actually in the update:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>13 new animals including crocodiles, elephants, hyenas, and vultures, which appear in the world more naturally and stick around for longer.</li>
<li>A new photography mode that lets you take snapshots of animals in your restored landscapes, with a scoring system that rewards skilled snappers.</li>
<li>3 challenging new maps to tackle: Parched Dunes, Canyon Peaks, and Fracked Floodplain. Bridge vast canyons, douse oil fires, and more.</li>
<li>New eco-tech to play with including a remotely controlled land recycling bot and the Xerophytium, a building used to restore cactus biomes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the fresh update trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CFw7lPW6WOA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1b5af6f679df7bc7efb300de01f82fdc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CFw7lPW6WOA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>If that's not enough for you - there's also a 60% discount on the game which is the biggest discount it's had so far! So this is a really great time to pick it up and it works wonderfully on Linux systems. It even has a Native Linux version available.</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s all the games to claim from Prime Gaming for August 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need more games? Here's all that's coming to Prime Gaming in August 2025. An easy way to add more games to your library across Linux, SteamOS and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"/> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play. Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now. If a game is Steam Deck Playable / Verified it will be SteamOS Compatible.</p>
<p>Today they've added Sid Meier's Civilization III Complete, THIEF: Definitive Edition and The Academy: The First Riddle.</p>
<p>Across the rest of the month they'll be adding in all these — FATE: The Traitor Soul, Filthy Animals | Heist Simulator, Tin Hearts, Necroking, Labyrinth City: Pierre the Maze Detective, Silver Box Classics, Heroes of Loot 2, Fantasy Empires and City Legends: The Ghost of Misty Hill Collector’s Edition.</p>
<p>You can install games from Epic, GOG and Amazon easily via tools like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-play-games-from-gog-and-epic-games-on-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Heroic Games Launcher and Lutris</a> with Prime giving you a code for each game for whatever store it's on. For any games that use anti-cheat be sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat compatibility page</a> to see their status.</p>
<p>Below is the list of all titles available as of today. <em>The table is sorted by the End date with those ending soon at the top.</em></p>

      <title>Heretic + Hexen get a definitive re-release with new content from id Software and Nightdive Studios</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/doom-doom-ii-get-bundled-together-with-new-enhanced-versions/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">what happened with DOOM + DOOM II</a>, Nightdive Studios have remastered the classics Heretic + Hexen as one bundle with new content. Although, they're actually <em>not</em> calling them a "remaster" instead they're opting to call them a "definitive re-release".</p>
<p>Announced today during QuakeCon 2025, they're also Steam Deck Verified right away so you can play them nicely on the go. Which means they also work great on Desktop Linux with Valve's Proton. If you owned either of the originals, you should get them free!</p>
<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Step into the definitive re-release of two dark spell-casting shooters that shaped the genre.</p>
<p>Forged by Raven Software on a modified DOOM engine, Heretic and Hexen were released in 1994 and 1995, pushing first person shooters into bold new territory. These innovative cult classics introduced groundbreaking features like inventory systems, vertical aiming, and distinct character classes, reshaping first person action games for generations to come. This enhanced restoration makes Heretic + Hexen available to new audiences and long-time fans with expanded accessibility across more platforms and languages than ever before. Whether you're returning to these shadowy realms or discovering them for the first time, an epic legacy awaits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4268055691754593818gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>As for what to actually expect from it, you'll get all this in the new enhanced bundle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Owners Receive</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders.</li>
<li>Hexen: Beyond Heretic.</li>
<li>Hexen: Deathkings of the Dark Citadel.</li>
<li>Two all-new episodes created in collaboration between individuals at id Software + Nightdive Studios:
	<ul>
<li>Heretic: Faith Renewed</li>
<li>Hexen: Vestiges of Grandeur</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a total of 117 campaign maps and 120 deathmatch maps in Heretic + Hexen.</p>
<p><strong>New Enhancements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Online cross-platform deathmatch and co-op for up to 16 players.</li>
<li>Local split-screen deathmatch and co-op for up to 8 players.</li>
<li>Toggleable, enhanced Tome of Power soundtrack by Andrew Hulshult.</li>
<li>Community-published mod support with an in-game mod browser.</li>
<li>Improved performance with multithreaded rendering supporting up to 4K resolution and 120 FPS.</li>
<li>A Vault section containing concept art and unused sprites from the development of the original games.</li>
<li>Accessibility options, such as updated UI, improved legibility, contrast and screen FX adjustments, and text-to-speech features.</li>
<li>Modern controller support.
	<ul>
<li>Weapon carousel for faster weapon switching.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Game balance toggle (original/enhanced).</li>

<p>Really love to see so many classics get upgraded like this. Especially since you get the original classics with them at the same time, so nothing is wiped away by doing this. Best of all worlds.</p>

      <title>Solve mysterious murders in Casebook 1899 - The Leipzig Murders with a launch set for September</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Casebook 1899 - The Leipzig Murders is a richly atmospheric, retro-inspired point-and-click adventure set in Leipzig, Germany at the dawn of the 20th century. The developer has now confirmed it's going to launch on September 4th, with Native Linux support and a demo is available still.</p>
<p>As Kreiser, you’ll examine clues, interrogate suspects, and piece together evidence to solve four murder cases. In a classic point-and-click format, Casebook 1899 - The Leipzig Murders will transport players to a less-explored era of German history.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="appNvUWjeg8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b53dbdfd54a8013ce260d7daac33058c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/appNvUWjeg8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Throughout its development the game has attracted attention within the point-and-click adventure community and has been showcased at events such as AdventureX, Indie Game Fest Cologne, CAGGTUS, and NEXO. It also earned second place in the newcomer category at the Games Innovation Award Saxony (GIAS).</p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Uncover vital evidence - Scour beautifully hand-pixellated environments for hidden clues, brought to life with detailed, handcrafted animations. Each scene captures the atmosphere of a bustling 19th-century Leipzig, Germany.</li>
<li>Interrogate suspects and witnesses - Cross paths with witnesses and suspects alike—but it's up to you to tell them apart. Gain their trust, ask the right questions, and uncover what they’d rather keep hidden.</li>
<li>Use your notebook - Keep track of every observation and witness statement in your notebook, where each scene has its own dedicated page for easy reference when you need it most.</li>
<li>Draw your own conclusions - Combine clues in your notebook to unlock new conclusions on your deduction board. Piece together the facts and identify the true culprit from a list of suspects.</li>
<li>Your choices will matter - Your choice of culprit in each of the four cases determines the outcome, making this a true test of your deductive skills. A sharp eye and keen mind are your greatest weapons in the fight against crime.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Mesa 25.2.0 released with NVIDIA upgrades, Apple Vulkan driver enhancements and lots more improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mesa 25.2.0 is officially out now as the latest new feature release of open source graphics drivers for Linux. There's quite a lot of changes with this one from big new features, lots of different drivers seeing enhancements and the usual assortment of bug fixes.</p>
<p>From the mailing list release announcement developer Eric Engestrom said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- squire -->This release includes some major house-cleaning of the window system code to remove support for deprecated functionality:<br/>
- DRI2 support has been removed entirely. X11 window system support is now only available through DRI3 or software paths. This should not directly impact users as DRI2 has been deprecated for some time.<br/>
- Support for the insecure legacy GEM names has also been removed and buffer sharing is now only supported using dma-buf file descriptors. This should also not affect users as dma-buf has been the preferred path for about a decade.<br/>
- Support for thread-unsafe libX11 has been removed. Mesa now requires libX11 &gt;= 1.8 (April 2022) which calls XInitThreads() on load and guarantees libX11 is always thread-safe. libX11 must not be built with --disable-thread-safety-constructor since that disables the XInitThreads() call.<br/>
- Support for EGL_WL_bind_wayland_display has been deprecated and is now hidden behind the -Dlegacy-wayland=bind-wayland-display build flag. In order for XWayland to work properly without EGL_WL_bind_wayland_display, distros will need to upgrade to Xwayland &gt;= 24.1 (May 2024).<br/>
<br/>
Another important things is that, as announced during `meson setup` since 25.0.2, the Clover OpenCL implementation has been deleted. RustiCL is now the only OpenCL implementation available, providing support for more OpenCL versions and features and to more hardware than Clover ever did. It is not (yet) perfect though, so please report any issue you find while using it.<br/>
<br/>
NVK has added a dependency on the rustc-hash crate, which has improved shader compile times by an estimated 12%. We believe rustc-hash is already widely packaged, so the hope is that this won't pose much of a burden to packagers.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of NVK, it now supports NVIDIA's Blackwell and Kepler architectures. The old Nouveau GL driver has not been updated for Blackwell and there are no plans to do so. Instead, Nouveau users will only get OpenGL via Zink+NVK on any GPUs after Ada. (Kepler users will still get the old Nouveau GL driver as it is still the default pre-Turing.)<br/>
<br/>
HoneyKrisp, the Apple Vulkan driver, has seen significant performance improvements.</p>
</blockquote>

      <title>Massive scale RTS game Ashes of the Singularity II announced for 2026</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ashes of the Singularity II has been announced by Oxide Games and Stardock, bringing us the next-generation of massive scale real-time strategy games.</p>
<p>My favourite genre. Something about building up a big army like this and watching the fireworks, every since first discovering the original Dune II and later Command &amp; Conquer. I have great expectations for Ashes of the Singularity II, I just hope it works well with Valve's Proton on Desktop Linux.</p>
<p>For this one they have a "significantly" expanded team and scope with them promising some pretty big stuff including "greater strategic depth, intricate base-building dynamics, and intense skirmishes against intelligent computer opponents".<!-- squire --> So far the only official trailer they've put up doesn't show gameplay but here it is anyway:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SV3k4yxWKS0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/820069c00a3f2fe5b43d2ccccbb69ae7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SV3k4yxWKS0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release: “Ten years ago, we set a new, literal benchmark for RTS games with massive battles and groundbreaking technology," said Brad Wardell, CEO of Stardock Entertainment. "With Ashes of the Singularity II, we’re raising the bar even higher, delivering strategic gameplay depth that RTS fans have always dreamed of.”</p>
<p><!-- squire -->“Obviously, in the first game, the number one request was to have a human faction,” said Wardell. “Back then, we just couldn’t support having thousands of organic, walking, squishy people in the world and thus had to design in favor of machines. We’re really excited to bring the humans into the war and watch how they fare against the massive mechanical armies of the Substrate and PHC.”</p>

      <title>NVIDIA say no to adding backdoors and killswitches in their GPUs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA have released a blog post from chief security officer, fighting back against attempts from pundits and policymakers in governments wanting backdoors.</p>
<p>In the post, David Reber Jr. gives a firm no to the suggestion they should add in anything like a backdoor or killswitch into their hardware noting "NVIDIA GPUs do not and should not have kill switches and backdoors" noting that adding anything like it would be "a gift to hackers and hostile actors". <em>Some words that perhaps the UK Government should take note on, with their repeated attempts (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption_ban_proposal_in_the_United_Kingdom" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#1</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgj54eq4vejo" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#2</a> and so on) to get backdoors in encryption.</em></p>
<p>The post continues noting how a "good" secret backdoor just isn't a thing "only dangerous vulnerabilities that need to be eliminated" and ensuring that "no single-point vulnerability can compromise or shut down a system". It all seems so obvious to say doesn't it? But it clearly needs to be repeated as governments simply don't learn. A backdoor for one, is eventually a backdoor for everyone determined to access it.</p>
<p>Reber Jr goes on to give the NSA's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_chip" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Clipper Chip initiative</a> from the 90s as an example of how it just doesn't work. There's more in the post worth reading but the ending note is especially blunt "There are no back doors in NVIDIA chips. No kill switches. No spyware. That's not how trustworthy systems are built — and never will be".</p>
<p>See more in the <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/no-backdoors-no-kill-switches-no-spyware/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">NVIDIA blog post</a>.</p>

      <title>Odencat released a sweet new adventure in Wish Upon a Cat</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Celebrating their sixth anniversary as a studio, Japanese developer Odencat have released a free heartwarming adventure with Wish Upon a Cat.</p>
<p>It has Linux support just like the previous games including Bear's Restaurant, Fishing Paradiso and Meg's Monster that all have very positive user reviews. Looks like this will be another lovely little one to go through, and since it's free you can just go and grab it right now.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="psi9pXEsWYI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ab013633b3475bf14c0591ff013a8731.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/psi9pXEsWYI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it (from Steam):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If I knew things were going to end up like this, I would've just apologized in the first place…"</p>
<p>It's your best friend's birthday—but after a recent fight with her, you're not exactly on speaking terms.</p>
<p>Before you even have a chance to wallow in regret, though, a burst of light erupts from your computer screen and sucks you into an alternate dimension—where a rather snarky mouse gives you the rundown.</p>
<p>A rogue cat with a bad attitude has been leaping between realities and causing all sorts of dimensional mayhem—and if something isn't done to stop it, it might very well cause another big bang. And you DEFINITELY don't want that.</p>
<p>With no other options available, you set off in pursuit of the feisty feline—not just to restore balance to the dimensions, but because it's the only way you'll ever make it back home.</p>
<p>In this short-but-sweet adventure, you'll journey through the many worlds of Odencat games like Bear's Restaurant and Meg's Monster, meeting dozens of familiar friends along the way on your search for the runaway cat.</p>
<p>Why did it throw the dimensions out of whack? What is it this little kitty-cat truly desires? And when all is said and done—what will YOU wish for?</p>

      <title>Bottles app for running Windows apps / games on Linux gets NGI Zero Commons funding</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The NLnet Foundation <a href="https://nlnet.nl/news/2025/20250804-announcement-grants-CommonsFund.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> more projects receiving funding from NGI Zero Commons, which includes the popular Bottles app for running Windows apps on Linux.</p>
<p>Not heard of the NGI Zero Commons Fund before? From the NLnet Foundation it's designed to help support free and open source software. They receive financial support from the European Commission's Next Generation Internet programme, the European Union’s Horizon Europe research and innovation programme and even the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI).</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://usebottles.com/posts/2025-08-04-nlnet-commons-fund/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> from the Bottles team they note it will go towards work on Bottles Next, as they're rebuilding the software to improve all parts of it. Back in <a href="https://usebottles.com/posts/2025-07-06-bottles-need-help/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">early July</a>, the Bottles developers put out a call for more support, so it's nice to see it answered.</p>
<p>While a lot of people use software like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-play-games-from-gog-and-epic-games-on-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Heroic and Lutris</a>, Bottles is just another tool in the box that you can use to make running Windows software a little bit easier.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA driver 570.181 released for Linux as the latest recommended stable driver</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In addition to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/nvidia-beta-driver-580-65-06-released-for-linux-with-bug-fixes-and-expanded-wayland-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">releasing a new Beta series recently</a>, NVIDIA have now put up driver version 570.181 as the latest recommended stable driver for Linux.</p>
<p>Here we go again though, we get a one-liner vague <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/drivers/details/252486/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a>. Are you ready for this? The improvements noted are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Minor bug fixes and improvements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>When this happened previously, NVIDIA stealthily <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/nvidia-stable-driver-575-64-03-released/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">added support for a newer GPU</a>. The time after with another vague changelog, I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/nvidia-570-172-08-released-for-linux-as-the-main-stable-driver/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">speculated that it was possibly for unrevealed security issues</a> — which turned out to be correct when NVIDIA later <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/nvidia-reveal-more-gpu-driver-security-issues-for-july-2025/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced some more security flaws</a>. So it's entirely possible we may get another security bulletin sometime soon. As always, GamingOnLinux will let you know when we have any details of that or anything else.</p>

      <title>After being banned for sale VILE: Exhumed has released for free</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It was going to release on Steam but it was removed and banned for sale, now VILE: Exhumed is back as a free game to fight back against censorship. <em>With the release it's now under the CC BY-NC-ND license.</em></p>
<p>Not caught up on what's going on? This is one game that was caught up in the recent campaign to have certain games with adult themes <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/mastercard-release-a-statement-about-game-stores-payment-processors-and-adult-content/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">removed for sale on Steam and itch.io</a>, with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/zoom-platform-also-had-payment-processor-issues-say-they-have-no-plans-to-remove-any-titles/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ZOOM Platform also recently talking about it too</a>.</p>
<p>The developer said that 50% of the profits will go towards the "Red Door Family Shelter, a Toronto based charity that focuses on helping families, refugees, and women who are escaping violence". Writing on the website the developer posted a statement about the situation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The game covers topics of assault, abuse, and entitlement, and uses a combination of FMV and practical effects to create images as horrifying as the themes. This was never a secret. There are a lot of intense visuals in VILE: Exhumed, but there is no uncensored nudity, no depictions of sex acts, and no pornography whatsoever – which is one of the justifications bad actors are using right now to censor games.</p>
<p>What this actually results in is taking power and storytelling away from women, other marginalized artists, and ultimately, from everyone.</p>
<p><strong>This censorship of my work is a direct attack on creative expression and artistic freedom, and it will not stop with false accusations of sexual content.</strong></p>
<p>They will come for anything that speaks more loudly than they do. </p>
<p>By giving the game away, for free, to whoever wants to play it, I am doing the same thing I set out to do when I started working on VILE: Exhumed, a game about sexual assault, male entitlement, and misogyny. Taking back my agency. </p>
<p>No one is allowed to dictate what kind of horror is acceptable, or what stories are allowed to be told.</p>

<p>Editor's Note: these bans and removals don't work. All that ends up happening is games and other content move elsewhere, and people go looking in darker places. We know how these things go, and now with all the age verification in the UK and coming to other countries, the situation is only going to get worse. </p>

      <title>Portal: Revolution drops Native Linux support to focus on Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Second Face Software have announced that their incredibly popular Portal: Revolution mod for Portal 2 has dropped the Native Linux build.</p>
<p>They've had a Native Linux build for a long time, but it became quite problematic and they weren't able to solve the issues players kept encountering. So instead, they're going to ensure it works with Proton where the issues didn't happen.</p>
<p>As they mentioned in their <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/601360/announcements/detail/509587556478748640" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Portal: Revolution, from the start, has included a native Linux build. As some players have recently reported, it was broken because of recent Steam updates. To fix this we have decided to remove the native Linux binaries in favour of Proton. Don't panic.</p>
<p>Our native Linux build sucked. You may have experienced frequent hangs and stutters related to gel rendering or other strange bugs. This stems from a bug in our multithreaded rendering code for gel blobs, and despite our best efforts we were not able to fix it. To make matters worse, it only happens on the native Linux build. Windows and Proton are not affected.</p>
<p>Because of these two reasons we'll ditch the native build and run the game through Proton. Performance should be comparable, if not even better at times and stability is definitely improved. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified with the Native Linux version, so this means it will need to be reviewed again with Proton by Valve, otherwise it will cause problems on Steam Deck. For now, you may need to manually opt into using Proton for it in the properties -&gt; Compatibility menu for the game on Steam to run properly.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cXczxIIvXJ0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dc22ee41837af784c9560db29b9d810f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cXczxIIvXJ0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In related news, earlier this year they also announced Portal: Revolution 2 is in development, so there's more fun to come for Portal fans.</p>

      <title>Dying Light: The Beast looks absolutely brutal in the new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I really hope Techland learned some lessons from Dying Light 2, as I have high hopes for Dying Light: The Beast. The latest trailer certainly makes it look fun, as short as it is.</p>
<p>Dying Light (the original) is still one of the best open-world zombie games, but Dying Light 2 just wasn't even close to being as good. This time around Techland seem to be putting a lot more effort into the overall body-horror aspect to it, with overhauled gore systems that look like a lot of fun to play with.</p>
<p>Check out the brief teaser trailer on some of it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SyhySFnQpmg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/45652f94b3a3be693485df968dc508b6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SyhySFnQpmg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release: "We’ve overhauled the body damage system," explains Nathan Lemaire, Game Director. "We doubled the number of places on enemies - we call them Gore-Nodes - where players can inflict damage and the number of wounds or injuries that are visible on one single enemy. And we improved the precision of melee attacks - so the angle and trajectory of your strike defines what you hit and how your enemies react to it. So you can target and cut off limbs more precisely than ever!"</p>
<p>To have a realistic representation of gore in Dying Light: The Beast, the art team went to some lengths. "We’ve improved all of the visuals of wounds and injuries and match them with all of the body types. The research was extensive - I just hope no one ever looks up my browser history," says Dominik Wasieńko, Lead Character Artist.</p>

      <title>JetBrains now a Platinum sponsor of Godot Engine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Godot Foundation announced that JetBrains have become a Platinum sponsor of Godot Engine development, helping push this cross-platform open source game engine.</p>
<p>Looking at Godot's sponsorship levels, this means JetBrains will be providing at least €36,000 a year. However, it does not give JetBrains any sway at all. Many companies and groups already help to fund Godot including Scorewarrior, The Khronos Group, W4 Games, Megacrit, Robot Gentleman, Re-Logic, Broken Rules, Chasing Carrots and others.</p>
<p>Currently, the Godot team are receiving €35,992 a month in funding from 1,521 members and 18 sponsors in total.</p>
<p>JetBrains said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At JetBrains, we value the diversity of thought and experience in the software industry, such as the many different programming languages and related ecosystems. We can see that there is ample scope for multiple game engines, especially so for a not-for-profit, open-source game engine. Development happens thanks to the dedication of contributors and paid volunteers, and we welcome the chance to support passionate people making a difference with a successful community project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are you still waiting for Godot? Maybe time to try it out if you're a game developer.</p>

      <title>Hunt: Showdown 1896 broken on Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck due to Easy Anti-Cheat</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 06/08/2025 - 9:37am UTC</strong>: while Crytek did not reply to GamingOnLinux, they have fixed the issue and the game works again. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Our anti-cheat page</a> has been updated to note it works again.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below…</em></p>
<p>Here we go again? Hunt: Showdown 1896 is a popular extraction shooter from Crytek that's now broken on Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck due to Easy Anti-Cheat.</p>
<p>Just recently the developers put out a small update with version 2.4.0.2 fixing a couple of bugs, but the side-effect is that the Easy Anti-Cheat system seems to now be either disabled for Linux systems or left broken. Quite frustrating to see, with no announcements from the developer.</p>
<p>I've tested with Proton 9 and Proton Experimental and both just give the same issue, the game will load and then eventually give you an error box like this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6486112621754395490gol1.png"/></p>
<p>There's quite a number of posts on their <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/594650/discussions/8/594030422158053461/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> forum about it, and the bug is already logged on Valve's <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/3898#issuecomment-3149923205" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> for Proton. The game is currently rated Steam Deck Playable / SteamOS Compatible by Valve.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20421985221754395417gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I've reached out to Crytek press to see if they have anything to share, will update if they reply.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated anti-cheat page</a> was updated to reflect the current status. Be sure to keep an eye on it for any changes for this and other games on Linux.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA are working on a &#34;general optimization&#34; for VKD3D / DirectX12 games on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For a while now Linux users with NVIDIA GPUs have been reporting performance issues with DirectX12 titles using VKD3D, but a fix may <em>finally</em> be coming.</p>
<p>A post was opened on the NVIDIA forum all the way back in August 2024, with it building up multiple hundreds of replies over time from different users talking about the performance issues. There's many posts about it elsewhere, and you often find the advice to Linux gamers building systems is to use an AMD GPU, with one of the biggest issues (aside from open source drivers) being the performance difference especially for DirectX12 titles.</p>
<p>Sometime soon, that annoying performance problem might be a thing of the past. On August 5th, NVIDIA developer amrits <a href="https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/directx12-performance-is-terrible-on-linux/303207/432" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">replied</a> to note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi All,<br/>
While looking at Horizon Zero Dawn Linux performance we identified a general optimization that benefits multiple titles with VKD3D. It is still in development. We will give an update when it is available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same NVIDIA developer did post back in <a href="https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/directx12-performance-is-terrible-on-linux/303207/279" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">June</a> to note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I really apologize for not communicating earlier.<br/>
Team is currently investigating performance issues, and we do have identified the root cause for Horizon Zero Dawn and are working on a fix.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So no time-frame and no other information, just that something is actually properly in progress and it will now benefit multiple titles.</p>
<p>Really hope to see it arrive soon!</p>

      <title>openSUSE Leap 16.0 will need Steam gamers to install some extras due to no 32-bit</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>openSUSE Leap 16.0 has entered the Release Candidate phase, and for anyone gaming on Steam with openSUSE Leap you'll need some tweaks. openSUSE doesn't actually register in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/steam-survey-for-july-2025-shows-linux-approaching-3/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's data for the top Linux distributions used</a>, but still some might be interested to know about this.</p>
<p>In the RC <a href="https://news.opensuse.org/2025/08/04/leap-16-rc/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release announcement</a>, there's this bit noted for Steam users:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="steam-wine-32-bit-support"><strong>Steam, Wine, 32-bit support</strong></p>
<p>SUSE Linux Enterprise 16.0 does not support 32-bit binary execution.<br/>
Leap users can install <code class="inline-code">grub2-compat-ia32</code>, which enables it by passing <code class="inline-code">ia32_emulation=1</code> to the kernel.<br/>
We’ve recently dropped Steam from the <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Package_repositories#Non-OSS" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Non-OSS repository</a> due to a limited set of 32-bit libraries.<br/>
Steam users will want to install <code class="inline-code">selinux-policy-targeted-gaming</code>, which is not installed by default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We all saw <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/fedora-proposal-to-drop-32-bit-support-has-been-withdrawn/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">what happened with Fedora</a> when a proposal was put to drop 32-bit didn't we? Sounds like another messy situation. <em>I wonder how much backlash this will end up causing for the openSUSE Leap developers.</em></p>
<p>To me, all this says is that openSUSE Leap 16.0 is not going to be a good pick for gaming on Linux. And that's fine, not every Linux distribution out there needs to focus on every possible use case, but this will cause friction for people. Then again, if you're using something like openSUSE Leap, you're probably a seasoned Linux user.</p>

      <title>Oblivion remade in the Skyrim engine, Skyblivion is on the final stretch to release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Skyblivion is a remake of Oblivion in the Skyrim engine, something that has been exciting RPG fans for a while and it's finally coming soon.</p>
<p>More about it from the developers of the mod: "Skyblivion is the ultimate fan-made experience for the Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, bringing the game into the newer engine of the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition. This process combines Oblivion’s impressive award-winning open-world that is renowned for its incredible gameplay, memorable quests, and expansive world space with the advancements in gaming that have been made in the last two decades. Set in the Elder Scroll’s Third Era, during the cataclysmic Oblivion Crisis, you must help to restore the Imperial throne and repel the demonic Daedric invasion."</p>
<p>The developers put up a sixth development diary video going over the progress on August 3rd, the first update since the release of the official Oblivion Remastered. Clearly, this hasn't deterred them for pushing forward on Skyblivion. Answering the question on "what's the point of it now?", in the video they mention how Skyblivion is actually a "full-scale remake that re-imagines Oblivion from the ground up, bringing it in line with modern RPG standards".</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Features planned for it include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The entirety of the Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion’s world space lovingly remade and updated for a new generation of gamers and long-time fans alike.</li>
<li>Classic systems and features such as spell crafting, class and attributes, underwater combat, lockpicking, and NPC disposition implemented into the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition’s engine.</li>

      <title>Keep a close eye on your kingdom in The King is Watching</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The King is Watching from Hypnohead and tinyBuild is a unique micro-management roguelite kingdom builder that will suck you right in. <em>Note: a key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>It's a strange blend of kingdom building micro-management for the resources and production, along with real-time auto-battle when it comes to the action. You place down building tiles in a small area, and move around your gaze to make the tiles actually activate and run their production. Your gaze tile range is limited, so it's a game of constant micro where you're always watching your resources to build them up, and then move your gaze around again to build up something else. Impressively clever, and very different to other such games and due to this your full attention will be completely absorbed by it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19824855411754390365gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19824855411754390365gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You know, it actually reminded me a little of Tetris in the way you're arranging the kingdom tiles and your gaze together. At least initially that is. It's obviously nothing like it, but I couldn't help but feel that when starting off in it. It's all about making perfect use of the space you've got to maximise your resource income with your limited area of gaze. Getting the tiles in the right place is one of the most difficult things about it, and can easily make you lose if you're not prepared enough. Thankfully, you can move tiles at any time, they just suffer a temporary production penalty for being moved.</p>
<p>While it's an RTS (real time strategy) game, it's more like real time <em>staring</em>. You don't directly interact with your troops, only the kingdom tiles although you do get to interact in certain other ways like spells. Some of the spells will truly save your kingdom too, I <em>completely</em> screwed up on one run and entirely ran out of Wheat so I couldn't produce any troops, but I did have a Tornado spell that mopped the floor with the enemies and saved my kingdom.</p>
<p>Everything is about your watchful eye, like some sort of Eye of Sauron – only you're just a <em>little</em> bit nicer. You can also pause at any time, which you'll end up making great use of to plan ahead a little on your resources.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cjpJH8nYHaY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/73ab9760c962a6dfb9ecd06bcb9fc616.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cjpJH8nYHaY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For the kingdom building, you only get a limited selection of tiles to begin with. To get more, you need to progress through the battles to get them as rewards. Which is interesting on how it works with other systems in the game, like prophecies that let you tweak what enemy waves you'll end up getting, so you can choose to fight tougher enemies for better rewards including better buildings, more money, new spells and so on. But there's also a trader where you can spend some of your built-up cash for buildings, resources and other assorted upgrades.</p>
<p>Quite a few ways to enhance your runs to with meta-progression taken from roguelikes. There's a currency you acquire to unlock special buildings to interact with before you start a run, where you can go through upgrades, there's different kings to unlock and each have their own unique buffs and abilities to unlock and more.</p>
<p>What's the actual goal here? To progress through and survive as many waves as possible, to defeat the bosses that come along. You always know what's coming though, thanks to the timeline bar along the top of the screen that tells you exactly what you'll be facing. Easier said than done though and total efficiency is key here. It's a constant tug of war between ensuring you have enough resources (and the correct resources) to build up your army, as you click around your gaze constantly across your little kingdom to tweak your production.</p>
<p>The only problem with it is that there's currently no mid-run save feature, which feels like an absolutely <em>crazy</em> thing to miss, especially in a strategy game like this. Thankfully, the developers have confirmed it's on the way and the update with it is currently in Beta. Once that's actually released for everyone, it will then get a true double thumbs up from me. Still, it's good without it, but will be actually <em>great</em> with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10427730531754390804gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10427730531754390804gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The King is Watching is a complete time sink in all of the best ways with a very satisfying gameplay loop, and it's a surprising challenge to be able to beat it. With the game tested on Kubuntu Linux 25.04 it runs perfectly out of the box with Proton 9.0-4.</p>
<p>From the press release: "We’ve had amazing support from fans and the community throughout this journey, and we’re beyond thrilled to share The King is Watching with the world," said Semyon Itmaniuk, Head of the Hypnohead Studio. "Embrace the monarchy, and craft a kingdom from the ground up into the most fearsome of them all. Huzzah!"</p>

      <title>Physics-based brawler Stick It to the Stickman from Free Lives arrives August 18</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Free Lives, developers of Broforce and Terra Nil, have confirmed their next game Stick It to the Stickman is set to arrive on August 18th. It will enter Early Access first, with a full release due in approximately 12 months.</p>
<p>What is it? Stick it to the Stickman is a physics-based brawler where you fight minimum wage stickmen to become a CEO. Choose from hundreds of unique moves to construct the perfect combat machine, then battle your way to the top of the corporate ladder. The developers say you will "Fight other CEOs for the prestige of employing the CEO with the biggest muscles. Perform dubiously legal tasks critical to expanding the company, including stealing cars, suppressing protestors and kidnapping building inspectors—all in the name of profit".</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>

<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Wild physics-based stickman combat featuring a vast array of brutal weapons and over-the-top special moves, including fireballs, chainsaws and katanas.</li>
<li>Combines multiple gameplay styles including platforming, brawling, autobattling, delivery, car theft, free-running and kicking people out of windows.</li>
<li>Play solo or with a ‘friend’ and defeat hordes of red stickmen to secure your promotion. But be warned: everybody else wants the job too.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems it will have Native Linux support again too as it was just added as "TBC" on Steam. If not, there's always Proton.</p>

      <title>A Portal dating sim? Yep. Aperture Dating Simulator is set to release on August 28</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sometimes I think I've seen it all, and then along comes a Portal dating sim with Aperture Dating Simulator.</p>
<p>Created by Ashleyanna Rivers, this fully-voiced dating sim is set in Valve's popular Portal universe, but not the same one you know and love. And clearly Valve approve of it, since they're letting it release on Steam. The dev says it's not "your average fan-made Portal game" in an alternate universe that will show you a new Aperture.</p>
<p>You take control of a manufacturing employee thrust out of their element and into maintenance, where you'll meet 8 brand-new personality cores, each with their own special little quirks. There's 18 possible endings to find and over 30 cut-scenes with "a lot this little dating sim parody has to offer" (or so they hope).</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

      <title>Check out the demo for Cult of PiN, a pinball roguelike</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cult of PiN has a seriously cool style that merges pinball with roguelikes, and now you can try it out early.</p>
<p>There's a Windows demo you can run via Proton for now on Steam, or play right in the browser on their itch.io page. The developer mentioned Linux and macOS versions are planned too. This is easily one of the absolute coolest takes on mixing up classic pinball into something new.</p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cult of PiN is a roguelike Pinball game requiring sharp reflexes and strategic combos. Collect powerful Glyphs to enhance your damage, and smash your way through as many stages as you can to claim a place on the global leaderboard.</p>
<p>Master the cradled ramp shot, hit hard-to-reach mission targets, and purchase run-altering mystical Glyphs to beat each table stage, destroying all the bumpers to move onto the next one. Discover hidden bonus tables and unlock new Balls and Glyphs for future runs. Perfect your nudge and trick shot skills to reach Act VI on each table to claim victory. After that, continue playing in endless mode to secure your spot on the leaderboards for each table.</p>

      <title>The Drifter is easily my new favourite point and click adventure</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Drifter from Powerhoof has released, and it is something truly special for the point and click adventure genre that's one not to be missed. <em>Note: a key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>I've long been a fan of the point and click genre, growing up playing some classics on the Amiga. I've also played a lot of modern takes on it, but I never quite get the feeling I did from back then. Until now, that is. The Drifter is truly exceptional and just does about everything right to hook you in. Not only does it have some seriously great pixel art, but the voice acting is truly amazing too.</p>
<p>My favourite thing though? The interface. While I'm sure there's some that will get their pitchforks out to stick me with on this, I played it with a gamepad. I know — sacrilege right? But wait! The Drifter was designed for both sides of the fence. The gamepad interface they designed is impressively easy to use and feels so natural that it made sitting back and relaxing with it just a wonderful experience.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2GiHlkE2z8g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3b55ef55113b5e157d6aab5659d6434e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2GiHlkE2z8g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the first few minutes, it will totally absorb you into the world, especially so thanks to the intro. You have absolutely no idea what's going on, but you really will want to know more. You will need to know more. What was that crazy guy on about? Was he actually just crazy or is there something bigger going on? Why were people firing at you and who are they? So many questions will start popping into your head. It certainly sets the scene nicely for the adventure you're about to go through. And that only continues the more you go into it, as things just start getting plain weird like out of some Netflix sci-fi drama, especially with the loops around death.</p>
<p>The voice acting is what really pulls you in though, mainly thanks to the main character Mick voiced by Adrian Vaughan (but they're all good). There's some great dialogue in there and Vaughan really helps to sell it all, especially with some of the complete silliness that goes on. I'm a bit of a sucker for a deep, gruff but soothing voice. I especially liked the way the conversations flow, with it jumping between characters talking and getting little bits of backstory from Vaughan narrating things and even with the flicking between talking and narrating it all feels so smooth.</p>
<p>It's not just the voice acting though, the soundtrack is brilliant too. Really brings out the atmosphere.</p>
<p>If you're after an adventure that will make you scratch your brain with puzzles, this is not the one, the puzzles here are interesting but more like set-pieces to stop it being a constant run through the story. Most of it is pretty obvious, which is not a bad thing, the puzzles are gentle on your brain to make you feel like you're actually doing something. However, the design is interesting with the puzzles often being done across multiple scenes with you needing various items, often combining them together. The result is some fun item hunting and silly events involving the items you're using.</p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A Pulp Adventure Thriller from the minds that brought you Peridium and Crawl.</li>
<li>An engrossing roller-coaster of a story- Drawing on King, Crichton and Carpenter, with a dash of 70s Aussie grindhouse.</li>
<li>Point 'n Click or Controller- Unique twin-stick controls make The Drifter as comfy to play on the couch as at your PC.</li>
<li>Bursting with raw crunchy pixel art and high-impact animation.</li>
<li>Professionally voice acted, with a brooding dark-synth cinematic score.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>All together from the animations to the voice acting and the slick gamepad interface you owe it to yourself to play this one. Seriously impressive, a double thumbs up from me. Do not skip it. It's going to be hard to enjoy another point and click adventure if it's not up to the quality of The Drifter in future.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support and runs great out of the box. Also Steam Deck Verified. No performance issues or special bugs worth noting.</p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher v2.18.1 brings more bug fixes for GOG and Epic Games on Linux / SteamOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Heroic is one of the best ways to run games from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-play-games-from-gog-and-epic-games-on-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Epic Games, GOG and Amazon on Linux, SteamOS / Steam Deck</a>. v2.18.1 brings bug fixes to make it even smoother.</p>
<p>It's a <em>hotfix</em>, so it's mainly to clear up problems from the last major release. One change they've actually <em>reverted</em> for this release was quite controversial, where Heroic was hiding various versions of Proton by default (except GE-Proton). Now, it only hides Proton Experimental and is an opt-in feature. Part of their reasoning was to keep it simple for users, with GE-Proton using a special set of proton fixes to make games outside of Steam work well. Turns out it caused issues though. More can be read about it in the original <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/pull/4254" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub post</a> and comments.</p>
<p>Additionally they mentioned they've "fixed the Environmental variables table and added a few couple of settings for using WoW64 on Linux and several other fixes and improvements".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9624567661754323284gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9624567661754323284gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Main changes noted:</p>
<blockquote>

      <title>x86 on ARM64 emulator FEX gets some huge gaming improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>FEX is one way to run x86 appps and games on ARM64, with the latest release 2508 bringing some pretty striking performance improvements.</p>
<p>Writing in a <a href="https://fex-emu.com/FEX-2508/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> about "Big juicy JIT optimizations", they showed off two charts of the performance difference versus the previous release and in some cases for gaming it's a huge win. Like with Cyberpunk 2077 seeing a 38.9% improvement which is massive.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7428137801754321418gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7428137801754321418gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14722959531754321417gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14722959531754321417gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Explaining some of the improvements the developers said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"></p>
<p>The majority of this performance uplift has come from call-return stack optimizations, where we are now able to take advantage of the ARM CPU’s own call-return prediction hardware, but we have had a variety of optimizations this month that improve both JIT compilation time in addition to execution time! Additionally now we compile significantly less code since we would have combinatorial explosion of JIT compiles when multiblock was enabled. We have now made it so each individual block of JIT code is freestanding and usually only gets compiled once.</p>
<p>Another improvement this month is the WINE wow64/arm64ec libraries can now take advantage of Apple Silicon’s hardware TSO feature. This happened to not be implemented with the wow64/arm64ec code path. This will significantly improve performance on that hardware in the case that someone spent the effort to run a game in that environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More work also went into supporting anti-tamper tech, with some versions of Denuvo potentially now working too but more work is to be done on that.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA Beta driver 580.65.06 released for Linux with bug fixes and expanded Wayland support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA have released the first Beta for the 580 driver series, with NVIDIA Beta driver 580.65.06 bringing mostly bug fixes. There's also an additional bit of Wayland protocol support included.</p>
<p>Since this is a Beta driver, it's not recommended just yet for everyday use. You'll want to be quite up to date though, with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/nvidia-reveal-more-gpu-driver-security-issues-for-july-2025/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NVIDIA recently revealing more security issues</a> in their drivers.</p>
<p>Highlights from the driver:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause Vulkan applications to hang when destroying swapchains after a lost device event.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could allow atomic commit and other DRM operations to return success status despite having failed due to handling an interrupt: <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/issues/832" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/issues/832</a></li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause GTK 4 applications to crash when using the Vulkan backend on Wayland.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could intermittently cause llama.cpp to crash on exit when using the Vulkan backend: <a href="https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/10528" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/10528</a></li>
<li>Added support for the fifo-v1 Wayland protocol on Vulkan.</li>
<li>Updated GPU clock value reporting in nvidia-settings, NVML, and nvidia-smi to show clocks before thermal and idle slowdowns for better consistency with the equivalent functionality on Windows.</li>
<li>Fixed compatibility with Bigscreen Beyond Head Mounted Displays.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could result in a black screen when setting specific modes on HDMI displays.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused blank or frozen screens under the following conditions: nvidia-drm is loaded with the modeset=1 and fbdev=1 parameters, using a Maxwell or Pascal series GPU, and more than one display device of differing resolutions are connected.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused nvidia-suspend.service to fail when available system memory is low.</li>
<li>Enabled RMIntrLockingMode by default. This feature can help reduce stutter especially when using virtual reality. This feature was originally introduced in the r570 series. It can be disabled by loading nvidia.ko with the `NVreg_RegistryDwords=RMIntrLockingMode=0` kernel module parameter.</li>
<li>Implemented another feature that can reduce time spent in the interrupt top half for low latency display interrupts by deferring the work until later. This feature is experimental and disabled by default. This feature can be enabled by loading nvidia.ko with the `NVreg_RegistryDwords=RmEnableAggressiveVblank=1` kernel module parameter.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause blank rendering on some single-buffered GLX applications when running on Xwayland.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause a kernel use-after-free on pre-Turing GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause OpenGL applications and compositors to stall when using NVIDIA as a PRIME Display Offload sink ("Reverse PRIME"), potentially resulting in a black screen.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that led to increasing memory usage in X11 OpenGL and Vulkan applications after suspend/resume cycles.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause 32-bit x86 applications running on recent builds of glibc to crash on dlopen().</li>
</ul>

      <title>Frostliner announced recently is basically Snowpiercer as a survival city-builder</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Okay, now this is cool. Frostliner puts you in charge of a train in this survival city builder on rails that's practically Snowpiercer. <em>I also only just realised today that Snowpiercer's final Season 4 did actually release…last year. </em></p>
<p>This blends a lot of gameplay elements together that seems quite unique. Your city is constantly moving, with combat elements that has a sort-of tower defense style to it. There's also an events system where all sorts of things can happen, and of course lots can go wrong. The developer said they're hoping to run a playtest later this year to get some feedback.</p>
<p>Check out the first trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5yLJ37k6wQo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/444afc35795e2db761f6a3db911683ed.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5yLJ37k6wQo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Construct a massive train called the Frostliner, which is capable of creating its own train carriages which can then be filled with facilities, and utilise adjacency bonuses which make the train more productive the larger it is.</li>
<li>Roam the frozen landscape, frequently stopping to gather much needed supplies, clear debris and recruit new passengers. However, once the train stops the player is on a timer as their reserved batteries powering the trains heaters quickly drain.</li>
<li>The train runs on fuel and the player must do whatever they can to keep it fueled and running.</li>
<li>Research new technologies, facilities and improvements such as the corpse furnace which allows passengers to be “converted” into the much needed fuel that the engine needs. Unlock new tiers of passengers with much greater demands, but more powerful bonuses and facilities.</li>
<li>The train is a treasure trove for the survivors and entities in the wasteland and they will do what they can to take the train. Any of these enemies you don’t manage to destroy will become pursuers, following behind your train until you are inevitably forced to stop. Increase the trains speed to stay one step ahead, or invest in defences to eradicate the threats before they become a problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>Right to the top of my wishlist you go.</p>

      <title>Click through the joy of opening up mystery boxes in Unboxathon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you love your chilled casual clicker games, Unboxathon could be a good one for you with a demo available to try.</p>
<p>What is it? A sweet content-filled game about opening up mysterious boxes. You have no idea what you're going to find. It's a clicker / incremental game, so it's all about collecting things to keep on upgrading to get more shiny new things. Only this one is about opening up boxes. In the demo you get access to 2 out of the 6 unlockable boxes, and 10% of the tech tree unlocks compared to the full version.</p>
<p>Check out their teaser trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="u-lOd6tW2Qo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/76e77eea789f1959070b26811f6a09b2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/u-lOd6tW2Qo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pop ‘Til You Drop: </strong>Pop all manner of bubbles, big, small and with different gameplay effects and bonuses to earn additional mystery boxes.</li>
<li><strong>Literal Boxes Full of Loot: </strong>Open up boxes of different rarities, including “Magical Relics” or “Luxury Goods” to get increasingly valuable loot and shiny, collectible items.</li>
<li><strong>Upgrade, Upgrade, Upgrade: </strong>Sell those items for profit and use those earnings to unlock incremental upgrades affecting your bubble bonuses, special bubbles, box quality, and more.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The demo worked perfectly with Proton 9.</p>

      <title>Dice A Million channels Balatro vibes into game-breaking dice rolling</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a fresh demo released, Dice A Million looks like it will grab a lot of my time in future. It gives off Balatro vibes for the design, as you roll dice and attempt to break the game with all sorts of combinations to watch numbers go up. <em>Delicious.</em></p>
<p>So what exactly is it? As the developer said: "Dice A Million is a roguelike deckbuilder about rolling dice to try and get to a million points. Combine the effects of more than 100 different dice and discover powerful synergies. Get through ever-increasing debts and fearsome bosses that will require a perfect symbiosis in your deck in order to be beaten."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mmJnr785cFk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/155e433ba5dd6fd893ca511bda9f25e3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mmJnr785cFk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Randomly generated runs, roguelike style!</li>
<li>More than 100 dice with unique effects.</li>
<li>More than 50 rings with passive effects to completement your build.</li>
<li>6 different enchantments that could drastically modify the behaviour of your dice.</li>
<li>Many different hands (classes) to choose from.</li>
<li>Hundreds of unlocks and secret achievements.</li>
<li>20 one-time use cards to help you fight RNG.</li>
<li>Millions of points.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer also announced they're working with 2 Left Thumbs to help with publishing. It's due out sometime later this year and should run fine with Proton.</p>

      <title>Gyro through a collection of handcrafted mazes in the Steam Deck exclusive Game With Balls</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The second game from Geert Verhoeff that's only meant to be played on a Steam Deck is Game With Balls, a collection of handcrafted mazes to gyro through. A demo is available for the game right now to get a taste of it.</p>
<p>Check out their teaser below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7svS7yqUZ2o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7b81995aefbc6ad34248a8e14b258650.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7svS7yqUZ2o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Game With Balls! A little collection of handcrafted mazes for the Steam Deck, where you use gyro movement to navigate one of the balls through them. Are you the one with the best time among your friends—or even in the world?!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Over 40 levels handcrafted in the real world using real wood, drawings, and other materials, then converted for your digital pleasure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An additional 10 challenges that not only test you on the time it takes to complete each level but also on other objectives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keeps track of your fastest times using Steam Leaderboards, so you can see if you’re the quickest among your friends—or the fastest in the world!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collect all secrets in every level to not only be the fastest but also the ultimate completist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Original soundtrack to relax to (or maybe not when you’re trying to beat your friends’ times).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting to see, although probably only a small market for such a thing. Previously they released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943100/Better_With_A_Friend/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Better With A Friend</a>, collection of hand drawn mini-games for the Steam Deck which only has 10 user reviews on Steam.</p>

      <title>Queer Games Bundle 2025 is live on itch.io</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>At a time where supporting creators of anything that might be deemed adult content or NSFW is more important than ever, the Queer Games Bundle 2025 is live.</p>
<p>With all the payment processor issues ongoing <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/mastercard-release-a-statement-about-game-stores-payment-processors-and-adult-content/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">across Steam, itch.io</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/zoom-platform-also-had-payment-processor-issues-say-they-have-no-plans-to-remove-any-titles/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ZOOM Platform</a> - it's only a matter of time until the target for having games removing is expanded to include queer-focused games too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16754351881754302323gol1.png"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the bundle page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we had the budget of an AAA game, we could give every solo developer in this bundle a livable wage multiple times over for a year and every single team a massive funding boost. Imagine what the developers and artists in this bundle could create a year from now if they weren’t worried about starving or how to pay their rent this month. </p>
<p>Purchasing the Queer Games Bundle is a direct action that you can take right now to support queer people in a life-changing way, and in exchange, you get over 600 amazing, heartfelt, fun, and radical games and artworks.  In a chaotic, grim time with new attacks daily on queer and especially trans people, queer art is something that does more than simply keep you alive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">There's two options to purchase:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://itch.io/b/3062/queer-games-bundle-2025-with-10-option" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The full $60 option for those than can afford it</a></li>
<li><a href="https://itch.io/b/3063/queer-games-bundle-2025-pay-what-you-can-edition" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">A cheaper $10 pay what you can option </a></li>

      <title>ZOOM Platform also had payment processor issues, say they &#34;have no plans to remove any titles&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ZOOM Platform that sell a lot of retro games, as well as publish upgrades for retro games, announced they've also been a target of payment processors for adult games.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.zoom-platform.com/news/preserving-and-protecting-artistic-freedom" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As you are likely aware, there have been a number of adult title de-listings across the industry. One of our payment processors made us aware that a "fellow member of the industry" was concerned about our content. After we heard from the payment processor, we immediately engaged in lengthy discussions with both PayPal and Stripe. We worked with our contacts at the aforementioned payment processors to develop a tripartite solution to ensure the right to free speech and freedom of expression as well as protect the safety of our valued customers and partners.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They've now added opt-in two-factor authentication, they're looking at alternative payment options and also a wallet system. While also saying they have "no plans" to remove any titles and will "do absolutely everything in our power to prevent such de-listings".</p>
<p>In an email to GamingOnLinux, one of their team said they expect the de-listing situation to expand further and in their discussions titles like "Grand Theft Auto, Duke Nukem, and Saints Row were described as potentially at risk".</p>
<p>As we already expected, NSFW games being a target was only ever going to be a first step. <em>There's always more to it.</em></p>

      <title>Heroes of Might and Magic 2 project fheroes2 version 1.1.10 has been released</title>
      <author>fheroes2</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dear players of Heroes of Might and Magic 2! Today we are happy to announce a new version of the <strong><strong>fheroes2</strong></strong> game engine - <strong><strong>1.1.10</strong></strong> (<a href="https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2/releases/tag/1.1.10" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2/releases/tag/1.1.10</a>)! This update brings several art enhancements, Editor fixes, and more!</p>
<p>This release includes multiple improvements to the <strong><strong>Editor</strong></strong>. First, the team fixed several crashes related to reaching the object placement limit. We also resolved a few passability and rendering issues. Lastly, the Castle’s options window now supports cancelling all changes made there.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10535542011754301309gol1.png"/></p>
<p>The team reworked several in-game dialogs, updated <strong><strong>buttons</strong></strong> for various languages, made buttons resizable in many cases, and fixed font inconsistencies. We also added sorting for save files by name or date, and introduced an icon for the <strong><strong>Virtual Keyboard</strong></strong> button.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19572054401754301331gol1.png"/></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21197202721754301351gol1.png"/></p>
<p>This release features numerous art updates. The <strong><strong>Magic Book</strong></strong> now shows a visual indicator when no pages are available. We fixed white pixels in the <strong><strong>Sorceress castle sky and rainbow</strong></strong>, and added missing bay artwork for the <strong><strong>Wizard castle</strong></strong>. Additionally, we improved the <strong><strong>Swordsman's walking animation</strong></strong> by adding a new frame.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8664132941754301381gol1.png"/><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12623044641754301382gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Alongside these changes, the team updated translations for several languages, resolved more issues on the Adventure Map, and closed over <em><em>40 issues</em></em> since the last release. As a nice bonus, we have included a new community-made map in the fheroes2 bundle: <strong><strong>Good, Bad, Magne</strong></strong>, and we updated the Eruption map in the bundle.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy the updated version of the engine. Thank you so much for supporting the project!</p>
<p>Don't forget, that you also need to grab the data from <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_2_gold_edition" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG.com</a> which it requires to run.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released the data for the Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey for July 2025, showing the Linux user share making gains towards hitting 3%.</p>
<p>We continue to see the slow but steady increase in the overall Linux user share on the desktop, good news for the health of the platform as more people realise just how good Linux is now.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's the current operating system share on Steam for July 2025:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 95.23% -0.44%</li>
<li>Linux 2.89% +0.32% </li>
<li>macOS 1.88% +0.12%</li>
</ul>
<p>If you take a look at our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated Steam Tracker page</a> for the charts, we can see that steady increase.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15167707281754127729gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15167707281754127729gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Plus the breakdown of Linux distributions that were popular across July 2025 on Steam. This is possibly the most expansive list Valve has given for the distribution breakdown yet.</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 28.31% -2.73%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 10.82% +0.33%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 22.1 64 bit 7.83% -0.07%</li>

      <title>Mastercard release a statement about game stores, payment processors and adult content</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 23:36 BST</strong> - Valve provided a statement to GamingOnLinux in response:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Mastercard did not communicate with Valve directly, despite our request to do so. Mastercard communicated with payment processors and their acquiring banks. Payment processors communicated this with Valve, and we replied by outlining Steam’s policy since 2018 of attempting to distribute games that are legal for distribution. Payment processors rejected this, and specifically cited Mastercard’s Rule 5.12.7 and risk to the Mastercard brand. See <a href="https://www.mastercard.us/content/dam/public/mastercardcom/na/global-site/documents/mastercard-rules.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.mastercard.us/content/dam/public/mastercardcom/na/global-site/documents/mastercard-rules.pdf</a>.</div>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below…</em></p>
<p>Mastercard have today released a short statement to clarify their position on adult content across game stores.</p>
<p>To bring up to speed on the recent situation — <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/valve-gets-pressured-by-payment-processors-with-a-new-rule-for-game-devs-and-various-adult-games-removed/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on July 16th I reported on Valve removing certain adult content</a> from the Steam store (with a statement from Valve). Later in July, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/game-store-itch-io-has-deindexed-adult-content-due-to-payment-processor-scrutiny/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">itch.io ended up deindexing adult content</a> noting the same pressure from payment processors, with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/itch-io-to-reindex-free-adult-content-as-they-search-for-new-payment-processors/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">itch.io now going through to reindex free adult content</a>.</p>
<p>The pressure on payment providers has come from <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/media-release-payment-gateways" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Collective Shout</a>, that claim they're a "grassroots movement challenging the objectification of women and sexualisation of girls in media, advertising and popular culture".</p>
<p>It wasn't entirely clear exactly which payment processors have been putting the pressure on game stores, with Mastercard now putting out a <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/us/en/news-and-trends/press/2025/august/clarifying-recent-headlines-on-gaming-content.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a> that I've copied below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mastercard has not evaluated any game or required restrictions of any activity on game creator sites and platforms, contrary to media reports and allegations.</p>
<p>Our payment network follows standards based on the rule of law. Put simply, we allow all lawful purchases on our network. At the same time, we require merchants to have appropriate controls to ensure Mastercard cards cannot be used for unlawful purchases, including illegal adult content.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>So this seems like Mastercard are basically saying "it's not us".</em></p>

      <title>itch.io to reindex free adult content as they search for new payment processors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The ongoing saga of payment processors pushing game stores continues, with <a href="http://itch.io" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">itch.io</a> now reindexing free adult content but some issues remain. Previously, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/game-store-itch-io-has-deindexed-adult-content-due-to-payment-processor-scrutiny/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">itch.io announced they were forced</a> to deindex (remove from search results) adult content due to pressure from their payment providers.</p>
<p>In a post on the <a href="https://itch.io/t/5149036/reindexing-adult-nsfw-content" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">itch.io forum</a>, founder Leaf Corcoran noted that discussions with payment processors is ongoing. Paid adult content will be re-introduced much slower "to ensure we can confidently support the widest range of creators in the long term". The itch store is also now getting a new content warning system for pages tagged as "NSFW" (not safe for work).</p>
<p>One payment processor mentioned by Corcoran is Stripe, which itch.io has used for over 10 years. They spoke with Stripe, who mentioned they are not able to support "content designed for sexual gratification" and Stripe provided a further message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stripe is currently unable to support sexually explicit content due to restrictions placed on them by their banking partners, despite card networks generally supporting adult content (with the appropriate registrations). Stripe has indicated that they hope to be able to support adult content in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Corcoran confirmed itch.io are looking at other payment partners for payment Stripe cannot process.</p>

      <title>Valve finally upgraded the Steam trailer video player, re-encoding around 400,000 videos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Steam trailer video player was old and not especially great, but now perhaps it might actually work a lot better with a big upgrade.</p>
<p>It brings an upgraded interface with a UI that adapts to different devices, preview images when seeking through a video, faster seeking / scrubbing and transitioning to full screen, smarter bandwith use and improved handling of different aspect ratios. You can see Valve's example video below of it in action for PEAK:</p>
<div class="ckeditor-html5-video" style="text-align: center;">
<video controls="controls" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14205840121754053334gol1.webm"></video>
</div>
<p>As part of the upgrade, Valve said they had to go back through and re-encode every trailer that could be shown, which they said ended up "being around 400,000 video files". Whew, that's a lot huh? Some videos might be quite a low resolution though, due to being uploaded years ago where Valve don't have the original.</p>
<p>Valve suggest developers that uploaded trailer prior to Summer 2020 may want to re-upload, so it can be sorted into the correct format and give Steam users a better quality version.</p>
<p>At the same time Valve are reminding developers that they may want to hide old trailers, and ensure they actually show gameplay — get to the gameplay as quickly as possible.</p>

      <title>Tycoon strategy game Car Park Capital gets a new trailer and publisher announcement</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Car Park Capital is an absolutely genius idea for a tycoon building sim, getting you to build up the greatest car parks ever.</p>
<p>What is it? A new but old-school styled tycoon game where you turn walkable towns into parking lots and use propaganda to convince people to pay you for it. It's your job to convince the citizens of various towns that they <em>need</em> them, and then make them rather large and silly while making a tidy profit of course.</p>
<p>I showed this off on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/build-the-greatest-car-parks-ever-in-the-retro-tycoon-styled-car-park-capital/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux back in June 2024</a>, and it's coming along nicely. It's doing so well they've pulled in a publisher with MicroProse Software which seems thoroughly fitting, considering it's inspired some of their classics. Check out the brand new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Ae3MtHDfSr4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2141affd4d23f69c3da8a89a237792d1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Ae3MtHDfSr4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer mentioned they've now left their day job to work full time on it with MicroProse handling marketing, localization, funding and more.</p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Real-time simulation with hundreds of vehicles and (bald) citizens, all bustling around your growing parking empire.</li>
<li>Build the dream: Demolish homes, buy land, and design massive parking lots, flat or vertical, with 3D construction tools.</li>
<li>Mind-reading tech: Tap into any citizen’s thoughts. Are they buying in? Or just angry about your oil rig next to their child’s school?</li>
<li>Propaganda tools: Convert skeptics into carbrains with megaphone slogans, billboard campaigns, and majestic car-themed statues.</li>
<li>Appease the people: When traffic hits critical mass, distract them with your glorious Ferris Wheel for cars.</li>
<li>Anti-car resistance: Outsmart protesters before they tank your approval ratings.</li>
<li>Stat-o-matic: Track every number a proper tycoon craves. Higher fees? Bigger oil consumption? That’s progress!</li>
<li>Drill, baby, drill: Because a full tank is a full heart.</li>
<li>Fight public transport: Who needs trains and walkability when every inch of the map can be asphalt?</li>
<li>Moddable: Tinker under the hood with Lua support for content and script modifications.</li>
</ul>

      <title>The new Nexus Mods app adds collections creation, library searching and more improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Work continues to expand the cross-platform open source Nexus Mods app, which will eventually replace Vortex with v0.14.3 out now with new features.</p>
<p>This latest release should make working with modding bigger games easier, as they've added in the ability to create collections. Enabling you to enable / disabled a set quickly. Sounds like a really great feature for quickly changing your games with various downloaded mods.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9243383701754051812gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9243383701754051812gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>And, one of the most requested features is also finally here. You can search your installed mods via the Library, and other sections will be coming "in a future release".</p>
<p>The rest of the info from the GitHub:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>More Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The app will now load the latest game version data every 30 minutes in the background.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technical Changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added validation to app settings to prevent bad values from being saved.</li>
<li>Collection metadata will now refresh each time the page is loaded in the app.</li>
<li>Improve error reporting for the Nexus Mods API requests.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug which prevented the app from properly recognising GOG DLCs.</li>
<li>Fixed an exception that would often appear when viewing External Changes.</li>
<li>Improved the error reporting around "Missing archive" errors to provide more useful information that will help fix it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Known Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Once a collection created by the user is removed from the app, it can no longer be edited, even if it was exported to the website.</li>
<li>Exported collections do not include a valid version number.</li>
<li>The game version is not checked when adding a collection, meaning you can install outdated mods without being warned.</li>
<li>The sort order for some columns does not work as expected.</li>
<li>The table header sorting and active tab states are not saved and are reset each time the view is loaded.</li>
<li>When deleting the second-to-last editable collection, an error message will show. This can be ignored.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Free and open source 2D graphics editor PixiEditor 2.0 out now with Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PixiEditor is a free and open source fully-featured 2D graphics editor, now better than ever with the 2.0 release out that brings Linux support.</p>
<p>The original creator mentioned their mission with it is to "give the world free and open source, offline, Universal 2D Image editor, that can do as much as expensive proprietary creative software such as Adobe's, if not more" and they believe version 2.0 "already outpaces Photoshop in certain areas".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5hmW2ZKO1YY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5be918df8606e6672e8daa308dc9ce30.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5hmW2ZKO1YY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it (from GitHub):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Toolsets for any scenario</strong></p>
<p>PixiEditor 2.0 comes by default with 3 toolsets:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pixel art</strong> - it contains tool suited for pixel-perfect scenarios</li>
<li><strong>Painting</strong> - basic painting tools, soft brushes, anti aliased shapes</li>
<li><strong>Vector</strong> - shapes and paths for creating vectors</li>
</ul>
<p>All <strong>toolsets can be used on one canvas</strong>. Mix vector with raster. Export to png, jpg, svg, gif, mp4 and more!</p>
<p><strong>Animations</strong></p>
<p>Version 2.0 comes with a timeline and animation capabilities. You can create frame by frame animations or use nodes to animate your custom shaders. Key frame animations with vectors are on our roadmap.</p>
<p><strong>Nodes</strong></p>
<p>Node render system is what powers such extensive capabilities. All layers, effects and the layer structure are nodes or a result of its connections. PixiEditor exposes node graph for every document, so you are free to customize your image however you want and create procedural art/animations!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds awesome and looks great! Nice to see it get Linux support.</p>
<p>You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/PixiEditor/PixiEditor" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2218560/PixiEditor/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://pixieditor.net/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Official Site</a>.</p>

      <title>Lossless Scaling Frame Generation for Linux hits 1.0 with a new UI making it easier than ever</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developer of the unofficial Lossless Scaling Frame Generation for Linux project announced the first official release, which comes with a new UI.</p>
<p>It's also easier than ever to actually install it, and thanks to the UI it's simpler to make it actually work now too. However, the UI might seem a little familiar, because it was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/theres-now-an-unofficial-gui-for-lossless-scalings-frame-generation-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">originally a separate project</a> that has been merged into the main lsfg-vk project now. Nice and tidy.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19130422201754050082gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19130422201754050082gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>From the GitHub page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What's new?</strong></p>
<p>This is the first release of lsfg-vk. It contains the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for LSFG 3.1, the latest frame generation model</li>
<li>Performance Mode, a lighter variant of LSFG 3.1</li>
<li>Flow Scale customization</li>
<li>An easy-to-use graphical user interface for customization</li>
<li>One config file to manage all games</li>
<li>Manual environment variables for configuration as well</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Thankfully, the actual release now comes with a few packages for Linux distributions including Ubuntu, Fedora and Arch Linux. Also a Flatpak without the UI is available too, as is installing it manually. As a reminder though, you need to own Lossless Scaling on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/Lossless_Scaling/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking to users in the Lossless Scaling Discord, the developer of the Linux project, "Pancake" said about future plans:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Future updates</strong></p>
<p>The journey does not end here.. far from it actually. I still have a bunch of things I want to add to this project so let's take a moment to talk about those.</p>
<p>Future updates may include Dual GPU support (which will not be as good as on Windows due to some Linux/Vulkan constraints unfortunately!). I may or may not also add older versions of LSFG as those seem to shine on some rare games and especially older systems. I've already mentioned adaptive mode, but fractional multipliers are also something I am considering (Adaptive Mode <em>should</em> also be fixing any framepacing issues and seemingly broken gamescope/handheld titles). There are also some huge performance improvements in the oven which should improve all modes performance by 2x-4x. Finally I will be adding some quality of life features such as specifying a proton game by it's exe file, or having separate names for presets than their activation title. Perhaps we will even see a button or hotkey to activate frame generation similar to Windows (I don't know how feasible that is though).</p>
<p>I will likely be releasing these new features in smaller "test" versions that may or may not be announced here, so keep an eye out!</p>
<p>Once again thank you everyone for your support on this project and I hope I was able to make your Linux gaming experience more enjoyable!</p>

      <title>Valve reveal the Steam sales and events for the first half of 2026</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While we're nowhere near done with 2025 yet, Valve have revealed the first lot of sales event for 2026 so here's what you need to know.</p>
<p>Valve do a lot of events outside of their big seasonal sales, including plenty for specific genres. They give the dates out ahead of times, so developers can prepare for them. Helps us too, since we know when to save for. For next year, Valve also said they're "experimenting with running Spotlight Fests, which let us go deeper with more niche themes over a shorter period of time". These will appear in the Discounts &amp; Events section on the front page.</p>
<p>Here's the list of 2026 events currently:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>January 2026:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Detective Fest: January 12 - January 19</p>
</li>
<li>

      <title>Valve makes Steam Library customisation a little easier in the latest Steam Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a new Steam Beta Client update for Desktop and SteamOS / Steam Deck, making customising your Steam games a bit easier.</p>
<p>Games now have their own dedicated tab in the properties menu for customisation, giving you a single standard place to change the game artwork. Not only that, but they've also added a special text box for you to add a custom name for sorting your Steam Library differently to the game name. This special name you add is <em>not</em> shown, it's purely for display sorting, something that many have been asking Valve to add. <em>An interesting way to do it.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/780148021754048761gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/780148021754048761gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21106417611754048762gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/21106417611754048762gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>The pictures above are how it looks on Desktop.</p>
<p>The Desktop changelog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added a Customization tab to game properties. The Customization tab allows users to view and set custom artwork for the game and set a custom sort title that will be used instead of the actual title when sorting games in the library.</li>
<li>Store menu - fixed blur issue for users with GPU acceleration turned off.</li>
<li>Store menu - Top Genres should now be more relevant and dynamic.</li>
<li>Store menu - added Store Home link.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that sometimes caused chat tabs to not contain the name and avatar of the chat participant.</li>
<li>Fixed context menus showing empty space at some UI scales.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Big Picture Mode</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed UI scale adjustments sometimes resetting scaling back to auto.</li>
<li>Fixed Big Picture Mode window changing size when UI scaling is adjusted.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Game Recording</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed keyboard shortcuts not working in Recordings &amp; Screenshots dialog.</li>
<li>Fixed export failing for lower resolution recordings.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Linux</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Steam UI scale not updating with system DPI changes in XWayland.</li>
<li>Fixed a case where steam would freeze and fail to recover after a process crash.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And for SteamOS / Steam Deck:</p>
<blockquote><strong>General</strong>
<ul>
<li>Added a Customization tab to game properties. The Customization tab allows users to set a custom sort title that will be used instead of the actual title when sorting games in the library.</li>
<li>Fixed a case where steam would freeze and fail to recover after a process crash.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Desktop</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Customization tab in desktop mode also allows users to view and set custom artwork for the game.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Here&#39;s the most played games on Steam Deck for July 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A fresh month is here so time to take a look at what has been popular over the last month on Steam Deck, and time for you to tell us what you've been playing.</p>
<p>Personally, I've been playing quite a lot of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">PEAK</a> and it's not surprising to see it so high at number 5. It's a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/co-op-climbing-game-peak-is-a-truly-great-time-with-friends/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">seriously fun time with a few friends</a> and we've been putting lots hours into it and still haven't managed to get through a full run yet, mostly because we're all <em>idiots</em>. Someone always has a habit of wandering off, and we're determined to rescue them and then lots of stupid things happen.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19133399591754047971gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19133399591754047971gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8456864781754047975gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/8456864781754047975gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>If you haven't checked out PEAK yet, make sure you do. Excellent co-op chaos. Double thumbs up from me.</p>
<p>From Valve's official data for Jul 3, 2025 - Aug 1, 2025 here's what's been played the most cut down to the top 50. All links direct to Steam, along with their Steam Deck Verified rating.</p>

      <title>Developer of PlayStation 1 emulator DuckStation threatens &#34;removing Linux support entirely&#34; but not yet</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems the main developer of the PlayStation 1 emulator DuckStation is not happy with Linux packaging, threatening to remove Linux support.</p>
<p>As quick a bit of background - the project was previously under the open source GPL license, but was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/playstation-1-emulator-duckstation-changes-license-for-no-commercial-use-and-no-derivatives/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changed in September last year</a> to a more restrictive license. This was due to people violating the old license, which isn't exactly going to stop anyone violating a new license but anyway…</p>
<p>On the official GitHub a <a href="https://github.com/stenzek/duckstation/commit/30df16cc767297c544e1311a3de4d10da30fe00c" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">change</a> was made by Connor "stenzek" McLaughlin to remove the PKGBUILD for Arch Linux. In the change description stenzek noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I originally provided this an alternative to the broken AUR packages.</p>
<p>However, it seems that Arch users would rather use broken packages and keep complaining to me instead of their packager. I specifically forbid packages for DuckStation (see README.md), and there's no way to request removal of these packages without handing my details over to a distribution I want nothing to do with.</p>
<p>So this is step one. <strong>Next step will be removing Linux support entirely</strong>, because I'm sick of the headaches and hacks for an operating system that only compromises 2% of the userbase, and I don't even use myself. But I'm hoping the Linux community will be reasonable, because as someone giving up my free time and not being compensated in any way, I shouldn't have to deal with this.</p>
<p>Just grep the source for "wayland" and you'll see what I mean.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Emphasis ours.</em></p>
<p>However, despite what clearly looked like a threat to just remove Linux support is not exactly true (not yet anyway). While it certainly reads like that was their plan (there's not really any other way to read into such a thing), in the official Discord they later said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since people seem to be spreading misinformation (yay), let's make some things clear:</p>
<ol>
<li>Linux support is not being removed from DuckStation, I have no immediate plans to do that.,</li>
<li>I've created a deletion request for the AUR package that is causing headaches, if they can remove it, that solves everything and we can go back to business as usual.,</li>
<li>If they don't, then we'll see. I don't really feel like playing a cat and mouse game of making changes that prevent it from building/running in that environment, it's easier to just walk away.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>What a messy situation this emulator has been.</p>

      <title>Battlefield 6 will be a unplayable on Linux systems due to the anti-cheat</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just in case you were curious - no you will not be able to play Battlefield 6 on any Linux powered system including SteamOS.</p>
<p>Why? Anti-cheat strikes again! It was very much expected for this one, since it's an Electronic Arts (EA) title but now it is confirmed. It will be using EA's newer EA Javelin Anticheat which actively blocks Linux platforms from playing.</p>
<p>As per the Steam store page that's now live, it will have Kernel-Level anti-cheat, which in the updated official <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/faq" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ</a> notes it's Javelin. So <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our curated anti-cheat page</a> has been updated to now list it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/157393981754045943gol1.jpg"/><br/>
Pictured - Battlefield 6</p>
<p>In other related news, one interesting point about Battlefield 6 is its use of open source. They're using <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> for their "Portal" system to allow creators to do all sorts of crazy things with the game. As confirmed in their recent video that you can see below. Godot is shown clearly at 3:04.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="92CHDiFW0wA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c4d7c72fdb582e06131725ec6a8d042e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/92CHDiFW0wA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Pretty amazing to see such huge developers now using the cross-platform and open source Godot.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Even more game industry consolidation going on. Atari has entered into an agreement with Thunderful Group AB to acquire most of it. As per the press release Atari will pay around €4.5 million (~$5.1M USD) to own approximately 82% of the outstanding shares and votes of Thunderful becoming the major shareholder.</p>
<p>Wade Rosen, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Atari, SA said about the deal: "This Transaction marks another important milestone in Atari's development with the expansion of its publishing and development capabilities in the European region.

      <title>Sony sues Tencent over Light of Motiram calling it a &#34;slavish clone&#34; of the Horizon Zero Dawn series</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It was only a matter of time really on this one. Sony have now formally begun legal action against Tencent for Light of Motiram.</p>
<p>Filed on July 25th, the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.453426/gov.uscourts.cand.453426.1.0.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">lawsuit</a> certainly doesn't pull any punches jumping right into calling it "a slavish clone of SIE’s immensely popular, award-winning Horizon series of video games". Sony are seeking to prevent the release of the game, along with seeking damages of "up to $150,000 for each separate work in the Horizon Franchise infringed".</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6prk0Jxg7Cw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">recent trailer</a> does look shockingly similar, as does all of their promotional material, as pointed out very clearly by Sony in the lawsuit. In <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/light-of-motiram-takes-horizon-zero-dawn-and-turns-it-into-a-co-op-survival-game/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my original article</a> about the game I even said "The copying here is pretty blatant" and it really is. Everything about it screams they wanted to make a Horizon game.</p>
<p>Reading further into it, representatives from Tencent (a claim from Sony) did actually approach them to discuss licensing the Horizon franchise in March 2024 at GDC. Here Tencent "pitched a project to SIE, wherein they outlined Tencent's desire to license SIE's intellectual property rights in the Horizon Franchise to create a mobile video game set in the Horizon universe" noting that the team involved were "[d]ie-hardfans" of the franchise.</p>

<p>Clones and games inspired directly by popular games are everywhere, they appear every day. However, this looks like it's probably just a bit too close especially with the creature and character designs, even if they're going for a different gameplay style with it being a co-op survival game. So it will be very interesting to see what happens as a result of this one.</p>

      <title>Cerebral psychological horror s.p.l.i.t from the dev of Buckshot Roulette is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Costing less than £3, here's your chance at some cheap thrills with the release of s.p.l.i.t from Buckshot Roulette developer Mike Klubnika. It's properly weird in the best kind of way and it won't take you long to complete either, good for a single run one evening.</p>
<p>What you get is an intense 90-minute or so psychological-horror-hacker game. s.p.l.i.t, plunges you into the dark, sickly world of cybercrime, as you attempt to gain access to an unethical superstructure, and once in - execute a devastating malware attack. One I'm sure plenty of Linux fans will appreciate with the keyboard-driven raw command-line interactions, wrapped up in Klubnika's trademark dystopian, low-fi audiovisual stylings.</p>

<li>Detailed command prompt hacking puzzles with an emphasis on traditional inputs.</li>

</ul>

      <title>Seriously cool car combat game FUMES has entered Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>FUMES really impressed me with the demo, and now you can jump in and blow some vehicles up in this fast-paced single-player car combat game. The demo was recently updated too and works great with Proton.</p>
<p>The initial release comes with quite a lot of content including 12 cars, 12 weapons, 3 giant bosses, 12 mini bosses, 3 different types of anomalies to discover and more. FUMES is very much a game like the classics both in terms of style and gameplay, reminds me of a lot of similar games I played back in the days of the original PlayStation.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HvQr6nI5mdI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/50a650fe3538e1b1b08337fe3565ec2c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HvQr6nI5mdI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The roadmap they've shared has lots of goodies planned for the game too. More activities and racing modes, melee combat, engine swapping, more exploration, more end-game content, a full proper story and much more. We might also see it get mod support and online co-op but they're not promising those.</p>
<p>It's seriously ace, you should grab it.</p>

      <title>SoulGame Studio release Flash classics in the Swords &amp; Souls Legacy Collection</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The new Swords &amp; Souls Legacy Collection from SoulGame Studio brings five Flash classics back with a Steam release. I'm sure a fair few readers will remember these, I certainly do. Now playable properly on modern systems in full-screen 16:9 for the first time.</p>
<p>Each title in the Swords &amp; Souls Legacy Collection offers a unique spin on action, adventure, and humour, all tied together by SoulGame Studio’s trademark charm and the unifying ‘Souls’ theme. While there isn’t a single overarching storyline across the five titles, each game features its own distinct world, characters and gameplay style.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DPPUsHC-J-c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6b55737ede1fe0877d326821a32d6734.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DPPUsHC-J-c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The games included are:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4><strong>Swords &amp; Souls</strong></h4>
<p>In this iconic RPG-training hybrid, design your Soul from the ground up, train them in skill-based mini-games, and prove your mettle in the deadly Arena. Hone reflexes, level up abilities, and unlock powerful gear as you face increasingly tougher foes and rise through the ranks. With charming animations, quirky humor, and deep character progression, <em>Swords &amp; Souls</em> stands tall as a Flash-era legend, and now it's back, better than ever.</p>
<h4><strong>Rogue Soul</strong></h4>
<p>Become the most wanted rogue in this fast-paced action-runner where style is everything. Sprint, slide, and slash your way through city rooftops and dodge enemy patrols as you collect loot and grow your notoriety. With responsive controls, acrobatic moves, and an ever-expanding list of treasures to uncover, <em>Rogue Soul</em> delivers a thrilling blend of precision and personality. Robbing from the rich has never been this slick.</p>
<h4><strong>Rogue Soul 2</strong></h4>
<p>The rogue returns, bigger, faster, and more dangerous. <em>Rogue Soul 2</em> builds on everything that made the original great with sprawling environments, new enemy types, powerful upgrades, and challenging boss encounters. As you explore vast new areas filled with traps, treasures, and secrets, you’ll unlock cosmetic gear, complete quests, and perfect your rogue’s moveset.</p>
<h4><strong>The Soul Driver</strong></h4>
<p>Buckle up for mayhem in <em>The Soul Driver</em>, a high-octane chase game where you're a fugitive with nothing to lose. Customize your ride, take on daring challenges, and smash through 42 miles of chaos as you flee an increasingly desperate police force. From roadblocks and helicopters to comically intense upgrades, this game delivers nonstop laughs and thrills. Can you make it to the border before the law catches up?</p>
<h4><strong>The Gentleman</strong></h4>
<p>Put your monocle on and prepare for refined platforming. In <em>The Gentleman</em>, gravity is just a suggestion as you gently stroll, leap, and float through clever puzzle-platformer levels using nothing but your umbrella and wit. This elegantly tricky title is packed with head-scratching levels and stylish charm. With its dashing hero and unique mechanics, it’s a love letter to players who like their challenges served with sophistication.</p>

      <title>Stardock Entertainment revealed Elemental: Reforged bringing together multiple games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Stardock Entertainment have announced Elemental: Reforged, which is kinda of like a super remaster of three different games to finally realize their vision.</p>
<p>It brings together the 4x series Elemental that was split into three games across Elemental: War of Magic, Fallen Enchantress, and Sorcerer King. Stardock said their original plan conceived back in 2008 was limited by the technology of the time and so this brings a modernized 64bit game engine to deliver on their original vision. There will be some game mechanics from each in the series, along with entirely new features. Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QHOH_iLe_Z8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d59135d6bec49eb9d610cc2509c1915c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QHOH_iLe_Z8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“With Elemental: Reforged, we’re finally able to deliver the original design we wanted,” said Brad Wardell, CEO of Stardock Entertainment and lead designer of the original Elemental game. “As we developed Elemental, we realized that the design wouldn’t fit in a 32-bit game and pared it down to into Elemental: War of Magic, which still had challenges fitting in 32-bit memory space. So then we made Elemental: Fallen Enchantress, which did much better but was still a shadow of what we had designed. Then we made Elemental: Sorcerer King where we focused on the crafting and quest elements of the original design. Now, thanks to remastering the engine to 64-bit, we can actually make the full game we originally envisioned in 2008.”</p>
<p>Elemental: Reforged Highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unified Elemental Experience. Brings together the strategic depth, smart AI, and rich gameplay from Fallen Enchantress, the immersive crafting and quest systems from Sorcerer King, and the dynasty-building, terraforming, and innovative mechanics first introduced in War of Magic. </li>
<li>Rich, Dynamic Worlds. Enjoy endless replayability through procedurally generated fantasy worlds filled with lore-rich quests, evolving environments that respond to your magic, unique fantasy civilizations, and bustling cities populated with individually simulated characters. </li>
<li>RPG-Infused Unit Design. Customize heroes and armies through an intuitive RPG-style character designer, crafting each unit with their own unique history, stats, equipment, and abilities, growing stronger with experience. </li>
<li>Compelling Tactical Combat. See how your designed units and characters fare in battle in highly refined tactical battles that reward strategic thinking, or leverage a sophisticated auto-resolve system powered by advanced AI for streamlined empire management. </li>
<li>Deep Quest and Story Integration. Embark on rich, narrative-driven quests seamlessly woven into the empire-building experience, influencing diplomacy, unlocking secrets, and offering meaningful rewards.</li>
<li>Modernized UI and Graphics Engine. Explore enhanced visuals powered by DirectX 11, seamless zooming from strategic cloth-map to detailed tactical view.</li>
<li>Integrated Modding tools. A comprehensive built-in modding and map-editing tools, and a fully redesigned user interface optimized for modern PC gaming with Steam workshop integration.</li>

      <title>The Crazy Hyper-Dungeon Chronicles (TCHDC) combines the ideas of Undertale and Dungeon Master</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Due to arrive in October, The Crazy Hyper-Dungeon Chronicles (TCHDC) combines the worlds of Undertale and Dungeon Master.</p>
<p>Here you get to decide exactly what type of adventurer you want to be. You are the hero of this story. You could opt for the goal-oriented Explorer who excels in puzzle-solving and stealth, dive right into the role of the Destroyer if you prefer to fight first and ask questions about the story later, or become the Resolver who seeks to uncover Hyper-Dungeon's lore and talk issues out instead of fighting when possible.</p>
<p>Sounds like a thoroughly odd but unique blend of game mechanics here. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UiTmM3faw-0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a4282a1fdf3dd5cb540420d913058ec4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UiTmM3faw-0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>According to the press release the labyrinthine is filled of traps, brain-scratching puzzles and you'll have to deal with the combat system that "blends traditional turn-based encounters with arcade action elements". As you explore you'll also encounter "a host of whimsical characters and have interactions laden with references to video games, geek culture, and subcultures galore".</p>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Procedurally generated levels ensure every trip into the Hyper-Dungeon is different and full of surprise encounters and opportunities.</li>
<li>Character profiles let you choose how to play: focus on lore and talk your way out of fights with the Resolver, dive right into combat with the Destroyer, or become the Explorer to excel at puzzle solving and stealth.</li>
<li>Combat blends turn-based strategy with real-time interactions, similar to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 or Super Mario RPG.</li>
<li>The Hyper-Dungeon is packed with in-game lore to unearth and pop/game culture references to discover.</li>
</ul>

      <title>OpenLinkHub is an open source interface to manage iCUE LINK Hub and various Corsair devices on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For people who have Corsair hardware, the OpenLinkHub project might be one you need to take a look at to help you manage it all including iCUE LINK Hub.</p>
<p>It's not an official Corsair project, since like many other big-name brands, they don't provide direct Linux support. So one one Linux user decided to create a project to manage it all. OpenLinkHub supports over 100 devices across iCUE LINK Hub and other Corsair AIOs and Hubs for RGB lighting, fan speeds, system metrics, as well as keyboards, mice and headsets via a web dashboard. </p>
<p>The point is to unify all Corsair devices into a single UI available via the web.</p>

<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Web-based UI accessible at http://localhost:27003</li>
<li>Control AIO coolers, fans, hubs, pumps, LCDs and RGB lighting</li>
<li>Manage keyboards, mice and headsets</li>
<li>Support for DDR4 and DDR5 memory</li>
<li>Custom fan profiles, temperature sensors and RGB editor</li>

      <title>Cattle Country the western styled Stardew gets expanded mining and new features</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cattle Country is a really nice western styled life and farming sim that's a good pick for fans of Stardew Valley. Now with a big content update! <em>ICYMI: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/move-over-stardew-its-time-for-cattle-country/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">See my original thoughts on it</a>.</em></p>
<p>What is it? A cosy frontier life-sim where players can build their dream homestead, raise livestock, craft tools, and carve out a peaceful life beneath the wide Western skies. While you can also romance characters, it's not all sunshine and rainbows - there's bandits that come along too, all part of life on the range.</p>
<p>The developers just released the "Beneath and Beyond" Update and it sounds like a good one. With expanded underground mining, and multiple big new features for all the above ground adventuring you'll be doing.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zeC9Ri9Xlqo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3e950633a9101abee027e80cc94e628f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zeC9Ri9Xlqo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Update Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Expanded Mining System – New mine levels, rarer resources, environmental hazards, and surprises waiting in the dark. Dig deeper than ever before and uncover secrets beneath the soil, from glittering gems to long-forgotten bandit loot. </li>
<li>Hay Dropper – Automatically feeds hay to your livestock, giving you more time to enjoy the open range.</li>
<li>Scratch Post – Place it in your barn or coop to keep animals happy and content.</li>
<li>Aquariums – Show off your prized catches by displaying fish in beautiful tanks right at home.</li>
<li>Horse Whistle Tune – Play a tune and call your trusty steed from afar, perfect for long treks or quick getaways.</li>
<li>Walleye Fish – Now available in lakes during spring and fall. It was previously uncatchable, but no longer out of reach for patient anglers.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's quite a lot more including plenty of bug fixes you can read in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2818150/view/510711823303967018" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>.</p>

      <title>HIPS N NOSES is a cafe management sim with magical twists and great looking game mechanics</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cafe management with a magical twist, plus roguelike combat elements and a pretty cool witchy style. HIPS N NOSES is one to keep on your wishlist.</p>
<p>The developer PepperStones from Korea noted that by day you run a "cozy yet mysterious café that helps customers regain their lost memories" and by night you "dive into surreal dream worlds, battling monsters and gathering rare ingredients to brew memory-restoring drinks".</p>
<p>It's not just the style that grabbed my attention here, it's the pretty surprising game mechanics with the way you serve customers. HIPS N NOSES just oozes style. Check it out in the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uwYtKfG3LPs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c6d2075585cedd0ef1ce7333615f5f0a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uwYtKfG3LPs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Recipe Customization - Each customer visiting the café has unique tastes and preferences. By picking up subtle hints in their conversations, players can adjust and enhance recipes with the best possible ingredients. Successfully satisfying even the most demanding customers leads to greater rewards and increased profits.</li>
<li>Combat in Dream World - The ever-changing dream world offers new experiences with every exploration. Meet various people in reality who also appear in the dream world, and together, defeat numerous monsters to collect special materials that cannot be obtained in reality.</li>
<li>Elements That Provide the Fun of Growth - Players can customize their café with various kitchen tools, interact with diverse customers, and grow stronger by defeating dream monsters. These growth systems enable players to handle more customers more efficiently, adding depth and long-term engagement to the gameplay.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's currently aiming for a 2026 release.</p>

      <title>Mecha fans should keep an eye on Ironwing Valiant: Record of Astera</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A mecha action-JRPG with ranged and melee mechanics, mech customization, companion customization and lots more? Sign me the heck up. The style of Ironwing Valiant: Record of Astera looks awesome, and we definitely have a lack of really good modern mech games like this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ironwing Valiant is a fast-pace, mecha action-JRPG game with shooting and melee mechanics, mech customization, companion customization, real-time with pause command abilities in combat, and a compelling storyline and characters. Taking the guise of a young mecha pilot named Reinhardt, you will battle through sleepy villages, imposing fortress cities, and war-scarred industrial centers, fully customize your Valiant (our term for mecha) to fit your playstyle. The game features full parts customization (Head, Arms, Legs, Core, minor components), a large selection of unique melee, ranged, and axillary weapons, companion and party customization, multiple enemy types (Infantry, armored vehicles, mechs, elite enemies, and more) and a JRPG-style storyline.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like a colourful Armored Core mixed with Valkyria Chronicles. Do you need any more than that? Check out their most recent demo trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yLEaOdIBc38"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6dac87a319f2ab33a6520c13284eb57d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yLEaOdIBc38" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>According to the developer the game world and story is based off of Chinese and Korean mythology and The Romance of The Three Kingdoms novel! So this is definitely one to watch.</p>
<p>There's a very early demo on their itch page and you can follow it on Steam directly too. An upgraded demo is also currently in the works but there's no release date set for the full game yet.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Audio is part of what makes a game great right? Theme Hospital game engine CorsixTH 0.69 is out now to enhance this absolute classic. A game I very much loved when it was originally released, and I really enjoy going back through it with a free and open source enhancement like this.</p>

<ul>
<li>Custom level/campaign creators can now use an existing level file as an overlay to copy and extend their level file with the #overlay variable. See the 'Custom Level' Wiki page for more information.</li>
<li>A new machine menu has been added. Now you can view the status of all your hospital machines in one place!</li>

<em>Pictured - CorsixTH on Linux</em></p>
<p>Plenty of smaller but still great changes came in this update too, like finally hearing patients vomiting. Improved AI for idle staff to look for work, VIPs now walk slower to match the original game and a number of bug fixes too.</p>
<p>Check out the full list on <a href="https://github.com/CorsixTH/CorsixTH/releases/tag/v0.69.0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>You need the original game files for it - you can <a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/theme_hospital?as=1636858786" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">buy Theme Hospital on GOG</a>. Then just run the AppImage from the CorsixTH downloads on <a href="https://github.com/CorsixTH/CorsixTH" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, and point it to where you've installed Theme Hospital.</p>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 mod Open Fortress is getting closer to a Steam release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/tf2-mod-open-fortress-is-coming-to-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Back in May</a> we had the announcement that Open Fortress is coming to Steam, and the latest update on their progress sounds great for this Team Fortress 2 mod.</p>
<p>What is it? A full standalone mod of Valve's TF2. The developer said it "builds on Team Fortress 2’s world-famous gunplay to create a smooth, stylish experience inspired by old-school FPS games" to bring all new maps, new game modes, new guns and an original soundtrack along with taking some inspiration from 1970s action flicks.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20850901511753700240gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>In the latest Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3561320/view/515216422280888823" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> the mod team announced that work has completed on porting it to the new official <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/team-fortress-2-major-update-released-and-source-available-for-modders-via-the-source-sdk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TF2 SDK that Valve released back in February</a>. The devs of Open Fortress say they can now upload builds to Steam which will be soon but "not yet". While the "titanic effort of getting Open Fortress SDK-compatible is over" they're still working to bring it up to a fully polished level. This includes improving lots of weapon models, refining maps, remastered sounds and more.</p>

      <title>20 years later, DnD classics Demon Stone and Dragonshard are getting upgraded Steam releases</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Game publisher SNEG recently announced Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dragonshard and Forgotten Realms: Demon Stone are coming to Steam with plenty of upgrades.</p>
<p>There's also a <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/dungeons-dragons-classics-collection" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Dungeons and Dragons Classics Collection Humble Bundle</a> live with the announcement, where you can get 13 classics from SNEG for £7.40 for the whole lot.</p>
<p>More about each of the re-releases below from the press release.</p>
<p><strong>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dragonshard</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Originally released in 2005, Dragonshard returns in a respectful re-release that quietly modernizes the classic: modern-resolution support, localization-friendly saves and profiles, smoother timers and physics, ASLR compatibility, and other under-the-hood fixes for a cleaner experience on today’s PCs.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS® Real-Time Strategy Experience</li>
<li>D&amp;D® game from the Eberron campaign setting</li>
<li>Game design with two levels of interconnected action: RTS war above ground and critical RPG-styled battles in dungeons below</li>
<li>Four ranges of controllable units: powerful champions, heroic captains, trainable henchmen, and nearly unstoppable battlefield juggernauts</li>
<li>Unit development based on 'Experience Points', allowing players to "level up" units - an added RPG twist to the classic RTS gameplay structure</li>
<li>An innovative village grid system - the "Nexus System" - where choice and placement of buildings can specifically affect units' powers</li>
<li>Three warring factions, each with its own history, campaigns, unique strengths... and weaknesses.</li>
<li>Game story by Eberron creator Keith Baker</li>
<li>A variety of threatening environments, all with the "Hyper Terrain" feature, creating real-time terrain deformation in the wake of unit movements</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Update 29/07/25</strong>: as pointed out in the comments, it's not actually the first DnD RTS. Clearing this up with SNEG, here's what they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can add even more, in my opinion, the first RTS in D&amp;D was Stronghold that had real-time city building and was released in 1993.</p>
<p>That said, we are not inventing anything new. That’s how the game was officially positioned - https://www.mobygames.com/game/19289/dungeons-dragons-dragonshard/cover/group-28777/cover-92156/ Check the top of the DVD-box cover. This statement was the main message of the campaign in 2005 and we wanted to keep it in the game description as many gamers remember it this way.</p>
<p>Why was it done? Probably because previous games were using the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons license while this one was the actual D&amp;D one. Previous games wouldn’t be called RTSs at that time either. Stronghold was about managing kingdom in real time and Blood &amp; Magic was about real time tactics without any base building as such.</p>

      <title>Super Meat Boy 3D looks fast, tough and enraging in the new gameplay trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The tough-as-nails platformer returns in three dimensions, Super Meat Boy 3D has a fresh gameplay trailer overview you can watch right now. The game will arrive sometime in 2026, and will no doubt work great on Linux platforms with Valve's Proton.</p>
<p>After watching it, I'm sold on it. The style actually looks incredible, and the vertical design of it with all the wall-running really looks like it will grab your full attention. You might want to take out controller insurance on this, it's sure to make you rage.</p>
<p>You can watch the new official developer commentary trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="tsd6an9jJ2s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ef1a8b272ef865e6eb3a304975f02a66.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/tsd6an9jJ2s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Super Meat Boy 3D</strong> is a tough as nails platformer where you play as an animated cube of meat who's trying to save his girlfriend (who happens to be made of bandages) from an evil fetus in a jar wearing a tux – <strong>IN 3D</strong>!<br/>
<br/>
Our meaty hero will leap from walls, over seas of buzz saws, through crumbling caves and pools of old trash sacrificing his own well-being to save his damsel in distress – <strong>IN 3D!</strong><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Super Meat Boy 3D</strong> brings the old school difficulty of classic retro titles we all know and love and streamlines them down to the essential no bull straight forward twitch reflex platforming. Ramping up in difficulty from hard to soul crushing Meat Boy will brave lush (but also on fire) forests, vast dumps filled with the waste of mankind, and high-tech forges producing the very traps that will inevitably kill Meat Boy over and over and over - <strong>IN 3D!</strong><br/>
<br/>
And if a bunch of levels weren't enough, we also have epic boss fights and tons of unlockable secrets – <strong>IN 3D!</strong></p>

      <title>Valve reveal new Steam store menu and enhanced search now in Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're on the Steam Client Beta (Desktops), you might have noticed the Steam store looking a bit different with the latest update. Valve <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/500579345320904591" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> a refresh of the Steam store menu noting it's designed to "provide easier access to the places Steam users most frequently visit".</p>
<p>What's changed? A lot actually. The whole left sidebar of links is entirely gone, combined into the new store bar at the top. It also puts the bar on more pages across on Steam, to give you access to the search and links easily. It will also disappear when you scroll down, just scroll up a bit for it to reappear.</p>
<p>Valve have also enhanced the search bar too. It now offers more options when searching including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Popular Searches</strong>: See what others are searching for right now</li>
<li><strong>Recently Viewed</strong>: An easy way to jump back to games you've previously looked at</li>
<li><strong>More than just games</strong>: Search for categories/tags, publishers, and more</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Search link</strong>: For those who want to refine their game search even further, we’ve made it easier than ever to access the advanced search page with a variety of filters.</li>
</ul>

<p>There's more including recommendations, categories and tags personalised to you and various smaller changes.</p>

      <title>Last Epoch devs Eleventh Hour Games have been acquired by Krafton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Subnautica 2 publisher Krafton have acquired Last Epoch devs Eleventh Hour Games, ahead of the latest season launching next month.</p>
<p>In a post on the Last Epoch forum Judd Cobler, Founder of Eleventh Hour Games, <a href="https://forum.lastepoch.com/t/a-new-chapter-for-eleventh-hour-games/78482" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">wrote</a> "Today I’m excited to announce that Eleventh Hour Games is joining Krafton, the powerhouse behind PUBG, who shares our passion for the action RPG genre and is ready to help fuel our efforts in raising Last Epoch to new heights. With this partnership we will have the opportunity and resources to execute on our goal of creating the very best ARPG in the genre.</p>
<p>After speaking with dozens of potential strategic partners, Krafton clearly demonstrated that they’re aligned in helping us achieve our goals and can both enable and guide us through some of the largest upcoming challenges we’ll face as a studio. This partnership will allow us to deliver things we’ve only dreamed of previously and I’m excited to share details on those at a later date".</p>
<p>Cobler noted how Eleventh Hour Games will be hiring "many" roles in the "near future".</p>
<p>This was announced by Eleventh Hour Games the same day they released a full trailer for Season 3 of Last Epoch.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="TnDnhPqC0BA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5408b28a580d4baa187b9a536f6e6fcb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/TnDnhPqC0BA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>Related: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/last-epoch-drops-the-native-linux-version-devs-tell-players-to-use-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in September 2024</a>, Eleventh Hour Games dropped support for their Native Linux version of Last Epoch telling people to use Proton instead.</em></p>
<p>From the Krafton press release: "We are thrilled to welcome Eleventh Hour Games into the KRAFTON family," said Maria Park, Head of Corporate Development at KRAFTON. "The team’s commitment to the ARPG community and innovative approach to game development resonated strongly with our values. Their rise from a grassroots studio to a globally renowned ARPG developer is nothing short of remarkable. We believe this acquisition lays the groundwork for diversifying KRAFTON’s genre portfolio and expanding distinctive franchise IPs. This acquisition also reaffirms our unwavering passion for great games and the teams that build them. We will always stand behind developers who put players first.”</p>
<p>KRAFTON acquired 100 percent of Eleventh Hour Games’ shares. The acquisition amount includes an initial consideration of USD 96 million.</p>
<p>Krafton are currently involved in a pretty dramatic legal spat with the original Subnautica founders, but that's clearly not putting the brakes on the rest of their publishing. Hopefully this won't one day turn into a sour situation as well. Probably not the best timing to be announcing such a thing though.</p>

      <title>Garry&#39;s Mod now has lots of Counter-Strike: Source and Half-Life 2 content included</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have given special permission to Garry's Mod from Facepunch to include a whole bunch of extra content for the popular physics sandbox.</p>
<p>In the July 2025 update the developers noted "The biggest user-facing change in this update brings most of Counter-Strike: Source and Half-Life 2 Episodic content to Garry's Mod by default, with gracious permission from Valve. This means that you no longer need to own those games and have them installed to play on community maps that expect you to have this content".</p>
<p>However it doesn't come with the maps, voice over files and music. You still need to own and install the games to use that part of each. Still, a thoroughly great change to see that should make jumping into Garry's Mod a whole lot easier going forwards.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7203514311753458878gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Facepunch also said this update means that "Half-Life 2: Episode 2 content is now available in the spawnmenu for every player by default". It won't remove all instances of missing textures, but the majority of them.</p>
<p>The update also contains a lot of smaller changes including crash fixes, optimizations and more. See the <a href="https://gmod.facepunch.com/news/july-2025-update" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">full update notes</a>.</p>
<p>It's actually pretty amazing how open Valve are in many ways with things like this, they're really nothing like certain other big companies.</p>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 adds 10 new maps for a summer event and more bug fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While this is not the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/mann-vs-machine-is-getting-an-upgrade-in-team-fortress-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mann vs Machine update we were previously promised</a>, Team Fortress 2 still has a big update our for the Summer 2025 Event. Still seems like a great time to jump back into the classic free to play FPS from Valve.</p>
<p>As usual for these event updates, Valve pulled in the community for basically all of the actual content that's included. Not something you see from other developers often.</p>
<p>For the Summer 2025 Event this is what was added:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Featuring 10 new community maps: Citadel, Aquarius, Fulgur, Cargo, Conifer, Boardwalk, Blowout, Mannhole, Demolition, and Pressure</li>
<li>Added the Summer 2025 Cosmetic Case
	<ul>
<li>Contains 23 new community-contributed items</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added 4 new community-contributed taunts to the Mann Co. Store
	<ul>
<li>Taunt: The Final Score</li>
<li>Taunt: Bear Hug</li>
<li>Taunt: Texan Trickshot</li>
<li>Taunt: Flying Colors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added 14 new community-created Unusual effects
	<ul>
<li>7 new effects for Unusual hats</li>
<li>7 new effects for Unusual taunts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All cosmetic and taunt cases will grant Summer 2025 Unusual effects instead of their normal Unusual effects during the Summer event. This does not include crates.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The Summer event runs through September 15th, 2025.</p>

      <title>THE FINALS devs confirm (again) continued compatibility for Linux / Steam Deck with Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Embark Studios have reconfirmed their for THE FINALS to continue working with Proton for Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck players.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/the-finals-is-getting-new-kernel-based-anti-cheat-likely-to-break-it-on-linux-steamos-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Back in early July</a> we had Embark Studios detail new anti-cheat plans for THE FINALS, which caused some concern amongst Linux players since it could end up unplayable as we've seen with various other games. They quickly confirmed the game would continue to work though.</p>
<p>The key though, is that THE FINALS is <em>not</em> "supported" but they will ensure it's not intentionally blocked. In the latest Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2073850/view/541112120139317344" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> they've posted the below to reassure Linux platform players:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Steam Deck and Proton Support</strong></p>
<p>We noticed the concern about Linux following our last update. We’re testing everything across all platforms, and have made it very clear to our partners that Proton and Steam Deck are important to our development plans. While we don’t officially support Steam Deck due to our required dependence on Proton Experimental, we are committed to ensuring compatibility, and we work with external partners to fix issues before we ship a patch. The experience of every player is important to us. Despite many factors, we are still dedicated to supporting it because we know it matters. However, general Wine support is not tested, and native Linux support is not planned. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Really great to see, hopefully more Linux players will actually take a look at THE FINALS given their repeated statements on it. Nice that a few bigger games like it aren't blocking us.</p>

<p>The main changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>[Linux] Prioritize GE-Proton Versions and adds a setting to show/hide non-GE version on Wine List.</li>
<li>[UX] Several improvements to Joystick and Keyboard navigation.</li>
<li>[UX] Adds a new option to launch games with or without logs from the game page.</li>
<li>[macOS] Adds Wine-Staging back to Wine Manager and Fix an issue with picking up the wrong wine binary when using GPTK.</li>
<li>[General] Adds Opt-in Anonymous analytics.</li>
<li>Several other fixes and improvements.</li>
</ul>
