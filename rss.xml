      <title>Here&#39;s how to get PAYDAY 3 Beta to work on Steam Deck &amp; Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PAYDAY 3 has a technical Beta currently live, as they're testing out their servers ready for the full release on September 21st. Getting it running on Steam Deck and desktop Linux needs a little fix to work so here's how.</p>
<p>It's quite simple but does require a few steps and just a little patience.</p>
<p>First of all, I would suggest signing up for their <a href="https://nebula.starbreeze.com/" target="_blank">Nebula account</a> system and then doing the Steam account linking. This will then allow the game to just auto log in. This third-party account is necessary right now. </p>
<p>Now, when you try to launch the game you'll be greeted by an error that will look a bit like this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5732671451694243437gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5732671451694243437gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Thankfully it's easy to get around but here is where you need a little patience, as some parts can take a little while to load. You'll need to install <em>Protontricks</em>, which is available as a Flatpak from <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/com.github.Matoking.protontricks" target="_blank">Flathub</a> (via Discover on Steam Deck in desktop mode). You <em>may</em> need to give Protontricks permissions to read the drive PAYDAY 3 is installed on, like an SD Card for Steam Deck or a different Steam Library drive on desktop. Run these in terminal:</p>
<p>For Desktop Linux:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">flatpak override --user --filesystem=/mnt/MySSD/SteamLibrary com.github.Matoking.protontricks</code></p>
<p>Steam Deck SD Cards:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">flatpak override --user --filesystem=/run/media/mmcblk0p1 com.github.Matoking.protontricks</code></p>
<p>After that, reload Protontricks.</p>
<p>Next you'll need to scroll to select PAYDAY 3:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16344433851694244059gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16344433851694244059gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Then you'll need to go through a few different screens to select the default wineprefix:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6766787161694244060gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6766787161694244060gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Next up is select the top option to install a Windows DLL or component:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5313593341694244060gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5313593341694244060gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Then scroll down to find <em>vcrun2019</em> or <em>vcrun2022</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3789849101694244061gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3789849101694244061gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p><em>Oddly, vcrun2022 showed up on Steam Deck for me but not desktop Linux but regardless both 2019 and 2022 work.</em></p>
<p>Then you'll see a few installer screens for vcrun like this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15765998051694244061gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15765998051694244061gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Just go through these, there's at least two and once finished it will bring back the Protontricks screen and you're then good to go. PAYDAY 3 will now run.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13142836351694244465gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13142836351694244465gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

      <title>More teasers appear for upcoming Valve hardware</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just recently I wrote about potential new hardware coming from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/linux-updates-tease-valve-galileo-and-sephiroth-steam-deck-refresh-or-new-vr/" target="_blank">Valve related to "Galileo" and "Sephiroth"</a> that could be a Steam Deck refresh or new VR kit. Now we have basic initial details on a device being certified in South Korea.</p>
<p><em>We still have no idea what it will be, so this is all pure speculation as usual until Valve actually announce something.</em></p>
<p>This next one comes from Brad Lynch <a href="https://twitter.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1699836012900544823" target="_blank">on X</a>, who found it. The <a href="https://www.rra.go.kr/ko/license/A_b_popup.do?app_no=202317210000256753" target="_blank">certification</a> (translated) dated August 28th reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specific low-power wireless devices (wireless devices for wireless access systems including wireless LAN (5150-5350 MHz, 5470-5850 MHz frequency band))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not really much at all to go on, except whatever this is it will have 5GHz WiFi. Many devices have WiFi capabilities including the Steam Deck, so it's still not much.</p>
<p>Doesn't really point either way to it being a Steam Deck refresh or the long leaked Deckard VR headset. However, from patents, we did see previously the Deckard VR kit will have a standalone mode so perhaps this is related to that? On top of that, we've seen Valve begin to improve SteamVR for Linux again recently so I am definitely leaning more into this all being work towards the successor to the Index.</p>
<p>Additionally, Lynch also <a href="https://twitter.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1699901595469918620" target="_blank">noticed</a> that there's actually a Valve Galilieo-specific mirror of Steam OS that's password protected. </p>
<p>Clearly, Valve are up to something. What do you think it will end up being?</p>

      <title>Amnesia: The Dark Descent Redux mod adds Vulkan and DirectX 12 support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this is quite fun to see. Amnesia: The Dark Descent has gained a Redux mod that rebuilds the graphics engine behind the game to provide Vulkan on Linux and DirectX 12 on Windows. It's not just adding it for the heck of it though, the developer said it will also correct some graphics issues in the original game while adding in new graphics options like HBAO+.</p>
<p>This is possible because Frictional Games opened up the source code for multiple of their games (<a href="https://github.com/FrictionalGames" target="_blank">GitHub</a>). This particular Redux mod reworks the graphics using <a href="https://theforge.dev/" target="_blank">The Forge</a>, a cross-platform rendering framework.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14781223371694176301gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14781223371694176301gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Amnesia: The Dark Descent Redux on Kubuntu, credit: me.</em></p>
<p>Don't expect perfection from the Redux mod just yet, as the developer said you can play it through but you may encounter some issues while they continue to improve it.</p>
<p>This is why open source is great. Anyone can come along and improve older games, give them a graphical boost and ensure they keep working long into the future.</p>
<p>Find the mod on <a href="https://mpollind.itch.io/amnesia-the-dark-descent-redux" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://github.com/OSS-Cosmic/AmnesiaTheDarkDescent" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. You need to own a copy of the game to use it.</p>
<p>Links to buy copies for the assets: <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/amnesia-the-dark-descent?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/amnesia_the_dark_descent?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/57300/Amnesia_The_Dark_Descent/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Fully-voiced surreal horror visual novel Slay the Princess launches October 20</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Coming from the developers of the excellent Scarlet Hollow, their next game Slay the Princess is set to launch on October 20 with full Native Linux support and it looks great. Save the princess? How about no. You're supposed to <em>slay</em> her apparently. Well this is a bit different isn't it.</p>
<p>Facilitate fate in an evolving drama drenched in monochromatic hand-penciled art from Ignatz-winning graphic novelist Abby Howard (The Crossroads at Midnight, The Last Halloween). Experience déjà vu like never before in a branching meta-narrative that unfolds its story in warped, hilarious, and unpredictable ways. Slay or be slain (or find a third option?) as each loop contorts to reflect each decision, forming a story with new twists and turns each playthrough. Begin the quest anew, joined by new personalities attempting to guide your actions.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="IY07Vh7MEbg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8c6addbaca318b09f6425f3a87d79b55.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/IY07Vh7MEbg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fully voice-acted</strong> by the impeccable Jonathan Sims and Nichole Goodnight.</li>
<li><strong>Hand-penciled art</strong> - every background and sprite is drawn traditionally with pencil and paper by Ignatz-winning graphic novelist Abby Howard.</li>
<li><strong>A princess.</strong> She's very bad and you have to get rid of her for all our sakes.</li>
<li><strong>No, the Princess isn't a cosmic horror.</strong> She's just an ordinary human Princess, and you can definitely slay her as long as you put your mind to it.</li>
<li><strong>Don't even think about trying to romance her.</strong> It won't end well for you.</li>
<li><strong>Hopefully you won't die.</strong> But if you do, you'll die a lot. Be careful and stay focused on the task at hand!</li>
<li>Time loops <strong>No time loops.</strong> Don't be ridiculous. Time is a strictly linear concept and it certainly doesn't "loop," whatever that's supposed to mean.</li>
<li><strong>A branching narrative</strong> where what you say and what you believe determines both who you are and how the story unfolds.</li>
<li><strong>A new roleplaying experience from the creators of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1609230/Scarlet_Hollow/" target="_blank">Scarlet Hollow</a>.</strong></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>“It starts out simple,” says Tony Howard-Arias, Lead Writer at Black Tabby Games. “And, ultimately, it stays simple — the premise never changes. You’re here to slay the Princess, and you need to slay her to save the entire world. But trust is a fragile thing, and the context around the goal changes dramatically the more decisions you make and the more you develop your relationship with the characters and the world. We’re really excited to see how everyone navigates these surreal gray waters.”</p>
<p>The previous game, Scarlet Hollow, also had full Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified. So I expect Slay the Princess will also be Steam Deck Verified at some point since it also has full controller support.</p>

      <title>Check out the new trailer for Projekt Z: Beyond Order</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Projekt Z: Beyond Order is an upcoming atmospheric first-person zombie co-op shooter set in WW2, in development by 314 Arts and a new trailer is live. They also mentioned late last year they have gained Modus Games as a publishing partner. It was also originally just called Projekt Z with it being renamed to Projekt Z: Beyond Order recently.</p>
<p><em>Nice to see they continued even after their Kickstarter failed.</em></p>
<p>More about it: "Projekt Z: Beyond Order is a first-person shooter set in a WW2 Zombie scenario on a secret German island. The game focuses on the threat of 'Projekt Z', a clandestine program run by the Nazis to turn Zombies, which have been discovered on the island earlier, into weapons to help turn the tide of the war in Nazi Germany's favor. On the Island, you will discover various other secret Nazi projects related and unrelated to 'Projekt Z'."</p>
<p>Check out the new teaser trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="dn93k37MUwI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/80b6b56eb04fb9fce741178c2001202c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/dn93k37MUwI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking to the developer over email, when asking about their plans for full Linux support they gave a resounding "Yes! :)" answer so expect Native Linux support at release.</p>
<p>Quite keen to see how this one evolves, especially as it's not another straight-shooter, with elements outside of the exploration and survival with a hideout that you continually build up, which they say will be a little like Fallout 4's settlement building. However, there will also be a full story with multiple arcs to go through.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/763310/Projekt_Z_Beyond_Order/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma 6 to launch in February 2024</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>They've finally set a date! The big release of the KDE Plasma 6 desktop is now set to launch in February 2024.</p>
<p>Confirming the plans in another recent developer overview <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2023/09/06/september-plasma-6-update/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, KDE dev Nate Graham mentioned there's no specific day yet but they've at least marked down the month and they are "feeling quite confident that the release will be in excellent shape by then" and another few months should make it solid.</p>
<p>Plasma 6 is now in Stage 4 of their original roadmap that Graham posted earlier in this year that went through:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make it compile.</li>
<li>Make it livable.</li>
<li>Clean up the code.</li>
<li>Implement planned features and changes.</li>
<li>QA it and fix the bugs.</li>
</ol>
<p>And some of the work done includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom ordering for KRunner search results.</li>
<li>Printers KCM rewritten in QML.</li>
<li>Double-click by default.</li>
<li>Tap-to-click by default.</li>
<li>Icons throughout Plasma itself now exclusively come from the systemwide icon theme.</li>
<li>Support for automatic bug reporting in DrKonqi and improved reporting flow in general.</li>
<li>Autostart KCM shows details about entries.</li>
<li>Distros can now customize the first page in Welcome Center.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm looking forward to it. With Plasma being my desktop environment of choice on my Linux desktop (Kubuntu) and it's what's included on Steam Deck with SteamOS too. So hopefully before too long we will see Valve give it an upgrade in SteamOS too.</p>

      <title>Star Trek: Infinite from Paradox releases October 12</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox Interactive along with Nimble Giant Entertainment have announced that Star Trek: Infinite will be releasing on October 12th. Unlike titles from their in-house first-party development teams, this one will <em>not</em> have Native Linux support. It's built on the foundation of Stellaris, and pretty much looks like Star Trek Stellaris.</p>
<p>Even on the Steam page Paradox touch on this noting that "Star Trek: Infinite is built upon the core systems of Stellaris, leveraging the deep and complex system and making them its own. Aspects of these systems have been streamlined and simplified to better resonate with the Star Trek franchise." — so they're expanding the audience, while making elements of it simpler.</p>
<p>"Beginning decades before the Star Trek: The Next Generation era, Star Trek: Infinite grants players the power to shape the galaxy’s destiny as a faction of their choice. The immersive grand strategy game puts players in the captain’s chair to lead one of four unique Quadrant Powers: The United Federation of Planets, Romulan Star Empire, Cardassian Union, or Klingon Empire. While remaining faithful to Star Trek lore, Star Trek: Infinite introduces fresh avenues for adventure as players can explore the Alpha and Beta quadrants, govern empire dynamics, handle economic intricacies, and engage with undiscovered civilizations."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3gS_nMkKl84"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ca93162a0f92eacfadab981bfc63a67c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3gS_nMkKl84" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1622900/Star_Trek_Infinite/" target="_blank">Steam</a> for pre-purchase and you get certain rewards if you grab it before release including:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Star Trek: </em><em>Lower Decks</em> uniform options</li>
<li>The <em>U</em><em>.</em><em>S</em><em>.</em><em>S</em><em>.</em><em> Cerritos</em>, a science ship with special options for minor nations (Second Contact)</li>
<li>A Klingon advisor voice line, “Qapla”</li>
</ul>
<p>In a preview that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23862814/star-trek-infinite-release-date-strategy-game-paradox" target="_blank">Polygon</a> had, they're keen to note it's not just a Star Trek skin on Stellaris. A quote from producer Mats Holm: "We split off from the <em>Stellaris</em> main branch quite a while ago," says Holm. "The <em>Stellaris</em> team is completely focused on making every possible sci-fi theme that you can imagine, put into one game. On <em>Star Trek: Infinite</em>, we want to make the ultimate Star Trek fantasy. We want it to be very bespoke."</p>
<p>I'm something of a Trekkie myself, so I'm hopeful it's a good one and hopeful it works well with Proton.</p>

      <title>Chaotic furniture-building co-op game KallaX only gives one player instructions</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>KallaX sounds like it could be quite hilarious. With co-op play of between 2-6 players, you will need to build some furniture but the problem is, only one of you has been given the instructions.</p>
<p>The developers, studio Unexpected, previously worked on games like As Far As The Eye and Antioch: Scarlet Bay and they say this game may very well "destroy your friendships forever". If it's anything as truly chaotic as Overcooked, it's certainly going to test your communication.</p>
<p>The trailer is well-made too and does make it look quite silly and fun:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Dt1Ztkh8DSQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5bad2411d3da895a443de4a6bdc70fad.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Dt1Ztkh8DSQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You'll be building all sorts from an ironing board to a complicated furniture in futuristic space environments. The good news is that if one of your friends annoys you enough you can "throw them out the window and let them drift away into the infinity of space" — lovely. This really does sound like a lot of fun, cute graphics too.</p>
<p>Launching September 18th on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1818280/KallaX/" target="_blank">Steam</a> with Native Linux support. It also has full controller support, so could be a good one for Steam Deck fans too.</p>

      <title>Tactical turn-based stealth game Spirited Thief releases September 19</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Spirited Thief looks pretty sweet. A tactical turn-based stealth game with a twist, where you take your time to scout ahead and plan your heist as your ghostly friend, then use your knowledge to break in and break out with pricey loot.</p>
<p>More about it: "Another job gone wrong... Elaj - unlucky thief with a few magic tricks upon his sleeves - and Trin - his partner-in-crime who happens to be an intangible spirit - are on the verge of being kicked out of the ruthless Thieves Guild! Determined to prove themselves to the guild, and make some sweet steals in the process, Elaj and Trin must work together to infiltrate heavily protected vaults, mysterious crypts, and more. With the occasional help of allies, what secrets, treasures, and troubles will the pair get their hands on?"</p>
<p>The developer recently revealed that it will launch on September 19th, along with Native Linux support and there's a brand new trailer to show off too:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8_e391Dmp0k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/01b2c3647a25ae7e23d950bddee35dd9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8_e391Dmp0k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Steal as Elaj, the thief. Loot as much as you can without giving the guards time to react.</li>
<li>Outsmart enemies, sneak through locked doors, and break down magical barriers. No door can stop you.</li>
<li>With turn-based gameplay, get in and get out before the guards become aware of your presence. You’ve only got so long, so use your turns wisely.</li>
<li>Infiltrate wealthy castles, dark dungeons, and occult lairs under the guidance of the infamous thieves' guild.</li>
<li>Upgrade your skills with new and exciting abilities in exchange for your ill-gotten gains.</li>
<li>Study your briefings so you know what you’re getting into and what to look out for. Will you take it slow and steady to find all the secrets, or is a smash-and-grab more up your street?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Should hopefully be nice on Steam Deck at release as well as desktop Linux, as the developer showed off work previously to make it with nicely with gamepads.</p>

      <title>Titanfall 2 has a player surge with a huge sale, great on Steam Deck &amp; desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Available really cheap until September 18th, Titanfall 2 has one of the best FPS campaigns around and some great multiplayer with the <a href="https://northstar.tf/" target="_blank">Northstar</a> mod too. </p>
<p>It's rated Steam Deck Playable and does work just great on desktop Linux. If you want to use Northstar, it may be best to use the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/ge-proton-8-14-released-deprecated-workarounds-removed/" target="_blank">latest GE-Proton</a>, as one of the recent updates to GE-Proton added some helpers for Northstar. What exactly is it though? Northstar is a modding framework client that allows users to host their own Titanfall 2 servers using custom scripts and assets to create custom content, as well as being able to host vanilla content. Once again, modding keeping a game alive after the original developer moves on.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6520003351694090926gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6520003351694090926gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The Ultimate Edition is currently 90% off making it only £2.49, which is a ridiculously good price for such a great game. So many hours of fun can be had for that.</p>
<p>It turns out I hadn't actually done a Steam Deck video of the game yet, although I did previously do some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDdhiC18KrM" target="_blank">footage on desktop Linux</a> back in 2020 where even then it was running exceptionally well. So here's some footage running on Steam Deck with Proton Experimental, followed by a guide to set up Northstar on Steam Deck because this was a good excuse to play some more:</p>

      <title>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart gets FSR 2.2 and Ray Tracing for AMD GPUs on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Insomniac Games and Nixxes Software showing how good PC support is done with Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, with another free upgrade out now. It's good news for Steam Deck and desktop Linux players too.</p>
<p>Really great to see, and once again they're doing improvements for Linux systems showing again you don't need Native Linux build to ensure it's supported and runs well. Support is what we want, to make sure we get what we pay for! This isn't the first time they've improved the game for Linux either, with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-update-includes-a-fix-for-linux-gamers/" target="_blank">a previous update</a> fixing up issues for NVIDIA GPUs on Linux.</p>
<p>Here's all that's in patch 1.831.0.0:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Stability improvements for AMD Radeon RX 7000 GPUs.</li>
<li>Improved frame pacing on GPUs with 8GB VRAM or less when hitting certain surfaces with large amounts of bullets.</li>
<li>Updated AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution to version 2.2.</li>
<li>Ray-tracing options are now available on AMD GPUs in Linux.</li>
<li>Dynamic Resolution Scaling can now be used in combination with Intel XeSS.</li>
<li>Added water deforming animation when the player character swims.</li>
<li>Hover Boots acceleration now works correctly at frame rates above 60 FPS.</li>
<li>Phantom Dash animation is no longer affected by the frame rate.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused the Phantom Dash effect to remain visible when toggled off.</li>
<li>Various user interface bugfixes.</li>
<li>Adjusted the launcher to fit on screens with low resolutions or high DPI scaling settings.
<ul>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>One thing to note, the current build graphics options text still says it's FSR 2.1 and <em>not</em> FSR 2.2, I've made the developer aware and they <a href="https://twitter.com/NixxesSoftware/status/1699759142510985576" target="_blank">told me</a> they will fix the text in the next update.</p>
<p>Some Steam Deck footage for the news:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nYZoxg8RpAU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1e430c2f4dabd56ca6298c86ccc922ac.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nYZoxg8RpAU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Looking pretty good overall on Steam Deck! Some expected slowdowns and dips when loading between portal worlds, and when the action is ridiculously over the top but the normal gameplay is almost a solid 30FPS. It feels really good on the Steam Deck and looks fantastic on the 7 inch screen.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart?ref=gol" target="_blank">Fanatical</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/ratchet-clank-rift-apart?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1895880/Ratchet__Clank_Rift_Apart/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>These custom Steam Deck buttons look awesome</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to mod your Steam Deck to make it a little bit more fancy? Deck Buttons from Colored Controllers look awesome but they're selling out fast.</p>
<p>Made by one person in the USA, these custom resin buttons come in various different colours and styles and can replace your Steam / Quick Settings, Start / Select, the Dpad and ABXY. The colours really do look awesome too and seem like quite a fun way to spice up how your Steam Deck looks from the same creator as the TouchProtect covers for the Steam Deck trackpads.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3396050841694090150gol1.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3396050841694090150gol1.gif"/></a></p>
<p>This does of course mean you would need to open up your Steam Deck but a mod that's nowhere near as intense as changing the entire cover or the screen. Actually changing the buttons over is one of the simpler mods you can do, a good one for a beginner.</p>
<p>And who wouldn't want to use some of these?</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17858187591694090222gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17858187591694090222gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Available in Party Black and Party Purple, shown above. Plus Holographic (the gif above) and Neon Blue, Neon Pink, Neon Yellow, Red and Atomic Purple.</p>
<p>Stock is selling fast with multiple already sold out but writing on X the creator mentioned they will be "  Ramping up mold making to be able to bring more buttons to you guys." so expect more stock to come once they can get through all the current orders.</p>
<p>Check them out on the <a href="https://deckbuttons.com/" target="_blank">Deck Buttons website</a>.</p>

      <title>DOOM Eternal removed Denuvo and it plays great on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With all the new amazing games coming out basically every month, lets not forget some slightly older games worth playing. Like DOOM Eternal, that just removed Denuvo Anti-Tamper.</p>
<p>Finally, right? They already removed Denuvo Anti-Cheat back in 2020 but now Denuvo is entirely gone as of the update released September 5th, 2023. So it should work better than ever, although it already did work quite brilliantly before because it was a very optimised game.</p>
<p>Any form of DRM is bad for consumers, so it's nice to see DOOM Eternal set free of the Denuvo curse.</p>
<p>Want to see how it can run on Steam Deck? Here's a quick chatty video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zr17uJaxKxI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/71f43424f3a1ac1c8a51ee893d00aedd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zr17uJaxKxI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Seriously, the performance on Steam Deck is really impressive. Probably one of the best looking <em>and</em> performing shooters available to play with Proton on Steam Deck by far.</p>

      <title>Linux continues rising above 3% desktop user share on Statcounter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another month, another set of stats showing that Linux desktop seems to be doing better than ever. According to <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide" target="_blank">Statcounter</a>, the Linux share has risen once again. A great sign for the health of the platform with more people using it.</p>
<p>While over on Steam the Linux numbers <em>did</em> dip over the last month, it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/linux-user-share-remains-above-macos-in-the-latest-steam-survey/" target="_blank">still remaining above macOS</a> which is interesting from a gaming standpoint but general desktop use is quite different.</p>
<p>The latest from Statcounter shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>January - 2.91%</li>
<li>February - 2.94%</li>
<li>March - 2.85%</li>
<li>April - 2.83%</li>
<li>May - 2.7%</li>
<li>June - 3.07%</li>
<li>July - 3.12%</li>
<li><strong>August - 3.18%</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The Windows share only dropped slightly this month, with the macOS share also dropping. However, ChromeOS, which is also technically a Linux distribution, rose from 3.24% to 3.34%. So if we included that Linux would actually be on around 6.52%.</p>

      <title>Steam will soon show better controller support details like for PlayStation controllers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has announced to developers that they're going to be rolling out better ways to show off controller support for games on Steam.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/3684558162504860651" target="_blank">announcement</a>, they highlighted the additional checks they will be putting in for PlayStation DualShock and DualSense controllers. Giving developers the ability to go through a controller-support questionnaire in Steamworks, to indicate if their games play well with controllers like the DualShock or DualSense.</p>
<p>Valve said that starting in October, they will be rolling out new ways to show this controller support to Steam users. One way may look a bit like this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3907467081694007554gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The updates to how Steam will display new controller support will include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Updates to store page area that displays controller support to also specify the level of PlayStation controller usage.</li>
<li>Updates to some browse pages to make it easier for players to find new games that support their controller device well.</li>
<li>Updates to the Steam Desktop client to indicate a game in your library has PlayStation controller support.</li>
<li>Updates to the Steam Desktop client to make it more clear when a game requires use of a controller to play.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As for why Valve are doing this they said that it has become much more common for PC players to use a controller, noting that since 2017 Steam has "seen over 87 Million users play at least once using a controller" and about 67% of them use a form of Xbox controller, with the rest being "PlayStation controllers, Switch Pro Controllers, and hundreds of other devices". However recently they've seen the most growth with PlayStation controllers noting that in 2018 they were only "about 11%" but they now see "27%" use PlayStation controllers.</p>
<p>Clearly using a controller on PC is popular, so it's good to see Valve are helping developers to better advertise what their games support.</p>
<p>With the Steam Deck out, and many other handhelds coming along, hopefully we will also see even more developers actually hook up some proper full controller support with a good UI for it.</p>

      <title>STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor more playable on Steam Deck with Patch 7</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor just had Patch 7 released, and Respawn noted it includes some performance improvements. So what does this mean for the Steam Deck? Here's what.</p>
<p>On desktop Linux, it worked pretty great overall already. On the Steam Deck though, it was pretty problematic. Even just the intro section failed to hit a solid 20FPS. After Patch 7 though? It's like a night and day difference, I'm very surprised at just how big the difference is often a 10FPS improvements over what it was before. We're looking at a much closer 30FPS experience, which is where we would expect such AAA games to be on a handheld like the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Here's some fresh footage showing the improvement:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aiRlVGZGmYg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/05757b7eaf96c12c89cbc85b7344b435.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aiRlVGZGmYg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As you can see, apart from some blips, we're really looking at a more playable experience there now. Good news for anyone who wanted to take STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor on the go. Some parts <em>will</em> still drop below 30FPS a fair bit, and some cut-scenes still have problems but either way — it is a big improvement over the initial release.</p>
<p>However, like with a few other titles, as mentioned in the video I did still see the RAM spike up to 14GB and crash the Steam Deck completely. It's a really random issue that not everyone sees, but very annoying for those that do. You might be able to get around that with the <a href="https://github.com/CryoByte33/steam-deck-utilities" target="_blank">CryoUtilities</a> tool.</p>
<p>Now compare the above footage with how it was <em>originally</em>:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="poYcwyybW8I"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b4253bc83e5aab08c43e51979a932c87.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/poYcwyybW8I" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>That's quite a difference.</p>

<p>In other Steam Deck news, an update to the Linux kernel teased <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/linux-updates-tease-valve-galileo-and-sephiroth-steam-deck-refresh-or-new-vr/" target="_blank">Valve 'Galileo' and 'Sephiroth'</a> hardware. Potentially a refreshed Steam Deck, a new VR device or something else (or <em>nothing</em>).</p>

      <title>Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars getting remastered, plus a whole new adventure</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Revolution Software recently announced two huge bits of news for adventure game fans! Not only will there be a whole new game with Broken Sword - Parzival's Stone but Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars: Reforged is coming too.</p>
<p><em>Yes I totally missed the original announcements.</em></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Y_s5p_rBIjE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bdfd93e6d5e39b86bd7d50d401a36bdf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Y_s5p_rBIjE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“This is the start of what we’re calling the ‘Broken Sword Renaissance’,” says Charles Cecil, Founder and CEO of Revolution Software. “With both Parzival’s Stone and Shadow of the Templars: Reforged, we’re making a big, bold, and broad offer both to those who have walked in the shoes of George &amp; Nico before and hunger for a new adventure, and also just as crucially people who have never even heard of the franchise. As with all Broken Sword games, both titles exist as independent adventures with no prior knowledge required, though naturally for those invested in the world we’ve created, there’s a lot to tap into under the surface.”</p>
<p>One thing to note, is that Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars: Reforged is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23842925/broken-sword-6-bs1-remaster-charles-cecil" target="_blank">making use of AI Art</a> to help it along. Speaking to Polygon the founder of Revolution, Charles Cecil, mentioned they simply couldn't afford to remake it without the help of an AI trained using their own sprites. This did result in some backlash, with Cecil <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/broken-sword-designer-charles-cecil-says-criticism-of-bespoke-ai-tool-is-frankly-ludicrous-" target="_blank">speaking to Game Developer</a> to try and clear it up noting they own <em>all</em> the data, it's trained with their own work, and it saves time on tedious tasks to let their artists then add the human touch after for "facial expressions, correct animations, and finesse the details" and so on.</p>
<p>There's a lot of fuss over AI art, especially because plenty of it is trained by using artwork from others, but in this case it simply sounds like a useful time-saving tool for their artists.</p>
<p>Both games are due out next year, and according to the Steam pages for each they will have Linux support too.</p>

      <title>Linux updates tease Valve &#39;Galileo&#39; and &#39;Sephiroth&#39; - Steam Deck refresh? Or new VR?</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's something that could be exciting but also could be a whole lot of nothing. So keep expectations firmly in check, but work submitted for Linux kernel 6.6 show something interesting from Valve. Potentially a Steam Deck refresh or their new VR headset perhaps?</p>
<p>The note comes from <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.6-Sound" target="_blank">Phoronix</a>, who as usual goes over basically every little thing Linux kernel related. They found work <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/87msy8hicb.wl-tiwai@suse.de/" target="_blank">being pulled in</a> for Linux kernel 6.6 sound updates, that includes additions for AMD Van Gogh, the chip used in the Steam Deck. However, when you look into the <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tiwai/sound.git/commit/?id=692f5510159c79bfa312a4e27a15e266232bfb4c" target="_blank">full updates</a> and scroll down for a while there's this interesting little bit:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4266316911693918404gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4266316911693918404gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>So here we have <em>Galileo</em> and <em>Sephiroth</em> being added for Valve - the question is <em>what</em> are they? They're being added under "Valve Jupiter device", with Jupiter being one of the names Valve seems to use for SteamOS. Considering the current SoC in the Steam Deck is named Aerith, a refresh of Sephiroth would continue their fun Final Fantasy inspired naming.</p>
<p>They <em>could</em> point to a lot of things: a Steam Deck refresh, the new VR headset we know they're working on, some developer boards they use in-house or anything really. We really have no idea but it's always fun to wonder about what it could turn out to be.</p>

      <title>Half-Life Alyx NoVR mod to get a huge upgrade in October</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The work going into the Half-Life Alyx NoVR mod is quite amazing, and while it was already very playable the next major update coming in October is going to really expand it.</p>
<p>Even in the version available now, you can complete Half-Life: Alyx with it but it's still not quite the best experience. Well, the best experience is obviously with a VR kit but you know what I mean. It's going to get much better for those without.</p>
<p>Here's what to expect in the upcoming update:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Alyx’s arms and hands fully modelled and animated.</li>
<li>Weapon firing animations for all 3 weapons.</li>
<li>Weapon idle animations for all 3 weapons.</li>
<li>Reload &amp; draw animations for all 3 weapons.</li>
<li>Upgrades for all 3 weapons.</li>
<li>Visually see each upgrade as you add each one.</li>
<li>Updated HUD.</li>
<li>Bug fixes and other updated game wide.</li>
<li>Multi-tool (maybe…this may not make the cut for this update).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They also included a teaser of the animation update:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="gXIIr3cAq_g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d6777537f3e9afd7a82887e258060572.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/gXIIr3cAq_g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>No exact date other than October for the update but we can expect another update post and another trailer on it to come in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Considering Alyx is one of my all-time favourite gaming experiences, I really can't wait for more people to be able to experience it like this. The mod team really has been putting in some serious effort to make it enjoyable for the masses of people who don't have or can't use VR. </p>
<p>See more on their <a href="https://www.moddb.com/games/half-life-alyx" target="_blank">Mod DB page</a>. Half-Life: Alyx is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/546560/HalfLife_Alyx/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Zoom Platform adds Syberia and Syberia II powered by ScummVM</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's now easier than ever to play the classic adventures Syberia and Syberia II from Microids, as the Zoom Platform has added them with cross-platform support. For those who don't know, Zoom Platform is a DRM-free store dedicated to keeping classics and modern games alive and they support Linux too.</p>
<p>Now you can grab <a href="https://www.zoom-platform.com/product/syberia-1" target="_blank">Syberia</a> and <a href="https://www.zoom-platform.com/product/syberia-2" target="_blank">Syberia II</a>, with Linux support, thanks to their team up with <a href="https://www.scummvm.org/" target="_blank">ScummVM</a> to play them with modern game engines. Nice to see another store working to ensure older games are preserved like this, especially since ScummVM do some really impressive work - so why not use it.</p>
<p>About Syberia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kate Walker, a young ambitious lawyer from New York, is handed what seems a fairly straight forward assignment - a quick stopover to handle the sale of an old automaton factory hidden in the alpine valleys, then straight back home to the US. Little did she imagine when embarking on this task that her life would be turned upside down. On her expedition across Europe, traveling from Western Europe to the far reaches of Eastern Russia, she encounters a host of incredible characters and locations in her attempt to track down Hans, the genius inventor - the final key to unlock the mystery of Syberia. Her voyage across land and time throws all she values into question, while the deal she sets out to sign turns into a pact with destiny. </p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A gripping script that goes beyond your imagination</li>
<li>Rich and intriguing characters with detailed and realistic 3D environments</li>
<li>Film-like camera angles, movements and framing</li>
<li>Original and creative puzzles (completely integrated into the scenario)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

Pictured - Syberia II</em></p>
<p>About Syberia II:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having searched Eastern and Western Europe for a missing heir, Kate Walker finally completed her long and arduous journey, obtaining the signature of Hans Voralberg and closing the automaton factory buyout. Mission accomplished? Not for this sophisticated New York lawyer… An unlikely pair, young Kate Walker and old, eccentric Hans Voralberg now set off on a journey together: in search of the last of the fabled Syberian mammoths at the heart of a long and forgotten universe. The surreal quest Hans began alone several years ago will come to a final close as he and Kate face obstacles far more dangerous than ever before, testing their courage and determination. Far and beyond, a mystical Syberia awaits their arrival… </p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Original and captivating storyline</li>
<li>Rich and intriguing new characters with new, realistically detailed 3D environments</li>
<li>Completely integrated, original puzzles that test the players skill throughout the game </li>
</ul>

      <title>Game porter Ethan Lee offers services to maintain old games for developers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ethan Lee, otherwise known as flibitijibibo (really rolls off the tongue huh), who created <a href="https://fna-xna.github.io/" target="_blank">FNA</a> and has ported a <a href="https://flibitijibibo.com/index.php?page=Portfolio/Ports" target="_blank">ton of games</a> to Linux, macOS and more has announced a <a href="https://flibitijibibo.com/maintenance.html" target="_blank">new game maintenance service</a> for developers.</p>
<p>Lee worked on ports like FEZ, Rogue Legacy 2, TMNT: Shredder's Revenge, Streets of Rage 4, Celeste, Thirty Flights of Loving and Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap just to name a few.</p>
<p>Now though, Lee is offering up a service to game developers to keep their games updated and working great on modern systems. As said in the announcement: "I am now available for hire to maintain games that have released and may no longer be in development! I believe that I can help bring your back catalog back to life, and can do so quickly and effectively with minimal costs to your business."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The platforms for maintenance and porting include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux</li>
<li>Windows</li>
<li>Xbox (One, Series X|S)</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch</li>
<li>macOS (currently x86_64 only, not Apple Silicon)</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some of what Lee has focused on recently includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steam Deck Verified certification</li>
<li>Migrating from UWP to GDK</li>
<li>Migrating XNA titles to FNA (so yes, your old XBLIG game qualifies!)</li>
<li>Public source code releases (<em>not</em> a requirement though)</li>
</ul>
<p>There's one extra little catch though, Lee said that the only requirement (apart from obviously being paid) is that there "must be a native Linux version available to customers" and if developers don't have one Lee will make one for them.</p>
<p>Sounds like a nice service for game preservation. No doubt many developers are over-worked, with plenty of indie teams having a growing list of titles they no longer worked on directly that could benefit from a little TLC. This service offers a full free assessment.</p>
<p>Contact details on <a href="https://www.flibitijibibo.com/" target="_blank">their website</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/flibitijibibo" target="_blank">on X</a>.</p>

      <title>Valve goes for the smurfs banning 90,000 people in Dota 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After the rather exciting launch of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/new-update-for-dota-2-might-pull-me-back-in-with-new-reporting-and-matchmaking/" target="_blank">the Summer Update</a> bringing with it new matchmaking and tools to get rid of bad experiences, Valve <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/570/view/3692442542242977036" target="_blank">goes for the smurfs</a> next.</p>
<p>What are smurfs? They're alternate accounts people use to go into a rank of matchmaking they shouldn't be in, to cause problems, to cheat, to grief other players and generally be toxic. They easily ruin games and so Valve pulled out the great bin ban-hammer and got rid of 90,000 of them this month.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16426574721693911554gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Valve said they also traced all the smurf accounts to the main account of each player. Going forward, Valve say, a person's main account found to be matched with a smurf could result in "a wide range of punishments, from temporary adjustments to behavior scores to permanent account bans".</p>
<p>Hopefully this threat will make more people think twice before going into an alternate account to screw up matches for others. Cheating and smurfing is a constant problem in online games, so it's good to see Valve put in serious effort to get rid of it.</p>
<p>Have you been playing Dota 2 since the Summer Update? Let me know how you've been getting on in the comments.</p>
<p>Additionally, an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/570/view/3675554676965379462" target="_blank">update</a> to Dota 2 released recently should solve these problems for Linux players:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed some over-bright rendering in Vulkan when color-correction post-processing was enabled.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash in the Vulkan renderer on Linux.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash on Linux GPUs with low memory.</li>
<li>Fixed fullscreen flickering on multi-monitor Linux systems.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer Part 32: Two Steps Forward, One Step Back</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-31-the-fear-of-loss/" target="_blank">Part 31: The Fear of Loss</a></strong></p>
<p>Over the past few months I have been making a number of upgrades and changes to Dianoga, and the time has come to lay them all out. The first upgrade I purchased at the start of the year was a simple one, and is one I have already made an allusion to in passing. German peripheral manufacturer Perixx still makes optical mice sporting a PS/2 connector, letting me experience the best of both worlds with their PERIMICE-209 WP model.</p>
<p>A cranky old ball mouse would indeed be more period accurate, but there are still some limits to what I am willing to go through for the sake of nostalgia. The only problem I encountered was not having the scroll wheel work on Linux, but this was resolved by using the mouseconfig utility and identifying the mouse as an MS Intellimouse, which is actually suggested in the official Red Hat Linux 7.3 documentation. Besides, my next upgrade would bring Dianoga more in line with the late 1990s.</p>
<p>While perusing the wares at the Barrhead Thrift Shoppe on 46th Street my brother found an AcerView 34T UVGA 13" CRT monitor selling for just $2 Canadian Dollars, allowing me to retire the LEN L151p LCD I had been using. As well as not being in keeping with the aesthetic, the LCD also had the annoying habit of showing a warning about being out of range on top of what otherwise looked to be a workable display, especially when playing games that utilized SVGAlib for graphics.</p>
<p>I could get around this by launching certain more pliant SVGAlib games such as the final build of <em>LinCity</em> before starting up the offending applications, as for whatever reason this would seem to soothe the nerves of the display, but I was more than happy to leave those headaches behind. Things were not all clear sailing with the AcerView CRT, however; Windows 98 would always default to shifting the image to the far right, beyond the bounds of the screen.</p>
<p>Compensating for this in the ATI control panel helped somewhat, but it was never perfect, and would not stay persistent upon changing screen resolutions. Linux under XFree86 also showed similar problems, but by using the xvidtune application I was able to produce workable modelines I could then add to my XF86Config-4 file to keep them preserved. I resolved that fiddling with the sizing knobs was just part of the experience, but a solution would come after something else went wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7528814021693852457gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7528814021693852457gol6.png"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2290804621693852458gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2290804621693852458gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>It was then that the inevitable happened, and the Fujitsu 10.25 GB IDE hard drive the computer came with started to show disk failures in ScanDisk. While the Hitachi 6.01 GB 9.5MM PATA hard drive I had installed Red Hat Linux 7.3 on was still working, albiet with a few quirks of its own, it was becoming clear that I was reaching the end of the road with my older platter media, and would need to go with either an SD or Compact Flash solution instead.</p>
<p>I already had in my possession a Syba 2.5" IDE to Dual Compact Flash Drive intended for use in laptops, and since I already had a PATA to IDE converter in place for the Hitachi, this proved to be no barrier to using it in Dianoga. I also had a set of two cheap Onefavor 8 GB compact flash cards on hand. Before installing Windows 98 I found I had to first format the card as fat32 with the LBA file system flag set, but it otherwise installed fine, and actually sorted my issues with the CRT display.</p>
<p>When moving on to installing Red Hat Linux 7.3 I would get a warning about the partition table being inconsistent if I had more than one compact flash card installed. The simplest solution was just to pull the other compact flash card for the install, which at least gives the benefit of ensuring Windows 98 would be unharmed while partitioning. While the performance was acceptable under Windows 98, the slow read speeds of the Onefavor card would cause the system to stall at times under Linux.</p>
<p>My QDI Advance 5/133 motherboard places a strict limit on the size of hard drive I can use, but I figured I would chance buying another cheap Cloudisk 16 GB 133x compact flash card in the hopes that I could at least make it work by flashing a later BIOS. This proved to be a mistake, but not because of the BIOS, which actually had no complaints. Red Hat Linux 7.3 literally took all night to install, and was crawling worse than it had with the Onefavor card, giving me a rude awakening.</p>
<p>In this case the problem was really on me, as the read and write speeds are displayed on the Cloudisk card label, showing off my lack of due diligence. In the end I bit the bullet and bought a more expensive but far faster Transcend 16 GB compact flash card running at 1066x speeds, which brought down the install time in Anaconda to just shy of half an hour. I now had more than doubled the amount of hard drive space Linux had available, and could enjoy more games with my CRT monitor.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA Vulkan Beta 535.43.09 and stable 535.104.05 drivers out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA recently released two fresh driver upgrades for Linux, although one of them we have no idea what they actually changed. Here's what's up.</p>
<p>Firstly, NVIDIA launched the stable driver update <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/download/driverResults.aspx/210649/en-uk/" target="_blank">535.104.05</a> on August 22nd. However, for the second time recently, they seem to have copy-pasted the driver changelog from the previous release. This driver has the <em>same</em> changelog as 535.98, and when 535.98 released it had the same changelog as 535.86.05 but they later corrected it. I tried to contact NVIDIA this time but here we are nearly two weeks later and they haven't fixed it. So what did they change in 535.104.05? No idea.</p>
<p>On September 2nd they also released a fresh <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" target="_blank">Vulkan Beta</a> Driver 535.43.09 for developers with these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_NV_descriptor_pool_overallocation.html" target="_blank">VK_NV_descriptor_pool_overallocation</a></li>
</ul>

<li>Fixes:

<li>Correctly clear fragment shading rate attachments with LOAD_OP_CLEAR</li>
<li>Fix potential device lost with vkCmdBlitImage when fragment shading rate is used</li>
<li>Correctly restore pipeline static state if previously overwritten by dynamic state set calls and pipeline is rebound</li>
<li>Fix dual-source blending when output is written to an array variable</li>
<li>Fix VK_KHR_cooperative_matrix bug with variable pointer shared memory CTS tests</li>

      <title>Here&#39;s how Starfield runs on Steam Deck and desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to know how <strong>Starfield</strong> runs on Steam Deck? Or desktop Linux? Well, I've given it a run to see what I think of it and here's some early info for you.</p>
<p>For Steam Deck, Valve released <em>two</em> Steam Deck OS upgrades to solve some issues, so you'll want to make sure you check for system updates first to get Steam Deck OS 3.4.10 to fix a GPU driver crash and a black screen problem. Once you update, Starfield <em>will</em> run on Steam Deck with Proton Experimental but the performance <em>is</em> an issue. Additionally, weirdly, the Start / Select buttons on Steam Deck with Proton Experimental are swapped - but you can change them over in Steam Input (noted in video 2 below).</p>
<p>On the lowest possible details with FSR set ON, some sections are fine but when things heat up, and just being in certain areas, the performance will repeatedly drop hard below 30FPS. So right now, it's far less than <em>properly</em> playable.</p>
<p>Here's two Steam Deck videos of the early game:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zPVzHbNwnN4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f0d272858c248912c2871b81a836f894.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zPVzHbNwnN4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The next video showcases the performance issues you can see quite well, in the city of New Atlantis:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JznnRzCjGKc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f8352bad67f62c60ac66652060a6b1ee.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JznnRzCjGKc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>If Bethesda manage to do some performance patches, where we can get it to a stable 30FPS then it would be pretty great because the gameplay would hold up quite well on Steam Deck at a static 30. Or perhaps Valve have some boosts waiting in Proton and SteamOS upgrades to come, we can hope anyway. This screenshot sums up the experience when running around a city on Steam Deck:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6113035261693828313gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6113035261693828313gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>There's already a number of performance mods out there, including one noted to be for Steam Deck, but in my own testing they don't work particularly well on Steam Deck and one in particular doing the rounds really breaks the lighting.</p>
<p>As for desktop Linux the situation is a little more complicated. As per what the developer of VKD3D-Proton (the Direct3D to Vulkan translation in Proton) <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/issues/1678#issuecomment-1702489043" target="_blank">posted</a> on GitHub there's big issues for NVIDIA and slightly less so for AMD:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NV 535 stable is clearly bugged here. 525.47.35 at least seems to work though ...</p>
<p>Performance on NV currently is known to be extremely poor due to being completely CPU bound. This is caused by lack of us enabling NV_device_generated_compute on NV due to a driver bug. <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/pull/1639" target="_blank">#1639</a> for details. When the beta driver updates, it should start running much better.</p>
<p>On Mesa desktop, please ensure that:</p>
<ul>
<li>You're running kernels 5.15.121+, 6.1.40+ or 6.4.5+ to fix a kernel regression that affected Starfield. Without it, GPU will hang randomly.</li>
<li>You're running mesa from git to get VK_NV_device_generated_commands_compute for optimal performance.</li>
<li>Proton Experimental</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I've been unable to use Mesa-git on Kubuntu in my testing, because the current build from <a href="https://launchpad.net/~oibaf/+archive/ubuntu/graphics-drivers" target="_blank">Oibaf</a> seems to break Vulkan. So sticking with Kisak's <a href="https://launchpad.net/~kisak/+archive/ubuntu/kisak-mesa" target="_blank">fresh Mesa PPA</a> for 23.1.6 here's how it ran for me:</p>

      <title>Linux user share remains above macOS in the latest Steam Survey</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After the rather exciting development <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/linux-overtakes-macos-users-on-steam-thanks-to-steam-deck/" target="_blank">in the last</a> Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey where Linux users overtook macOS for the first time, the latest survey shows Linux continues to be above macOS but with the numbers dipping down.</p>
<p>The latest results for August 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 96.61% + 0.40%</li>
<li>Linux 1.82% - 0.14%</li>
<li>OSX 1.57% - 0.27%</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7568046251693676435gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7568046251693676435gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>When switching over to the Linux-only data here’s the most popular distributions for gaming on Steam:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 44.18% +2.11%</li>
<li>"Arch Linux" 64 bit 7.68% -0.26%</li>
<li>Freedesktop.org SDK 22.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 6.03% +0.04%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS 64 bit 4.10% -3.28%</li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 3.99% -0.30%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 21.2 64 bit 3.41% +3.41%</li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 2.93% -0.04%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS 64 bit 2.91% +2.91%</li>
<li>Other 24.78% -0.74%</li>
</ul>
<p>So we continue to see that the Steam Deck with SteamOS is what's really pushing Linux gaming right now with it growing again this month compared to other distributions.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 8-14 released, deprecated workarounds removed</title>
      <author>Smellbringer</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases" target="_blank">latest release for GE-Proton</a>, the community version of Proton, has dropped. Version 8-14 brings with it several fixes and workaround removals that had deprecated. We must note that this isn't the official version of Proton from Valve, so you'll have to download it separately.</p>
<p>We also should point out that this is only really recommended for games that are having issues running normally under Valve's version of Proton. For example, GE-Proton 8-14 fixes cutscene audio in the Atelier Ryza trilogy and black screening in Star Trek Online. So if you want to play those games on Linux, the listed issues won't be there anymore.</p>

      <title>The state of optimus-manager explained by its developer</title>
      <author>nwildner</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/Askannz/optimus-manager" target="_blank">Optimus-manager</a> is a nice piece of software that lets you configure dual GPU setups usually available on laptops that share the same built-in screen and have a lot of nuances to be dealt with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there a <a href="https://jarrods.tech/what-is-a-mux-switch-for-gaming-laptops/" target="_blank">mux switch</a> available?</li>
<li>Are the HDMI or DP output ports hardwired to the laptop? <strong>PS</strong>: one of my current <a href="https://rog-forum.asus.com/t5/tuf-asus-gaming-notebooks/can-t-achieve-144fps-when-dp-is-connected-to-combo-port/m-p/945788" target="_blank">unanswered</a> questions from ASUS.</li>
<li>Is the integrated GPU Intel or AMD?</li>
<li>Is the dedicated GPU able to handle PCI resets when you want to disconnect it?</li>
<li>Are you able to disable the iGPU on BIOS and let only the dGPU on? (In my case, no)</li>
<li>The list goes on...</li>
</ul>
<p>I've started using optimus-manager after I noticed some performance improvements of nearly 10% more frames per second when using my dedicated GPU only from the boot rather than using some GPU delegation tool like Prime Rendering. But that is something to be discussed in another article. This software basically works by probing well-known PCI output for GPUs using <code class="inline-code"><tt>lspci</tt></code> auto generating a Xorg configuration for one of the three following modes depending on your setup before loading your login manager:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hybrid: iGPU is the primary, offload to dGPU when needed</li>
<li>Dedicated: X and applications will always run on dGPU</li>
<li>Integrated: iGPU will be the only GPU available(alias to Intel mode).</li>
</ul>
<p>It also comes with a nice Qt-based system tray applet for those who want to change the configuration on the go and relogin on X to apply it. My current <a href="https://gitlab.com/nwildner/dotfiles/-/blob/master/etc/optimus-manager/optimus-manager.conf?ref_type=heads" target="_blank">configuration</a> is: Hybrid mode when booting on battery, Dedicated mode when booting with a power cord attached.</p>
<p>The first setup of my current laptop took me more time than I would expected because optimus-manager has a lingering issue opened regarding dealing with Domain IDs on PCI:  <a class="Link--primary css-truncate css-truncate-target js-issue-title js-smoothscroll-anchor markdown-title width-fit" href="https://github.com/Askannz/optimus-manager/issues/471#top" target="_blank">Wrong BusID in generated xorg.conf</a> .</p>
<p><code>[nwildner@sandworm ~]$ lspci -m | grep -i 'RTX\|UHD'<br/>
00:02.0 "VGA compatible controller" "Intel Corporation" "Alder Lake-P GT1 [UHD Graphics]" -r0c -p00 "ASUSTeK Computer Inc." "Device 136d"<br/>
01:00.0 "VGA compatible controller" "NVIDIA Corporation" "GA104M [GeForce RTX 3070 Mobile / Max-Q]" -ra1 -p00 "ASUSTeK Computer Inc." "Device 136d"<br/>
[nwildner@sandworm ~]$ lspci | grep -i 'RTX\|UHD'<br/>
0000:00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Alder Lake-P GT1 [UHD Graphics] (rev 0c)<br/>
0000:01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GA104M [GeForce RTX 3070 Mobile / Max-Q] (rev a1)</code></p>
<p>To make things harder, Xorg has some arcane configuration where Domain ID and BUS ID need to be swapped in order(first 2 columns of <code class="inline-code"><tt>lspci</tt></code> output), and running <code class="inline-code"><tt>lspci</tt></code> in compatibility mode to suppress the Domain ID will generate a broken Xorg configuration crashing X.</p>
<p>While this isn't a deal breaker because I already have a workaround in place, I was wondering it this issue was ever going to be fixed. Tried to download to submit some patches myself that would handle the PCI Domain ID stuff, but to my surprise I'm not the only one not really familiarized with the software. The lead developer is also struggling on this one.</p>
<p>Since there wasn't much activity on optimus-manager repository lately, I decided to google keywords like "is optimus manager active?", "is optimus manager abandoned" , "state of optimus manager" and unfortunately I've found an announcement from the lead developer of this tool that it is a little saddening: <a href="https://github.com/Askannz/optimus-manager/issues/543" target="_blank">[Discussion] The state of optimus-manager</a>. Basically the developer stated that he does not have the energy, the hardware neither the knowledge to keep up with such a big project that looked simpler at first place when forked from Ubuntu. <strong>And that is OK</strong>.</p>
<p>While it is sad that optimus-manager is not being actively maintained anymore, it is nice to see the official feedback from the lead developer, admitting that he might have fell into the trap where the project seemed to be simpler that he thought.</p>
<p><strong>Some lessons to be learned here are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For those who want to use optimus-manager, there could be other alternatives like Prime and stay on hybrid mode always. Don't take my word for granted on performance and try it by yourself.</li>
<li>While the project is in a "limbo", it might be stable enough for your daily use.</li>
<li>Don't expect updates on the software, but also, try to not blame the lead developer who took the first step into the obscure world of dealing with multi GPU setups on Linux laptops.</li>
<li><em>The project needs more hands and eyeballs so, if you have the knowledge just sent some patches. </em>Or if you are really knowledgeable of laptop GPU setups, the lead developer can hand over the project to you.</li>

      <title>War Thunder&#39;s next major update is &#39;Sons of Attila&#39;, plus easier vehicle unlocks coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gaijin Entertainment have teased the next big update for War Thunder, named Sons of Attila and they continue to work through their roadmap to improve other parts of the game. War Thunder has Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>First up, here's the teaser for Sons of Attila:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="fJrT2vP-mpQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1e94adc51dc39dd32dfa57365f570cc0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/fJrT2vP-mpQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Also, I really do love seeing that Linux tux icon in their trailers, they're one of the few who do it and they've supported Linux long-term and it continues to run well.</p>
<p>The developers also recently <a href="https://warthunder.com/en/news/8433-roadmap-following-the-roadmap-reducing-research-purchase-cost-of-aircraft-map-changes-more-en" target="_blank">blogged</a> that they're making some changes to aircraft unlock costs and research point requirements, making them actually easier and slightly less of a grind. So in future you can expect to see reductions for:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The amount of Research Points required to research vehicles.</li>
<li>The amount of Research Points required to research modifications of vehicles.</li>
<li>The Silver Lion cost for purchasing vehicles.</li>
<li>The Silver Lion cost for crewing vehicles.</li>
<li>The Silver Lion cost for purchasing an Expert Crew.</li>
<li>The Silver Lion cost for purchasing modifications.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus, they're tweaking the purchase cost on a "wide range" of most vehicles in all ranks across  aircraft, ground vehicles and naval forces to reduce them. This includes a reduction in cost for crewing vehicles, purchasing Expert Crews, as well as vehicle modifications.</p>
<p>In other War Thunder news, once again someone recently <a href="https://twitter.com/BurkeKrohn/status/1696354150131318815" target="_blank">leaked</a> restricted military information on the War Thunder forum. Not quite as bad as previous times though, this one seems to only be restricted in certain countries. </p>
<p>Play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/236390/War_Thunder/" target="_blank">free on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Crusader Kings III hits 3 million sales after 3 years</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox Interactive announced today that following the recent release of Wards &amp; Wardens for Crusader Kings III, that on the 3 year mark they've now hit 3 million sales. Crusader Kings III has Native Linux support, and it is rated Steam Deck Playable by Valve.</p>
<p>In all the madness of the recent releases, I also totally missed covering that Crusader Kings III: Wards &amp; Wardens along with the free 1.10.0 "Quill" update went out towards the end of August. Some of the free stuff for all players includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A new system for rulers giving or trading Hostages brings a new side of historical medieval politics to life - Hostages are powerful tools for ensuring peace, as they can be executed during wars to make your enemy suffer a great blow to their morale and stability. Hostages can be identified by a new portrait icon.
<ul>
<li>They can be demanded, exchanged, or even used to bargain beneficial peace deals during wars!</li>
<li>Having Hostages of notable status will reward you with both prestige and renown.</li>
<li>While hostages are most often children, there’s no guarantee that their warden will send them back as they come of age… after all, they are great bargaining chips!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The new Perpetual Hook type lies in-between Weak and Strong Hooks, acting like a Weak hook that can be re-used every few years.</li>
<li>A new Adoption interaction allows certain rulers to bring in new members to their family and dynasty. Characters with the Compassionate trait or of a culture. with certain Traditions can Adopt, but the restrictions can also be tightened or removed via a new Game Rule!</li>
<li>A new Eccentric personality trait allows characters with it to develop their Lifestyles with ease at the cost of public perception, as their methods might be seen as erratic and odd! Several new event options have been added for the trait, and some of the more ‘out there’ events have been updated to require this trait to fire.</li>
<li>Added 6 new events to the Pet Cat story Cycle.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>From the 3 million sales / 3 year anniversary press release:</p>
<p>"The last three years have been very busy and very exciting, and it's thrilling to see so many people enjoy what we have built,” says Alex Oltner, Game Director for Crusader Kings III. “Crusader Kings III is a very special game that has something to appeal to almost everyone - conquerors, builders, storytellers, and romantics. The response to our recent Tours &amp; Tournaments expansion has been especially gratifying and we have so many more ideas we want to bring to life. Our entire team is grateful to everyone who has helped make Crusader Kings III what it has become."</p>

      <title>Steam Deck OS 3.4.9 released with GPU fix for Starfield</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/steam-deck-os-349-beta-gets-a-gpu-fix-for-an-upcoming-game/" target="_blank">As I speculated previously</a> when Steam Deck OS 3.4.9 went into Preview, Valve has now <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3702568031464333823?snr=2_9_100015_" target="_blank">released</a> it as a Stable update for all Steam Deck owners for Starfield.</p>
<p>When the update launched into Preview, Valve only noted the GPU fix was for "an upcoming game". Now Steam Deck OS 3.4.9 is Stable with the changelog noted as:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a GPU driver crash with Starfield</li>
<li>Fixed hangs on reboot when switching from upcoming Beta OS releases.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I will have a very rough quick first-look as soon as Starfield is installed and ready on my Steam Deck. Stay tuned on that one (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gamingonlinux" target="_blank">follow on YouTube</a>), I'm not expecting performance to be particularly good though <em>for now</em>. As we've seen with many AAA launches, they generally work better (and in many cases fully Steam Deck Verified) a few weeks after release.</p>
<p>Nice to see Valve get ahead of this one though, good to see such prompt updates for the Steam Deck!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8487039221693527057gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8487039221693527057gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Starfield</p>
<p>For players who pre-purchased the special deluxe edition, early access for Starfield has now begun, with the full release on September 6th.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1697431054167183682" target="_blank">mentioned</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a known issue with Starfield where the initial window waits on a black screen. You can tap it with the touchscreen to progress past it, and we are releasing another OS update with a fix within the next hour.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Update #2</strong>: Steam Deck OS 3.4.10 has <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3687939575938360687?snr=2_9_100015_" target="_blank">rolled out</a> for the extra fix "where Starfield could become stuck on a black screen while launching, waiting for touchscreen interaction."</p>

      <title>Embracer closes Volition developer of Freespace, Red Faction, Saints Row</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, there goes another big industry name. Embracer Group, who currently own a stupidly vast portfolio of developers and publisher has shut down Volition.</p>
<p>The news was shared by Volition on their <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/volition_an-update-from-volition-activity-7103051392797351936-hkgT/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> that reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Volition team has proudly created world-class entertainment for fans around the globe for 30 years. We've been driven by a passion for our community and always worked to deliver joy, surprise, and delight.</p>
<p>This past June, Embracer Group announced a restructuring program to strengthen Embracer and maintain its position as a leader in the video game industry. As part of that program, they evaluated strategic and operational goals and made the difficult decision to close Volition effective immediately.</p>
<p>To help our team, we are working to provide job assistance and help smooth the transition for our Volition family members. We thank our customers and fans around the world for all the love and support over the years.<br/>
You will always be in our hearts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A shame to see such a name shut. That said, their latest release with the Saints Row reboot didn't exactly gain recognition. It also caused Volition to move under Gearbox. Embracer themselves <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q2-july-september-2022-net-sales-increased-by-190-to-sek-9569-million-35-organic-growth/" target="_blank">said</a> that Saints Row had "left the fanbase partially polarized" although the game had "performed in line with management expectations in the quarter".</p>
<p>This won't be the last getting shut, as Embracer <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/after-eating-up-lots-of-game-studios-embracer-group-set-to-close-a-bunch/" target="_blank">previously announced</a> a comprehensive restructuring program.</p>

      <title>HoloCure is a Vampire Survivors clone that&#39;s free, really cute and surprisingly fun </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I will admit, I know basically nothing about Hololive, VTubers or anything like that and yet I'm now completely sucked in by the free fan game HoloCure - Save the Fans! This is a Vampire Survivors clone made for fans of Hololive, but don't let that dissuade you, it's also a surprisingly great game to kill some time with.</p>
<p>You pick a character, and go through various stages to beat a boss and then move onto the next stage when you unlock it. Or you can pick the endless mode and just keep going. It's an auto-attack game, with defeated enemies dropping little arrows to pick up to level you up where you can pick from a randomised set of new abilities or character buffs. So, you know, it's Vampire Survivors in another skin. For the most part anyway, it takes VS and does its own thing with it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="fKtS-EK2D5o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/46d12899a8c79f4934fd9de2e6e2ce60.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/fKtS-EK2D5o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's various extras inside it too with an upgrade system, a sort of in-joke about gacha games with you buying extras with the entirely in-game earned currency too. Quite a lot of characters too, I counted 38 of them to unlock with 5 given to you at the start free. Again though, all of it you earn in-game, it's entirely free as a fan game.</p>
<p>On top of all the characters, and the many stages to play through there's even an extra part with the Holo House you unlock. This is like an extra mini-game, where you can do extra activities some of which will also give you a boost in the main stages gameplay. </p>
<p>So many things to talk about the design of it, because honestly it's amazing. From the different enemy waves, to the anvil that drops down from the sky to let you augment your weapons. Who would have thought that one of the best <em>free</em> games this year would be a VS clone? At one point I was able to create flames just by walking, and I turned my sword into a great big flame too:</p>
<div class="ckeditor-html5-video" data-responsive="true" style="text-align: center;">
<video autoplay="autoplay" controls="controls" loop="loop" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15112293201693486681gol1.mp4" style="height:auto; max-width:100%"></video>
</div>
<p style="text-align:center"><em>Clip captured on Kubuntu 23.04</em></p>
<p>So many fun combinations you can do with the characters and the upgrade system. I'm only really just starting to properly get into the game, absolutely loads more to unlock and I really can't wait to spend some more time with it on my coffee breaks.</p>
<p>Really impressive stuff and it's proven popular with a peak player count today alone of 18,868 people. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21244064281693484935gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21244064281693484935gol1.jpeg"/></a>Pictured - HoloCure - Save the Fans! on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>It has no Steam Deck rating yet, but as far as I can see it works great! Performance is good, it looks great and everything I can see works as expected. It doesn't have full controller support, so you may see some keyboard icons but it still works just fine out of the box. On desktop Linux, it's much the same. No issues there and with Proton 8 it works to perfection.</p>
<p>Lots of unique cute characters, all with their own abilities and styles. Totally free, no micro-transactions of any sort. Great retro beats to bop your head along to as well. What's not to love about this? Go check it out and thank me later.</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2420510/HoloCure__Save_the_Fans/" target="_blank">out on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Halls of Torment adds new characters, new stage, &#39;Agony Mode&#39; and much more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, there goes basically all of my free time. Halls of Torment blends together retro Diablo with Vampire Survivors and it was already horribly addictive and now I fear I'm going to be sucked in again.</p>
<p>This new update has expanded the game quite a lot, surprisingly so. Firstly there's a new 'Class Marks' feature that allows you to pick traits for your character from other classes, although it needs you to finish certain quests.</p>

<p>There's also a new 'Agony Mode' that unlocks once you defeat the Lord of a stage. Agony Mode makes the monster count, monster health, and XP drops dynamically scale based on your performance. So agony increases the more you kill, and reduces the more that's left alive. Here you'll find uncommon items, additional champions will spawn and they are randomized with extra modifiers and abilities and these champions will drop various rewards for you.</p>
<p>Some of the other new stuff:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>New stage: Frozen Depths</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Can be unlocked by defeating the frost knight on the Forgotten Viaduct.</li>
<li>New unknown enemies await with 3 unique bosses and a new lord.</li>
<li>The stage layout limits your movement and requires you to navigate carefully through the caves while avoiding getting encircled by foes.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>New elemental effect: Frost</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Frost explodes and deals damage in an area when the affected monster dies or 20 stacks have been accumulated.</li>
<li>If the frost effect runs out it triggers with only half of its damage.</li>
<li>Frost deals damage based on the number of stacks.</li>
<li>The strongest hit that applied frost determines the area of the effect.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>New characters</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Norseman
<ul>
<li>Dual wielding axe fighter boosting your physical abilities.</li>
<li>When he hits a certain number of enemies he unleashes a devastating Frost Nova.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Beast Huntress
<ul>
<li>Throws her spear with great force, piercing through the enemy lines and applying frost effect.</li>
<li>Has a hound that protects her from close enemies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>New abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ice Avalanche: an ice based attack with a diagonal pattern.</li>
<li>Flame Strike: close quarter defense or boss killer.</li>
<li>Arcane Rift: magic mines that deal devastating damage.</li>
<li>Spirit Warrior: summoned warrior that dashes through enemies.</li>

      <title>New update for Dota 2 might pull me back in, with new reporting and matchmaking</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It finally seems like it might be time for me to put another 500 hours into Dota 2, as Valve has given the game quite an interesting upgrade for The Summer Client Update.</p>
<p>Firstly, they've completely changed the way you view and buy cosmetics. Before, it was quite a mess. Now there's the Armory where you can go and view all characters and shop around for all the cosmetics available. Allowing you to see what you're missing, and what you currently have. It's <em>much</em> better. It also allows you to quickly demo a hero while previewing a cosmetic set.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2861663091693477860gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2861663091693477860gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>That's not the best bit though. The new matchmaking and reporting system is finally sounding like it might actually make Dota 2 a better place to spend your free time.</p>
<p>Now the commendation system will affect matchmaking. A player you commend is more likely to show up in future games, while a new "Dislike" button will make them less likely to show up. There's also the new reporting system allowing you to report Toxic Chat, Toxic Voice, Smurfing, Griefing, Cheating and Role Abuse. You can report any time during or after a match, allowing you to make a report for either your team or the enemy and removes the cap on the number of reports you can submit.</p>
<p>There's also now real-time processing of toxic chat. So when you report someone during a game, Valve say it will be analysed in real-time. If they detect it's toxic, Valve will mute that player's voice and text chat for the game and put a timer on pings, alt-clicks and pre-set chat wheels.</p>
<p>Valve will also notify you when action is taken thanks to a report.</p>
<p>Each player also has a behaviour and communication score between 0 and 12,000. While it previously only affected who you got matched with, it will now also disable access to certain features like post-game item drops, game pausing, and ranked play if you're particularly naughty.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11502606991693478286gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11502606991693478286gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>This update sound fantastic. Valve has clearly put real proper effort into making Dota 2 better going forward. I can't wait to spend some time with it again.</p>

      <title>SteamWorld Build arrives December 1st with full Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SteamWorld Build is the latest in the SteamWorld series from Thunderful Development / Thunderful Publishing and they're once again entirely changing the genre for the series and turning it into a city-builder.</p>
<p>While previous games in the series including SteamWorld Dig, SteamWorld Dig 2, SteamWorld Heist and SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech all had Native Linux releases — this time SteamWorld Build will not as <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2134770/discussions/0/3764480918998658630/#c3764481114698409787" target="_blank">confirmed</a> on their Steam forum. However, they also <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2134770/discussions/0/3779119905188346209/#c3779119905191384690" target="_blank">confirmed</a> it will have full controller and Steam Deck support so no doubt it will run great with Proton (reports on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/2134770?device=any" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> from the demo show it running just fine).</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="gz0V9Z9SPgk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fab021c51f1fb8e11facf48cf43d7ca9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/gz0V9Z9SPgk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it: "Be the architect of a SteamWorld mining town! Break ground and raise houses for your steambot citizens, keep them fed and provide some rootin'-tootin' entertainment.</p>
<p>There's an abandoned mine sitting under your town, and it’s rumored to be filled with ancient tech that holds the key to escaping the impending doom. Use the natural resources above ground and the abundant ores buried in the mine to expand your town. Stimulate new residential tiers to join the quest to dig deeper, unearth untold riches and ultimately help them to hightail it off the planet!"</p>
<p>There is a demo available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2134770/SteamWorld_Build/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and the full release will also be on <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/steamworld_build" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>

      <title>Slime Rancher is being turned into a movie</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this could be a whole lot of fun! Slime Rancher, the series of games about a lone rancher sucking up slimes in a vacuum gun is getting a movie adaptation.</p>
<p>First reported by <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/08/story-kitchen-monomi-park-slime-rancher-1235520932/" target="_blank">Deadline</a>, game developer Monomi Park has teamed up with Story Kitchen for the full feature film. This is the same team who are also working on the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/animated-series-in-the-works-for-vampire-survivors-plus-big-upgrade-upcoming/" target="_blank">Vampire Survivors TV series</a>. Writing on X, Monomi Park founder Nick Popovich <a href="https://twitter.com/NickPopovich/status/1692267594341048347" target="_blank">confirmed </a>the news simply stating "Yes, I'm excited.".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/360990091693404588gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/360990091693404588gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Slime Rancher</em></p>
<p>Could be quite fun, it's definitely an interesting setting to have a movie about it and the games are just wonderful too and both games work well on Linux. </p>
<p>Slime Rancher is also one of the best-reviewed games on Steam, currently sitting at position number 21 on <a href="https://steam250.com/top250" target="_blank">Steam Top 250</a>. It sold well too, with the developer <a href="https://twitter.com/slimerancher/status/1570136503539634177" target="_blank">announcing</a> last year it hit the 6 million mark. Slime Rancher 2, currently in Early Access, is also <a href="https://twitter.com/NickPopovich/status/1574485734840360962" target="_blank">clearly</a> quite a hit selling over 300,000 copies in only a few days.</p>
<p>No details on when it will release, there's no real info on anything yet apart from a confirmation that it's happening.</p>

      <title>Check out the demo for Crop Rotation, a farming-themed card drafting game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A farming-themed card drafting game? Well that's a new one. Crop Rotation is releasing on September 15th and there's a fresh demo available on Steam now too. It will have Native Linux support at release.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="v9diokKi1LY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e6f8007d596d42962d4eb7626b1e751c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/v9diokKi1LY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer doesn't give you much to go on though, here's the synopsis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have taken a loan to buy an automated farm. The loan is huge but the farm should pay for itself right ??? RIGHT???</p>
<p>Crop Rotation is a farming-theme card drafting game. Cards are played automatically so you can focus on the deck building and building synergies.</p>
<p>Earn enough money to pay off the loan, or spend all of them rerolling for that one card</p>
<p>Play in relaxed mode, or chase high score in rating mode, or play the weekly mode to show off your skill.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems like it could be interesting, nice to see indie developers continue trying all sorts of new things both weird and wonderful like this. They're a solo developer and you can follow them for more on <a href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@ZwodahS" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>.</p>
<p>Check <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2348090/Crop_Rotation/" target="_blank">it out on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Budgie 10.8 desktop released with plenty of new features</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://buddiesofbudgie.org/blog/budgie-10.8-released" target="_blank">Budgie 10.8</a> was released recently, bringing plenty of enhancements to this interesting desktop environment so here's a little run over what's new.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18120771811693402979gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18120771811693402979gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<ul>
<li>New trash applet - a previously third-party addon is now part of the main Budgie project for users to add to their desktops.</li>
<li>Magpie - a new soft-fork of GNOME's Mutter, to enable them to keep up X11 support in a good state. Eventually it will be a full wlroots-based Wayland compositor as they will drop X11 support to go all-in on Wayland.</li>
<li>Privilege Escalation Dialog Improvements - when PolicyKit pops up an overlay for you to enter a password, you can expand a little details tab to see what exactly requested it.</li>
<li>Battery Status Applet - you can now control system power modes and swap between Balanced, Power Saver and Performance depending on your system's support for it.</li>
<li>System Tray Applet - now using the modern Status Notifier specification.</li>
<li>Budgie Menu - had some menu category reorganisation to be more clear.</li>
<li>Small theme refinements.</li>
</ul>
<p>The question in mind is: why would you use Budgie? What does it offer that's better than say KDE Plasma, GNOME and others? If you use it, let me know why in the comments.</p>

<p>Of course, I'm still salty that Blizzard hasn't brought Starcraft or Warcraft to Steam nor did Microsoft put Halo Wars on sale. But it's fine, there's plenty of other games to choose from. I'll probably get <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/sub/37429/" target="_blank">X-COM</a> and maybe <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/839770/Phoenix_Point/" target="_blank">Phoenix Point</a>, which I shouted out because it's made by the original developer of the 90's X-COM.</p>

      <title>Patch 2 for Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 coming with &#39;major performance improvements&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Larian only just released a MASSIVE patch for Baldur's Gate 3, and another is being planned out to come with some "major performance improvements" which sounds exciting - especially for Steam Deck players.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/patch-1-now-live_87" target="_blank">first patch</a> went live on August 25th, and the patch notes were <em>so long</em> it couldn't fit on Steam. With it addressing over 1,000 bugs like short characters not really being able to smooch properly. That's been addressed now though so Larian say they're bringing back "Short King Summer".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18877358961693329323gol1.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18877358961693329323gol1.gif"/></a></p>
<p>So what's all this about a second patch then? Well, on X (formerly Twitter) Larian Studios <a href="https://twitter.com/larianstudios/status/1696534057251921949" target="_blank">posted</a> this:</p>
<p>"Patch 2 is around the corner. It features major performance improvements, many new tweaks &amp; changes, and begins our journey incorporating feedback into Origin Character epilogues, among other major things. Details coming soon."</p>
<p>Given how even on my desktop, certain parts would drop quite a lot in performance, this is good news. We already know they're planning to upgrade to FSR 2.2 as they previously confirmed, but some major performance improvements on top of that are going to be very welcome as it's really <em>rough</em> in many parts on Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>You can buy Baldur's Gate 3 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/baldurs_gate_iii?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>
<p>Still easily going to be my GOTY, unless something else particularly amazing appears. Starfield who? How's your play-through going? It's still proving to be a huge game with a peak player count today of 539,576 which is very impressive.</p>

      <title>Schizollama from Chaosmonger Studio is a blazing-fast run and gun game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Chaosmonger Studio sure are busy. After releasing ENCODYA and Clunky Hero, then announcing Soul Tolerance and Three Minutes To Eight they've now announced a fifth game. It's called Schizollama and it looks ridiculous.</p>
<p>Their aim with it is to create "one of fastest action-platformers on the market" with retro-arcade pixel visuals "to entertain different generations of players, with tons of funny splatterish elements, fast-paced action, humor, and randomized levels". Check out their first trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rYp7zt4LMIs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6eb86b17b1e6f65573ead423c47632e1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rYp7zt4LMIs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Procedurally generated levels for nearly infinite replayability.</li>
<li>Colored pixel-art toon graphic, with frame-by-frame animations.</li>
<li>Fantasy violence, with liters of pixelated blood and funny splatter scenes.</li>
<li>Two multiplayer co-op.</li>
<li>Very fast action.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>More about it: " A group of highly-trained mercenaries is hired by a wise old llama to join an almost impossible mission. The aim of which is to exterminate every alpaca out there. The reason? Well, first of all, they are disgusting beasts, second, they are often confused with llamas, therefore is better for everybody if only one species survives. Aboard a drilling-machine, the llamas will travel a bizarre journey all around the world, digging their way out, collecting funky substances, and fighting an army of alpacas and their beastie allies."</p>
<p>There's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2571500/Schizollama/" target="_blank">demo available now on Steam</a> with planned full support for Linux (including Steam Deck), macOS and Windows. With a plan for a full launch sometime in mid-2024 and they're also launching a Kickstarter to help fund it in a few weeks.</p>

      <title>Check out the demo for upcoming action RPG Drova - Forsaken Kin</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Drova - Forsaken Kin is an upcoming action RPG from Just2D and Deck13, inspired by the allure of Celtic mythology. There's also a fresh demo out to try.</p>
<p>More about it: "Drova - Forsaken Kin is a pixel art Action-RPG inspired by the grim dark classics of the genre and the mystical allure of Celtic mythology. Dive into a handcrafted open world where your choices and actions shape the environment. A society has discovered the power of a dead empire: to capture the spirits that govern nature and rule over them instead. However, the anger of the remaining spirits divided them. Where will you stand?"</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Free navigation in a dynamic hand crafted open world.</li>
<li>Flow based combat system with different combos and weapons.</li>
<li>Tailored story based on your actions and dialogues.</li>
<li>Join one of two factions to survive in this world.</li>
<li>Learn and master various abilities to create your own playstyle.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It will have Native Linux support and there is a Linux demo available. At least from the trailer it looks like it could be quite an interesting one, with some good looking environments if you like your pixel art. The full release is due out sometime in 2024 so it's a while away.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1585180/Drova__Forsaken_Kin/" target="_blank">Give it a go on Steam</a> with the new demo.</p>

      <title>Dev of Shadow Tactics, Desperados III, Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew shutting down</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this is certainly unexpected. Mimimi Games developer of games including Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun, Desperados III and the recently launched Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew will be closing up.</p>
<p>I'm honestly shocked by this one, as they made some really great games in a genre that not many other developers are doing (or not doing well). Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew also only just launched on August 17th to pretty glowing reviews from many publications and videos.</p>
<p>This just goes to show how difficult the games industry is, even for reasonably known names like Mimimi Games who made games that had great reviews.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6657625741693312876gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6657625741693312876gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew</em></p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.mimimi.games/our-final-game/" target="_blank">announcement</a> they said their increasingly ambitious games "took a heavy personal toll on us and our families" and so they're going to "prioritize our well-being and to pull the brakes instead of signing up for another multi-year production cycle" so Shadow Gambit was their last game. They'll still continue support for Shadow Gambit with patches but no more games will be made.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck OS 3.4.9 Beta gets a GPU fix for an upcoming game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's something interesting for you. Valve <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3702568031464333823?snr=2_9_100015_" target="_blank">released</a> a fresh upgrade for the Steam Deck OS now in Beta, including a fix for an upcoming game.</p>
<p>They don't actually name the game, which makes me even more curious. Likely as they don't want to name any third-party games to not cause any issues with the developer / publisher in question. What do we think it is though? Starfield? It's probably Starfield right?</p>
<p>Here's what's changed in Steam Deck OS 3.4.9 Beta:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a GPU driver crash with an upcoming game</li>
<li>Fixed hangs on reboot when switching from upcoming Beta OS releases.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>How to get it? You need to opt into the Steam Deck <strong>Preview</strong> channel. You can change this via the Settings &gt; System &gt; System Update Channel drop-down box and select Preview.</p>
<p>If it is Starfield, they'll likely want this release before the end of the week when the pre-purchase early access for it starts. Guess we'll have to wait and see. It could be anything and there's no hints as to what.</p>
<p>We're still waiting on SteamOS 3.5, which Valve seem to be taking their sweet time on, which <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/steamos-35-for-steam-deck-gets-a-screen-colour-temperature-setting/" target="_blank">recently added</a> a colour temperature setting for the screen.</p>

      <title>Daggerfall Unity adds exclusive in-game books by the original lead designer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall continues living on with Daggerfall Unity, an open source recreation of Daggerfall in the Unity engine and a new release just rolled out with Daggerfall Unity 0.15.4 Beta.</p>
<p>Some of the benefits of Daggerfall Unity include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Cross-platform (Windows/Linux/Mac)</li>
<li>Retro graphics are boosted by modern engine and lighting</li>
<li>High resolution with classic style</li>
<li>Smooth first-person controls</li>
<li>Huge draw distances</li>
<li>Quality of life enhancements</li>
<li>Mod support</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the big fun additions in Daggerfall Unity 0.15.4 Beta is the inclusion of two exclusive in-game books from the original lead designer, Ted Peterson. They give you a little background on a key figure in Daggerfall's story, and can be discovered once you progress past a key moment in the game.</p>
<p>From the release notes they say that "Ted wanted to be clear these books are in no way official and should not be considered canon. If Bethesda does something different with these characters in future then whatever Bethesda does is canon. Please also note that Part 1 and 2 are not the complete series, just the first two chapters".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1383506831693306034gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1383506831693306034gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><em>Side-note: Peterson's studio, OnceLost Games, are currently working on a big open world RPG called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1685310/The_Wayward_Realms/" target="_blank">The Wayward Realms</a>.</em></p>
<p>The rest of the update for Daggerfall Unity is a mixture of bug fixes and localization enhancements, with this version intended to be a stable beta for general play - so you're good to upgrade to it.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma 6 gets double-click to open by default and other improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Something that has proven to be quite divisive in the Linux community for KDE Plasma users is single or double-click to open something, as Plasma 6 will <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2023/08/18/this-week-in-kde-double-click-by-default/" target="_blank">default to double-click</a>.</p>
<p>It will still be configurable of course, but it's a change that has people split with lots of posts across social media arguing about it. Me though? I'm happy about it! Single click to open just seemed like such an odd default to have. Especially so for people coming from Windows, which as we all know is the most used desktop platform - for such a <em>small</em> thing, it just makes sense to match the behaviour there.</p>
<p>On top of that, Plasma 6 will also have touchpads have <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2023/08/25/this-week-in-kde-tap-to-click-by-default/" target="_blank">tap to click turned on</a> by default now that touchpads aren't as bad as they were 9 years ago when the original decision was made.</p>
<p>Another big change is how bug reporting happens when apps crash on Plasma, with it being much more simplified with an option to report the issues automatically. So you won't even need to sign up for a Bugzilla account, bugs get reported quicker and hopefully this will means bugs get solved faster.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13187061151693304851gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>There's so much more the KDE team have been doing for Plasma lately, here's some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keyboard brightness level on many laptops now shows an on-screen display for the change.</li>
<li>When toggling keyboard backlight off / on it now remembers the original brightness level.</li>
<li>Minimum screen brightness now set to 1 so you can't accidentally turn it off.</li>

      <title>Linux kernel 6.5 released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here it is, on August 27th the latest work by a great many developers was released with Linus Torvalds announcing the Linux kernel 6.5. From the release <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2023/8/27/348" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So nothing particularly odd or scary happened this last week, so there is no excuse to delay the 6.5 release.</p>
<p>I still have this nagging feeling that a lot of people are on vacation and that things have been quiet partly due to that. But this release has been going smoothly, so that's probably just me being paranoid. The biggest patches this last week were literally just to our selftests.</p>
<p>The shortlog below is obviously not the 6.5 release log, it's purely just the last week since rc7.</p>
<p>Anyway, this obviously means that the merge window for 6.6 starts tomorrow. I already have ~20 pull requests pending and ready to go, but before we start the next merge frenzy, please give this final release one last round of testing, ok?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of what's included in Linux kernel 6.5:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steam Deck fix for AMD Zenbleed.</li>
<li>Fixes for for ASUS ROG ALLY Audio and Bluetooth support.</li>
<li>Improved Fan and Sensor support for the AYANEO 2, Geek, OXP Mini, and AOKZOE A1 PRO.</li>
<li>Rumble support for Xbox Elite Series 2 (model 1797), Xbox One (model 1708) and Xbox Series X (model 1914) controllers.</li>
<li>Support for the NVIDIA Shield Thunderstrike controller.</li>
<li>Enable Freesync Video Mode by default.</li>
<li>More work on Wi-Fi 7.</li>
<li>ASUS ROG Z13 Keyboard support added.</li>
<li>A fix for "a really annoying interrupt storm in the AMD driver affecting Asus TUF gaming notebooks".</li>
<li>+ thousands more changes, improvements, new hardware support and it just goes on and on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Full kernel <a href="https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v6.x/ChangeLog-6.5" target="_blank">6.5 changelog here</a>. As usual <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/linux-65-features" target="_blank">Phoronix</a> has a reasonable overview because trying to go through the changelog is an absolute nightmare.</p>
<p>Was there anything in particular you're excited about for kernel 6.5? Let me know in the comments.</p>

      <title>GuliKit reveal SNES styled dock for Steam Deck and other handhelds</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Still in the market for a dock for your Steam Deck or whatever other handheld you have? At Gamescom, GuliKit revealed a pretty slick looking SNES styled retro dock for you.</p>
<p>It's not on the market yet, so you can't buy one. Although it is due to release sometime soon but they're not saying exactly when or giving a price just yet. The wide compatibility is nice as they say it works across the Steam Deck, ROG Ally, Nintendo Switch and Ayaneo handhelds.</p>
<p>Pictures from GuliKit:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9118638191693237297gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9118638191693237297gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17178422071693237298gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17178422071693237298gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Dock Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>USB-C Out</li>
<li>USB-C In</li>
<li>3 x USB 3.0</li>
<li>1 x HDMI out</li>
<li>Gigabit Ethernet</li>
</ul>
<p>Looks pretty slick, and is mighty tempting me even though I have many docks already. But one more couldn't hurt when it looks this cool right? Collecting random tech is not a problem is it? <em>Don't answer that.</em></p>
<p>It also has a fun cover and space to store some memory cards as well:</p>

      <title>Respawn begin unbanning various Apex Legends Linux and Steam Deck players</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's been a bit of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/respawn-now-properly-looking-into-apex-legends-bans-on-linux-steam-deck/" target="_blank">a saga for Apex Legends players</a> using the Proton compatibility tool to play it on Steam Deck and Linux desktop but it seems Respawn continue their ban investigation.</p>
<p>Reports have been sprinkling in over the last few days that numerous players who were unfairly banned have seen their bans get reversed. Hopefully this is a sign of Respawn now properly looking into it, after many players have been waiting over a week for a resolution on the issue despite firm claims of no cheating happening.</p>
<p>It's still not clear what's going on, or what caused this second ban-wave of players on Linux systems and we're not likely to be told why — because when it comes to anti-cheat bigger developers and publishers don't like to go into details that might in any way help cheaters.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13741917371693228610gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Respawn still have the investigation noted on their official <a href="https://trello.com/c/7roI320C/418-linux-steam-deck-players-encountering-getting-kicked-from-servers-and-banned" target="_blank">Trello</a> page so they haven't finished yet.</p>
<p>Are you still banned? Or have you been unbanned recently or were you not banned at all and were able to carry on? Let me know in the comments.</p>

      <title>Darwinia from Introversion Software gets a big compatibility upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Darwinia, a classic from Introversion Software (original devs of Prison Architect) released originally in 2005 just got upgraded to keep it running nice on modern platforms. Not many developers go back to update their classics like this, nice to see from Introversion!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3512239901693227506gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3512239901693227506gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Darwinia offers up full Native Linux support and there's currently no Steam Deck rating for it.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Major Changes:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added a native OpenGL ES rendering backend.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash triggered by entering/leaving levels several times.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where radar dishes would forget how to rotate if the renderer was restarted (e.g. if the Screen settings were changed while in a level).</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where cutscenes did not correctly preserve the world state, and could cause some buildings to change team ownership. (e.g. on Temple, the Spam cubes could be assigned the wrong team and be attacked by the red Darwinians)</li>
<li>Now supports a new NVIDIA driver feature, the DXGI present path for Vulkan/OpenGL. Should greatly improve frame smoothness and eliminate stutters.</li>
<li>Reduced stutter caused by one-off long frames.</li>
<li>Reworked some of the water avoidance behavior. There were some bugs in how the water avoidance decisions were made, which caused Darwinians to sometimes become confused and just stand still after leaving water.</li>
<li>When Darwinians or Squads are in water, instead of dying immediately after 10 consecutive seconds, they start to take damage over time.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Darwinians would clip through the landscape when coming out of water, and then suddenly pop up above ground after several seconds.</li>
<li>Fixed the floating-on-water animation to update every frame instead of every game tick.</li>
<li>Worked around a bug in NVIDIA drivers older than 530, which caused some rendering glitches with VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_library.</li>
<li>Fixed some cases where AMD FSR 1.0 shaders would not compile correctly when targeting AMD GPUs.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Minor changes:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Introduced timed expiration for cached pipelines and shaders.</li>
<li>Fixed a failure to initialize OpenGL core renderer on Zink.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the mouse cursor render using 16-bit float RGBA framebuffers.</li>
<li>Fixed targeting reticles being shown for units behind the camera.</li>
<li>Minimized clipping of game cursor below the landscape.</li>
<li>Fixed input handling bugs when running at very low framerates.</li>
<li>Many code cleanups to modernize the code base a bit.</li>
<li>Tuned thread priorities for audio and worker threads.</li>
<li>Improved performance of MiniAudio mixing.</li>
<li>Several minor performance improvements.</li>
<li>Updated contributing libraries (MoltenVK, ANGLE, SDL, MiniAudio, etc)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available in the Introversion Classics pack on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/introversion-classics-pack?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/darwinia" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1500/Darwinia/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Deimos Games shutting, making Helium Rain and Astral Shipwright free to play</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Deimos Games announced they're shutting down but their games code is already open source, and now both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/681330/Helium_Rain/" target="_blank">Helium Rain</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1728180/Astral_Shipwright/" target="_blank">Astral Shipwright</a> will be going free to play.</p>
<p>In an announcement on the Steam pages for both games the developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's been about a decade since I first started prototyping a space game - one where you'd start off with a small ship and trade resources. Two games, three game engines and 15,000 copies sold later, here am I with a new life where I don't quite have the time for such work anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Deimos Games will be shutting down this year. Both Helium Rain and Astral Shipwright will be going free-to-play, so that new players can still experience them in the future. As a reminder, both are also open-source, so if you were going to build anything based on these projects, you now have access to free content too. It's been refreshing to see game developers reuse code for their own projects, and I hope that will continue.<br/>
<br/>
I want to thank all players who supported me on this endeavour. I'm truly happy that I was able to share my work with you.<br/>
<br/>
Stranger</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means anyone can still easily check out their games, and tinker with the code to learn from or make something new. While both games code are available under the BSD license, they do use Unreal Engine, so the code is open source but it still relies on a proprietary game engine - just to be clear on that.</p>
<p>They both go free to play on September 1st.</p>

      <title>Roblox support returns to Linux with Wine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/roblox-support-is-coming-back-to-wine-on-linux/" target="_blank">After the recent news</a> that Roblox was playable in Wine again with their special Beta channels, it seems they've now enabled Roblox to run in Wine on the stable version making it really easy to get Roblox on Linux.</p>
<p>There's been no announcement that I can find yet, but testing it myself today after lots of reports came in — yup, Roblox is now working just fine without a Beta.</p>
<p>Probably the easiest way to run it is with <a href="https://flathub.org/en-GB/apps/io.github.vinegarhq.Vinegar" target="_blank">Vinegar</a>, a Wine wrapper for Roblox. You can just install it from Flathub (or Discover on Steam Deck in Desktop Mode), make a configuration file in terminal to set it to Vulkan and then you're good to go after that:</p>

      <title>Radeon RX 7800 XT and RX 7700 XT revealed, plus more details on FSR 3</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AMD just announced the Radeon RX 7800 XT and Radeon RX 7700 XT Graphics Cards, and they're giving out more details on FidelityFX Super Resolution 3 (FSR 3).</p>
<p>Of course availability is the big question. AMD said to expect them both on September 6th from partners including ASRock, ASUS, Biostar, Gigabyte, PowerColor, Sapphire, Vastarmor, XFX and Yeston. Plus they will be selecting them direct on the same date.</p>
<p>Here's the specs sheets AMD gave out:</p>

<p></p>
<p>As for FidelityFX Super Resolution 3 (FSR 3), AMD have a new <a href="https://community.amd.com/t5/gaming/first-look-at-amd-fidelityfx-super-resolution-3/ba-p/626581" target="_blank">blog post</a> up with even more details. The first titles to get it will be Forspoken and Immortals of Aveum some time in "early fall". With other titles confirmed to be adding it later including Cyberpunk 2077, Space Marine 2, Frostpunk 2, Squad, Starship Troopers Extermination, Avatar Frontiers of Pandora, Alters, Crimson Desert, Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth and Black Myth Wukong.</p>
<p>The key addition in FSR3 is frame generation that AMD say "uses an enhanced version of AMD Fluid Motion Frames (AFMF) optical flow technology and temporal game data such as motion vectors to generate additional high-quality frames for a higher framerate in supported games, up to 2x2". Useful for games that you want to bump up to 4K with Ray Tracing.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/413555431692978613gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/413555431692978613gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>One thing they've address is ensuring it doesn't impact the UI of a game, so they include "UI processing included as an integral part of our solution to minimize any impact frame generation may have on the in-game interface" and FSR3 also includes the latest version of their temporal upscaling that's integrated with the new frame generation.</p>
<p>Another addition in FSR 3 is a "Native AA" quality mode that allows you to use FSR 3 without applying any upscaling but still gives you the high-quality anti-aliasing and sharpening of FSR. It will come with a performance cost though, but might look better than what AA some games provide out of the box.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13223284731692978660gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13223284731692978660gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>AMD has also committed to keeping it open source and will be added to the AMD FidelityFX SDK.</p>

      <title>Factorio: Space Age revealed giving you a fleet and multiple planets</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We knew an expansion was coming as it was confirmed some time ago, but now Wube Software have revealed much more about what's now called Factorio: Space Age.</p>
<p>This expansion will continue your building after you launch into space at the end of a game in Factorio. You'll get to discover new worlds with challenges, exploit their resources and manage your fleet of interplanetary space platforms they say. </p>
<p>With this expansion though, instead of sending up one rocket, you'll be sending many! As these will provide resources in orbit for you to use to build big space platforms. However, since you're doing it multiple times, rockets will be a bit cheaper to produce. There will be 4 extra planets, each with a unique theme, resources, challenges and gameplay mechanics and some have different military targets too.</p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7942676501692977080gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7942676501692977080gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's still the free 2.0 update coming which will benefit all players, as technically the expansion will act like a mod on top of their updated base game. Some things you'll get in the update includes the ability to control train systems better, better blueprint building, better flying robot behaviour and more to be revealed.</p>
<p>It's not due a while though, they say at least another year until it's ready. However, they will now be talking about the expansion regularly to go over more details of it.</p>
<p>The blog post also touches on how it's similar to the Space Exploration mod. There's a good reason for that, as Earendel who made the mod is part of Wube Software and has also been working on the expansion. They say that Space Age though is designed for everyone, and required game engine changes for what they wanted to do with it.</p>
<p>Factorio is available to buy on <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/factorio?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/factorio?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and it is rated Steam Deck Playable by Valve. It also recently had a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/07/factorio-upgraded-with-controller-support-now-in-the-stable-release/" target="_blank">big upgrade to the controller support</a>.</p>

      <title>Canonical give some thoughts on the future of Ubuntu Desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ubuntu is one of the top most used Linux distributions on the desktop and Canonical, the company behind it, has a new <a href="https://ubuntu.com/blog/ubuntu-desktop-charting-a-course-for-the-future" target="_blank">blog post</a> up giving some thoughts on the future of Ubuntu Desktop.</p>
<p>In the post Oliver Smith, the Product Manager, goes over various details about the current status. Like how Ubuntu on the desktop has 6 million monthly active users, it's the most popular Linux distro for developers (Stack Overflow) and the most popular for <em>gaming</em>. The gaming side perhaps is a little debatable, as they're guesstimating based on what's inside the "Other" category on the Steam Survey. If Valve showed all versions of Ubuntu, I would imagine it easily is the biggest.</p>
<p>With the changing landscape Smith mentions how the Ubuntu Desktop team continues to "grow rapidly", which is a good sign for the future of it of course as clearly they're investing a lot of resources into it right now.</p>
<p>One thing pointed out is the new installer, which is the same one that Ubuntu Server uses. They say it could enable things like having a laptop with Ubuntu pre-installed with the ability to easily "apply customisations on first boot to create a personalised or enterprise specific installation through device enrollment".</p>
<p>They're also teasing something related to hardware. Noting that there's devices from Dell, HP, Lenovo, Raspberry Pi, other Arm devices and cloud devices but with Ubuntu 23.10 they're "keeping quiet" about…something. So a potential new hardware deal is to be announced at some point.</p>
<p>Other things coming for Ubuntu 23.10 include a modern and performant app store, the ability to customize Ubuntu desktop images, quarter-screen tiling, their partnership with Intel on hardware accelerated video encoding and decoding in the Chromium snap is now making its way to stable, investigations into providing a mechanism for users to manage additional permissions requested by apps, experiments into hardware-backed full disk encryption as an option in the Ubuntu installer, they're bringing Netplan to Ubuntu Desktop to "deliver a more unified experience for those managing Ubuntu across both server and desktop" and continued work on Ubuntu Core Desktop (an immutable version of Ubuntu - think like SteamOS and Fedora Silverblue).</p>
<p>It's nice to see Canonical talking up Ubuntu Desktop more!</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://ubuntu.com/blog/ubuntu-desktop-charting-a-course-for-the-future" target="_blank">full blog post</a> for more.</p>

      <title>ARMORED CORE VI FIRES OF RUBICON runs well on Steam Deck and desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ARMORED CORE VI FIRES OF RUBICON is the big new release developed by FromSoftware Inc, the same team from ELDEN RING and it does seem to run quite well on Steam Deck and desktop Linux.</p>
<p>The game does use Easy Anti-Cheat, however FromSoftware have it enabled for Linux / Steam Deck so that doesn't appear to be causing any issues. They said clearly before releasing they did want it to work well on Steam Deck so that's great to see. It's also rated Steam Deck playable by Valve, not Verified as some text is too small — an ongoing problem many developers still don't add in text scaling.</p>
<p>Here's a look at it on Steam Deck showing gameplay plus a little benchmark across Low, Medium, High and Max Presets:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="b8gNCg3GbbQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/443a77282c24fbc5915edfbfdc73f603.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/b8gNCg3GbbQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For Steam Deck my choice graphics settings are simply the Medium Preset, with Motion Blur OFF and 40Hz locked on the Steam Deck. Overall that seems to be a pretty decent. While the "best" might be to lock it to 30FPS due to some drops in large battles, a lot of it can hit 40 so it just felt better to stick there overall. Like most bigger intense games, battery life is not long between 1.5-2 hours.</p>
<p>On desktop Linux (Kubuntu), running it on the Max Preset with my AMD Ryzen 5800x and Radeon 6800 XT it's been sticking quite well around 90FPS at 2560x1440. So I'm quite happy with the performance on this one. I did try for 120FPS, but on Max it would dip regularly between 90-100FPS depending on what was going on. This is without the setting to dynamically adjust the rendering, and there's no settings for any AMD FSR.</p>
<p>Desktop Linux screenshots (click to enlarge):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11427561541692962493gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11427561541692962493gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7336916721692962495gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7336916721692962495gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20837720971692963587gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20837720971692963587gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2523116421692963589gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2523116421692963589gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Two problems I did notice on desktop Linux: the first is that the Steam Overlay does not work with it but Steam Achievements work just fine though. The other is that while gamepad controls work perfectly, it will on some launches get stuck showing keyboard icons.</p>
<p>Something to keep in mind is that it is a <em>tough</em> game. Much like ELDEN RING, it will punish you. However, I feel the combat here is plenty more forgiving and personally, I much prefer the mech setting. Since it's mission-based, it works quite well to give you plenty of breaks.</p>
<p>Really seems like FromSoftware Inc. are onto another hit here. It won't get anywhere near the status that ELDEN RING had but I've no doubt it will sell well and be enjoyed by many.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/armored-core-vi-fires-of-rubicon?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1888160/ARMORED_CORE_VI_FIRES_OF_RUBICON/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA posts NVAPI core software development kit on GitHub</title>
      <author>nwildner</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Without any additional <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvapi/commits/main" target="_blank">commit messages</a> except the repository description, Nvidia posted the source code for its Developer Kit tool on <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvapi/tree/main" target="_blank">Github</a> under the NVIDIA Corporation organization umbrella.</p>
<p>We do currently have the <a href="https://github.com/jp7677/dxvk-nvapi" target="_blank">DXVK-NVAPI</a>, which is an alternative NVAPI implementation on top of DXVK, so there's a potential it could help projects like this. There is a considerable difference between reading some API documentation stating how a resource should be used and investigate some undocumented behaviour versus having the code available to also read its implementation. Some of the files pushed to that repository like the <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvapi/blob/main/nvapi_lite_salstart.h" target="_blank">nvapi_lite_salstart.h</a> date back from 2012 as per file headers.</p>
<p>While there is some code available in that repository, libraries are still being provided as binaries like the <tt>amd64/nvapi64.lib</tt> and <tt>x86/nvapi64.lib</tt> files.</p>
<p>The dxvk-nvapi creator also opened on <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvapi/issues/1" target="_blank">Issue request</a> to include the nvapi-open-source-sdk as well on a Github repository for better tracking of future releases.</p>
<p>Is this an indication that NVIDIA is on it's way to better collaboration and that it also sees potential in projects like the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/nvk-the-open-source-vulkan-driver-for-nvidia-merged-into-mesa/" target="_blank">NVK opensource driver</a>?

      <description><div class="content group e-content">

      <title>Kentucky Route Zero has a big upgrade improving it on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kentucky Route Zero: PC Edition has seen it's first major update since the release of Act V in 2020, and now it should be a better experience on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>While it already has Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified, they clearly weren't satisfied with it. So they went back and overhauled the user interface in the new "Modern" mode.  There's also new and improved language support, plus lots of bug fixes.</p>
<p>This new Modern interface is supposed to be "more flexible and readable on a wider variety of devices, including tablets and the Steam Deck". The original interface is still around if you want it but they tweaked that too. They said another final update is planned to come in future to add in "line rendering improvements for high resolutions, and full multi-touch input on the Steam Deck" - so it's going to get even sweeter.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">New Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Switch freely between "Modern," "Classic," and "Retro" modes.</li>
<li>New translations: Arabic, Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese, Polish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish.</li>
<li>A new Japanese translation.</li>
<li>Steam Cloud sync.</li>
<li>Zoom in on details in the scene by holding the right mouse button or gamepad trigger, or pinching the screen.</li>
<li>Improved touchscreen support makes the game 100% <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yqn9CXG1n6A" target="_blank">hot dog compatible</a>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/kentucky-route-zero?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/231200/Kentucky_Route_Zero_PC_Edition/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Whisker Squadron: Survivor takes Star Fox and adds a lil Vampire Survivors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Taking the rail shooter goodness inspired by Star Fox, making it a bit more rogue-lite and blending in the Vampire Survivors styled gems to pick up and choose a random power-up, Whisker Squadron: Survivor is ace. Note: key provided for me.</p>
<p>It's just entered Early Access on Steam and I've been having a lot of fun with this one. Developed by Flippfly, the same team that made Race the Sun. Giving you some seriously wild runs each lasting around 30 minutes, you'll face off against an onslaught of all sorts of craziness. At times the screen can be quite literally filled full of lasers trying to cut your ship in half.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_5Z6kYdF2P0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f8b22114f1fbcb5b3064ad73439c25d0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_5Z6kYdF2P0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While it does have Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified, testing on both my desktop (Kubuntu) and Steam Deck - neither had any gamepad input at all. Swapping over to Proton Experimental made gamepad input work though. Odd, I've reported this to the developer.</p>
<p>It's a huge amount of fun but I'm definitely looking forward to them expanding the content on it. Still gives me that brain-itch of needing another run though.</p>
<p>Have a look at my little Steam Deck video on it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="gv9DEAbFWyU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bcb0073aa5b305a4fc13fc661c6f2cda.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/gv9DEAbFWyU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Good stuff!</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2140100/Whisker_Squadron_Survivor/" target="_blank">out on Steam</a> in Early Access.</p>

      <title>No Man&#39;s Sky - Echoes Update is out adding a secret society of robotic aliens</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this is quite an expected update, No Man's Sky - Echoes is live as another free upgrade for players and it's a pretty big update for the game full of new content. No Man's Sky is Steam Deck Verified and playable on Linux desktop with Proton.</p>
<p>This update adds in the <em>Autophage</em>, a long-hidden civilization of robotic beings whose bodies are cobbled together with scrap metal and salvaged tech with lots of varied styles. The extra fun thing about them? You get to make your own robotic avatar and customize it to your liking. That's not even the best bit of the update — there's loads to it including: a big expansion to space combat with a <strong>lot</strong> more depth, pirate frigates with massive space cannons, you can make a unique staff to be your multi-tool, there's also a new class of customizable multi-tool, a new expedition, outlaw capital ships and the list goes on.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8g2YqU-_GtA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fa47d45f69e79f024982bb31fd77577a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8g2YqU-_GtA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's safe to say No Man's Sky is now almost an entirely different game to what released originally, it's also becoming one of the most in-depth open-world space games ever made. What they've added in this update alone is pretty amazing, Hello Games continues to impress with the post-release support. Seems like it may be time to play it through.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/no-mans-sky?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Sweet beekeeping sim APICO update 3.0 heads to the ocean</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What do beekeeping and ocean exploration have in common? Well they will both be in the APICO 3.0 update that's planned to arrive this "fall".</p>
<p>Update 3.0: What Lies Beeneath invites you to dive into the crystal blue ocean waters surrounding the APICO archipelago and explore its depths. New areas, forageables, quests, and new bees are yours to discover deep bee-low the watery abyss. Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kgUb2TUuSFA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2f11eb82051bff42dea73a5ddcd53062.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kgUb2TUuSFA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What's coming in the 3.0 update:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New areas:</strong> Dive deep down to the bottom of the ocean and discover a new bee-ome with new areas to explore that include deep-sea flora and fauna, a coral reef system, and more!</li>
<li><strong>New Bees:</strong> Discover, collect, build homes and breed new species of bees found only at the furthest depths of the ocean, and collect their resources for craftables and quests.</li>
<li><strong>New Quests: </strong>Harness the help of your newfound bee friends to restore the damaged coral reef system and clean up underwater pollution to help the bee-cosystem and its inhabitants thrive.</li>
<li><strong>New Fishing Mechanic:</strong> Skipper’s dad, Captain, arrives at the archipelago to teach you the ins and outs of a new mechanic — fishing!</li>
<li><strong>And More:</strong> New quality-of-life improvements, including a newly added trash can and nearby chest auto-deposit, will help your beekeeping bee-come more efficient than ever!</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a really lovely game to play through. Relaxing, sweet and just a nice game to relax with so this expansion certainly has my eyes glued to it. Even sweeter is that when you buy it a portion of the proceeds go towards bee conservation.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Available to buy right now on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/apico?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://tngineers.itch.io/apico" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1390190/APICO/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Respawn now properly looking into Apex Legends bans on Linux &amp; Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/linux-players-getting-banned-on-apex-legends-again/" target="_blank">Around five days ago</a> I reported on Apex Legends doing a ban wave which for the second time hit a bunch of players on Linux and Steam Deck playing it with Proton. Now at least the developer Respawn is looking into it.</p>
<p>While I've been updating the previous article, it's probably a good idea for a fresh report to keep people up to date on what's happening. There's been quite a <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/Technical-Issues/Linux-players-getting-banned/td-p/12338557/page/34" target="_blank">lot</a> of confirmed reports of bans now, with the majority of which being Linux desktop players but a few who play on Steam Deck were also caught up in it.</p>
<p>My emails to various EA contacts went unanswered, but thankfully a Respawn staff member on the community run, developer supported Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/15uqt7w/comment/jxgwj2m/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank">replied</a> officially to note: "Updating folks here that the investigation is continuing and we've added this to the <a href="https://trello.com/c/7roI320C/418-linux-steam-deck-players-encountering-getting-kicked-from-servers-and-banned" target="_blank">Trello</a> for transparency. We'll update that card as more details become available. Cheers for your reports!"</p>
<p>The official Respawn account on X (formerly Twitter) also <a href="https://twitter.com/Respawn/status/1694467974021996951" target="_blank">posted</a> on August 23rd that a number of bans were issued on that day, but no word from either them or EA on X about the Linux bans so it's likely unrelated (unless more bans appear).</p>
<p>Hopefully sometime soon we can find out why it happened, and see the bans getting reversed. Since this is the second time it's happened, hopefully they will also make steps to prevent it happening to non-cheaters so I don't have to report on it for a third time.</p>

      <title>Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands musical comedy RPG is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love a bit of music, comedy and absurdity? Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands has plenty and it's officially out now with full Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified too. Seems players on Steam are liking it too with a Very Positive rating.</p>
<p>Even though it is Steam Deck Verified the developer still continues making improvements, with an update landing today to improve controls for Steam Deck and other gamepads. The developer has been patching up various other bugs since release too so it's seeing nice post-release support. Another worthy Linux game to add to your collection. Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hXEP4cm7Res"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/de3f7bdec9ee22fbfa7b9e8b05f1dc04.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hXEP4cm7Res" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Customise the band with 9 musically-themed classes to choose from, each with their own attacks, perks and sensational appearance.</li>
<li>Kick down every single door you come across, regardless of how unlocked they might be.</li>
<li>Some doors will be too strong to kick down. That's why you gotta kick down weaker doors to level up your door kicking skill until you're strong enough.</li>
<li>Fancy combat system that focuses on BAR EFFECTS. What happens BETWEEN turns makes all the difference, bringing real-time elements into the turn-based combat.</li>
<li>Sew patches of band logos onto your BATTLE JACKET for extra perks in BATTLE.</li>
<li>No Random Encounters! Monsters will be shown on the field for your avoiding leisure.</li>
<li>Original soundtrack that'll make you say things like SIIICK and OH RIGHT ON.</li>
<li>Bursting at the seams with humour, absurdity and a wide variety of colourful characters, armed with an abundance of dialogue faces to express themselves TO THE MAX.</li>
<li>A rich world packed with well over 100 unique NPCs.</li>
<li>Even the ITEMS have personality. Say bye bye to the generic "HEALTH POTION". Local NPC Barry Friendly is taking care of the soothing beverages around here. Sink into a warm cup of BARRY FRIENDLY'S TEA whenever your health is low. Maybe you'll even have the pleasure of meeting Barry at some point.</li>
<li>One of the enemies you fight is a skateboarding platypus.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This was actually <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/deathbulge/deathbulge-battle-of-the-bands" target="_blank">funded on Kickstarter</a>, so it's good to see another successful release thanks to crowdfunding.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1083790/Deathbulge_Battle_of_the_Bands/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Epic Games&#39; new exclusive deal gives devs 100% for 6 months</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Epic Games have announced their new Epic First Run program, to entice more developers to release on their store exclusively and give developers a boost. With this we can expect to see many more developers opt to go Epic exclusive.</p>
<p>The Epic First Run program will give developers 100% of the revenue, so Epic Games will not take a cut from sales on the Epic Games Store for the first 6 exclusive months. It's opt-in for developers and does <em>not</em> prevent them from selling it directly <em>and</em> selling it using keys via the likes of Green Man Gaming, Humble Store and other stores that sell keys. Naturally, this rules out Steam and GOG, which is largely the point of it to get more people to shop on the Epic Store and not Steam.</p>
<p>After the 6 month exclusive period is up, developers can then release elsewhere and the revenue split goes back to 88% for developers and 12% to Epic Games.</p>
<p>Epic also mention that they now have over 68 million monthly active users with over 230 million players. To help get word out, developers who opt into the Epic First Run program will get "new exclusive badging, homepage placements, and dedicated collections" along with features in "elevant store campaigns including sales, events, and editorial as applicable".</p>
<p>See Epic's <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/introducing-the-epic-first-run-program" target="_blank">announcement here</a>.</p>
<p><em>What do you think to this news?</em></p>
<p>On Linux and Steam Deck, you can use the likes of the <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> to really simplify getting games from Epic since they still do not officially support either with the Epic Store.</p>
<p><em>In related news Denuvo are rolling out some <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/denuvo-expand-their-anti-tamper-and-add-special-unreal-engine-protection/" target="_blank">special protection for Unreal Engine games</a>.</em></p>

      <title>Denuvo expand their Anti-Tamper and add special Unreal Engine Protection</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You all absolutely adore Denuvo right? Well it's about to expand to offer game developers more options to add into their games so here's what's coming.</p>
<p>Announced during Gamescom is an expansion of their Anti-Tamper tooling with Integrity Verification. They say it will bring "more granular options to the Anti-Tamper product" letting developers verify the integrity of their own code, which is supposed to protect it against static and dynamic tampering preventing people from altering protected game code before startup and during gameplay.</p>
<p>“We understand the paramount importance of code security in the gaming industry,” said Doug Lowther, Chief Executive Officer at Irdeto, “Our Integrity Verification feature offers an effortless and robust defense, empowering our customers with a powerful tool to protect their valuable code and maintain the integrity of their gaming experiences.”</p>
<p>As for the Unreal Engine Protection, this new feature is a "first-of-its-kind solution is easy to integrate into the game on a binary level, effectively thwarting data mining attempts and creating formidable barriers against cheat creators, pirates and fraudsters" according to Denuvo developer Irdeto. </p>
<p>“With the Unreal Engine Protection, we are creating new weapons for the gaming industry’s fight against hackers trying to do things with games that are not supposed to be done,” said Lowther, “Our commitment to staying ahead of the curve in gaming security is exemplified by this first-to-market solution, enabling game developers and publishers to protect their creations with unparalleled ease.” </p>
<p>Full <a href="https://irdeto.com/news/denuvo-by-irdeto-unveils-new-features-for-enhanced-gaming-security-at-gamescom" target="_blank">press release here</a>.</p>
<p>Thankfully, so far, Denuvo hasn't actually caused all that many issues for Linux desktop and Steam Deck gamers, since games protected by it work in Proton. When I spoke to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/01/steamworks-gets-denuvo-anti-cheat-heres-what-irdeto-say-about-linux-support/" target="_blank">Irdeto back in early 2021</a> they mentioned their anti-cheat would work on Linux too but it would tell developers as running at lower integrity but still that the "userspace game process performs significant cheat detection". Since then we've not had any updates on that.</p>

      <title>Bazzite is a new Fedora-based Linux for Steam Deck and gaming PCs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to try something a little different? Bazzite was recently announced as a custom Fedora 38-based Linux image designed to bring the best Linux gaming to PCs and Steam Deck. The developers note it's built from <a href="https://github.com/ublue-os/main" target="_blank">ublue-os/main</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ublue-os/nvidia" target="_blank">ublue-os/nvidia</a> using <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/" target="_blank">Fedora</a> technology so you'll get expanded hardware support and plenty of drivers included.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17488967831692788372gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17488967831692788372gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>A bunch of features they say to expect from it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proprietary Nvidia drivers pre-installed.</li>
<li>Full hardware accelerated codec support for H264 decoding.</li>
<li>Full support for AMD's ROCM OpenCL/HIP run-times.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/atar-axis/xpadneo" target="_blank">xpadneo</a> driver for wireless Xbox One controllers.</li>
<li>Full support for <a href="https://www.synaptics.com/products/displaylink-graphics" target="_blank">DisplayLink</a>.</li>
<li>Includes Valve's KDE themes from SteamOS.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ishitatsuyuki/LatencyFleX" target="_blank">LatencyFleX</a>, <a href="https://github.com/DadSchoorse/vkBasalt" target="_blank">vkBasalt</a>, <a href="https://github.com/flightlessmango/Mangohud" target="_blank">MangoHud</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/nowrep/obs-vkcapture" target="_blank">OBS VkCapture</a> installed and available by default</li>
<li>Support for <a href="https://www.wallpaperengine.io/en" target="_blank">Wallpaper Engine</a>. (Only on KDE)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox" target="_blank">Distrobox</a> preinstalled with automatic updates for created containers.</li>
<li>Automated <code class="inline-code">duperemove</code> services for reducing the disk space used by wine prefix contents.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pop-os/system76-scheduler" target="_blank">System76-Scheduler</a> preinstalled, providing automatic process priority tweaks to your focused application and keeping CPU time for background processes to a minimum.</li>
<li>Customized System76-Scheduler config with additional rules and CFS parameters from <a href="https://github.com/Frogging-Family/linux-tkg" target="_blank">Linux-TKG</a>.</li>
<li>Uses <a href="https://github.com/google/bbr" target="_blank">Google's BBR TCP congestion control</a> by default.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sezanzeb/input-remapper" target="_blank">Input Remapper</a> preinstalled and enabled. (Available but default-disabled on the Deck variant)</li>
<li>Helpful first-start installer provides an easy way to install numerous applications and tweaks, including installing <a href="https://gitlab.com/corectrl/corectrl" target="_blank">CoreCtrl</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/leinardi/gwe" target="_blank">GreenWithEnvy</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://nixos.org/" target="_blank">Nix</a> package manager optionally available.</li>
<li><a href="https://waydro.id/" target="_blank">Waydroid</a> preinstalled for running Android apps. Future releases will offer to set this up for you. (Not available on Nvidia builds)</li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/CalcProgrammer1/OpenRGB" target="_blank">OpenRGB</a> i2c-piix4 and i2c-nct6775 drivers for controlling RGB on certain motherboards.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hannesmann/gcadapter-oc-kmod" target="_blank">GCAdapter_OC</a> driver for overclocking Nintendo's Gamecube Controller Adapter to 1000hz polling.</li>
<li>Out of the box support for <a href="https://wooting.io/" target="_blank">Wooting</a> keyboards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Including Waydroid configured by default is a pretty interesting choice, could expand what you can do on Steam Deck rather a lot don't you think? There's a lot of things there making me quite keen to try it out on one of my Steam Decks. Tempting…</p>
<p>They include various tweak between using it on desktop and Steam Deck. For example the Steam Deck release gives you the ability to install the likes of Decky Loader, EmuDeck and ProtonUp-Qt during the setup. You get the latest version of the Mesa graphics drivers, easy update rollbacks if something breaks, a custom update system to let you upgrade  the OS, Flatpaks, and Distrobox images to be updated directly from the Gamemode UI and much more.</p>
<p>Quite an exciting idea overall!</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://universal-blue.org/blog/2023/08/20/bazzite-10/" target="_blank">release announcement</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: as a clarification, this is not a "new distro" but doing a bunch of fancy customizations directly on top of Fedora. The text was edited to reflect this.</p>

      <title>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty new trailer live, plus big free update coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty is an upcoming paid expansion for the open world game from CD PROJEKT RED. Here's all the new details for you.</p>
<p>With the base game currrently Steam Deck Verified and rated Gold on ProtonDB, it remains to be seen how the update and expansion will change that. We'll know a lot more closer to release and I'll be taking a look to let you know what to expect. Although a lot of what's new will be paid content in the DLC they've said that the redesigned skill trees, overhauled police system, and vehicle combat will all be available for free as part of Update 2.0 for Cyberpunk 2077!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zBrkG3aeWCc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/083d3af82a74f889215583988a4c5934.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zBrkG3aeWCc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The new skill tree offers a wide range of powerful abilities that will allow you to master new playstyles and create unique, meaningful builds. Phantom Liberty also introduces a densely packed new location, Dogtown, with endless dynamic events and missions, action-packed gigs, new clothing items, weapons, cyberware, and more to explore.</p>
<p>Also highlighted is the redesigned parks system, which shows off some new perks that open up more gameplay options, and interesting new ways to take down enemies. Thankfully both enemy AI and police AI have been improved, meaning everything is a lot more dynamic. Hopefully this means we'll see less of everyone just standing around lifeleslly, which was quite funny to see in the original. Police for example will now set up roadblocks, attempt to ram you off the road and more. Oh, and there's vehicle combat now too.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty releases September 26th and the 2.0 update a while before. You can pre-order on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2138330/Cyberpunk_2077_Phantom_Liberty/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store (GOG Key)</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/cyberpunk_2077_phantom_liberty" target="_blank">GOG</a> direct.</p>
<p><em>I've actually yet to play through it, so it seems like my waiting will pay off big time for this one to truly get a better experience overall. Are you also holding off?</em></p>

      <title>Blending GTA with Deus Ex, Streets of Rogue 2 gets a first trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As a big fan of the original game, I'm very excited for Streets of Rogue 2. Giving you a big unpredictable open world that combines elements of GTA, Deus Ex and various sandbox games. The first trailer was shown off during Gamescom.</p>
<p>You'll be able to explore a lively world where <em>everything</em> is destructible. According to the info I was sent Streets of Rogue 2's procedurally-generated map is more than <u>100</u> times the size of a level from the first game. That's…pretty big actually. Exciting! In the game you'll see a nice variety of locations including neon-lit cities, the serene countryside, mysterious caves, sunlit islands, and creepy graveyards.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="r57eVyONrJo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b1f9ab6ea95258972b8d24eeb6fc72a8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/r57eVyONrJo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Last I spoke to developer Matt Dabrowski it was still getting Native Linux support. But we'll know more closer to release.</p>
<p>From the press release: “I'm super excited to finally reveal gameplay footage for Streets of Rogue 2! It's been a long time coming,” said Matt Dabrowski, creator of the Streets of Rogue franchise. “Streets of Rogue 2 is the culmination of nearly 10 years of ongoing work on the series. It's a truly massive project that frankly makes the original game look like a prototype. I'm looking forward to getting this into everyone's hands via Early Access next year!”</p>
<p>It enters Early Access in 2024. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2165810/Streets_of_Rogue_2/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Nightdive Studios announce Turok 3 and Star Wars: Dark Forces remasters</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems we have even more remasters on the way from Nightdive Studios, as they've now announced both Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion Remastered and Star Wars: Dark Forces Remaster.</p>
<p>For Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion Remastered, this is the first game that will be remastered using the very latest version of the proprietary KEX engine, which Nightdive say "utilizes an improved renderer to achieve a higher tier of visual fidelity across 3D models, textures, and graphical effects".</p>
<p>Here's the trailer for Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion Remastered</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SdCaj5ZRp-A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/be05fd52edc4084021fdc6c1d5b9b7fe.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SdCaj5ZRp-A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A remastered version of the 2000 classic, available for the first time since its Nintendo 64 release</li>
<li>Up to 4K 120FPS performance</li>
<li>Advanced rendering features, including anti-aliasing, bloom, ambient occlusion, dynamic shadows, and motion blur</li>
<li>Remastered environment art, character models, and updated weapon models</li>
<li>Optional Motion/Gyro controls for Nintendo Switch console and Gamepad rumble</li>
<li>Brand new Achievements</li>
</ul>
<p>Next up is Star Wars: Dark Forces Remaster which we have less details on. Nightdive are working in collaboration with Lucasfilm Games and it will be just like the other remasters with the proprietary KEX engine. Star Wars: Dark Forces Remaster supports up to 4K at 120FPS and features advanced 3D rendering, modern gamepad support, trophies and achievements, and more! Trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4b9TTurkH4c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a13bf3598cda5ca0d669be2bade96acb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4b9TTurkH4c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>No release date for either was mentioned.</p>
<p>Of course we won't know what the Linux and Steam Deck compatibility is going to be like until later. However, I will aim to keep you posted. However, KEX engine remasters generally work just fine in Proton just like the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/quake-ii-remastered-shadow-dropped-playable-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">recent Quake II Remastered</a>.</p>

      <title>Sniper Elite 5 now rated Steam Deck Playable with an anti-cheat update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Today Sniper Elite 5 got updated and it seems they upgraded Easy Anti-Cheat from Epic Online Services, including making sure it works on Linux and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>So thanks to that Valve have also as of today given it a Steam Deck Playable rating. As seen on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1029690/history/?changeid=19995387" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, it originally mentioned the unsupported anti-cheat but that's no longer the case. It would be Verified if it didn't have some cases where the in-game text was too small, so hopefully that's something Rebellion can work on next. It also notes the first-time setup needs an active internet connection.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3495862031692717318gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3495862031692717318gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Currently the Steam Deck verification has it pinned to the stable version of Proton (Proton 8.0-3).</p>
<p>Sniper Elite 5 originally launched in May 2022, so it's nice to see continued support for the game and for the developer to ensure it works properly for Steam Deck and Linux desktop players like this. The list of games unplayable on Steam Deck is getting shorter all the time.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/sniper-elite-5?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1029690/Sniper_Elite_5/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 and Half-Life 2 RTX announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Today NVIDIA announced DLSS 3.5 further enhancing Ray Tracing and Half-Life 2 RTX was also announced. So let's go over the details.</p>
<p>Firstly Half-Life 2 RTX is being built by the community. Four top Half-Life 2 modding teams have come together including the people behind Half-Life 2: VR, Half-Life 2: Remade Assets, Project 17, and Raising the Bar: Redux under the banner of Orbifold Studios. They've been given access to the latest RTX Remix and they're rebuilding materials with Physically Based Rendering (PBR) properties, adding extra geometric detail via Valve’s Hammer editor, and leveraging NVIDIA technologies including full ray tracing, DLSS 3, Reflex, and RTX IO.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aM_gzfAMdNs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1e56751632013bf42dd4b7a5800a3a35.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aM_gzfAMdNs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can see a lot more in the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/half-life-2-rtx-remix-in-development/" target="_blank">NVIDIA announcement</a>. The project also has a <a href="https://www.hl2rtx.com/" target="_blank">dedicated website</a>. Like previous RTX remasters, it will probably not have Native Linux support but will be playable with Proton.</p>
<p>The other big one is NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 that NVIDIA say features "Ray Reconstruction, a new AI model that creates higher quality ray-traced images for intensive ray-traced games and apps". It is trained with "5x" more data than DLSS 3, and recognises more ray-traced effects that NVIDIA say allow it to "make smarter decisions about using temporal and spatial data, and to retain high frequency information for superior-quality upscaling". So basically put it's supposed to continue making ray-tracing look better, while also giving you potentially better performance.</p>
<p>You can see an example of it below with Cyberpunk 2077 and below that is a Tech Talk with NVIDIA VP of Applied Deep Learning Research, Bryan Catanzaro:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="oMCC9TgsCDY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d8ab67ca91edb804fb25f6207342aac2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/oMCC9TgsCDY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="sGKCrcNsVzo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6ee81d140b17145553dfceb6a6fac147.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/sGKCrcNsVzo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>See more <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/nvidia-dlss-3-5-ray-reconstruction/" target="_blank">about DLSS 3.5 here</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally the previously released Portal with RTX will also be getting an upgrade to use DLSS 3.5 "later this fall", along side an update to the NVIDIA RTX Remix used for it that improves performance and the quality of path tracing for older graphics cards.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to jump into some Darkest Dungeon II? Well now it's easier than ever thanks to the addition of controller support and full Steam Deck support too. It's even now Steam Deck Verified. Thanks to the additions desktop players too can now kick-back with a gamepad, if that's your preferred input.</p>
<p>The update landed on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1940340/view/3653035411211706936" target="_blank">August 17th</a> adding in:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added controller support:
<ul>
<li>Xbox and PS controller supported.</li>
<li>UI updates when using gamepad to accommodate controls.</li>
<li>Button legends added to indicate controls on screen.</li>
<li>Toggle-able “More Info” views the Character sheet and Combat when using gamepad.</li>
<li>Added additional UI feedback when selecting or focusing on UI.</li>
<li>Ability to swap between mouse + keyboard and controller.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added full support to Steam Deck (we’re verified now!).</li>
<li>Oblivion’s Ingress has had its visuals updated to be more in line with the Oblivion’s Rampart.</li>
<li>Performance and optimization pass across many assets and areas in the game including The Tangle.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That, plus a whole bunch of balancing adjustments and other assorted additions to the game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18089125251692703107gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18089125251692703107gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Nice to see plenty more developers work to improve their games on Steam Deck. Especially nice when they add in proper controller support that benefits everyone. For the Steam Deck the verification was done on Proton Experimental.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1940340/Darkest_Dungeon_II/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>SteamOS 3.5 for Steam Deck gets a screen colour temperature setting</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A while ago I mentioned (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyAmFvLdYbg" target="_blank">in a video</a>) how the upcoming SteamOS 3.5 for Steam Deck added in a colour vibrance setting, and now Valve seems to have expanded it even further with a screen colour temperature setting as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2211544441692700547gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2211544441692700547gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Here's a look at the difference between the default 7500K colour temperature and then turning it up to 11000K, with colour vibrance at default:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14662815541692701588gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14662815541692701588gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12506157311692701597gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12506157311692701597gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You can see the difference very clearly in the second picture where it's turned up, look at the difference in the blues.</p>
<p>This is currently available in the Main + Steam Deck Beta update channels, which you'll see if you turned on Developer Mode, and then select to see the Advanced Update Channels in the Developer menu in settings. I would firmly advise <strong>against</strong> this though, as it's updated often and can be full of big bugs (there's a reason it's hidden). Stick with the normal Steam Deck Stable / Beta.</p>
<p>SteamOS 3.5 is sounding quite exciting now, hopefully it's not too much longer until it's released.</p>

      <title>JSAUX launch a Steam Deck Anti-Glare screen replacement</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While we have <a href="https://www.deckhd.com/" target="_blank">DeckHD</a> launching their higher-resolution Steam Deck screen replacement, we also now have <a href="https://jsaux.com/products/anti-glare-screen-for-steam-deck-gp0300" target="_blank">JSAUX</a> who have launched their own Steam Deck Anti-Glare screen replacement.</p>
<p>Unlike DeckHD, the team at JSAUX decided to stick with the normal 800p Steam Deck resolution. The only minor difference is that JSAUX claim their screen has 70% sRGB coverage versus 67% on the original. Could be a good little upgrade mod for anyone with a 64GB or 256GB Steam Deck to get the anti-glare screen.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3791624981692699558gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3791624981692699558gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>A difficult mod to do though, that requires taking the entire Steam Deck apart. Not something beginners should think about, as a lot of small things can go wrong that could end up becoming a big expense. Even the JSAUX store page has a warning on this (nice to see).</p>
<p>Still, it's nice to continue to see more and more hardware mods appearing for the Steam Deck because of how open it is.</p>
<p>Available for $89.99 via <a href="https://jsaux.com/products/anti-glare-screen-for-steam-deck-gp0300" target="_blank">JSAUX</a>.</p>

      <title>Roblox support is coming back to Wine on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news for Roblox fans, as the game will soon start working in Wine again as the developers have been working to update it since the big breakage with the new client.</p>
<p>A few days ago on their developer forum, one of their staff members <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/why-did-roblox-stop-supporting-linux-users/2444335/61?u=sirsquiddybob" target="_blank">replied</a> (you have to be signed in to read) noting "shoutout to the Grapejuice community - this one is for you". <em>Grapejuice being a tool that configures Wine and Roblox together. </em>The staff member also included a screenshot of Roblox running on Manjaro Linux:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9904814361692696327gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9904814361692696327gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Roblox has multiple version channels, and it seems you're actually able to play it right now with Wine on the "zintegration" or "zcanary" channel. Although you should really wait until it rolls out properly, because switching around channels can cause all sorts of <strong>issues</strong> (like getting stuck on a particular channel) because it's all in <em>testing</em>.</p>
<p>That same staff member did also <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/why-did-roblox-stop-supporting-linux-users/2444335/100?u=sirsquiddybob" target="_blank">note</a> that "There will be an official announcement regarding unofficial support for Wine. As for an ETA, let’s just say soon™."</p>
<p>Just for science, testing it myself it does indeed work again when testing using the zcanary channel with the <a href="https://flathub.org/en-GB/apps/io.github.vinegarhq.Vinegar" target="_blank">Vinegar</a> wrapper for Roblox and Wine:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8422098541692697297gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8422098541692697297gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - BIG Paintball in Roblox on Kubuntu</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11939633871692697513gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11939633871692697513gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Pet Simulator in Roblox on Kubuntu</em></p>
<p>If you <em>really</em> want to try it out, again I <strong>wouldn't</strong> suggest so (really just wait until it hits stable Roblox), but it is possible if you use Vinegar linked above. You will need to switch it over to the zcanary update branch and use Vulkan, which you can do via this in terminal:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">mkdir -p ~/.var/app/io.github.vinegarhq.Vinegar/config/vinegar/ &amp;&amp; { echo "[player]"; echo "dxvk = false"; echo "renderer = \"Vulkan\""; echo "channel = \"zcanary\""; } &gt;&gt; ~/.var/app/io.github.vinegarhq.Vinegar/config/vinegar/config.toml</code></p>
<p>After that you'll be able to just login on the website, and run games or use the Vinegar Roblox App it gives you.</p>

      <title>5 years ago Valve released Proton forever changing Linux gaming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Has it really been that long? Apparently so. Valve originally announced their <em>rebranding</em> of Steam Play with Proton back on August 21st, 2018. Seems like a good time for a quick reflection being halfway to a decade old now.</p>
<p>The problem: before, during and just after the original Steam Machine push developers just weren't porting many games to Linux, and on the whole really when you look back Linux gaming was in a period of mostly stagnation. Nothing much was happening. A lot of the early porting work that came along was slowly dying off since the Steam Machines didn't provide the boost Valve and Linux gamers were hoping for. </p>
<p>Originally, “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190204114909/https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=9439-QHKN-1308" target="_blank">Steam Play</a>” simply meant you could buy a game on Steam and get access to all versions of it. So if you purchased a game on Windows, you could play it on Linux if it had a Native Linux version (same again for macOS). Clearly though, that wasn't enough for what Valve had planned. So if Valve wanted to make Linux a <em>better</em> platform for people to actually use it, they needed <em>something</em> more.</p>
<p>Popular games needed to be able to run on Linux if more people were to use it, because what good is a platform for gaming if tons of the most played games weren’t compatible? As Valve saw with the Steam Machines (not the only reason of course) it doesn’t end well.</p>
<p>I remember being sat in my office at the time, going over my TODO list of various articles and games to cover, planning the week ahead. Ready to then probably go to bed and then <em>BAM</em> — out of nowhere this <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/221410/announcements/detail/1696055855739350561" target="_blank">announcement</a> comes along from Valve that basically said <em>“you're going to be hella busy, better get a lot of coffee”. </em>Valve had partnered up with <a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/" target="_blank">CodeWeavers</a> and <strong>Proton</strong> was the answer. </p>
<p>Proton being the name Valve gave to their fork of <a href="https://www.winehq.org/" target="_blank">Wine</a> with a bunch of added extras, and it has changed Linux gaming forever. Steam Play is more than just Proton though, be sure to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">read my full Steam Play Proton guide</a>. <em>Side-note: John Carmack (id Software / Oculus VR / Keen Technologies) even thought Wine was the solution</em><a href="https://twitter.com/id_aa_carmack/status/298628243630723074" target="_blank"><em> </em><em>back in 2013</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>Of course Proton wouldn't have been possible without all the many years of work that went into the Wine project in the first place, and everyone who contributed to Wine should be applauded for their effort. Valve has funded a lot of extra work though to get things like<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk" target="_blank"> DXVK</a> and<a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton" target="_blank"> VKD3D-Proton</a> for the translation from Direct3D to Vulkan into a state where performance can be really great! <em>Valve also funds work on Linux graphics drivers, Linux kernel work and the list goes on.</em></p>
<p>Just how much has Proton changed things though? Well, we certainly <em>wouldn't</em> have the Steam Deck if it wasn't for Proton. There's no way Valve would have released their handheld without as many games as possible, clearly learning their lesson on the failure of the Steam Machines. But as we all know, the Steam Machines burned so Proton and the Steam Deck could rise from the ashes.</p>
<p>Proton just makes a <em>lot</em> of sense. It didn't take long for Valve to expand Proton to go initially from a few select Valve-approved titles, to being able to run anything we choose to try with it. From there, Linux gaming just seemingly <em>exploded</em>. And then eventually we saw <em>why</em> Valve made Proton with the Steam Deck announcement coming less than three years later in July 2021.</p>
<p>When you look at the crowd-sourced reports on<a href="https://www.protondb.com/" target="_blank"> ProtonDB</a> over 11,000 titles are reported to work by multiple people. It's a small fraction of Steam's overall game count but ProtonDB relies on people actually going and writing a report.</p>
<p>Valve's own Deck Verified rating system <em>just</em> for the Steam Deck hit plenty of milestones since the Steam Deck's release too, now having over<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/steam-deck-hits-over-10000-verified-and-playable-games/" target="_blank"> 10,000 titles rated to be Playable or Verified</a>. Although both ProtonDB and Deck Verified include a mixture of Native Linux releases and Windows games run with Proton. The <em>point</em> is - being on Linux now for a gamer means quite often a huge amount of your games do actually "just work". It's <em>almost</em> magical.</p>
<p>The real number of games playable on Linux will never be truly known though, because on Steam there's many tens of thousands of games and a lot of them will likely "just work" with Proton if they don’t have a Native Linux build available…and many more are releasing every week. This is a truly incredible place to be in. When you think about Linux and Steam Deck together having <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/linux-overtakes-macos-users-on-steam-thanks-to-steam-deck/" target="_blank">just less than a 2%</a> user share on Steam overall — these are some insane numbers for game compatibility for a niche platform.</p>
<p>Thanks to Proton, I've been able to discover a <em>ton</em> of new favourite games, some I would never have played before. Games like Deep Rock Galactic, God of War, Death Stranding, Baldur’s Gate 3, Brotato, Beat Saber and so on. You get the idea, there’s a truly ridiculous selection of games available and at times it’s a little <em>paralysing</em> scrolling through my Steam Library deciding what to play — a delightfully annoying problem to have huh?</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18291519851692554532gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18291519851692554532gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured - Baldur's Gate 3, shot taken on Kubuntu</em></p>
<p>Gamers using Linux (be it desktop or Steam Deck) in 2023 are now in a place where they can get <strong>excited</strong> alongside friends who use Windows or traditional consoles, because they know there's a good probable chance at release that whatever new exciting game coming out will work without much trouble.</p>
<p>Proton is far from perfect though and it does mean in a few ways that Valve, CodeWeavers and everyone else working on it are playing catch-up with Microsoft on compatibility and whatever changes Microsoft suddenly decides to announce that affects gaming. That, and how many different ways game developers can abuse various APIs to do things in weird ways. Valve and co are a dedicated bunch though, <em>constantly</em> fixing up issues from AAA games like<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/proton-experimental-beta-gets-steam-deck-performance-fix-for-elden-ring/" target="_blank"> ELDEN RING</a> where Valve quickly worked to implement optimizations, same again for problems with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/valve-fix-dead-space-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Dead Space</a> to the likes of<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/07/codeweavers-blog-about-their-linux-steam-deck-work-on-proton-with-pooshooter/" target="_blank"> PooShooter: Toilet Invaders</a> (what a fun highlight that was eh?). There's also the constant third-party launcher breakage, that Valve are also fixing up each time it happens.</p>
<p>Valve produce updates to Proton <em>constantly</em> to improve compatibility, with over 300 revisions to the main <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">changelog</a> (although some a minor text corrections) it's clear to see how much work goes into it. With various new main versions of Proton through 4, 5, 6, 7 now onto 8 and multiple updates to Proton Experimental almost <em>every</em> month.</p>
<p>So here's to Proton, the magnificent tech that allows playing all kinds of games across Linux systems from desktop to Steam Deck and wherever else you decide to stick Linux. Nice one Valve. Cheers.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 8-13 and 8-12 released, FSR no longer default and many game fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The community maintained GE-Proton has two new releases available, so here's what's changed and improved with the latest versions. This is the version of Proton <em>not</em> supported by Valve, so it may have issues at times the official Proton does not. However, it also at times pulls in fixes a bit quicker and can do things sometimes that Valve cannot do. To sum up: use it if you need it for specific games, otherwise sticking with the official Proton is the best idea. More about Proton can be found in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">my Proton beginner's guide</a>.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton8-12" target="_blank">GE-Proton 8-12</a> they've now disabled FSR by default. It's still there but you'll once again need to use Steam launch options like WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR=1 to set it as they found using it actually limits in-game resolutions in some games.</p>
<p>There's also patches and fixes for these games:</p>
<ul>
<li>Farlight 84.</li>
<li>Guilty Gear Xrd.</li>
<li>Escape from Monkey Island.</li>
<li>Memento Mori.</li>
<li>Titanfall with northstar.</li>
<li>DCS World steam edition.</li>
<li>Assetto Corsa.</li>
<li>Persona 5 Strikers.</li>
<li>Shin Megami Tensei III Nocturne HD Remaster.</li>
<li>Tex Murphy: Overseer.</li>
<li>Alternativa.</li>
<li>The Big Secret of a Small Town.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus other back-end work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Import upstream proton fixes.</li>
<li>Updated wine bleeding edge.</li>
<li>Updated dxvk git.</li>
<li>Updated vkd3d-proton git.</li>
</ul>
<p>While <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton8-13" target="_blank">GE-Proton 8-13</a> was a hotfix to clean up other issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>steam helper MR <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/pull/6555" target="_blank">ValveSoftware#6555</a> re-added and updated. Allows -northstar to work with Titanfall 2 while not breaking other games that use bash script launchers. This also allows other launch options to be used alongside -northstar option, regardless of arguement ordering (ie -northstar -novid, or -novid -northstar). This MR also allows launch options to be used with EA games (link2ea commands).</li>
<li>Updated Titanfall 2 protonfix to restore original Titanfall2.exe if NorthstarLauncher.exe symlink was previously used. (the -northstar option does not use/need NorthstarLauncher.exe, it works instead via wsock32 override).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Text Guide to install GE-Proton:</strong></p>

      <title>Dwarf Fortress gets a Linux Beta on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready to dig deep? Dwarf Fortress now has a Linux Beta available on Steam, so you can get testing and see what all the fuss is about with this new version. While it was already playable with Proton, we knew for a while that Bay 12 Games planned Native Linux support as well.</p>
<p>As they said in the Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/3660916710568153375" target="_blank">announcement</a> "The Linux version is almost ready, and in about two weeks we will be looking for beta testers, after Tarn gets back from Germany... in fact, it's already on the Public Beta Branch!" — so even though technically right now they're not looking for testers they put it up for you anyway.</p>
<p>Simply opt into the main Beta for it on Steam and you'll be able to play and test it. However, if you find you can't get it because it keeps using Proton, you can select the Steam Linux Runtime from the Compatibility menu which will then make sure it grabs the Linux version.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18209411421692612541gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18209411421692612541gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12872830061692612543gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12872830061692612543gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
