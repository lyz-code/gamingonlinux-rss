      <title>Steam now allows transferring games between PCs and Steam Deck too</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In the latest Client Beta available for Desktop Steam and Steam Deck, Valve put in a new feature to help you transferring games.</p>
<p>If enabled in your Steam Downloads settings, you can transfer games and update files from one PC to another, or from PC to Steam Deck. Useful in many different situations like having limited bandwidth, slow internet speeds, LAN parties and you get the idea. Here's a video to highlight the feature as well as various other bits of Steam Deck / Linux news:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kVfGOsMI1Hs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7c1fa165c7422fab35c2d298e2858843.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kVfGOsMI1Hs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The full <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3673285123502439065" target="_blank">patch notes</a> for the Steam Deck Beta:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed some issues where focus was lost after exiting a game</li>
<li>Reduced flashing in background when scrolling through games on home screen</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Local Network Game Transfers</p>
<ul>
<li>Added new feature that allows Steam users to copy existing Steam game installation and update files from one PC to another over a local area network, without having to download and install from a Steam content server on the internet. This reduces internet traffic and can speed up installs or updates.</li>
<li>This feature is currently only PC -&gt; PC or PC -&gt; Steam Deck, and both sender and receiver must be opted into Steam Beta.</li>
<li>Steam users have control over who files can be sent to: self only, friends only, or everyone. The default setting is self only.</li>
<li>More info about this new feature can be found <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/46BD-6BA8-B012-CE43" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Added a loading throbber when waiting on Steam Cloud to update</li>
<li>Improved the latency of querying the workshop in the Configuration Browser and fix issues with configurations popping-in or opening the wrong tab because results weren't fully received</li>
<li>Added a loading throbber that shows while the Configuration Browser workshop query is running</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Desktop Mode: Steam</p>
<ul>
<li>Added UI that temporarily takes over the "What's New" section of the Library when pre-purchased games are available to pre-load or install and play</li>
<li>Added UI at startup for account selection</li>
<li>Added a "sign out" option to the main menu that removes credentials for the signed in account from the machine</li>
<li>Fixed a crash when the OS is notifying Steam that it should shutdown</li>
<li>Improved performance of games when using Steam Workshop APIs</li>
<li>Refreshed the profile games page with a new style and improved performance</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Desktop Mode: Big Picture</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue where the old BPM on-screen keyboard would appear at the same time as the new BPM virtual keyboard</li>
<li>Fixed issue where user could not re-enter a context submenu after backing out of it.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Just for Desktop Steam, they also finally started getting the New Big Picture mode working better with NVIDIA GPUs, which has been pretty terrible in terms of performance. To be honest though, I can't tell any difference and if anything, it actually feels even worse than before.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8732230701676744527gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8732230701676744527gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>These are <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3642885192596178104" target="_blank">also noted</a> <em>just</em> for Desktop Steam Beta:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue where incoming chat messages would not be delivered properly while in-game.</li>
<li>Added support for the Sony DualSense Edge controller including support for remapping of the rear buttons.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with Steam preventing PS4 controllers from being read over DirectInput when Steam Input was disabled. Note: this was already hotfixed into the non-Beta Steam client.</li>
</ul>

      <title>iFixit begin offering Steam Deck SSD upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Even more options to upgrade your Steam Deck SSD! The folks at iFixit have begun offering SSDs and upgrade kits.</p>
<p>Nice to see in addition to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/framework-begin-offering-2tb-ssd-upgrades-for-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Framework</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/scan-uk-to-offer-ssd-upgrades-compatible-with-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Scan UK</a>, as these smaller SSDs have been a little difficult to come by. The more that stock them and the more that sell, the more likely they are to spread further and come down in price after a while too.</p>
<p>As for what iFixit are offering they have the Micron 2400 NVMe SSD in 512GB, 1TB and 2TB editions with either their Upgrade Kit or just the SSD by itself. It looks like currently they're only in the US (didn't show up for EU / UK). Pricing goes from $99.99 for just the 512GB SSD up to $304.99 for the 2TB SSD plus the Upgrade Kit so it can be a little on the pricy side still right now.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4043943981676719156gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4043943981676719156gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>See more on the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/products/micron-2400-nvme-pcie-gen4-2230-ssd" target="_blank">iFixit Store</a>.</p>
<p>Are you planning to do an SSD upgrade or have you done it already? Let me know in the comments.</p>

      <title>Wine 8.2 rolls out along with a new Proton Experimental update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Today we've seen an update for two translation layers. Wine has development release 8.2 available, and there's an update for Proton Experimental too.</p>
<p>As a reminder: Wine is a translation layer that runs Windows apps and games on other platforms including Linux. Proton is what Valve use on Linux Desktop and Steam Deck to run many thousands of games and Wine is part of Proton!</p>
<p>For <a href="https://www.winehq.org/announce/8.2" target="_blank">Wine 8.2</a> here's the release highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Better debug information in Wow64 mode.</li>
<li>Wow64 thunks in the WPCAP library.</li>
<li>Indeo IV50 codec support.</li>
<li>Monitor names set from EDID data.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The Wine developers also noted 22 bugs fixed including issues with Visual Studio, GOG Heroes of Might and Magic IV, Final Fantasy XI, various vbscript memory leaks and various other miscellaneous improvements.</p>
<p><em>Want help managing Wine on Linux? You can try <a href="https://usebottles.com/" target="_blank">Bottles</a>, <a href="https://lutris.net/" target="_blank">Lutris</a> and the <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/" target="_blank">Heroic Launcher</a>.</em></p>
<p>On the Proton Experimental side, there's been two small updates since I last wrote about it. For the update on February 10th the single noted fix was for "Arabic fonts in FIFA 21 and 22". While today's Proton Experimental update also notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fix multiplayer in Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition.</li>
<li>Improve monitor names visible in settings in Hogwart Legacy and other games. (X11 only)</li>
<li>Fix Wild Hearts keyboard input issues.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The Proton changelog can be found <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">here</a>. At some point this year I expect Valve will rebase Proton on the Wine 8.x series but no word as to when that will happen.</p>
<p>To change the version of Proton used by games on Linux Desktop and Steam Deck:</p>
<p><strong>Steam Deck</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Open a game in your Steam Library.</li>
<li>Go to the settings icon on the far right and click it.</li>
<li>Select Properties.</li>
<li>Compatibility menu -&gt; tick the box -&gt; select from the dropdown box.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Linux Desktop</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Right click any game in your Steam Library.</li>
<li>Select Properties.</li>
<li>Compatibility menu -&gt; tick the box -&gt; select from the dropdown box.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's a video too:</p>

      <title>A new Civilization game is in development and XCOM designer leaves Firaxis</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>2K sent out a press release today confirming a number of things including a new Civilization game is on the way.</p>
<p>In the press release they noted that Jake Solomon, Creative Director on XCOM and Marvel's Midnight Suns, is leaving after two decades at the company after being a big part of XCOM: Enemy Unknown, XCOM 2, and Marvel's Midnight Suns. Not only that, industry veteran Heather Hazen has been bumped up from Firaxis Games Chief Operating Officer to Studio Head. Hazen previously worked as Executive Producer on Fortnite at Epic Games, as well as Plants vs. Zombies and Bejeweled while at PopCap Games.</p>
<p>Not much was said about the new Civilization apart from Hazen's own statement in the press release:</p>
<p>"I'm thrilled to have this opportunity to carry on the studio's storied legacy, beginning with the announcement that Firaxis is in development on the next iteration of the legendary Civilization franchise," said Hazen. "I'm lucky to be working with some of the best developers in our industry, and we have plans to take the Civilization franchise to exciting new heights for our millions of players around the world.  In addition, we will continue to support Marvel's Midnight Suns with post-launch content, and explore new creative projects for our teams."</p>
<p>It's probably quite <em>unlikely </em>that the new Civilization will have Native Linux support, given that Aspyr Media aren't really doing any more porting like it. With <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a> as good as it is now, no doubt by the time it releases it would work quite well anyway on Linux.</p>

      <title>All Your Base Are Belong to Us — Zero Wing (and other classics) hit Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Zero Wing along with other shoot 'em up classics Out Zone, Twin Cobra and Truxton from Toaplan and Bitwave Games have their brand new PC releases out.</p>
<p>Quite disappointingly though, the famous <a href="https://youtu.be/qItugh-fFgg" target="_blank">meme</a> "All your base are belong to us" from Zero Wing that was in the Sega Mega Drive (Sega Genesis) version is absent from this new release. This is due to each of the games being upgraded from the original Arcade game versions. However, the good news is that a patch is coming that will add the cutscene back in, it just wasn't ready for the main release.</p>
<p>Some of the upgrades available for the games includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Quality-focused features such as minimal input lag, input processing, and rendering all complete on the same frame.</li>
<li>Instrument Panels featuring additional gameplay information and artwork.</li>
<li>Rewind feature allowing gamers to rewind between 10-18 minutes of play.</li>
<li>Assist features facilitating options such as auto-fire.</li>
<li>Very Easy Mode, allowing beginners to master each game at their own pace.</li>
<li>Pixel-perfect display option or full-screen scaling in both windowed and full-screen modes.</li>
<li>Rotate option allowing the action to be rotated in 90-degree increments.</li>
<li>Choose between Raw Input on Windows or Steam® Input.</li>
<li>Practice mode, allowing gamers to hone their skills.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>See their release trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AwXoPPNx5QY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ebaec3aa340eceba7caa757884fdf9bd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AwXoPPNx5QY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>All of them have <strong>Native Linux</strong> support and after testing on Steam Deck as they sent over a copy of each to me, they will <em>easily</em> be fully Steam Deck Verified. I've had a lot of fun with them, and they're all as difficult as I remember. Zero Wing in particular used to kick my ass on Mega Drive but it remained as one of my favourite shoot 'em ups and overall Bitwave Games have done a real quality job on them.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>Tatsujin CEO, and legendary Toaplan developer, Masahiro Yuge, commented, “We’re humbled that gamers today hold our games in such high regard, it’s a testament to the work we put into making each title a memorable experience. We’re glad these titles have stood the test of time and we’re delighted to bring them to a new audience through the release of Toaplan Arcade Shoot ‘Em Up Collection Vol.1.”</p>
<p>Niklas Istenes, CEO of Bitwave Games, said, “Developing this premier volume of much-loved shooters has been a labour of love and one which we know our community is excited to play. We’re so happy to finally release the first in our planned collection and can’t wait to see what scores gamers manage to achieve on the online leader boards! We look forward to announcing more about our future plans for the collection soon, and we’re confident gamers will fall in love with these games all over again."</p>

<p>While you could get them elsewhere, and then emulate them, I'm a huge fan of click and play releases like this for classics that come with enhancements built-in. It just makes playing them a whole lot nicer. I can easily recommend picking up these classics because sometimes they really don't make them like they used to. I'm extremely keen to see what they have cooking up for more upgraded retro releases like this. Especially nice that they did Native Linux support that works great on Desktop Linux and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>You can find each of them on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/franchise/toaplan/" target="_blank">Steam</a> (<a href="https://www.gog.com/en/games?developers=bitwave-games" target="_blank">GOG</a> too but they only have the Windows builds).</p>

      <title>Total War: WARHAMMER III update gives everyone Immortal Empires</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Creative Assembly and SEGA have released the 2.4.0 version update to Total War: WARHAMMER III and it's quite a big one.</p>
<p>This brings the massive combined campaign Immortal Empires out of Beta and ready for everyone. This is where if you own the previous games, it all gets bundled into one big thing with all of the landmasses, Legendary Lords, war units and more from the Total War: WARHAMMER series into one colossal mode. However, they've now opened this up to all players regardless if you own the previous games or not. They said you can just buy the individual DLC from the previous games if you want to access more from them.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Qqhc3mK06r0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e394c11fe15e6bff35341e282174ed6a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Qqhc3mK06r0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Sounds awesome.</p>
<p>Here some of the other changes in the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Karak Eight Peaks is now a ten-slot settlement for the Skaven... yes-yes...</li>
<li>Malus's quest battle for the Warpstone of Khaine is now in the Chaos Wastes, closer to his starting position.</li>
<li>Fixed a variety of visual/graphical glitches such as clipping capes, snapping models and broken animations.</li>
<li>Garrisons are no longer reinforcements and now enter the battle from the start.</li>
<li>Fixed a multiplayer desync that could occur when an Empire player chose to Summon the Elector Counts.</li>
<li>Coedill will no longer immediately enter the battle instead of reinforcing once the Waystones are destroyed in Drycha's quest battle.</li>
<li>Interrogating Grom the Paunch in Athel Tamarha as Eltharion now correctly gives Mistwalker units the ability to mirror Grom's Big Waaagh ability.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Boris Ursus wouldn't gain supporters while the Invocation of Dazh is active.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>See their patch notes overview video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ASLcFaaiNgM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1684aef8d17dc27962633ca51364eae4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ASLcFaaiNgM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For those of you sticking to the Native Linux port from Feral Interactive instead of running it in Proton, there's a bit of a wait ahead. Over email to my question about the update for it they mentioned they don't have a fixed date for the update but it's in the "final stages of development and are aiming at making the Linux update available soon".</p>

      <title>Steam had 83,000 new customers every day in 2022</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has put out their <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/3677786186779762808" target="_blank">Steam Year In Review for 2022</a> and while they didn't give us a new monthly active user count, there were plenty of other details shared.</p>
<p>One that's the most striking to me, was the note about how they saw a completely ridiculous <strong><u>83,000</u></strong> "new first-time purchasers every day of the year". That is just absolutely nuts. Steam is clearly stronger than ever and growing at a crazy pace. Valve noted how they crossed over 30 million users online last year too, which was only a year and a half after hitting 20 million for the first time. </p>
<p>What's driving the growth then? The PC (that's Personal Computer — PC <em>doesn't</em> mean Windows) is an open platform and isn't "reliant on any one product or manufacturer" said Valve. Certainly is a benefit as they said anyone can come along with "a beat-up old laptop or a brand new top of the line rig, and plug in any peripheral they want" and with the Steam Deck too of course there's more ways than ever to play.</p>
<p>A lot of the post is just going over things I've reported on across last year like Steam Deck, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> updates, Big Picture Mode, Dynamic Cloud Sync and their regular Steam Input updates. There was also their update to Game Hubs, the new Steam Mobile App and all their new festivals and sales.</p>
<p>When it comes to what's driving people to Steam it was a big mix of established names and new developers too. Of course they have stuff like Call of Duty, Elden Ring and others but they also mentioned how 85 of the top releases during 2022 were from studios releasing their first game — with developers spread across the globe too.</p>
<p>Going along with their growth in customers, they had a lot of downloads too. They said the content delivery increased by "36%" as they served up 44.7 exabytes. To put it into perspective they said that would be the equivalent to having "every one of the 8 billion people on planet Earth downloaded a 5.5 gigabyte game".</p>
<p>Simply incredibly growth. Valve pretty much continue to be a money printing machine. It's hard to imagine but with the 30% cut they take from most developers, that's a whole lot in the bank.</p>

      <title>Hunt: Showdown added Easy Anti-Cheat for Steam Deck &amp; Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While no announcement from the developer has been made yet, Hunt: Showdown now has the Easy Anti-Cheat file needed and works on Steam Deck and Linux Desktop.</p>
<p>This is one I certainly didn't expect to start working. However, since there's been no announcement, it could stop working in future. EAC doesn't just get added and turned on like this by accident though.</p>
<p>For the Steam Deck, it actually works surprisingly well too and even looks pretty good on Low details. To ensure it works, make sure you have installed the Proton EasyAntiCheat Runtime from your Steam Library. As it may not be automatically installed and you won't have it unless you've installed something else that did have it automatically set on it.</p>
<p>See some Steam Deck footage below:</p>

<p>As for Desktop Linux, my testing has been on Fedora KDE 37 and it has been a pretty great experience there too. Setting everything up to High on the various presets, using a 1440p resolution with my AMD Ryzen 5800x plus NVIDIA 2080 Ti it's been quite smooth, apart from the usual expected shader cache dips while it gets built up and eventually becomes fully smooth.</p>
<p>I've been generally seeing 90+FPS with everything on High. It runs really very nicely.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/594650/Hunt_Showdown/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>. Not a recommendation yet though though due to the mentioned issue of it not being formally announced but thought you would like to know and see it running.</p>

      <title>Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector adds Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector from Black Lab Games and publisher Slitherine released back in 2021, and it just got upgraded for Steam Deck players. </p>
<p>More about it: "Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector is a fast-paced turn-based strategy game set in the grimdark universe of the 41st Millennium. Pick your force, develop your army, field mighty heroes and fight for victory using superior strategy, awesome abilities, and devastating weaponry."</p>
<p>Never seen it? Trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nVsCATpZloc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d20213e2eeef203b4f815cba0d3cc338.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nVsCATpZloc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Nice to see developers of all sorts big and small, and all different genres look to make the experience better. Previously it was rated as Unsupported by Valve through their Deck Verified rating system - so hopefully now it can be bumped up at least to Playable or Verified to let potential players know.</p>
<p>As of the latest update version 1.2.43 here's the main changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Steamdeck support. We’ve made a number of changes to improve the experience when playing on Steam Deck.
<ul>
<li>The game will default to gamepad controls when starting on Steam Deck, fonts should be more readable, the on-screen keyboard should display when required and better v-sync handling for smoother play.</li>
<li>Added support for gamepad controls in some PC-only multiplayer UIs such as tournaments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added support for chat messages in asynchronous multiplayer matches.</li>
<li>Refactored the system that manages multiplayer turn data exchange to prevent most desyncs.</li>
<li>Enabled V-sync when running on PS5, Xbox One X or Xbox Series X.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/warhammer-40000-battlesector?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295500/Warhammer_40000_Battlesector/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Classic city-builder Nebuchadnezzar gets a big free update and DLC</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nebuchadnezzar, a classic isometric city-builder has continued to get some big upgrades with a new release out and an expansion DLC too.</p>
<p>Designed much like the original Pharaoh from 1999, and looks like an upgraded version of it. Initially it struggled at release due to some missing features but the developers at Nepos Games have really pulled it out the bag here. The free 1.4 update adds in: walls to secure your city, warfare, diplomacy improvements, increased map sizes, an update to the original campaign to add in some warfare missions, a colourblind mode and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11748953851676573323gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11748953851676573323gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>On top of the huge free update they also released Nebuchadnezzar: The Adventures of Sargon DLC. This includes a whole new campaign along with a fully voiced dialogs system for those of you wanting to play through more.</p>
<p>Now rated Very Positive from users on Steam, seems like they've done well with it. Nice to see it continue to be upgraded.</p>
<p>You can buy it from <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/nebuchadnezzar?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1157220/Nebuchadnezzar/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>AMD releases source code for FidelityFX FSR2 v2.2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Last year AMD announced FSR version 2.2 and today AMD has actually released the source code on <a href="https://github.com/GPUOpen-Effects/FidelityFX-FSR2/releases/tag/v2.2.0" target="_blank">GitHub</a> for FidelityFX FSR2 v2.2.</p>
<p>This makes it even easier for any developer and game engine to use it, so hopefully we will begin to see more games implement it to help performance. With this being the first proper public release of FSR 2.2 these are the main changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Introduction of debug API checker.</li>
<li>Changes to improve "High Velocity Ghosting" situations.</li>
<li>Changes to Luminance computation with pre-exposure application.</li>
<li>Small motion vectors ignored in previous depth estimation.</li>
<li>Changes to depth logic to improve disocclusion detection and avoid self-disocclusions.</li>
<li>Dilated reactive mask logic updated to use temporal motion vector divergence to kill locks.</li>
<li>New lock luminance resource.</li>
<li>Accumulation overhauled to use temporal reactivity.</li>
<li>Changed how intermediate signals are stored and tonemapped.</li>
<li>Luminance instability logic improved.</li>
<li>Tonemapping no longer applied during RCAS to retain more dynamic range.</li>
<li>Fixes for multiple user reported issues on GitHub and elsewhere. Thank you for your feedback!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>AMD are announcing another milestone too with 250 games either having FSR or planning to add it in as they showed in a graphic of many game logos. Out of the 250 they said 110 of them will support the latest FSR 2 and they soon expect the number of FSR 2 enabled games to overtake FSR 1.</p>

      <title>Returnal is just rough on Steam Deck but great on Desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Returnal is now on Steam so naturally I gave this previously PlayStation exclusive a run on Steam Deck. It's quite sad though.</p>
<p>This is a case of a game just being a bit too much for the Steam Deck to nicely handle. With everything set to Low, with multiple in-game scaling methods tried like AMD FSR, NVIDIA NIS and dynamic resolution — all show the game really cannot stick to 30FPS. Frame pacing is all over the place too, making it just an <em>unpleasant</em> experience. You <em>could</em> reduce the rendering resolution but considering how fast paced the game is, the result is not pretty in action and getting it low enough where it makes a true difference is just not acceptable quality-wise.</p>
<p>Have a look at benchmarks and gameplay below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="o08FUGspv90"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/27789560759e2d97113fab5ff4ff7430.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/o08FUGspv90" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As for how it runs on Desktop Linux? Testing it on Fedora KDE 37 with my AMD Ryzen 5800x and an NVIDIA 2080 Ti, performance there seems quite good overall. I'm actually really surprised by how smooth it is, I was expecting a lot more stutter but it's impressive.</p>
<p>Running it at 1440p on the Epic settings preset with NVIDIA Image Scaling set to Quality and I've been seeing it running a good ~90FPS. Without using a scaling option, it would give me around 50-55FPS at 1440p. There is <em>some</em> shader stutter but as expected, it gets smoother over time and not a big deal here.</p>
<p>Screenshots of it on Fedora (click to enlarge them):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19849482861676501143gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19849482861676501143gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6935789371676501444gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6935789371676501444gol1.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>For desktop Linux gamers at least, this looks like quite a safe bet from my early impressions here. It performs well, looks absolutely fantastic and the action sure is intense!</p>

      <title>Shader cache downloads being a nuisance? Valve may have solved it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve's shader cache system can be extremely helpful for Linux gaming, however it can also at times be quite problematic but Valve may have solved a big problem with it.</p>
<p>The idea behind the system is that you're supposed to see small regular downloads for the shader cache of each game, as Valve continue to build it up and then spread it out to everyone to help improve game performance on Linux and Steam Deck. However, over the years quite a lot of people have reported how it kept giving full downloads of the whole thing instead of being incremental.</p>
<p>Writing on the GitHub bug report from 2021 today, Valve developer <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/8076#issuecomment-1430641159" target="_blank">Pierre-Loup Griffais said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shader cache downloads are designed to be incremental. Reports here indicate a daily download of the full shader cache file size, which is inconsistent with expectations - a small download and full disk write is expected instead.</p>
<p>After looking at the logs shared on this issue and on <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/9200" target="_blank">#9200</a>, we've investigated and found a server-side problem with the system that keeps track of the ordering of shaders in those updates.</p>
<p>We've just rolled out an initial fix and will continue to monitor the situation. If the issue persists, please comment on this report and attach your <code class="inline-code">shader_log[.previous].txt</code> as indicated above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully now fewer people (or no one) will see the issue but do let them know on the bug report if it happens to you.</p>

      <title>Zink driver for OpenGL over Vulkan gets a 10x performance boost for DOOM 2016</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A really small change to the Zink driver, that gives OpenGL support on top of Vulkan, has given an ~10x speed boost for DOOM (2016). Other games are likely to benefit from this change too but DOOM was the one where an issue was noticed.</p>
<p>Writing on <a href="https://www.supergoodcode.com/CAPPED/" target="_blank">their blog</a> last week, developer Mike Blumenkrantz noted that a really odd issue was found where "Even as early as the title screen, framerate would struggle to hit 30fps for a while before rocketing up to whatever maximum it could reach. In-game was the same, soaring to the 200fps maximum after enough time standing stationary without moving the camera. As soon as the camera shifted however, back to 20fps we went.".</p>
<p>After investigating they found the problem and a <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/21218" target="_blank">merge request</a> that was accepted for Mesa that's only around 4 lines has fixed the issue to allow DOOM to run at full-speed on the Zink driver.</p>
<p>Makes me often wonder how many things can be fixed up by such small changes.</p>
<p>What's the point of the Zink driver? As the Mesa documentation states: "The Zink driver is a Gallium driver that emits Vulkan API calls instead of targeting a specific GPU architecture. This can be used to get full desktop OpenGL support on devices that only support Vulkan.".</p>

      <title>You may want to run system updates, after a recent sudo security flaw</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It was pointed out to me recently in the <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux Discord</a>, that the sudo package recently had a security flaw, so time to check for updates.</p>
<p>The sudo package is what's responsible for giving certain users or user groups the ability to run some (or all) commands as root or another user. A pretty important package, and of course one that needs to be secure. Nothing is perfect though of course, and security issues being reported and then fixed is a good thing.</p>
<p>Going by the US NVD (National Vulnerability Database) <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22809" target="_blank">entry for it</a>, they classed it as a High level issue. As described:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Sudo before 1.9.12p2, the sudoedit (aka -e) feature mishandles extra arguments passed in the user-provided environment variables (SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL, and EDITOR), allowing a local attacker to append arbitrary entries to the list of files to process. This can lead to privilege escalation. Affected versions are 1.8.0 through 1.9.12.p1. The problem exists because a user-specified editor may contain a "--" argument that defeats a protection mechanism, e.g., an EDITOR='vim -- /path/to/extra/file' value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Giving that it needs a local attack, it does limit what people can do with it but still a good reminder to ensure your systems are up to date eh?</p>
<p>So if you're on at least sudo 1.9.12p2 you're good to go. Although, some distributions like Ubuntu use slightly different versioning so if you're on Ubuntu you should have 1.9.11p3. Fedora seems up to date too, but checking on System76's Pop!_OS it's only reporting sudo 1.9.9 for example (Edit: but as pointed out in comments, it has the patch as it's based on an older Ubuntu).</p>
<p>You can read a little more on it <a href="https://medium.com/@dev.nest/how-to-bypass-sudo-exploit-cve-2023-22809-vulnerability-296ef10a1466" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

      <title>D8VK is an in-progress implementation of Direct3D 8 for DXVK</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While we have VKD3D-Proton for Direct3D 12 to Vulkan and DXVK for Direct3D 9 / 10 / 11 to Vulkan translation, what about Direct3D 8? <a href="https://github.com/AlpyneDreams/d8vk" target="_blank">D8VK</a> is an upcoming in-progress project for that.</p>
<p>I've been aware of this for a while but after checking back on it, the project seems to be coming along rather nicely to support some older classics and get them performing well with Wine / <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a>. It even had a first pre-release build back in December 2022 and work continues on it now. ProtonUp-Qt even added support for it in a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/protonup-qt-v277-adds-support-for-northstarproton-to-play-modded-titanfall-2/" target="_blank">previous release</a> too.</p>
<p>Going by <a href="https://github.com/AlpyneDreams/d8vk/wiki#supported-games" target="_blank">their list</a> of supported games, it's looking quite impressive on what it can run already but it seems plenty of work is still ahead before it's truly ready. Some of what they list as playable on Linux with it includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>7 Wonders Magical Mystery Tour</li>

      <title>EVERSPACE 2 gets a Steam Deck and Linux release update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For those of you curious on what's happening with EVERSPACE 2 for Linux, ROCKFISH Games have given an official update on what to expect.</p>
<p>In a post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1128920/view/3632752322785384804" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rockfishgames/everspace-2/posts/3732437" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, they made it clear that Linux support and Steam Deck are priorities for them to be supported. As they said having it playable "natively on Linux is high on our priority list" although there can always be unforeseen issues as they learned porting the first game to Linux but "overall Unreal Engine 4’s Linux support is in a much better state, now".</p>
<p>However, they're clear that "PC" (they mean Windows…sigh) is their "top priority" right now since it's the biggest set of users and a few weeks will still be spent on Windows players before shifting over to Linux. They're "reasonably confident" on Linux support at the 1.0 launch.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="u8m47pGxGaM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ea606059f206e0a9c60eeffbe5828351.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/u8m47pGxGaM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As for Steam Deck specific support they said they're also hoping for that at the 1.0 release but it's a lot more work due to optimizations needed, and changes needing to be made to the text size and UI for the smaller screen. Plus, Steam Deck was not part of their Kickstarter promises so it's a lower priority. They said trying it on Steam Deck right now is a "pretty OK time" but they want to aim for the experience to be of a higher quality.</p>
<p>If I hear of any changes, I'll let you know.</p>

      <title>10 years ago Steam released for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm starting to feel old. I remember a time before Steam for Linux, back in the dark days even before the first set of Humble Indie Bundles, it's truly crazy how far Linux has come overall as a platform for gaming. 10 years ago <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/oldnews/9943" target="_blank">today</a>, Steam for Linux left Beta and released officially and what a difference it made!</p>
<p>Many issues along the way, a number of missteps from Valve directly too (hello Steam Machines), but we got there in the end didn't we? Linux Gaming is no longer a thing that people will constantly laugh about. It's here, it's a thing and many people now with a Steam Deck likely don't even realise they're using Linux — that's just how good it can be.</p>
<p><em>Life changing of course for me too, GamingOnLinux is my job and 99% of that is thanks to Valve's effort.</em></p>
<p>I'm not going to rehash everything, since I've gone over many milestones before like my previous article <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/07/faster-zombies-to-steam-deck-the-history-of-valve-and-linux-gaming/" target="_blank">Faster Zombies to Steam Deck: The History of Valve and Linux Gaming</a> from 2021, which is worth a read if you're somewhat new to Linux gaming (and Steam Deck!).</p>
<p>Happy 10 years, Steam for Linux! Cheers! Here's to the next 10 and many more.</p>
<p>What do you expect over the next 10 years and what have been your favourite moments?</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma 5.27 released with multi-monitor &amp; Wayland upgrades, Steam Deck updater</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>KDE Plasma 5.27 sounds like a really great update to this desktop environment, the same one used on the desktop mode for the Steam Deck and my personal choice for my PC too.</p>
<p>Coming in on Valentines Day and the "<a href="https://fsfe.org/news/2023/news-20230104-01.en.html" target="_blank">I Love Free Software Day</a>" (that's apparently a thing?), it brings an absolute ton of enhancements to the desktop experience including a new introduction wizard to guide you through a first time install that might help a few confused users. There's also a window tiling system, updates to app themes, upgrades to the widgets system, adjustments to system settings so it's not so overloaded, Discover now supports full Steam Deck system upgrades and so much more.</p>
<p>KDE Plasma 5.27 is also a Long Term Support release so it will continue to see fixes until some time in 2024 when the next LTS release of Plasma becomes available.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6697133811676399250gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6697133811676399250gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the other changes includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi-monitor overhaul:</strong> Those of you who use multiple monitors should benefit greatly from a major overhaul of how Plasma handles them. Arrangements will now be more robust, without the chance of panels and desktops getting lost after monitors are unplugged or re-arranged.</li>
<li><strong>Use global shortcuts to run terminal commands:</strong> The <em>Shortcuts</em> page in the <em>System Settings</em> utility now lets you configure keyboard shortcuts not only for apps, but also to launch terminal commands and scripts.</li>
<li><strong>Activate "Do Not Disturb" mode from the command line:</strong> If you spend most of the time in the terminal and are being overwhelmed with notifications, just type <code class="inline-code">kde-inhibit --notifications</code> and Plasma will enter "Do Not Disturb" mode.</li>
<li><strong>Send windows to Activities:</strong> Do you use Activities to compartmentalize your private work, public life, and play time? If so, now you can move or copy windows to one, some or all of your Activities by right-clicking on the titlebar and choosing where you want it to go.</li>
<li><strong>Save power with one keystroke:</strong> While on the lock screen, hit the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key to turn off the screen and save some power.</li>
<li><strong>Customized menu entries</strong>. If you like customizing how apps launch, KDE's <em>Menu Editor</em> has always let you set environment variables when opening your apps, but now it's much easier to do so, as Plasma 5.27 gives the editor a specific text box for exactly that purpose.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>By far my favourite bit is the focus on multi-monitor support, which has been a real nuisance at times. Looking forward to seeing that in action on both my Desktop and my often-docked Steam Deck. Hopefully now there will be less dancing around to get it to actually remember layouts.</p>
<p>As for when to expect the update? That all depends on what Linux distribution you use for Desktop Linux. For Steam Deck specifically, it will likely come in the next major SteamOS update.</p>

      <title>The new Vampire Survivors update is trippy and pulled me back in</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vampire Survivors is back with a brand new update that's real trippy, and also has a little Sonic flavour to it. If you don't hear from me for a week, it's because it's sucked me right back in. Send help.</p>
<p>I'll admit I completely burned out on Vampire Survivors for a while, especially because many other similar games have since come along that in various ways do things better (or just differently in a fun way). However, coming back to it now a few updates later and wow — there's absolutely tons of content in it to play through and unlock now.</p>
<p>Check out their insane new trailer below. Seriously, what madness:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="a9REb2CEzV0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1471c28223cb6b0177a40b0168afe1a2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/a9REb2CEzV0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The mostly spoiler free changelog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Contains:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3 new achievements.</li>
<li>1 new challenge stage.</li>
<li>2 new relics to get a new PowerUp and something special.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Tweaks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Items not necessary for the Queen Sigma unlock have a yellowish background color in Collection.</li>
<li>If you have at least 1M gold, the Eggman appears in Moongolow.</li>
<li>The game should remember the skins you've been using for each character.</li>
<li>"spoopyseason" spell should permanently unlock new skins for Mortaccio, Yatta Cavallo, Bianca Ramba, and O'Sole Meeo.</li>
<li>Added a team member to the credits.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Full patch notes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1794680/view/5662747178708901034" target="_blank">with spoilers here</a>.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/" target="_blank">find it on Steam</a>. It has a Native Linux port (although not advertised), and works great on Desktop Linux and Steam Deck. They're still working on their big game engine port, which they also previously mentioned would bring proper Linux support too.</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer - Part 25: Quantum Axcess </title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-24-mother-knows-best/" target="_blank">Part 24: Mother Knows Best</a></strong></p>
<p>Back when I first played through <em>Quake: The Offering</em> I found that I enjoyed the two mission packs even more than I did the original <em>Quake</em> campaign, and while <em>Scourge of Armagon</em> and <em>Dissolution of Eternity</em> were the only official sanctioned addons sold for <em>Quake</em>, several third party expansions and total conversions exist that also had retail releases. Two of these, <em>Shrak</em> and <em>Malice</em>, were published on CD-ROM in 1997 by Quantum Axcess. </p>
<p>While neither came with Linux specific instructions, the readme.txt file for <em>Malice</em> does at least describe how to get the game working under MacOS, which follows much of the same procedure. After inserting the CD-ROM you need to copy over the malice directory to your <em>Quake</em> installation, which by default can be found at /usr/local/games/quake on Linux. Once done all you need to do is launch <em>Quake</em> using the "-game malice" argument.</p>
<p>Setting up <em>Shrak</em> is more problematic, as the 16-bit MS-DOS application ST.EXE was included with <em>Shrak</em> to combine textures due to concerns over distributing id Software's intellectual property. On Linux this can be dealt with through DOSBox using the manual install instructions found on the <em>Shrak</em> FAQ page. An official update patch is also available for those owning the first CD-ROM pressing of the game. Once all is applied you can launch <em>Quake</em> using the "-game shrak" argument.</p>
<p><em>Malice </em>does introduce some new features that need to be bound to the keyboard using the console, a complete list of which can be found included as part of the MacOS instructions. If you are using OpenGL acceleration you should also delete your old meshes by removing the id1/glquake directory before launching to avoid artifacts. You must also ensure that you give write permissions to the malice and shrak directories to have save files work from your user account.</p>
<p>In addition, a lethal goof exists in <em>Malice</em> where the developers forgot to pack a parachute in the "The Underwater Base" level well into the campaign. The original suggestion from Quantum Axcess was to just to use the fly console command to cheat the level. A patch was later released that provides an alternate D8B.BSP map file, but this needs to be loaded from the console, and oddly enough provides a hoverboard rather than a parachute. It does still do the job at least.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19523804661672956347gol6.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19523804661672956347gol6.jpg"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/669924891675811054gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/669924891675811054gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>Like with the official mission packs, these total conversions show off a great deal more variety and inventiveness than was found in the main <em>Quake</em> campaign. Of the two <em>Shrak</em> is the more pedestrian, fitting in well alongside the other expansions, introducing a new villain much like Armagon. Even innovations such as the grappling hook and the friend maker are in line with experiments such as the "Horn of Conjuring" or the "Anti-Grav Belt" found in the sanctioned packs.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is why <em>Shrak</em> is the more forgotten, with it not even having all of its secret areas documented online until I put in the effort myself. It also has a number of rough edges, with <em>Shrak</em> reverting to showing the final briefing text from <em>Quake</em> at the end. <em>Malice, </em>on the other hand, is something else.<em> Malice</em> feels like if <em>SiN</em> were developed on the original <em>Quake</em> engine; ironic, considering <em>Scourge of Armagon</em> was the first retail product Ritual Entertainment produced.</p>
<p>You play a similar if more brain damaged protagonist, fighting the forces of a large megacorporation in a cyberpunk future. The maps are more dynamic than found in <em>Quake</em>, featuring scripted set pieces and even pilotable vehicles and probes. The enemies are largely hitscanners, most of your weapons now need to be reloaded, and both <em>Malice </em>and <em>SiN</em> even have pistols that can serve as your main reliable. All of this, as well as the bugs brought on by bloated ambition.</p>
<p>By abusing the demo feature in <em>Quake</em> they were even able to add cutscenes to <em>Malice,</em> although the CD music would often overwhelm the dialogue; both total conversions feature all new soundtracks which lean heavier on electronica. I also found while playing either <em>Malice</em> or <em>Shrak</em> that many of the switches would appear too dark when rendered through glquake.glx, but would look fine in software mode. <em>Malice</em> spouts garbage to the console when using OpenGL as well.</p>
<p>Quantum Axcess were far from the only distributor to dip their toes into the waters of unofficial <em>Quake</em> expansion content, with even the sequel <em>Quake II</em> seeing a number of companion CD-ROMs released for use alongside it. Some of those I intend to cover at some point, but I think I have had my fill of <em>Quake</em> again for now. Instead, I have found an old CD-R disc which I am curious to see if it can still be read after all these years. Time to move from rocket jumping to distro hopping.</p>

      <title>Gladiator battling deck-builder Alina of the Arena gets Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Alina of the Arena looks like a lot of fun if you love your deck-builders, and a recent update should make it a lot better on Steam Deck (and Desktops with a controller). Just recently it was given a Steam Deck Verified rating.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1668690/announcements/detail/3657521891367834743" target="_blank">update</a> from the developer was short, sweet and very much to the point simply noting it has Steam Deck and Controller support now.</p>
<p>With gameplay that's inspired by elements of Slay the Spire and Into the Breach, it ticks a lot of the right boxes for me so I'm looking forward to giving this one a go. You play as a gladiator that must fight for a bloodthirsty crowd to survive, building up a deck of powerful abilities was moving around a hex-based grid to defend and avoid attacks from various different types of enemies.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xqu3cCR_Ybk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ab277c6e67e88a8004734d669072df92.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xqu3cCR_Ybk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Dynamic Deckbuilding - Pick up dozens of cards, keep the ones you need, and craft a unique deck as you fight your way through randomized levels that present a different challenge each run!</li>
<li>Hex-based Tactics - Unlike traditional deckbuilders that focus on attack and defense, the tactics element adds a dimension of positioning. Dupe your enemies into attacking each other, or use the terrain to gain an upper hand.</li>
<li>Dual Equipment System - Carry equipment in both hands to enhance your cards! You can dual wield daggers for extra damage, go with a sword &amp; shield combo for rounded performance, or wreak havoc with a two-handed weapon. Figure out the best combination for each fight!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1668690/Alina_of_the_Arena/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Have plenty of free time? Check out the new Double Fine documentary</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have a lot of time free and love Double Fine games, especially Psychonauts 2? Good news, there's a multi-hour documentary now available.</p>
<p>Coming from 2 Players Productions, it encompasses six years and thousands of hours of footage cut down into an interesting little mini-series documentary about game development. Certainly worth a watch to get a bit more of the info behind the scenes. As described: "2 Player Productions and Double Fine Productions present Double Fine PsychOdyssey, an unprecedented documentary experience seven years in the making.</p>
<p>Ten years after the release of their flagship video game Psychonauts, Double Fine Productions returns to its most celebrated franchise with Psychonauts 2. Now facing the pressure to produce a worthy sequel, the studio must confront overly ambitious designs, poor morale, technical challenges and financial woes, all during a turbulent span of time for the world.</p>
<p>Double Fine PsychOdyssey is the direct continuation of the acclaimed series Double Fine Adventure, and offers even deeper insight into the passion, humor, and heartbreak of video game development."</p>
<p>Trailer below:</p>

<p>Watch the whole <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIhLvue17Sd70y34zh2erWWpMyOnh4UN_" target="_blank">series on YouTube</a>, it's also hosted on the <a href="https://archive.org/details/Double_Fine_PsychOdyssey" target="_blank">Internet Archive</a>.</p>
<p>It's long, like really long. Something to watch over a week perhaps?</p>

      <title>itch.io has a &#39;Trans Witches are Witches&#39; bundle that&#39;s raised over $90K</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://itch.io/b/1712/trans-witches-are-witches" target="_blank">The Trans Witches are Witches bundle</a> is live on itch.io featuring 69 items from various LGBTQ+ creators, aimed at rejecting "Hogwarts Legacy's bigotry". A good way for people to support creators if you're deciding not to pick up Hogwarts Legacy. </p>
<p>With it you get access to an assortment of games, game assets, zines, various TTRPG stuff and more. It costs $60 but they also have a separate <a href="https://itch.io/b/1713/trans-witches-are-witches-apprentice-edition" target="_blank">$10 version</a> too for people who don't have as much to spare.</p>
<p>One of the fun little standouts is <a href="https://magictrick.itch.io/magic-trick" target="_blank">Magic Trick</a>, "a skateboarding adventure game about community! As the new WizKid in town, perform magic using rad skating combos, explore the whimsical city, and socialize with your wacky new neighbors who could use more magic in their lives!".</p>
<p>Everything included is related to the magic world in some way, as the clear theme here is for magic fans who don't wish to support the new Hogwarts Legacy for various reasons, but the controversy hasn't stopped the game from becoming a huge seller on Steam and one of the all-time biggest releases. For those of you who don't understand what's going on and why the Harry Potter universe is problematic, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1iaJWSwUZs" target="_blank">this video</a> can shed some light on bits of it. The bundles have links to various issues with the Hogwarts Legacy game too.</p>
<p>The bundle runs until February 24th and has already raised over $90,000 with both versions of the bundle together.</p>

      <title>Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania releasing March 6th with new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania is shaping up to be the most exciting content expansion to Dead Cells yet and we don't have long to wait now as it's releasing March 6th. Are you as excited as I am? I might have to give the Netflix Anime a second run-through…</p>
<p>In the new trailer they said in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/588650/view/3655268188659289097" target="_blank">announcement</a> you're only seeing about "5%" of what it has to offer, and they'll have 51 of the original Castlevania tracks in this DLC, with 12 reimagined by their own musician in their Dead Cells style. Anyway, check out the first proper trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QBBwIHYm8Mw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/35a610ad00c10bb51497518ef4798e13.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QBBwIHYm8Mw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p style="text-align:start">What the DLC will come with:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Classic Weapons: </strong>Unlock 14 iconic weapons such as the Vampire Killer, Throwing Axe &amp; Holy Water to decimate Dracula's bestiary of monsters and finally the dark lord himself. Each item has been translated into the fast-paced combat of Dead Cells while keeping their original essence.</li>
<li><strong>Explore Dracula's Castle: </strong>Secret rooms. Flame-lit corridors. Gloomy tombs. Beautiful paintings. Food hidden in the walls. Full of original monsters from the series, such as harpies, werewolves &amp; haunted armors, the character of the iconic castle will transport you into the realms of gothic fantasy.</li>
<li><strong>Classic and Reimagined Music: </strong>We're giving you access to an alternative soundtrack made of 51 of the original Castlevania tunes, that can be heard across the entire game. Yes, 51! On top of this, we've taken the 12 most iconic tracks, such as Vampire Killer, Bloody Tears and Simon Belmont's Theme, and reimagined them in the style of Dead Cells as a soundtrack for this DLC, while preserving the Castlevania ambiance of course.</li>
<li><strong>A New Story:  </strong>Richter Belmont and Alucard will be by your side throughout your quest to vanquish Dracula, helping you to navigate the maze of Dracula’s Castle and providing you with strong weapons (sometimes willingly, sometimes not). However, where there is good there is evil, so watch out for powerful foes who will try everything in their power to stop you from reaching the throne room.</li>
<li><strong>Three Boss Fights: </strong>Fight against the very essence of evil in two intense duels versus Death and Dracula, both set against a majestic backdrop. If you can survive these gauntlets, prepare yourself for our most ambitious boss showdown yet...</li>
<li><strong>Castlevania Outfits: </strong>Unlock 20 outfits as you progress through the castle, letting you roleplay as all your favourite characters like Alucard, Richter Belmont, Simon Belmont, Maria Renard, Trevor Belmont, Sypha Belnades or even Dracula himself.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can buy Dead Cells from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/dead-cells?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/dead_cells?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/588650/Dead_Cells/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified (and really does work great).</p>
<p>Additionally, they've teamed up with Scorpion Masqué to do a real board game which will head to <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/scorpionmasque/dead-cells-the-rogue-lite-board-game" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> later this year.</p>

      <title>Neon-smashing one-button arcade game Ding Dong XL gets improved for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Released back in 2018, the one-button arcade game Ding Dong XL from Adamvision Studios that has an Overwhelmingly Positive Steam user rating gets upgraded ready for Steam Deck.</p>
<p>It already had a Native Linux version, so this was mainly the developer testing and ensuring it all looks and works well on the Steam Deck directly. They also noted only the 64bit Linux version was updated as they weren't sure if the 32bit build was even needed (it's really not).</p>
<p>Here's what they noted had changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Updated to a newer Unity Engine version.</li>
<li>Fixed a bunch of minor reported bugs.</li>
<li>Adjusted some particle effects to be less performance draining.</li>
<li>Added the internal leaderboards menu (and kept link to Steam full menu).</li>
<li>Updated the Adamvision logo splash, no more bright white screen, this is the future.</li>
<li>Made some changes to ensure compatibility on Steam Deck, tested and confirmed working great :).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Never played it before myself but certainly looks like one of those games I wouldn't be able to put down if I started it. Looks really easy to get into, see the trailer below:</p>

<p>After another short Beta period, Valve recently released another stable Steam Client update for Desktop and Steam Deck and here's what's new.

Some of the fixes are just cleaning up not sending people on Desktop to Steam Deck areas.</p>
<p>These are noted for the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3673284490061606420" target="_blank">Steam Deck changes</a>:</p>

      <title>Death Corp makes you an intern at the Grim Reaper&#39;s company</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Getting a job is tough but college graduate Art was lucky enough to catch the eye of the Grim Reaper. Hold on, does the Grim Reaper even have eyes? Currently in development with a full release planned early next year, some might recognise the artwork from Justin Wack and the Big Time Hack, with the animator on it now pursuing their own game with Death Corp.</p>
<p>More about it from the dev: "Let's start with an intern position...You play as Art, a young college graduate looking for his first serious job.

      <title>Surprisingly BioShock Infinite got an update to fix it launching on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just recently the Native Linux port of BioShock Infinite was updated to fix it failing to launch after an update.</p>
<p>As a quick reminder — back in September last year 2K <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/various-bioshock-games-get-a-2k-launcher-calling-it-a-quality-of-life-update/" target="_blank">updated various BioShock games</a> to have their own launcher, because we all know gamers love extra launchers don't they? The previous article lists workarounds for them on Linux but as a side-effect they also broke the old Native Linux version.</p>
<p>It's taken over five months to sort it but they finally released an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/8870/view/3641758659211388390" target="_blank">update</a> and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our last patch to BioShock Infinite on Steam was intended only for Windows but unexpectedly affected shared dependencies with the Linux version that made the game unplayable on some versions of Linux. We’ve since identified and fixed those conflicts and have verified those solutions addressed the issue in Linux (Ubuntu 22.10). We apologize for the inconvenience to our fans on Linux and appreciate their patience as we worked on a fix.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>I checked on it and the Native Linux port launches fine now on Fedora.</em></p>
<p>Nice to see they finally did something, even though you <em>could</em> workaround it with Proton. For some it seems the Native Linux version actually works better though. I'm just surprised they actually fixed it, I was half expecting them to just leave it and tell people to use Proton at this point.</p>

      <title>Like a Dragon: Ishin! gets Steam Deck Verified ahead of release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio and SEGA are bringing Like a Dragon: Ishin! to Steam, and the good news is that it is already Steam Deck Verified. Originally released back in 2014, this is actually a remake. This will released on February 21st, with people who pre-order the Digital Deluxe Edition getting early access on February 17th.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20039436271676043397gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20039436271676043397gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Centuries of peace are coming to an end. Across the nation, factions assemble in anticipation of civil war.<br/>
Imperial loyalists unite under the banner of “sonno joui”—revere the Emperor, expel the barbarians. They fight to overthrow Japan's military dictatorship and shut its borders to foreign influence.<br/>
Meanwhile, the ruling government, the Bakufu, has assigned special police forces to maintain order—provided they can manage to coexist without drawing blades on one another.<br/>
And in the capital city of Kyo, a man who will change the course of history seeks justice... and revenge.</p>
<p>Sakamoto Ryoma.</p>
<p>Accused of murdering someone he holds dear, this lowly samurai from a backwater land renounces his name and goes into hiding. To find the true killer's identity, Ryoma must conceal himself among the wolves of the infamous Shinsengumi.<br/>
Taking the alias Saito Hajime, it isn't long before he winds up embroiled in the political schemes and savage violence that will reshape the country—and give rise to legends.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the Steam Page:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8977419441676043064gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8977419441676043064gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured: The Steam Deck Verified notice from Steam.</em></p>
<p>Hopefully there won't be any issues at release and Valve has thoroughly tested it, as there is a small but growing list of Verified titles that really <em>shouldn't</em> be.</p>
<p>See the recent trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bh83wVDmUcI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/48600c2700b99c1df2d416cf18218728.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bh83wVDmUcI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A word of warning though, it's another game to come with the dreaded Denuvo, which can cause problems when switching between PC and Steam Deck, especially so if you mess with different versions of Proton as it can detect each as a new PC and end up locking you out of the game.</p>
<p>I'll admit something to you: I've not actually played any of the Yakuza / Like a Dragon games. Am I missing something big here?</p>
<p>You can get it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/like-a-dragon-ishin?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1805480/Like_a_Dragon_Ishin/" target="_blank"> Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Scan UK to offer SSD upgrades compatible with Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently the company Framework <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/framework-begin-offering-2tb-ssd-upgrades-for-steam-deck/" target="_blank">announced their plans</a> to supply people in the USA and Canada with 2TB SSDs compatible with the Steam Deck but for people in the UK, Scan may be a good option.</p>
<p>Scan have listed a <a href="https://www.scan.co.uk/products/1tb-sabrent-rocket-22x30-nvme-pcie-40-x4-m2-ssd-phison-3d-tlc-nand-4750mb-s-read-4300mb-s-write450k" target="_blank">Sabrent Rocket 2230 1TB NVMe</a>, which they plan to release on February 27th for £159.49 and you can pre-order it now. On their listing, they even mention Steam Deck as one of the compatible uses for the SSD, so it's good to see more stores begin to offer this tiny storage option.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21415279781676041029gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21415279781676041029gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Shopping around a bit, this does seem like a reasonable price as I've seen it going for quite a lot more across other stores. You could look to the likes of Ebay, AliExpress and more you never quite know what you're going to get (if they even turn up at all) so it's nice to see more legit sources with somewhat reasonable prices begin to show and over time we should see more of it, and see prices drop, just like we do with other types of SSDs.</p>

      <title>Steam Desktop and Steam Deck Beta reduces startup time, fixes more bugs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>More goodies for Steam Desktop and Steam Deck users on the Beta update branch, as another update is out now. Especially good for those of you who somehow have amassed tens of thousands of games.</p>
<p>I thought I was pushing it a bit with 2,600 but some people really have tens of thousands huh? How would you actually pick anything to play? I'm often paralysed by choice with what I have.</p>
<p>Anyway…here's what's changed for both:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">General</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="plain-list-title">Reduced startup time for users with tens of thousands of games in their library.</p>
</li>
<li>Fixed small movement of Virtual Keyboard when pressing shift in some themes.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Steam input</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="plain-list-title">Fixed issue where a Team Fortress 2 Steam Controller startup sound was missing.</p>
</li>
<li>Fixed some issues with Nintendo switch gyro drift calibration.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Desktop Mode</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="plain-list-title">Fixed Control-1/Control-2 hotkeys not working in Big Picture Mode (Linux specific).</p>
</li>
<li>Reverted back to old Game Info dialog that is accessible from the Friends List.</li>
<li>Fixed crash when opening Steam store.</li>
<li>Fixed Steam library becoming unusable after applying a controller configuration.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19745058081676040599gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19745058081676040599gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Shown: the New Big Picture Mode</em></p>
<p>While these changes seem specific to the Desktop Steam Client:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed crash on startup when an internal Steam browser window fails creation.</li>
<li>Added settings option to enable/disable UI sounds.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Valve promise a proper big Team Fortress 2 update is coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wait, what year is it? Someone pinch me, I must be dreaming. Valve announced a proper big update is planned and on the way for Team Fortress 2. Yes really.</p>
<p>It's so big they're claiming it's going to be a "full-on update-sized update". They skipped over announcing it on Twitter and instead decided to actually post an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/TF2/announcements/detail/3669906790333865368" target="_blank">announcement</a> on the TF2 Steam Page copied below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steam Workshop Creators, can we have your attention please. The following message is <em>so</em> urgent, <em>so</em> time-sensitive, we made the executive decision to skip TikTok and Twitter entirely and break the glass on the most bleeding-edge communication technology available.</p>
<p>Welcome to the future. Welcome… to a "blog-post".</p>
<p>"Wow!" you're probably thinking. "I forgot how hard reading is!" Yeah, it's scary how fast you lose that. Don't worry, we'll be brief:</p>
<p>The last few Team Fortress summer events have only been item updates. But <em>this</em> year, we're planning on shipping a full-on update-sized update — with items, maps, taunts, unusual effects, war paints and who knows what else?! Which means we need Steam Workshop content! YOUR Steam Workshop content!</p>
<p>So get to work! (Or back to work, if you were already working but got distracted when the entire internet simultaneously found out about this state-of-the-art blog-post.) Make sure to get your submissions into the Steam Workshop by May 1st, so they can be considered for this as-yet-unnamed, un-themed, but still very exciting summer-situated (but not summer-themed) (unless you wanted to develop summer-themed stuff) update.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally released in 2007, it remains as one of the most played games on Steam (over 100,000 on it right now), although it has seen various massive bot attack problems over the last few years that Valve attempted to address across a number of smaller updates. It's nice to see they're getting back on track here, after previously releasing a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/team-fortress-2-update-adds-vscript-and-you-can-now-run-linux-inside-it/" target="_blank">big scripting update</a> to make it more of a modders playground.</p>

      <title>Framework begin offering 2TB SSD upgrades for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have a Steam Deck and want to upgrade the internal storage? You're not alone and plenty already have, but getting one compatible isn't exactly easy so Framework have decided to jump in.</p>
<p>For those who don't know them, Framework made their name by creating the Framework Laptop, designed to last with components that can be easily swapped out and upgraded. Seems like quite a natural fit for them to offer up easy upgrades for other devices don't you think?</p>
<p>Writing on <a href="https://frame.work/gb/en/blog/now-offering-2tb-ssds-for-steam-deck-in-the-framework" target="_blank">their blog</a> they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You may be thinking “what?” but we spotted an interesting opportunity to enable upgrades on another popular consumer electronics product: the Steam Deck. We have the first batch of these available in the Marketplace today in the US and Canada, and are exploring stocking them for Europe and Australia as well. Unlike the 2280-sized M.2 SSDs that the Framework Laptop uses, the handheld Steam Deck relies on the physically smaller but less common 2230 format. As a result, it can be difficult to find legitimate sources for larger capacity drives like 2TB ones to load all of those games that you’re totally going to play someday. Since we order a huge number of Western Digital drives already, it’s relatively easy for us to add one more line item and stock 2TB SN740 2230 ones. You can follow the guide from our friends at <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Steam+Deck+SSD+Replacement/148989" target="_blank">iFixit</a> to perform the upgrade. You can also use these drives in many Surface laptops and tablets. We’re continuing to search for ways to help you with hard-to-find upgrades for other products, so let us know if there is anything we should focus on!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can find them in the US and Canada on <a href="https://frame.work/gb/en/products/western-digital-sn740-nvme-m-2-2230" target="_blank">their Marketplace</a>. For USA it's $299 and Canada it's $399.</p>
<p>If they do announce availability elsewhere like the EU / UK, I'll let you know.</p>

      <title>Thief-like stealth game The Dark Mod v2.11 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love the old first-person stealth game Thief? The Dark Mod was inspired by it and there's a new release out. Free, open source and a lot of fun to be had with many missions available to download.</p>
<p>While it is a game, it's also a complete toolkit for fans to make their own stealth missions and there's already <a href="https://www.thedarkmod.com/missions/" target="_blank">tons available</a>. Out of the box it doesn't really come with anything, except two example missions and a tutorial so it's up to you to seek out more content for it — although the built-in downloader can take care of that for you.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18380952251675954886gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18380952251675954886gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The developers mentioned version 2.11 is mostly about fixing up bugs, however some new features were sprinkled in too including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stealth Score and AI Alert behaviour was much improved.</li>
<li>Smoother transitions from climbing.</li>
<li>A multi-looting feature to grab multiple items at a time.</li>
<li>Performance improvements.</li>
<li>Improved graphics for shadows and volumetric lighting.</li>
<li>The Engine now supports Obj model format (good for modders).</li>
<li>GUI scripting has been overhauled with better syntax and error reporting.</li>
</ul>
<p>See the full release <a href="https://www.thedarkmod.com/posts/the-dark-mod-2-11-has-been-released/" target="_blank">announcement here</a>.</p>

      <title>The new System Shock remake demo runs surprisingly well on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After going through development hell and being long delayed, Nightdive Studios have put up a fresh demo of their System Shock remake that includes controller support and a new intro.</p>
<p>To actually play it on Linux / Steam Deck, you do need to go into the Properties -&gt; Compatibility menu and force Proton, as they've left up a seemingly old Linux launch config that's just empty and downloads nothing. It's unclear if they will still be doing a Native Linux version or not.</p>
<p>Giving it a run on Steam Deck and I was very surprised, I was expecting a game like this to really not perform well at all given that it's a demo of an unfinished game but even on Medium details for the most part it runs shockingly great. They still need to work on the new controller support some more, as the acceleration and sensitivity on thumb-stick is wildly off but it's a good start. Check out my video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="y4HxnEVoMf0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/36d8499035afe1167f54af6b109ed271.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/y4HxnEVoMf0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In regards to how it runs on Desktop Linux, testing it out also on Fedora 37 (KDE spin) it also runs there very nicely too on maximum settings. On both there's some shader cache stutter at certain points, but really it's not bad at all and at least on desktop the blips in framerate are tiny while it does it.</p>
<p>Still not sold on the game yet. While the world certainly looks nice and seems interesting, I'm going to need a lot more time with it. The combat, especially melee, felt quite poor and hard to judge when you're going to actually hit something.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7083330291675942147gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7083330291675942147gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured - System Shock on Fedora 37.</em></p>
<p>As long as you force it to Proton so it actually downloads, it seems you're good to go.</p>
<p>Find it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/482400/System_Shock/" target="_blank">on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Godot Engine 4.0 gets a first Release Candidate</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Game developers might want to begin to look closer at this one! The free and open source <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> is about to have the biggest update ever with 4.0 that now has a first Release Candidate. Since it's such a massive overhaul it would be close to impossible to list everything that has changed since Godot 3.x!</p>
<p>Just a small slice of what's actually new includes: Vulkan support, sky shaders, a big upgrade to their GDScript language, upgraded .NET for C# scripting, big improvements to importing and exporting assets, lots of improvements to accessibility within the game engine editor, AMD Fidelity FX Super Resolution (FSR) support, a volumetric fog effect was added, a new global illumination system, an improved and refreshed physics system and the list just keeps on going for quite some time.</p>
<p>Right now their focus is set firmly on fixing up issues and making sure it's truly release ready, so no more new features will be pulled in until Godot 4.1.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2531578531675873451gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2531578531675873451gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Godot 4.0 RC1 on Fedora Linux.</em></p>
<p>Hopefully the 4.0 release, and then 4.1 after will keep pulling more people over to this FOSS game engine, rather than getting stuck with proprietary lock-in from Unreal, Unity, Game Maker and other popular game engines.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/release-candidate-godot-4-0-rc-1/" target="_blank">their blog post</a> for more.</p>

      <title>Command &amp; Conquer - Combined Arms adds the start of a campaign mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Command &amp; Conquer - Combined Arms is a free and open source game pack made with the <a href="https://www.openra.net/" target="_blank">OpenRA</a> game engine, the bundles together forces from various classic Westwood RTS games including Allies, Soviets, Nod, GDI and the Scrin.</p>
<p>Bringing them all together with elements taken from Tiberian Dawn, Red Alert, Tiberian Sun, Red Alert 2 and Generals along with new units and support powers. It just had a big version 0.90 release that upgraded the OpenRA game engine used, along with the first part of their unique planned single-player campaign to play through.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19261743591675866301gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19261743591675866301gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - playing as the Scrin, Fedora Linux.</em></p>
<p>Highlights of what's new includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>First three chapters of single-player campaign (15 missions).</li>
<li>New sidebar/command bar UI.</li>
<li>Added MultiQueue lobby option (each production structure has its own queue).</li>
<li>Added CA music tracks via content download. Added missing Aftermath/Counterstrike music.</li>
<li>65 new maps, including all maps from RAGL seasons 12 and 13, and a bunch of team game maps.</li>
<li>Engine update (improved performance and many bug fixes).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1BiFYv1Zf2A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e09017fa6f6fd1cb052a90207cb13bc0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1BiFYv1Zf2A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I absolutely love this. OpenRA has done a huge service to the RTS gaming community and after growing up playing the likes of Tiberian Dawn, Red Alert I definitely appreciate it. Having all the sides together in such a way is quite fun too! Nice to see it continue to get even better.</p>
<p>Plus absolutely tons of smaller changes that can be seen on their <a href="https://github.com/Inq8/CAmod/releases/tag/0.90" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>The Callisto Protocol got a Steam Deck upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Callisto Protocol, the horror game that was inspired by Dead Space, has recently gained a hardcore mode and a dedicated Steam Deck upgrade too.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1544020/view/3671032056808752461" target="_blank">patch notes</a> they mentioned this for Steam Deck:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Updated font rendering and UI elements for readability.</li>
<li>Created a rendering functionality profile specifically for Steam Deck with the best settings for smooth gameplay.</li>
<li>Updated control schemes for SteamDeck controls.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So I decided to give it a re-look since it's had the above, plus a few other performance upgrades since the release that I was hoping would make it a better experience. Overall, it is a lot better than it was but it can still be a little on the problematic side. </p>
<p>It's not entirely clear what this "rendering functionality profile" even does. There's no special Steam Deck preset, and they're now hiding the benchmark mode specifically on Steam Deck too — which is just odd (it shows up normally on Fedora Linux on my desktop). It's now really close to being properly playable at 30FPS out of the box, still just not quite there but at least now it's somewhat enjoyable, as the drops it still has aren't as painfully dramatic as before.</p>
<p>You can see the full first chapter of the game on Steam Deck below:</p>

<p>It's possible that YouTube might end up putting it behind an age gate, so find the <a href="https://youtu.be/FifuHvPGLVw" target="_blank">direct video link here</a>. </p>

      <title>Zelda-lite classic Anodyne gets a much upgraded fan remake</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Anodyne from Analgesic Productions recently celebrated a <a href="https://blog.analgesic.productions/posts/2023-02-04-Anodyne-10th-Anniversary" target="_blank">10th anniversary</a>, and the community delivered in style with a full fan remake for modern platforms thanks to the previous source code release. The original is not open source but "source available", since it has a custom license with the new fan remake available under the same licensing.</p>
<p>More about it: "In this unique Zelda-lite game, explore and fight your way through surreal and creepy, nature, urban and abstract themed areas in the human Young's subconscious, evoked by a 16-bit-era visual style and a moody, dream-like soundtrack. Talk to bizarre characters and survive through Game Boy-styled dungeons, while hunting down mysterious keys and cards that will allow you to dive deeper into the dream world."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7816379491675858665gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7816379491675858665gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Anodyne Fan Remake on Fedora 37.</em></p>
<p>An overview of the changes in the Anodyne Fan Remake includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Render at 60 FPS using OpenGL, effects are done using shaders instead of CPU-side computation</li>
<li>Controller support
<ul>
<li>Switch Pro controller support needs Steam to be active to work correctly</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Indicator of currently selected broom in top left of the screen
<ul>
<li>Swapping between brooms doesn't require using the menu - PgUp/Dwn and controller shoulder buttons switch between them, 1-4 sets the current broom directly</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unopened chest indicator on minimaps on screens you've visited. No more searching for that one chest in the entire dungeon you missed</li>
<li>Minimap shows floor numbers for multi-floor dungeons</li>
<li>Return to entrance now returns you to the screen where you entered the dungeon (most notable in REDCAVE with its multiple entrances)</li>
<li>Several bugfixes for softlocks and non-essential glitches (wiggle glitch is still in, have fun!)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>With the changes, it can work nicely out of the box on modern systems instead of the ancient and unsupported Adobe tech. I've tested it working great on Fedora Linux (see screenshot above) and also working just fine on Steam Deck as well.</p>
<p>Here's a video of it in action on Steam Deck where just like desktop Linux it works great:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Y9z1QuPAe-k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4dcb184d093686c00b2dfbed7635f485.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Y9z1QuPAe-k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>Playing this in bed will really bring back memories of doing the same with the original Game Boy that I had. </em></p>

      <title>Point and click adventure Splittown gets a new Linux demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>Splittown is an upcoming point and click adventure about the Cold War, where the world is split in two and now there's a Linux demo. Their plan to release this was noted in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/point-and-click-adventure-splittown-linux-support/" target="_blank">a previous article</a>, where the developer reached out to me after for some pre-release testing and it was looking great!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cold War has split the world in two, both figuratively and literally. The Great Divide spans across the globe with an impenetrable mess of concrete and barbed wire sandwiched between the two blocs. You are Leonard Nimby; stone-faced former top agent of IM5, hot on the trail of a shrink gun stolen from you by a villanous mayoral candidate on the eve of a fateful election.<br/>
<br/>
Splittown is a point-and-click adventure game inspired by 90s classics such as Day of the Tentacle and Sam &amp; Max Hit The Road. You'll crack confounding puzzles, stuff improbable amounts of items in your pockets, and engage in humorous dialogue with a colorful cast of characters on an adventure that will push your wits to the limit.</p>

      <title>Interior Worlds is an upcoming weird spooky liminal space photography game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A slightly spooky and weird exploration game about taking snaps, Interior Worlds seems interesting and it's coming to Linux too. Speaking to the developer, they noted Linux support will come slightly after the Windows release.</p>
<p>I don't think I can even begin to properly describe this one so I'll leave it to the developer: "Welcome to Interior Worlds; an ambient and unsettling first-person exploration game where you'll dive into strange, yet familiar spaces. Temporary gaps and portals we cross at some point or another - now yearning for a closer look. A look that can only be seen properly through the lens of an SLR camera."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mSHPkTUvMSg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6d78c17789b60e22d9c1bc5ee85dc89a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mSHPkTUvMSg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Use your vintage and mysterious analog camera to capture stunning photographs of environmental anomalies throughout each space. Keep a sharp eye out while traversing the more... ominous locations.</li>
<li>Track and share your own in-game catalog of photos, timestamped and pre-filtered with subtle layers of maximum liminal crust.</li>
<li>Ten unique thresholds to traverse. A roadside hotel, empty movie theater, dying mall, and many more. Every environment is hand-crafted in a loving throwback to late 90's and early 00's graphics.</li>
<li>A multitude of ways to capture photos. Adjust zoom levels, increase/decrease lens focus, tilt left/right for a dutch angle, and more. Create perturbing compositions in hundreds of ways.</li>
<li>Unparalleled interactivity. Activate vending machines, phones, sinks, televisions, or simply turn the lights on or off for a different photo-moment vibe.</li>
<li>Immersive and unsettling soundscape. Melt into an eerie mix of low, rumbling drones and soft, stretched pads during the journey.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>What do you think? Something you might find interesting? </p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2207970/Interior_Worlds/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a> with a release coming in March.</p>

      <title>Trackmania is looking great on Steam Deck and Linux desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Trackmania has released on Steam recently and thanks to the recent Ubisoft Connect <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/steam-deck-linux-proton-7-0-6-ea-ubisoft/" target="_blank">fixes from Valve in Proton 7.0-6</a>, Trackmania works great on Steam Deck. It's free to play and has in-game purchases for the full content, however you can play rather a lot without spending a penny.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lCyUBmG40h4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5666bc06dd088a70f2b22b8ae0b29bb4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lCyUBmG40h4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For Desktop Linux users, I've also been testing it on Fedora and it works just great there too. At 1440p it will always stay above 60FPS on max details on my Ryzen 5800x + NVIDIA 2080Ti, most of the time at least ~90FPS but it does heavily depend on the map being played. Some maps are nothing on system resources, others can bring it down a fair bit.</p>
<p>A few dips when it needs to compile a shader that doesn't happen again on a second run, nothing too severe though. Overall, quite happy with the performance myself.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16655067461675792877gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16655067461675792877gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>This really does bring back some memories of playing the first game so long ago.</p>

      <title>Customizable platform fighter Fraymakers is out in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With some really slick animations, the customizable platform fighter Fraymakers has launched in Early Access on Steam with Linux support. It went into Early Access on January 19th that somehow I forgot about, even though I purchased it and played it — woops. I'm only human right?</p>
<p>Following the success of the Kickstarter that back in 2020 that gave them $364,922 in funding (before taxes and expenses ate into it that is), it's nice to see it out and so far it's showing plenty of potential. Some of the key selling points on this is the varied cast of indie game characters, along with the custom content creation system that you can easily download extras for in the Steam Workshop.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cW8oNo1hbmw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/72c8608223e4f193f97eafdb2d54e732.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cW8oNo1hbmw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Easy to pick up, hard to master</strong> - Fraymakers is designed to be friendly to new players and challenging and expressive for veteran players. You’re going to have a ton of fun whether you want a quick round with your friends or you’re looking to climb the leaderboards.</li>
<li><strong>Rollback Netcode</strong> - If you’ve been part of the fighting game community over the past few years, you know that rollback is the gold standard for fighting game netcode. We’ve prioritized and designed around rollback from the outset of development, meaning that Fraymakers will provide the smoothest possible online experience.</li>
<li><strong>Full Movesets</strong> - With over 80 animations per character, we've skipped nothing! Each character comes complete with every motion and attack you've come to expect from a platform fighter as well as some brand new techniques.</li>
<li><strong>Assists</strong> - Choose from a massive selection of indie characters to unleash an attack, fire a projectile, buff your character, or inflict a special status effect on your foes.</li>
<li><strong>...And Infinite Expandability!</strong> - We designed both the game and our custom content editor to be accessible and powerful. We want the process of creating your own content to be simple and fun. Whether you're a player or a creator, this means that the possibilities are endless.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's already a good amount of extra content being loaded up in the Steam Workshop, someone even added <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2928636648&amp;searchtext=" target="_blank">Trunks</a> from Dragon Ball Z which I naturally had to try out.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6471494231675790847gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6471494231675790847gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>So far at least on Desktop Linux (Fedora) it works quite well. Controller support is a little odd, as sometimes my controller needs a good minute and some button mashing before it's actually detected, and other times the vibration won't stop for a while. The usual expected Early Access release bugs. </p>
<p>Looks fantastic though, the official characters have some gorgeous style and animations done on them, I only hope the developers can keep up the progress on it now it has people wanting more.</p>

      <title>Colony builder Maia gets big optimizations, along with controller and Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A name I've not heard for a while that I seemed to miss some emails on recently. Colony building sim Maia, from developer Simon Roth, had a rather <em>big</em> upgrade. This is the first major update since early in 2021.</p>
<p>Some major new features were added to the game including: an entirely new mini-map system to let you get a glimpse of your colony, controller support and big optimizations to performance to help lower end devices like the Steam Deck.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="N0J-ykZbos8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e9d788102b19967902b0225a7b9b5aaf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/N0J-ykZbos8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some other changes includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a shader issue with AMD GPU driver support that was stopping the game from running for some users.</li>
<li>Pause button on keyboard now rebindable.</li>
<li>Fix for colonists trying to make small adjustments whilst running causing them to abruptly come to a half and then start running again.</li>
<li>Upgraded SDL support.</li>
<li>Objective flashing animation improved.</li>
<li>Rain textures and animation improved.</li>
<li>Grid simulation no longer shows invalid values on energy storage devices when the game is paused.</li>
<li>Lava simulation optimised and threading removed to prevent crashes. (Full lava rewrite postponed due to complexity)</li>
<li>Colonists will now prioritise the meteor pickups in the second level of the campaign.</li>
<li>Massively reduced the constraint iterations on the cloth simulations to improve CPU performance when the player has lots of flags.</li>
<li>Fix for incorrect light colour in Radiation Containment room.</li>
<li>Protobird sleep behaviour fixed to stop it running automatically into groom behaviour.</li>
<li>Capsules landing will no longer set the ground on fire if the ground is covered in snow.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>It has a Native Linux version but the developer recommended Proton (specifically GE-Proton) for playing on Steam Deck.</em></p>
<p>While the game has struggled over the years to find an audience, and deal with some of the more problematic parts of the AI, it's nice to see such an interesting take on a colony builder still continue to be improved many years later.</p>
<p>You can buy Maia on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/252250/Maia/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a> and also <a href="https://machinestudios.itch.io/maia" target="_blank">itch.io</a>.</p>

      <title>Star Wars Dark Forces source port The Force Engine adds Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Force Engine is a free and open source game engine reimplementation for Star Wars Dark Forces, with upcoming support of Outlaws. The latest release version 1.08 adds Linux support!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2173915321675772984gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2173915321675772984gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here's all that's changed in the 1.08 release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Changed "activated" to "toggle" to better match existing cheat messages.</li>
<li>Fixed a HOM issue in Executor.</li>
<li>Added a proper FPS counter which can be enabled in the graphics menu.</li>
<li>Renamed "energy" to "battery power".</li>
<li>Official Linux support added.</li>
<li>Updated the README with Linux build and run instructions.</li>
<li>Removed the unique 3DO model limit.</li>
<li>Fixed font rendering bugs (lack of language-specific symbols) due to using signed 8-bit characters instead of unsigned.</li>
<li>Dark Forces menu shortcuts now work correctly for different languages.</li>
<li>Fixed the Gamorrean Guard attack delay - they were attacking much more often than in vanilla.</li>
<li>Fixed the Sewer Creature attack and search delays, they were slightly longer than vanilla (meaning it attacked less often than it should have).</li>
<li>Midi selection in the Sound menu now works correctly.</li>
<li>The Escape menu now uses the correct palette, fixing issues with some languages and mods.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash when a WAX did not have the appropriate animation in certain areas of the AI code.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently it seems Linux users need to build it from source and the actual build instructions aren't in the readme, so I've asked if they can add more detailed instructions for people. Perhaps also someone can get it put up on <a href="https://flathub.org" target="_blank">Flathub</a> to make it even easier (and then get it simple on Steam Deck too).</p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://github.com/luciusDXL/TheForceEngine" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. You do need the data files which you can get from <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/star_wars_dark_forces" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>

      <title>Space looter-shooter EVERSPACE 2 set to launch on April 6</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>EVERSPACE 2 from ROCKFISH Games is ready to properly blast off on April 6th and it's looking mighty fine. I've been quite excited about seeing this one completed and I'll be taking a good look around the release or shortly after.</p>
<p>They've also said they're planning to release a free content update in the second half of 2023, and their team is also working on a major expansion for mid-2024. See the new trailer below:</p>

<p>For those of you waiting on the Native Linux version they said this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Linux (and Mac) support are still on track, with the aim to deliver this as close to the full release as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“EVERSPACE 2 has been, by far, our biggest and most ambitious project at ROCKFISH Games and a true labour of love over the five years it’s been in development, the last two of which in Early Access,” says ROCKFISH Games CEO Michael Schade. “With our release date revealed, we can see a light at the end of the tunnel where our amazing community and players all over the world new to the series will get to experience this adventure full of exciting, white-knuckle space combat and beautiful handcrafted deep space and planetside locations to explore. We’ve invested a hefty eight-digits budget into creating the game we’ve always wanted to make, and the team is now hard at work finaling and polishing all of our launch day content to perfection. Beyond the final chapter of the EVERSPACE 2’s story, there’s still a lot to see!”</p>
<p>While it's currently in Early Access, they will be raising the price. So if you've been after it waiting for the full release keep in mind the price will go up to $49.99 / £44.99 / €49.99 on February 20th.</p>
<p>EVERSPACE 2 is currently available on <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/everspace_2?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1128920/EVERSPACE_2/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer - Part 24: Mother Knows Best</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-23-ready-set-go/" target="_blank">Part 23: Ready, Set, Go!</a></strong></p>
<p>My mother's favourite game on Linux is without a doubt <em>Frozen Bubble</em>. It is a casual game in all of the best ways; one you can dive into and learn at your own pace thanks to its simple but repeatable formula. The stakes are never too high, with each level just being repeated until you beat it; the worst possible outcome being seeing a cartoon penguin cry over the fleeting loss of its igloo home. You will have them all jumping for joy again soon enough.</p>
<p>Searching online, I came across both the frozen-bubble-0.9.2-fr1.i386.rpm package alongside its perl-SDL-1.12-fr1.i386.rpm package dependency from freshrpms. I did try building the final 1.0.0 release from source, but it requires a newer version of SDL than is packaged for Red Hat Linux 7.3 which explains why no RPM packages were available. Consider this to be a snapshot in time back to 2002, from right before the game was to take the world by storm.</p>
<p>In terms of limitations it is hard to believe this was not the final release. The degree of polish on display with <em>Frozen Bubble</em> even at this early stage is already leagues ahead of most of its other contemporary free gaming fare. The game has its own unique identity, with a custom soundtrack, polar atmosphere, and recognizable characters. While the gameplay at its core may be a straight lift from <em>Puzzle Bobble</em>, it is in the implementation that <em>Frozen Bubble</em> excels.</p>
<p>One complaint I did have with <em>Frozen Bubble</em> over the years is how the blue and purple bubbles, as well as the yellow and green bubbles, can look very much alike to someone who is colourblind like myself. It was not until I was consulting the changelog that I discovered that a special option was included which makes the bubbles also contain geometric shapes, activated using the -cb launch flag. This did not come until the following 0.9.3 release of the game.</p>
<p>While appreciated, this solution does still comes across as bit of an underexposed hack. The situation is still far better than what I encountered with <em>Theocracy</em>, where I missed spotting the Teotitlans entirely on the province view map, as their cyan colour code was almost indistinguishable to the beige given to neutral non-aligned provinces. Version 0.9.3 also has <em>Frozen Bubble</em> remember to ask for your high score after completing all 50 levels, about the only other complaint I had.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16386212461675316432gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16386212461675316432gol6.png"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9582936901675318969gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9582936901675318969gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>The milestone 1.0.0 release of <em>Frozen Bubble</em> in 2003 would expand the game to have 100 levels as well as retooling the graphics and including a built-in level editor. Following that, the game would be rebranded as <em>Frozen Bubble 2</em> starting with the 2.0.0 release in 2006, with the final stable 2.2.0 version coming out in 2008. <em>Frozen Bubble 2</em> features the ability to play multiplayer over the network, as well as showcasing brand new 3D assets created with Blender.</p>
<p>Some work would continue on the game up until 2010, but from there the project became dormant. It was never ported to SDL2 or had support added for widescreen or modern high definition displays. <em>Frozen Bubble</em> did see a number of forks to allow it to run in a web browser, with both a Java and JavaScript version being produced by Glenn Sanson. Considering how often the title is to this day held as a standard bearer of Linux gaming, an update does seem to be in order.</p>
<p>I would also tweak the game's difficulty curve just a little. While skill does play a role, often a successful play is dependent on the order of bubbles you get fed to your launcher. With luck some levels are made ridiculously easy, while others can be near impossible. As a veteran of the game, my mother agrees with me that level 70 as still featured in the final release can kill your momentum dead, and should at the very least be moved to be the ultimate level. Food for thought.</p>
<p>In the years following its release <em>Frozen Bubble</em> would stay the darling of Readers' and Editors' Choice Awards from a wide variety of Linux publications and websites, owing much to its wide demographic appeal. Consider how the lead developer Guillaume Cottenceau was inspired to start work on the game because he remembered how the original <em>Puzzle Bobble</em> was one of the few games he would play with his sister. Or how much my mother loves the game.</p>
<p>This also gave <em>Frozen Bubble</em> the distinction of being one of the oddest of <em>Quake</em> killers. With the exception of <em>XBill</em>, which I suspect garnered favour for political reasons, the Readers' Choice Awards for the <em>Linux Journal</em> magazine had always been dominated by <em>Quake</em> games. Then <em>Frozen Bubble</em> wins in 2003 and goes on to hold the "Best Linux Game" title for all of the next eight years surveyed. I, on the other hand, do still feel the urge to play <em>Quake</em> again.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA Vulkan Beta 525.47.07 supports extension to help VKD3D-Proton DXR</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems like a future update of VKD3D-Proton that translates Direct3D 12 to Vulkan for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a>, for Windows games on Linux desktop and Steam Deck, will make use of a newer extension available in the new NVIDIA Vulkan Beta 525.47.07 release.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" target="_blank">release notes</a> for the new NVIDIA driver:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New:
<ul>
<li>VK_EXT_pipeline_library_group_handles</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Vulkan Video driver experiments:
<ul>
<li>Internally synchronize the picture VkVideoSessionParametersKHR while during parameter updates with vkUpdateVideoSessionParametersKHR</li>
<li>Allow for Picture Parameters like StdVideoH264PictureParameterSet, StdVideoH264SequenceParameterSet, StdVideoH265SequenceParameterSet, StdVideoH265PictureParameterSet and StdVideoH265VideoParameterSet to be optionally passed within vkCmdBeginVideoCodingKHR() and/or vkCmdDecodeVideoKHR() within VkVideoSessionParametersUpdateInfoKHR as an inlined extension structure</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixes:
<ul>
<li>Ignore VkPipelineColorBlendStateCreateInfo.pAttachments when all state is dynamic</li>
<li>Fix an issue with the video session picture parameters creation where the max PPS/SPS/VPS size is set to 1</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>open-gpu-kernel-modules release:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/releases/tag/525.47.07" target="_blank">https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/releases/tag/525.47.07</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>When you look into what that new extension does the <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_pipeline_library_group_handles.html" target="_blank">documentation</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When using pipeline libraries in ray tracing pipelines, a library might get linked into different pipelines in an incremental way. An application can have a strategy where a ray tracing pipeline is comprised of N pipeline libraries and is later augumented by creating a new pipeline with N + 1 libraries. Without this extension, all group handles must be re-queried as the group handle is tied to the pipeline, not the library. This is problematic for applications which aim to decouple construction of record buffers and the linkage of ray tracing pipelines.</p>
<p>To aid in this, this extension enables support for querying group handles directly from pipeline libraries. Group handles obtained from a library <strong>must</strong> remain bitwise identical in any <code class="inline-code">VkPipeline</code> that links to the library.</p>
<p>With this feature, the extension also improves compatibility with DXR 1.1 AddToStateObject(), which guarantees that group handles returned remain bitwise identical between parent and child pipelines. In addition, querying group handles from COLLECTION objects is also supported with that API.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key point being the last paragraph, making it able to more closely match with DirectX Ray Tracing (DXR) does. VKD3D-Proton added in support for it just <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/commit/6f56e02354622b28041f8baaa2e201c950c0f7f5" target="_blank">recently</a> too. Seems like support for this extension is not yet in the Mesa drivers for Intel and AMD just yet.</p>

      <title>Gorgeous puzzler Bonfire Peaks getting a 3-part DLC starting March 2nd</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Easily one of the best puzzle games to release back in 2021 and frankly it's criminally overlooked (only 140 use reviews on Steam?!), is set to get a whole lot bigger with the Lost Memories 3-part DLC. <em>The gorgeous blocky-voxel world with great lighting and bite-sized puzzles won me over easily.</em></p>
<p>The first part of this DLC releases March 2nd, and the developer said it's already around one quarter the size of the original game, so it's going to have quite a bit in it and the 2nd and 3rd parts are under development. Each part will bring entirely new puzzles and game mechanics to go along with it so it should be real interesting to see what they have cooking up.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="C4aYKw0ae2M"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4e07d8bc1d84e09f298009ba3a66a383.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/C4aYKw0ae2M" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Created by Pipe Push Paradise and Hiding Spot developer Corey Martin, co-designed with Alan Hazelden (Draknek), and with art by Mari Khaleghi and Zach Soares. If you want a good puzzle game, look no further, seriously it's wonderful and you'll have a bit of time to complete it before the DLC releases.</p>
<p>The full game is currently available via <a href="https://coreymartin.itch.io/bonfire-peaks" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1147890/Bonfire_Peaks/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

<p>All your base are belong to us. Toaplan are having some absolute classics revived including Zero Wing, Out Zone, Twin Cobra and Truxton with a PC release and enhancements. Oh, and Native Linux support to ensure they're great on Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>Working with Bitwave Games, they've confirmed to me Native Linux support is a go for the release on February 14 for all of the games in this first collection. Well, <em>Native</em> being an interesting word to use because it's clearly old games with emulation but you get the idea — they're ensuring it all works properly including the enhancements within it and it's all set up correctly.</p>
<p>Some true classics too! Zero Wing was one of the few full-games I had on SEGA Mega Drive when I was younger and that intro scene stuck with me forever.</p>

<p>Some of the enhancements includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Minimal Input Lag: Emulation, input processing, and rendering all complete on the same frame.</li>
<li>Quick Save using F1-F10, Reload with Shift+ F1-F10.</li>
<li>Online leaderboards for Single Credit, No Assist, and Assisted plays.</li>
<li>Instrument panels with extra gameplay information and artwork.</li>
<li>Rewind the game between 10-18 minutes, depending on the action.</li>
<li>Capture sharable replays to immortalize your interstellar victories (or funny moments).</li>
<li>Assist Features such as auto-fire at multiple rates.</li>
<li>Very Easy Mode: Lower the difficulty to breeze through the adventure.</li>
<li>Pixel perfect or full-screen scaling in windowed or full-screen mode.</li>
<li>Rotate the gameplay in 90-degree increments.</li>
<li>Steam Achievements.</li>
<li>Choose between Raw Input on Windows or Steam Input.</li>
<li>Hone your skills in the ultra customizable practice mode!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Superfluous Returnz is an unnecessary video game of a useless superhero</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>French comedy point and click adventure Superfluous Returnz is all about a useless superhero and it's releasing on May 15th. Coming with Native Linux support, I must admit one particular scene in the trailer made me laugh a bit, probably more than it should have.</p>
<p>An interesting thing about this one, is that it has a free and open source game engine made for it too named <a href="https://framagit.org/Gee/sosage" target="_blank">Sosage</a> (Superfluous Open Source Adventure Game Engine).</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8-ksx13Q84A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ae9d0e5b0e77c5d62d80145a9b812f40.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8-ksx13Q84A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>The action takes place in Fochougny, a very quiet French village where billionaire Harpagon Lonion resides. He regularly disguises himself as Superfluous, a very useless superhero in such a peaceful countryside ...</p>
<p>Helped by his assistant Sophie, who tries to somehow temper the enthusiasm of his employer, he will try to apprehend the mysterious apple thief who is terrorizing the orchards of Fochougny ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Immerse yourself in a colorful universe in the style of a 2D cartoon.</li>
<li>Wander quietly through the village of Fochougny, an open world.</li>
<li>Solve puzzles, pick up items, combine them, talk to people from Fochougny to try to figure out what happened.</li>
<li>Play with the mouse in the best tradition of point-and-click games, or choose gamepad or keyboard controls.</li>
<li>Enjoy finely cut dialogues and omnipresent humor (the quality of the jokes is non-contractual).</li>
<li>Relax playing a game where you can't lose, die or get stuck (but where you can to tear your hair trying to solve some puzzles - hair implants are not provided).</li>
<li>Text dialogues available in English and French.</li>
</ul>

      <title>touchHLE is a new emulator for iPhone OS apps</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want a way to emulate old Apple iOS apps and games? Well, <a href="https://github.com/hikari-no-yume/touchHLE" target="_blank">touchHLE</a> just had its first release to prevent some more things being lost to time.</p>
<p>Platforms change and move on, often cutting off what came before. We've seen it time and time again with games consoles and with iOS being the closed platform it is plenty will get lost from it too. Perhaps not so much now if projects like touchHLE can keep advancing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>touchHLE is a high-level emulator (HLE) for iPhone OS apps. It runs on modern desktop operating systems, and is written in Rust.</p>
<p>As an HLE, touchHLE is radically different from a low-level emulator (LLE) like QEMU. The only code the emulated CPU executes is the app binary and a handful of libraries; touchHLE takes the place of iPhone OS and provides its own implementations of the system frameworks (Foundation, UIKit, OpenGL ES, OpenAL, etc).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently it doesn't seem to have fully working Linux support, and it has been a solo effort so far but now it has a release up and it's available on <a href="https://github.com/hikari-no-yume/touchHLE" target="_blank">GitHub</a> I'm sure it won't be long until someone else hacks away at it to get Linux support into shape.</p>
<p>Right now their main goal for the project is to support the earlier days of iOS like iPhone OS 2.x and mainly later 32bit versions with modern 64bit apps a non-goal and unlikely to be prioritised due to the complexity of it.</p>
<p>You can see their example video below:</p>

      <title>Open source Transport Tycoon Deluxe remake OpenTTD v13.0 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another classic free and open source game continues getting better, with the Transport Tycoon Deluxe remake OpenTTD version 13.0 out now. A business sim where you make money by  transporting passengers and cargo via road, rail, water, and air.</p>
<p>Only a few months since the last major update, it's nice to see development so active on a quality game! This is also one of the biggest updates they've done for some time.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18777525491675686917gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18777525491675686917gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here's the highlights of what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Variable interface scaling at whatever size you want (not just 2x and 4x), with optional chunky bevels for that retro feel. This includes better automatic scaling when using HiDPI or mixed DPI setups.</li>
<li>Direct access to NewGRF/AI/GS settings from the new game window.</li>
<li>Various small tweaks and improvements to several windows.</li>
<li>NewGRFs can now provide engine variants that are shown hierarchically in the purchase list.</li>
<li>Multi-track level crossings to keep road vehicles from stopping in the middle of the crossing.</li>
<li>Custom league tables for GameScripts.</li>
<li>More natural rivers which get wider as they flow downstream.</li>
<li>And much more including lots of bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm definitely looking forward to the scaling options, now being on a 1440p monitor. </p>

      <title>Handshakes is a free sokoban puzzler about two hands meeting</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sometimes a good firm handshake is what's needed and someone decided to turn that idea into a free puzzle game with Handshakes.</p>
<p>Released back in January, this delightful little puzzler has 30 levels of arm-stretching that ranges from easy at the start up to palm-sweaty brain-teasingly difficult. Always playful though, I ended up cutting off one of my hands in some levels — woops. A genuine delight to randomly come across when looking for something new to play through. It won't take you too long to beat unless you're an idiot like me.</p>
<p>It's clever, because you're controlling multiple hands that need to meet, and you need to push boxes out of the way, open doors and more. Simple ideas but wonderfully made, what a gem.</p>

<p>It gets a firm shake from me.</p>
<p><em>Lots of people seem to like this one too with an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam!</em></p>
<p>Go shake some hands over on <a href="https://petpumpkin.itch.io/handshakes" target="_blank">itch.io</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2171690/Handshakes/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has a Native Linux version too.</p>
<p>The developer is also making an expanded version now too named <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2245130/Handshakes_Hands_On/" target="_blank">Handshakes: Hands On</a> that will have lots of new levels and plenty of new game mechanics to tickle those fingers with.</p>

<p>For the free update named The Jailhouse, they said it will include quality of life improvements including changes to guard behaviour, improvements to quick build materials, a small makeover of the deployment scheduler and the addition of Toby, a Yorkshire Terrier dog. The update also re-balances the Identity Thief reputation and other in-game effects.</p>
<p>As for the DLC here's what you can expect from it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>It’s a prison, in a jungle! - </strong>Enjoy some wooden furniture, five new flooring types (one specific for water!), one outdoor cinema plus new walls and doors: all is set to thrive in the jungle.</li>
<li><strong>Tropical fever (and how to survive it) - </strong>Tropical fever can spread among inmates. Luckily, you can fight and manage it with netted beds, fire pits, and a new, cutting-edge medical program.</li>
<li><strong>A different environment - </strong>In the jungle, you will find new trees, which you can farm and sell, or chop down for lumber. Some wood variants for guard towers, drains, etc. are also available.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Inspired by the classic SimTower, build up high with Property Pro</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Property Pro is an upcoming game from SimDevs, with an aim to capture the classic feel of SimTower from the 90s. With a hint of the character styling from Prison Architect and RimWorld, the idea sounds good.</p>
<p>You'll get to build a properly from scratch or purchase a used one, which may came with a whole bunch of hidden issues you need to deal with. Lots of different types of rooms to build, special guests, surprise inspects and many other challenges are planned to be included.</p>
<p>See some screenshots below, click them to make them bigger:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16210584961675428759gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16210584961675428759gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12879636771675428761gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12879636771675428761gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Writing on <a href="https://twitter.com/SimDevs/status/1618340598624440322" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, the developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As a child, I was captivated by SimTower even though I didn't fully understand how to play the #game. Now that I'm older, my goal is to recreate what it felt like playing the game from those cherished memories.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>That really spoke to me, I remember enjoying what little of it I understood back then too…</em></p>
<p>Seems like it's worth keeping an eye on, if you love management style games.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1721000/Property_Pro/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>. It will have Native Linux support just like their previous game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/810590/Area_86/" target="_blank">Area 86</a>.</p>

      <title>Going to live my dream of Fifth Element flying cars in MiLE HiGH TAXi</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Remember the classic sci-fi movie Fifth Element? I sure do and I only watched it <em>again</em> recently, where memories came flowing back of how I used to want those flying cars. Well, one game developer clearly loved it too and they're soon releasing MiLE HiGH TAXi.</p>
<p>The developer mentions it shouldn't take players long to get to grips with the controls, and you can expect a "pulse-pounding ride" where you'll "encounter a cast of hilarious and chatty pedestrians, as well as impatient and over-the-top passengers" as you try to avoid all sorts of obstacles.</p>
<p>It's a mixture of Crazy Taxi, with mechanics inspired by Fifth Element and I honestly can't wait to try it out. Created by solo dev Cassius John-Adams, it's looking impressive as you'll see in the below trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Xzs46WdaMkg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b0a20d05eef4f561a76f6edaa9f54f23.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Xzs46WdaMkg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It has a few different game modes too:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In regular mode, strategize to pick up and drop off passengers in efficient ways, maximizing your earnings and extending your game time and career.</li>
<li>In Challenge mode, you'll face increasingly difficult challenges as you deliver passengers sequentially to level up.</li>
<li>In Free Roam mode, you'll be able to explore the city with no time limits or passenger pickups, discovering hidden shortcuts and other secrets as you go.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer plans to release it on March 13th, with Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified ahead of release.</p>
<p>Follow it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1366560/MiLE_HiGH_TAXi/" target="_blank">on Steam now</a>.</p>

      <title>Nordic Ashes: Survivors of Ragnarok is a Norse inspired horde survival rogue-lite</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nordic Ashes: Survivors of Ragnarok is yet another survivor game in the spirit of Vampire Survivors, except this has a Nordic theme to it and it's now on Steam with Native Linux support. It's also Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>The developer sent a copy to my Steam Curator and I've been playing it a fair bit since I love these <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/a-genre-is-born-horde-games/" target="_blank">horde games</a>, and being a huge <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/my-game-of-the-year-2022-is-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Brotato</a> fan I was keen to see more variations on it. </p>
<p>Here it's has the similar mechanics of running around an arena, collecting things from enemies to level up and buffing up your character. However, unlike most others in the genre, it's not about building up a big assortment of weapons to unleash hell on your screen. Nordic Ashes is a bit more tame, with more of a focus on surviving and boosting your main weapon.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21252723791675357208gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21252723791675357208gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Runs great out of the box on Fedora Linux.</em></p>
<p>As you go through each map you level up, upgrade skills and when you die or finish a level there's some meta-progression to on the legendary Norse tree Yggdrasil but building that up can take quite a few hours of grindy gameplay. This is a lot more based on movement skill to avoid enemies and carefully picking your upgrades, compared with trying to be a truly overwhelming force like other similar titles where half the screen is covered by special effects. To some it might be better, but if you're really into the insane over-the-top action of the other titles this may not be for you. But for a somewhat slower and calmer experience it may be a good match.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore the 9 Realms, each of them based on a world connected by Yggdrasil, the legendary Norse Tree.</li>
<li>Different characters, with exclusive abilities and weapons depending on their role.</li>
<li>Constellation Ability Trees to upgrade your survivor’s powers.</li>
<li>Design the most powerful builds.</li>
<li>Bosses with their own behaviours to make battles more epic.</li>
<li>Dozens of Relics to unlock.</li>
<li>Yggdrasil upgrades as a meta-progress.</li>
<li>Exclusive Early Access skins!</li>
<li>Play using mouse &amp; keyboard or controller.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Sports management / visual novel mash-up Roller Drama is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I don't play many visual novels (mostly a whole zero) but I do love when games sprinkle it in with other things like the sports management game Roller Drama. The game is certainly inspired and looks a lot like Roller Derby but it's not a simulator of it, and the actual gameplay is quite different according to the developer.</p>
<p>Set in a dystopian alternative world "where things are going… slightly worse than they are here", you watch as personal dramas rage on, manage matches and players and much more.</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Interactive narrative with meaningful choices (almost 100!) and multiple endings.</li>
<li>Vivid, explorable universe.</li>
<li>Replayable narrative and matches: every championship is unique, several different endings.</li>
<li>Replay a specific chapter.</li>
<li>Real-time roller derby matches.</li>
<li>Coach a team of five athletes with wildly different personalities.</li>
<li>Hand drawn character art by award winning illustrator Vic Macioci.</li>
<li>Play with controller or mouse + keyboard.</li>
<li>Cloud saves.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Zoom Platform, a store aimed at &#39;Generation X&#39; adds more Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One I've been meaning to point out for a while now is <a href="https://www.zoom-platform.com/" target="_blank">Zoom Platform</a>. A games store that tries to appeal to "Generation X" with both new and classic games, DRM-free and they're continuing to build up their Linux support.</p>
<p>They don't have a whole lot available for Linux Native fans right now, with 26 titles currently tagged as supported including Sensible World of Soccer 96-97, Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition, Judge Dredd and more but they're continuing to build it up.</p>
<p>Recently they <a href="https://www.zoom-platform.com/news/new-updates-2023-01-07" target="_blank">updated</a> a bunch of Duke Nukem titles that use DOSBox, to work better with both the DOSBox and DOSBox-X flatpaks and over the last few months they've added more titles. Just recently, they also added Linux support for Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty, noting on <a href="https://twitter.com/ZOOMPlatform/status/1620784072980299776" target="_blank">Twitter</a> a goal of theirs is to "support Linux as much as we can".</p>
<p>It's interesting to see a store that tries to appeal to the slightly older generation of gamers. As much as <a href="http://gog.com" target="_blank">GOG</a> tried to in the past, they've long since moved their focus much more onto modern releases. So perhaps some older readers might want to keep an eye on Zoom Platform.</p>

      <title>Dwarf Fortress made over $7 million in January</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Something that's completely deserved of course. The Dwarf Fortress developers shared that the game made over $7,230,000 in January.</p>
<p>The news was shared on the <a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf//index.php?topic=181354.0" target="_blank">official forum</a> in their latest monthly report. They do make it clear, that they don't get to keep all of that as a bit less than half "will go to taxes" and they have to pay people, they have all the usual business expenses and so on but of course they will still get a lot of money from it overall. Enough that they've " solved the main issues of health/retirement that are troubling for independent people, as well as safeguarded the future of the game".</p>
<p>How much they made over the last few months:</p>
<ul>
<li>January: $7,230,123.58.</li>
<li>December: $15,635.07.</li>
<li>November: $14,071.27.</li>
<li>October: $15,374.72.</li>
<li>September: $14,679.51.</li>
</ul>
<p>While it's amazing to see and fully deserved, this isn't exactly the kind of success a lot of indie teams can reproduce though. They have a lot of unique factors at play here including putting it out free for many years before their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/" target="_blank">Steam</a> release, which had numerous upgrades like the official graphics along with the health problems the developer faces which no doubt has spoke to hearts of many people.</p>
<p>If you've been playing it, how many hours have you sunk into it since the Steam release? It's playable with Proton but a Native Linux port is <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/dwarf-fortress-releases-december-6-on-steam-and-itchio-native-linux-support-later/" target="_blank">planned</a>.</p>

      <title>AMD reveal prices and availability for Ryzen 7000X3D CPU series</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AMD has now revealed how much you can expect to be poorer by when picking up one of the new 7000X3D CPUs, along with release dates. The details were announced on Twitter and are:</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Available February 28</p>
<ul>
<li>Ryzen 9 7950X3D - $699</li>
<li>Ryzen 9 7900X3D - $599</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Available April 6</p>
<ul>
<li>Ryzen 7 7800X3D - $449 </li>
</ul>
<p>Good news for those of you with an up to date motherboard too, as AMD continue to mention how it's a drop-in replacement for AM5 motherboards with a BIOS update so no need to go out and buy another board. When it comes to cooling, they recommend at least a 280mm all-in-one liquid cooler for the best performance. </p>
<p>They also released a video about it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FLxH9ivPWUI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/119109261dbe7dbb581ea19c71c62a0c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FLxH9ivPWUI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I really absolutely don't <em>need</em> one since I have an AMD Ryzen 5800X but I sure do <em>want</em> one. </p>

      <title>Ubisoft just broke their games on Linux desktop and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 21:17</strong>: Looks like Proton developers have updated the "bleeding-edge" Beta for Proton Experimental, that works around the issue. Note: using it can cause other issues, the Beta doesn't have a lot of testing, you've been warned.</p>
<p>If you go into the Properties on Proton Experimental in your Steam Library, and opt into the "bleeding-edge" Beta, then set your Ubisoft games to use Proton Experimental it will fix it for now until a proper Proton update is out. </p>
<p><strong>Update 22:11</strong>: Valve released a Proton Experimental (no Beta needed) fix for this.</p>
<hr/>
<p><u><em>Original article below</em></u></p>
<p>Third-party launchers on Steam are once again being a massive nuisance. First it was EA breaking everything on Linux and Steam Deck and now it's Ubisoft telling everyone to hold their beer.</p>
<p>Valve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/proton-experimental-upgraded-to-fix-the-ea-app-failing-to-update-on-steam-deck-a-linux/" target="_blank">fixed the EA App</a> in Proton after a while, and it's likely we're going to need to wait on a fix from Valve again for whatever Ubisoft changed in the latest Ubisoft Connect update.</p>
<p>When you go to launch any game on desktop Linux or Steam Deck that uses Ubisoft Connect, it will do an update and then you'll be greeted with this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5117776381675266378gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5117776381675266378gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>That picture above is from my Fedora Linux desktop trying Ghost Recon Breakpoint today.</p>
<p>After testing The Division 2, Watch Dogs Legion, Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Ghost Recon Breakpoint on my Steam Deck too, they all also gave the exact same problem as you'll see in the screenshot below from my Steam Deck:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7110715951675266489gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7110715951675266489gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>So it seems that every title that uses Ubisoft Connect, is now left broken on Linux desktop and Steam Deck. This comes only <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/ubisoft-fixed-the-division-2-on-steam-deck-and-linux-desktop/" target="_blank">two weeks after</a> Ubisoft fixed The Division 2 for Steam Deck / Linux. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/fix-ghost-recon-breakpoint-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Breakpoint still needs manual fixes</a>.</p>
<p>Why do developers and publishers keep forcing these absolutely useless third-party launchers on us? Never once have I, or anyone I've spoken to, actually wanted them. They only ever cause problems and solve basically nothing that Steam cannot already do directly.</p>
<p>I've logged an official <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6498" target="_blank">bug report</a> with Valve and notified their developers about it.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 22:13</strong>: In addition to the below, Valve did another Proton Experimental update after some recent Ubisoft Connect <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/ubisoft-broke-their-games-on-linux-desktop-and-steam-deck/" target="_blank">breakage I highlighted</a> that includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fix 2K launcher failure caused by launcher update.</li>
<li>Fix Ubisoft Connect launcher failure caused by launcher update.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Valve has released an update to two different versions of their Windows compatibility layer for Linux desktop and Steam Deck with Proton Hotfix and Proton Experimental seeing small updates. Here's what's new.</p>
<p><em>If you're confused on what Proton is, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">check out my beginner's guide</a>.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Now playable: Forspoken, Samurai Maiden.</li>
<li>Improve sleep/resume functionality on Steam Deck for Tiny Tina's Wonderland.</li>
</ul>
<p>For <strong>Proton Hotfix</strong>, Valve's Pierre-Loup Griffais said on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1620567410205130752" target="_blank">Twitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Proton Hotfix change has just been deployed to fix an issue where the Dead Space save screen thumbnail wouldn't appear properly. We're not aware of any remaining issues with the game but are continuing to monitor reports.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Changelog can be found <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>In a follow-up tweet asking for clarification Griffais <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1620587750587252736" target="_blank">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of those changes were improvements to our DX12 implementation to better support usage patterns we hadn't seen before.</p>
</blockquote>

      <title>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past gets a reverse-engineered clone</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, the 1991 classic from Nintendo has been reverse-engineered to bring it natively to more platforms. Nintendo are no doubt warming up their lawyers. Available on <a href="https://github.com/snesrev/zelda3" target="_blank">GitHub</a> under the MIT license, it notes the game is fully playable from start to finish and it does need the original ROM for the resources, so it doesn't include the copyrighted assets.</p>
<p>Some extra features were added too including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Support for pixel shaders.</li>
<li>Support for enhanced aspect ratios of 16:9 or 16:10.</li>
<li>Higher quality world map.</li>
<li>Support for MSU audio tracks.</li>
<li>Secondary item slot on button X (Hold X in inventory to select).</li>
<li>Switching current item with L/R keys.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Looks like it's supported to run it across Linux, macOS and Windows too!</p>

      <title>elementary OS 7 &#39;Horus&#39; is out now with major AppCenter upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>elementary OS, probably one of the absolutely slickest looking Linux distributions around, has released version 7 with some major upgrades.</p>
<p>According to the Founder and CEO, Danielle Foré, the previous release saw downloads hit over 400,000 and that's not counting third-party downloads or torrents that don't use their downloads page. Some impressive numbers.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20058983841675254487gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20058983841675254487gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>elementary OS 7 screen - credit to the elementary OS team</em></p>
<p>elementary OS 7 saw a lot of working going into the AppCenter, their first-party application for installing and updating software. It's quite unique, as it offers developers a pay what you want model to put up applications for users, something they seem to be quite successful with.</p>
<p>The new release overhauls the likes of app descriptions, easier updates, upgrades to side-loading and alternate stores, improved responsiveness of the AppCenter itself, rewritten navigation and lots more. One major change is how they handle installing from other sources, instead of showing a warning message it will now show the app in AppCenter with a clear icon and note that it's not curated by them.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17022305351675254762gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17022305351675254762gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Some more of what's new includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>GNOME Web 43 with support for creating web apps.</li>
<li>Big improvements to their Feedback app to make it easier to use.</li>
<li>A simpler to use OS installer with less screens to click through.</li>
<li>Their onboarding welcome app now lets you configure automatic updates.</li>
<li>Their email app Mail now has a "more-modern, flatter design" as a final step to make it more responsive.</li>
<li>A redesign of Printer settings.</li>
<li>A complete rewrite of their Music app.</li>
</ul>
<p>The developers noted performance has been a focus for this release too and in "just about every section" they could have written about performance. They've spent a fair amount of time looking into slowdowns, reworking old code and optimizing everything they possibly could.</p>
<p>Lots more in the <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/os-7-available-now/" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>
<p>Really looking good! I've always been impressed by the design of elementary OS 7.</p>

      <title>Budgie 10.7 sounds like a great desktop to use on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Budgie 10.7 is out now, refreshing many parts of this Linux desktop environment to improve the UI across many parts. Originally created for the Solus Linux distribution, nowadays it lives as an independent project and continues to impress.</p>
<p>There's quite a lot new including an application indexer that should be more reliable, Budgie Desktop Settings has a new design for widget selection and Budge Menu saw quite a few improvements like: gaining support for dual-GPUs to pick the right one, a personal user menu giving you quick access to folders like Home and Documents, quick-access buttons at the bottom things like Desktop Settings and Power and the Budgie Menu also no longer needs to reload when the application index changes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10875362121675253239gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10875362121675253239gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
Budgie 10.7 screenshot - credit to the Budgie devs</p>
<p>Some more of what's new includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Budgie Run Dialog uses their new application indexer.</li>
<li>A new Budgie Screenshot application built into the desktop.</li>
<li>Lots of improvements to the notification system, like showing you a summary of notifications after using something in fullscreen. Their notification system also now supports more of the FreeDesktop Notification spec.</li>
<li>Raven, their big panel on the right, now has a whole new widget API system so anyone can build their own widgets for Raven. Plus there's upgrades to multiple existing Raven widgets like a new Usage Monitor giving you a minimal look at CPU, RAM and Swap use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lots more can be found in the <a href="https://blog.buddiesofbudgie.org/budgie-10-7-released/" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>
<p>I've never actually used Budgie myself, and going by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/users/statistics/" target="_blank">our user stats</a> not a whole lot of people do that filled in their PC Info. If you do use it — what attracts you to it compared with the likes of GNOME, KDE, Xfce and so on?</p>

      <title>Colossal Cave returns from the 1970s in a 3D reimagining</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Colossal Cave, originally released in 1977 from Will Crowther and Don Woods has been revived and reimagined for modern audiences. Another one for a heavy dose of nostalgia perhaps? This new version comes from Sierra On-Line founders Ken and Roberta Williams.</p>
<p>While the original was a text-based adventure, this new version gives it a full 3D look while still aiming to be faithful to what the original game represented. With the non-linear exploration system, you will decide on how to proceed through it and discover the many secrets hiding.</p>

      <title>Inspired by Boulder Dash and Supaplex, Gem Worlds is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oh the nostalgia is heavy with this one! Gem Worlds is inspired directly by the likes of Boulder Dash and Supaplex. I didn't play either, but it's also very similar to one I did play and LOVED on Amiga called Emerald Mine.</p>
<p>This will be something of an acquired taste I think, more for my older readers, since it's not especially flashy but plays on nostalgia from the classics and I love to cover everything from tiny solo games to the latest AAA as long as they could be interesting. I also spent far too many days inside playing the likes of Emerald Mine.</p>
<p><em>Have a little look at the trailer below:</em></p>

<p>Game features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore 50 uniquely-generated levels across 5 unique worlds.</li>
<li>Collect gems, dodge boulders, escape to survive.</li>
<li>Fight monsters (or avoid them) using melee or a variety of skills.</li>
<li>Unlock and upgrade more than 10 diverse skills as the game progresses.</li>
<li>Exploit biome-specific obstacles including mines, icicles, cactii, and more.</li>
<li>3+ hours of play time.</li>

      <title>SurrounDead looks like a mix of DayZ and Project Zomboid</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's early days for the game yet with it in Early Access but SurrounDead could be a promising one to play online with some friends.</p>
<p>From the description and footage shown from the developer, it looks like an odd blending of DayZ and Project Zomboid. However, it also seems to be heavily inspired by another called DeadPoly which is lesser known than the two aforementioned bigger games but if you've seen that you'll know what to expect.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="jP121rIaaQw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4849daf089fbd9ede70cb8e0bea0d9bd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/jP121rIaaQw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What makes this different then? Why am I mentioning it? Well, I initially thought it actually had a Native Linux version whereas DeadPoly does not. It has the SteamOS icon on Steam but checking SteamDB, there's no Linux content or launch configuration. Only after I checked the system requirements, did I spot something that's somewhat unique, as it directly lists Proton for Linux as what they support.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8549866651675182317gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8549866651675182317gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It might not exactly be the first time, my memory escapes me on who did it first, but it's in the single digits on the number of developers noting support being official for Proton in this way so I thought it was interesting to highlight.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Travel through a desolate post apocalyptic landscape.</li>
<li>Fight zombies and possibly worse.</li>
<li>Find many different firearms, melee weapons and equipment.</li>
<li>Trade with survivors in trader hideouts or safe zones to get that one piece of equipment you need.</li>
<li>Barricade buildings or find your self somewhere in the wilderness to escape to.</li>
<li>Loot varied locations to improve yourself, but be aware of your surroundings.</li>
<li>Weather and day/night cycles, be careful.</li>
<li>Manage your stats to stay alive.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Free strategy shooter game Unvanquished v0.54 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Free, open source and full of bugs (the squishable kind) — Unvanquished is a mixture of strategy and an FPS with a new release v0.54 out now. Unvanquished is a fork of Tremulous, for those don't know it's similar in style to Natural Selection with aliens versus humans fighting it out with each having a little base to build.</p>
<p>This release brings with it official ARM support for Linux, so you can now play Unvanquished on your Raspberry Pi and many other ARM systems. Some of course might be too slow but it also means you can now run a server for it on ARM too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9447110311675181444gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9447110311675181444gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Unvanquished v0.54 screenshot.</em></p>
<p>More polishing work went into the UI this time around too with the map load screen now showing the map name and author name and map authors can be a little creative with the level shots now too. On top of the modded servers can also be a little more creative, as they can have their own welcome screen.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17000929741675180516gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17000929741675180516gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Welcome screen example shot.</em></p>
<p>Speaking of online play, the developers improved colour code support for things like usernames, so it doesn't count towards the character count limit.</p>
<p>Other improvements include an update to the lucifer cannon model, there's no negative momentum anymore impacting players as the game goes on, rockets no longer follow dead players and a bug affecting Marauder zap chains is fixed. There's also a bunch of new icons , spectator mode fixes and numerous fixes to bots to improve how they play so they should actually be a bit more menacing and fun to play against. Bot navigation got the biggest upgrade, with their navigation mesh (what they use to pathfind) now being generated in-game solving many problems.</p>
<p>Plenty of changes to the graphics rendering was added like the ability to disable light styles, files for optional features when disabled are no longer loaded, serious issues with dynamic lights were solved along with many crash bugs being fixed.</p>
<p><em>Seems like 2023 is going to be a good year for Unvanquished.</em></p>

      <title>Steam Deck and desktop Beta fix up more on-screen keyboard bugs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bugs! Kill 'em all! Would you like to know more? Valve have a new Steam Deck and Desktop Steam Beta available with a few bugs being stomped. As per usual, there's some shared between them since they mostly use the same bits of the Steam client now.</p>
<p>For the Steam Deck here's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3635002625426139933" target="_blank">what's changed</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">General</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="plain-list-title">Fixed right-shift and nearby keys of onscreen keyboard sometimes not working.</p>
</li>
<li>Fixed "a" and "c" keys triggering an animation on the game details page.</li>
<li>Fixed controller guide button shortcut summary showing an incorrect icon.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="plain-list-title">Fixed an issue where the deadzone slider would get clipped in the controller configurator.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">And then a few differences for Desktop Steam so here's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3659772423378761673" target="_blank">what's changed</a> there:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">New Big Picture Mode</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="plain-list-title">Fixed right-shift and nearby keys of onscreen keyboard sometimes not working.</p>
</li>
<li>Fixed "a" and "c" keys triggering an animation on the game details page.</li>
<li>Big Picture Mode only supports modifying network settings when running on SteamOS / Steam Deck.</li>
<li>Hid button to view Steam Deck manual in Quick Access on non-Deck devices.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="plain-list-title">Fixed an issue where the deadzone slider would get clipped in the controller configurator.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">One day this year, I really hope I get to excitedly write about how either Valve or NVIDIA fix the terrible performance of the New Big Picture Mode on Desktop. Apparently one does not simply <s>walk into Mordor</s> make it work well. I'm sure if it was easy, it would have been sorted by now.</p>

      <title>Forspoken gets an update to improve Steam Deck performance</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1680880/Forspoken/" target="_blank">Forspoken</a> has been controversial for quite a lot of a reasons but also a title many were looking forward to. The release was a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/forspoken-desktop-linux-spoof-steam-deck/" target="_blank">bit rough</a> but the developers are cleaning it up now and it has some Steam Deck fixes.</p>
<p>Here's the patch notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Adjustments have been made to HDR mode.</li>
<li>Localization and spelling fixes.</li>
<li>Various minor fixes.</li>
<li>Certain technical issues occurring on Steam Deck has been fixed.</li>
<li>Performance and stability has been improved on Steam Deck.  </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Amazing to see games from publishers like Square Enix pay attention to a Linux gaming device, we're going to see a lot more of this over the next year. Although, it would be great if developers did these things before release, especially with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/steam-deck-in-stock-japan-hong-kong-south-korea-taiwan/" target="_blank">roll-out of the Steam Deck in Asia</a> going strong, there's going to be a lot more people using it now.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8463547201675173182gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8463547201675173182gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I still personally think £64.99 is a crazy price for it, so I won't be going into any depth on it myself. It currently has a Mixed user rating on Steam from over 2,000 people and the peak player count dropped pretty harshly quickly after release so it's not exactly popular.</p>
<p>They did update the demo too, so for those of you who wish to try it out that might give you a good idea now.</p>

      <title>AMD GPU driver on Linux and Steam Deck to get big improvement on stuttering problems</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The work to improve gaming performance on Steam Deck and Linux desktops for AMD GPUs is always ongoing, and it seems we're set for another nice improvement to how smooth games are.</p>
<p>One of the biggest problems is shader compile stutter, where you play through a game first-time and see it stuttering about all over the place until the shaders get built. It's less of a problem in plenty of games if Valve have them ready for download but that's not always possible, and doesn't always solve it. Some games also update a lot and need shader cache updates often, this will again help with those times where it’s not yet available. For games not on Steam, it will also be a huge bonus win for performance.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/vulkan-based-d3d9-10-and-11-translation-layer-dxvk-version-20-out-now/" target="_blank">DXVK 2.0</a> released back in November 2022 included some major changes to work around it, and work is ongoing in the AMD GPU driver RADV to make use it what's needed. Later NVIDIA drivers have it and the improvements there are quite impressive but the current experimental work in the AMD GPU driver needed work.</p>
<p>As Valve contractor Mike Blumenkrantz <a href="https://www.supergoodcode.com/through-the-loop/" target="_blank">blogged about</a> recently going over work they and others have done regarding the VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_library Vulkan API extension, and the blog post is well worth a read for some background into it but to cut to the chase — the result of the work is a "50,000%" improvement in fast-linking which for <em>gamers</em> should result in a much improved experience for certain games.</p>
<p>The work should hopefully come in Mesa 23.1 due later this year where use of the noted Vulkan extension above should hopefully be turned on by default, and then for Steam Deck players specifically hopefully in something like SteamOS 3.5.</p>
<p>This and more was covered in my recent video:</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer - Part 23: Ready, Set, Go!</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-22-happy-hacking/" target="_blank">Part 22: Happy Hacking</a></strong></p>
<p>If you look at the commercial Linux gaming catalogue at the turn of the millennium, in amongst all of the 3D shooters and strategic simulations being released, one glaring omission seems to have been the lack of any racing games. Loki Software never ported any to Linux, nor did any of the other porting houses. This left a void for the free gaming community to fill. One of the first be off to the races was <em>Trophy</em>, whose development started in March 2000.</p>
<p>The latest version of <em>Trophy</em> I can run from Red Hat Linux 7.3 is version 1.1.3 from before the game was ported to ClanLib 0.8 and beyond. To do this, I first had to grab the ClanLib-0.6.1-fr1.i386.rpm, ClanLib-sound-0.6.1-fr1.i386.rpm, and Hermes-1.3.2-fr3.i386.rpm pacakges from freshrpms. Even then, the included binary that came bundled with the 1.1.3 source tarball would still not load, as it was built against libstdc++5 which is too new.</p>
<p>This is the same problem I had when attempting to launch later versions of <em>Cube</em>, but since I could satisfy all the other build dependencies in this case, I was able to compile my own binary linked to my older version of glibc. To do this, all I had to do was run "make clean" followed by "make" in the trophy directory. This did mean I also had to install all of the ClanLib and Hermes development packages, which from freshrpms came to a whopping eleven packages in total.</p>
<p>Even then the game window still came up labelled as "Trophy 1.0.6" instead, but both the "Snake" and "Rally" tracks were present and correct, so I know I built the right version. Beyond that the only other bug I encountered was that I was unable to change the colour of my car using the arrow keys as the menu suggests, with the new game screen only seeming to allow me to input my name. That said, I am also unsure what the "Hall Of Fame" is even for at this point.</p>
<p><em>Trophy </em>is a top down racer which distinguishes itself by having an emphasis on using extras such as vehicular combat to get ahead of your rivals. You can fire a machine gun at other cars by pressing the "x" key, drop bombs with the "c" key, and give yourself a turbo boost by holding down the "a" key. All of these are powered by collectibles found scattered about the track, right up until you finish the fifth and final lap. The result is a strong arcade feel without being a kart racer.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14509378931674772712gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14509378931674772712gol6.png"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2622579241674772713gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2622579241674772713gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>The graphics are appealing if a little compressed, with the tracks themselves being large for the time 1200x1200px bitmaps created in several layers through use of the GNU Image Manipulation Program. In fact, an entire track designer manual was written that goes over the process of building a track, all to encourage <em>Trophy </em>players to make a submit their own creations. This manual can still be read from the <em>Trophy </em>website hosted on SourceForge.</p>
<p>Work on <em>Trophy</em> advanced in fits in starts, with the latest 2.0.4 release from 2019 still depending on the ancient ClanLib 1.0 software development kit. But while <em>Trophy</em> ossified from a technical perspective over the last decade or so, the gameplay became deeply enriched starting with the 2.0.0 release. This was the first to feature a championship mode as well as a shop where you can buy vehicle upgrades and new cars, giving the money you collect a real purpose at long last.</p>
<p>With all of these additions in particular, <em>Trophy</em> reminds me very much of <em>Mini-Car Racing</em> as published by eGames, one of my brother's favourite games growing up. Whether this a coincidence or not is hard to say, as both games first released in the same year, but they do both have you race on the moon. <em>Mini-Car Racing</em>, incidentally, is also one of many older games which are far easier to get working with WINE than on modern versions of Windows today.</p>
<p>Looking at the TODO list included alongside <em>Trophy </em>shows that<em> </em>the similarities were planned to go even deeper than that, with the inclusion of oil slicks, rockets, and jump points on the tracks. All of which compounds the feeling that <em>Trophy</em> does still have a great deal of unfulfilled potential, with networked multiplayer also having been mooted at one point. There is a legacy here that would be great for someone to build upon, should the right contributor be found.</p>
<p>Which free and open source game projects take off and which stagnant often seems to be at the gift of chance, but at least here there is always the option that some new life can be breathed into them, if given enough interest. The same can even be said for what is to this day my mother's favourite computer game, a free software title which for most of the 2000s was one of the most lauded Linux games to ever be released for the platform.</p>

      <title>Marvel&#39;s Midnight Suns gets an update to help Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Marvel's Midnight Suns is a great strategy game from the developer of XCOM, and now it should actually much better on Steam Deck and Linux desktop.</p>
<p>Two major problems were broken Cloud Saves and a crash for plenty of people at certain points, with both now hopefully solved! Always nice to see such major titles getting some special attention for my favourite gaming platform and the stability fixes specifically should also help players on Linux desktop too!</p>
<p>In the latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/368260/view/3678912721785348966" target="_blank">update</a> they noted this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">General</p>
<ul>
<li>General performance improvements</li>
<li>General stability fixes</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Steam Deck:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steam Deck Virtual Keyboard fixes</li>
<li>Steam/Deck/Link save fixes, including cloud syncing</li>
<li>Steam Deck stability fixes</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can see my previous video on the game below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="69g7N0celto"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1440839a02821bab3953221a0b90c044.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/69g7N0celto" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Definitely looking forward to playing more of it, although I really hate that it has micro-transactions, that still feels gross. They already have a Season Pass, which actually gives you everything extra with the micro-transactions to buy extras individually, it just feels completely stupid to have both and confuse players. Aside from that, I don't have a lot to complain about, the battles are a whole lot of fun.</p>
<p>Deadpool just arrived recently too:</p>

      <title>Slavic fantasy-adventure The End of the Sun gets a demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In the mood for something just a bit different? The End of the Sun is a Slavic-fantasy adventure and you can try it out now. At release it will have Native Linux support and the demo has a Linux version ready too.</p>
<p>About the game: "The End of the Sun is a first-person exploration and adventure story-based game, set in the world of Slavic rites, beliefs and legends. The small village becomes a place of mysterious events, through which the line between myth and reality begins to fade perilously. As the ashter (Slavic sorcerer) who is gifted with the ability to travel in time and knowledge about Navia (the otherworld where human fates shape), following the trail of the unusual fugitive, you come to a mysterious village. Unfortunately, you cannot find anyone there, at least not in a way you expected to. All you can see around are burned hearths."</p>
<p>The developers say you can expect around an hour gameplay from the demo, with English and Polish full audio with 9 languages planned for the full release that will be sometime in Q4 2023.</p>
<p>You can see their new teaser below:</p>

      <title>Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory open source project ET: Legacy has a new release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.etlegacy.com/" target="_blank">ET: Legacy</a> continues carrying the torch of the classic multiplayer title Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, with a new release out that has lots of fixes. The original release was planned as an expansion to Return to Castle Wolfenstein, and later it came as a standalone thing that was later open sourced and now ET: Legacy keeps it going.</p>

<li>Blocked connection from IP with engine temp bans (exclude ports to fix issue with clients changing net_port and reconnecting after a kick, circumventing temp ban)</li>
<li>Added sv_serverTimeReset cvar for resetting svs.time on map change to avoid various issues related to high server uptime</li>
