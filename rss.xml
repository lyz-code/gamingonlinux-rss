      <title>Stellar Blade launches for PC on June 11, specifications and features revealed</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SHIFT UP Corporation /PlayStation Publishing LLC today announced officially that Stellar Blade will be launching for PC on June 11. Finally, I'll get to see what people have been fussing over.</p>
<p>The PC release will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 resolution scaling and frame generation, NVIDIA DLAA image enhancement, and NVIDIA Reflex latency reduction features. Additionally AMD FSR 3 is also supported.</p>
<p>Big monitor owners will also be happy as it supports ultrawide resolutions and super ultrawide. There's also "High-resolution background textures", full input customization for gamepads and keyboards and some new content with new suits to wear.</p>

<p>On the official X/Twitter account, they also <a href="https://x.com/StellarBlade/status/1921230656945668391" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">showed</a> a very brief clip of it on Steam Deck and it seemed to be running well enough but difficult to properly tell. They did also previously say it would be <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/stellar-blade-to-be-optimized-for-the-steam-deck-and-other-umpc-environments/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">optimised for the Steam Deck</a>. Going by the specifications, it seems reasonable that this might perform well.</p>
<p>Pre-orders are available for £59.99 on the main edition and £79.99 for the complete edition.</p>

      <title>Minecraft will finally let you craft saddles instead of hunting for them</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In a future Minecraft release that's now in testing, you won't need to hunt or fish for a saddle, as it's finally going to be an item you can just craft. <em>Seems the knowledge was finally found, it only took 15 years.</em></p>
<p>Why are they doing this now? Well, it sort-of makes sense. While it does reduce part of the point of exploring the world, since it's yet another thing you can just make yourself, Mojang <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/minecraft-is-getting-a-graphics-overhaul-with-the-vibrant-visuals-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced the Happy Ghast</a> that will let you ride it with a crafted harness anyway. So it was a bit odd for you to be able to craft the harness but not the saddle.</p>
<p>Related: be sure to check out my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/an-idiots-guide-to-setting-up-minecraft-on-steam-deck-steamos-with-controller-support/" target="_blank">idiots guide to setting up Minecraft on Steam Deck / SteamOS with controller support</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, this fresh update in testing was <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/craftable-saddles-and-fresh-music" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> by Mojang on May 13th. All you'll need are 3 bits of leather and 1 iron ingot and then you can ride away into the night.</p>

      <title>Nubs! Arena is a chaotic multiplayer brawler by ex-Awesomenauts devs, free for the first 24 hours</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Act fast if you want a brand new free game, as Nubs! Arena from ex-Awesomenauts developers has released and it's free for the first 24 hours. This is <em>not</em> a free trial, it's free to <em>keep</em> if you add it to your account within the time limit.</p>
<p>What is it? Nubs!: Arena is a fast-paced, party-style brawler with roguelite progression, over-the-top action, and enough chaos to ruin friendships (in a good way). Battle online with 4-20 players or locally with up to 4 players in unhinged free-for-alls.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bCsUuBaMdQo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d6d83d13f776a77d6548caa1373fbe72.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bCsUuBaMdQo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>All you have to do is scroll down on Steam and click the Add to Account button:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20105829551747316452gol1.png"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Extensive Character Customization – Craft a Nub that stands out in the chaos.</li>
<li>Multiple Game Modes – Battle solo or in teams with up to 20 people.</li>
<li>Fast-Paced, Action-Packed Battles with Roguelite Progression – One more match quickly turns into ten.</li>
<li>A Variety of Weapons &amp; Power-Ups – Some are powerful, some are absurd, and some are just… fish.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I've verified that it works perfectly without any issue on Linux with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/proton-experimental-updated-to-fix-missing-saves-and-a-new-proton-10-beta-fixes-gamepad-breakage/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 10 Beta</a>. Pretty chaotic with the way the arena shrinks down like a Battle Royale after a while. Add to that the assortment of different weapons you can grab from chests during a round, there's a lot of ways for you to win or die. Could quite easily end up being my new coffee-break game and something to unwind with before bed.</p>

      <title>Shroom and Gloom is a first-person fungus-filled deck-builder with a demo you need to try</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We're getting totally spoiled with unique deck-builders lately like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/the-fusion-of-deck-building-and-space-tetris-in-the-demo-of-moonsigil-atlas-has-totally-hooked-me/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Moonsigil Atlas</a> that I really can't wait for. And now Devolver Digital announced they're publishing Shroom and Gloom with a demo up now and it's glorious.</p>
<p>What is it? A moody first-person, roguelike double-deckbuilder. Yes, double, you have two entirely different decks in this one. The style of it is the real draw though, it looks incredible in motion. There's a combat deck which obviously is used during fights, and then also a explore deck with special cards to help you get around the dungeons.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9109275751747315866gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9109275751747315866gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Part of what makes it unique are the enemies as they're also food. Numerous cards have special additions on them, which can turn dead fungi enemies into food cards. You can also then get a pot card for your exploration, and turn them all into a soup too. The shop system plays into this food system too, with new cards from the shopkeeper costing food, that you'll place into a bowl for them from your food cards.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4847588581747315864gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4847588581747315864gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12682074931747315866gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12682074931747315866gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I've just thoroughly enjoyed exploring the various doors in the dungeon for the atmosphere, it's really great.</p>
<p>I've run through the demo which worked great on Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/proton-experimental-updated-to-fix-missing-saves-and-a-new-proton-10-beta-fixes-gamepad-breakage/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 10 Beta</a> and it is yet another game that I'm going to have to somehow fit into my wishlist, because it deserves to be there.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vL3TJj9mtMc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/aed8a34c3ed58cd034210f68ac624802.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vL3TJj9mtMc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Double-Deckbuilding! - Build 2 distinct decks! Use the combat deck to survive fierce battles! Use the explore deck to navigate dungeons, modify your cards, and unlock new weapons and abilities!</li>
<li>Eye-ball melting art! - Hand-drawn art and animations collide with dozens of rich 3D spaces, bringing you into a surreal world of mushrooms and madness!</li>
<li>Infinite growth and monstrous mega-combos! - Shroom and Gloom offers unique ways for players to grow and modify their cards infinitely. Grow low level starting cards into over-powered attacks, or modify rare cards into game-breaking super-weapons!</li>
<li>Less blocking, more eating! - Why block your enemies when you could eat them instead! Shroom and Gloom features a bounty of ways for you to season, skewer or roast your foes, then eat them to restore lost health. Better yet, throw your roasted enemies into a pot, and cook up some game-changing soups!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A demo you have to try and it enters Early Access later this year.</p>

      <title>Denuvo will lock you out of games on Linux, SteamOS, Steam Deck if you keep changing Proton versions</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Although for some of us this is a well-known problem, it has appeared again with the release of DOOM: The Dark Ages so it's worth a quick PSA to remind people about Denuvo activation limits with Proton on Linux, SteamOS / Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Here's the thing — Denuvo Anti-Tamper games <em>do</em> work on Linux systems when running a Windows game through Proton. However, Denuvo has a set limit on the amount of activations it allows per-game. This is five systems it detects within 24 hours.</p>
<p>The problem is on Linux systems with Proton, you might be trying to find the best version of Proton to run the game with, especially so for new releases. If you <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-change-the-proton-version-on-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">keep changing your Proton version</a> this can trip up Denuvo and count each Proton swap as a new activation. What happens then? You get locked out for 24 hours.</p>
<p>An example shot below is Atomic Heart, which I intentionally tripped when swapping Proton versions just to show you what happens when you do:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19629230321747312375gol1.png"/></p>
<p>So keep in mind for games that have Denuvo Anti-Tamper to limit the amount of times you swap the Proton version.</p>
<p>You shouldn't often need to actually change the Proton version though. For games on Steam that have been through Steam Deck Verified or have a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/valve-announce-steamos-compatibility-ratings-an-extension-of-steam-deck-verified-for-more-devices/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS Compatibility rating</a>, Valve will have picked the best version of Proton by default for it. However, some people like to use things like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-ge-proton-on-steam-deck-steamos-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GE-Proton</a>, or change to a newer version of Proton than what Valve verified a game against, to potentially at times get a better experience.</p>
<p>How to find games that have Denuvo? They are supposed to be noted on Steam, you can see in the side-bar on Atomic Heart for example:</p>

      <title>PartyDeck is a split-screen game launcher for Linux / SteamOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now this is some seriously cool software and I love to see it. PartyDeck is a new tool that can help you run various games in local split-screen, even if they don't actually support it.</p>
<p>How? It runs multiple copies of the same game and sorts out all the connections for you, and will even automatically fit all the windows onto your screen. So it's not actual local split-screen, it's faking it but it's a fantastic idea to make gaming more accessible for people to play together.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">As the developer explains how it works:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>KWin Session:</strong> This KWin Session displays all running game instances and runs a script to automatically resize and reposition each Gamescope window.</li>
<li><strong>Gamescope:</strong> Contains each instance of the game to its own window. Also has the neat side effect of receiving controller input even when the window is not currently active, meaning multiple Gamescope instances can all receive input simultaneously</li>
<li><strong>Bubblewrap:</strong> Uses bindings to mask out evdev input files from the instances, so each instance only receives input from one specific controller. Also uses directory binding to give each player their own save data and settings within the games.</li>
<li><strong>Runtime (Steam Runtime/Proton):</strong> If needed, the app can run native Linux games through a Steam Runtime (currently, 1.0 (scout) and 2.0 (soldier) are supported) for better compatibility. Windows games are launched through UMU Launcher</li>
<li><strong>Goldberg Steam Emu:</strong> On games that use the Steam API for multiplayer, Goldberg is used to allow the game instances to connect to each other, as well as other devices running on the same LAN.</li>
<li><strong>And finally, the game itself.</strong></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18831961931747307575gol1.png"/></p>
<p>There are various limitations, and the developer is honest about it being the "first serious software project I've ever done" and so it may be a little on the messier side.</p>

      <title>Popular stress-testing app OCCT is coming to Steam and includes a special build for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>OCCT <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/stress-testing-and-hardware-monitoring-tool-occt-has-officially-released-for-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently released a supported Native Linux version</a> of their popular fully featured stress-testing application, and now they've announced it's coming to Steam as part of a wider expansion.</p>
<p>Not only that, but they've announced the Steam release will also come with a "portable handheld edition of OCCT that runs flawlessly on the Steam Deck". Their Native Linux build was already compatible but this was optimized to give the best experience on Steam Deck now too.</p>
<p>When it releases on Steam it will be free but also have an "optional non-recurrent purchase, priced the same as on Patreon".</p>

<li>Processor (CPU) – Evaluate your CPU’s stability and performance with various test modes.</li>
<li>Graphics Card (GPU) – Push your GPU to its limits with DirectX and CUDA-specific stress tests.</li>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Frogspin pulled my in by the colourful and inviting sweet visuals but reading more into it, the game sounds like it becomes pure hilarious chaos due to the slot machine modifier mechanics.

      <title>Here&#39;s a statement from Valve on the reported Steam data breach</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's been reports of a Steam data breach recently, and instead of jumping the gun I reached out to Valve first to see what was going on.</p>
<p>From what I can tell the reports originated on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/underdark-ai_cybersecurity-databreach-steam-activity-7327022917370703872-JqN3" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> from "Underdark.ai" that claimed there was a "Massive Alleged Steam Data Breach: 89M+ Records for Sale". This was then picked up on X/Twitter, and then lots of news websites posted it up. The initial report mentioned the company Twilio, who told me earlier today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no evidence to suggest that Twilio was breached. We have reviewed a sampling of the data found online, and see no indication that this data was obtained from Twilio.</p>
<cite>A Twilio Spokesperson</cite></blockquote>
<p>Next up, the full statement sent to me by Valve:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday we were made aware of reports of leaks of older text messages that had previously been sent to Steam customers. We have examined the leak sample and have determined <strong>this was NOT a breach of Steam systems.</strong></p>
<p>We’re still digging into the source of the leak, which is compounded by the fact that any SMS messages are unencrypted in transit, and routed through multiple providers on the way to your phone.</p>
<p>The leak consisted of older text messages that included one-time codes that were only valid for 15-minute time frames and the phone numbers they were sent to. <strong>The leaked data did not associate the phone numbers with a Steam account, password information, payment information or other personal data.</strong> Old text messages cannot be used to breach the security of your Steam account, and whenever a code is used to change your Steam email or password using SMS, you will receive a confirmation via email and/or Steam secure messages.</p>
<p>From a Steam perspective, customers do not need to change their passwords or phone numbers as a result of this event. It is a good reminder to treat any account security messages that you have not explicitly requested as suspicious. We recommend regularly checking your Steam account security at any time at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/account/authorizeddevices" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="https://store.steampowered.com/account/authorizeddevices">https://store.steampowered.com/account/authorizeddevices</a>.</p>
<p>We also recommend Steam users set up the Steam Mobile Authenticator if they haven’t already, as it gives us the best way to send secure messages about their account and that account’s safety.</p>
<cite>Valve Press</cite></blockquote>
<p>Will update when I learn any more verified information.</p>
<p><em>Quick little update 11:09 BST — Valve have now posted it officially on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/533224478739530146" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</em></p>

      <title>Mesa 25.0.6 released with AMD GPU fixes for DOOM: The Dark Ages on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The open source Mesa 25.0.6 graphics drivers bug-fix release is out now, and thankfully this one comes with the updates needed to run DOOM: The Dark Ages on Linux with Proton when you have an AMD GPU.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/doom-the-dark-ages-needs-workarounds-on-linux-with-amd-gpus-a-fix-has-been-merged-into-mesa/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I recently reported about the issues</a> with DOOM: The Dark Ages, and it's nice to see it solved so quickly and <em>just</em> ahead of the game being released properly in a few hours. There's also issues solved for Skin Deep, Psychonauts, Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, Hunt Showdown 1896, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II,  Tomb Raider IV - VI Remastered and Dota 2 across different drivers.</p>

<em>Pictured - DOOM: The Dark Ages</em></p>
<p>The DOOM fix is <em>not</em> actually in their main highlighted list of bug-fixes at the top of the <a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/relnotes/25.0.6.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a> (as quoted below), but when you scroll down a bit it does note these changes are included from developer Natalie Vock:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>radv,driconf: Add radv_force_64k_sparse_alignment config.</li>
<li>driconf: Add workarounds for DOOM: The Dark Ages.</li>
</ul>

<p>The main highlighted fixes otherwise are:</p>

      <title>Rogue Worlds is a free chaotic tactical roguelite platformer out now with Linux and Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rogue Worlds is a new free chaotic tactical roguelite platformer that's a spin-off of Aura of Worlds, a paid bigger game from developer Cognitive Forge. It looks really good and can't argue with that price.</p>
<p>Here, the environment is your toolkit and your key to salvation. You'll outwit deadly traps, swing across dangerous gaps, wield the strength of enemies against them, and turn hazards into chaotic advantages at every turn. The game has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Check out their trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="RkVpiC0YxY4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a65e7f3792f44e1fbf8c2fdd8c7c634e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/RkVpiC0YxY4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Diverse Level Themes: Tidal corridors lined with mines, flickering lights in underground ruins, rising lava pits, and carnivorous gardens. Each environment brings unique dangers and opportunities.</li>
<li>Creative Abilities: Master parkour, cloak from enemies, or even enthrall foes to fight on your side.</li>
<li>Multi-Use Objects: Light your way with a lantern—or throw it as an improvised flaming Molotov.</li>
<li>Challenging Boss Fights: Outsmart colossal adversaries by using both your reflexes and the environment to your advantage.</li>
<li>Handcrafted Pixel Art &amp; Animations: Beautifully detailed pixel visuals bring the world to life.</li>
<li>Unique Musical Score: An immersive soundtrack that evolves with your adventure.</li>
<li>Permanent Progression: Unlock new items, character backgrounds, and more to customize your journey.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>On the subject of how it's connected to their previous games, Aura of Worlds, they said "Rogue Worlds offers a focused, free start to the creative survival gameplay that defines Aura of Worlds. While it stands on its own, it’s also part of a larger, evolving universe, with Aura of Worlds receiving ongoing content updates, expanded biomes, new items, challenges, and more surprises still to come. Progress made in Rogue Worlds carries over to Aura of Worlds, allowing players to seamlessly continue their journey with unlocked gear, rescued allies, and upgraded options intact. Whether you’re discovering the series for the first time or jumping in from the full game, Rogue Worlds is a fast, flexible, and chaotic entry point built to reward experimentation and improvisation."</p>
<p>So it's sort-of like a really big demo, but also not a demo because it stands on its own. A smaller free companion game that can be played by itself.</p>

      <title>The fusion of deck-building and space-Tetris in the demo of Moonsigil Atlas has totally hooked me</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Moonsigil Atlas has a demo out now and it's already shot right up to the top of my wishlist. The idea of fusing a Slay the Spire styled deck-builder with something sort-of Tetris-like is just incredibly slick.</p>
<p>I wrote about it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/moonsigil-atlas-is-a-deckbuilding-roguelike-with-tile-based-energy-thats-tetris-meets-slay-the-spire/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">earlier in April</a>, quite interested in the idea and the developer sent over a pre-release key for the demo that I've <em>thoroughly enjoyed</em> playing through. For a deck-builder, it's incredibly refreshing and thoroughly different to play through thanks to the main game mechanic of fitting pieces onto a board.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2447696861747241812gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2447696861747241812gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>How it works: you fight in battles where your cards need to be placed onto the centre board. The cards all have different shapes, so part of the strategy is knowing not just what card to use but where <em>exactly</em> to place it onto the board too. Enemies you face can also place their own shapes on the board to mess with you, some of which can have really annoying effects on your cards that you need to watch out for.</p>
<p>There's no mana system, which makes it initially a little odd, as you can just keep on using cards and placing shapes as long as you think they'll be useful each round. In a way, the board itself is your mana. I especially like how the card upgrade system allows you to remove specific tiles you select from individual cards, so you can make some of them easier to slot together with other cards when placing them on the board later on.</p>
<p>Trailer is below if you missed me covering it previously:</p>

<p>Really fun idea and wonderful visuals and audio too.</p>
<p>Go give the demo a run through and let me know what you think in the comments. The demo has over 100 cards, two playable characters and various different enemies to battle.</p>

      <title>Rescue Ops: Wildfire could be a good one for co-op fans where you fight raging infernos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rescue Ops: Wildfire is an upcoming immersive firefighter simulation game where you (and friends, if you have any) get to attempt to put out dynamic, unpredictable mega-fires.</p>
<p>Mixed across two modes you'll be able to play through a mission-based campaign playable alone or with up to 4 total players. There's also going to be a sandbox mode to really test yourself on the frontlines. I'm definitely interested to see their fire reaction system that they said reacts to wind strength and direction and can "spread across vast hectares of terrain, no two fires or the way you approach them will ever be the same".</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With climate change giving rise to more frequent and extreme wildfires around the world, more than ever before brave firefighters heroically walk into the fire and flames to protect our communities. In Rescue Ops: Wildfire, players will experience the intensity of being on the front lines of one the world’s most dangerous professions, built from the ground up for solo or cooperative play.</p>
<p>From the fire station to the front line, you’re in control. The initial emergency call to the fire station is just the first step, and it’s then that you’ll have to use the many varied tactics, tools, strategies, and mechanics at your disposal to battle the blaze. Operate a fleet of ground and aerial vehicles to assess and travel to the incident site, locate and rescue trapped or injured civilians, call in tactical support, wield forest clearing equipment, and take the fight directly to the mega-fires with intricate and immersive water hose systems and gameplay.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fight to control massive dynamic wildfires and determine the best strategies in Campaign and Sandbox mode, alone or with players worldwide.</li>
<li>Operate a fleet of ground and aerial firefighting vehicles including fire engines and helicopters.</li>
<li>Call in tactical support to gain the upper hand: deploy water bombers, have a water supply delivered, or ask for ground support to establish an attack or defense line.</li>
<li>Gear up with cutting-edge equipment, developed with the support and expertise of professional firefighters.</li>
<li>Charge into maps inspired by the world’s wildest regions, each with unique terrain and challenges.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully there won't be any problems with running this one with Proton on Linux / SteamOS. I like the idea of it and the short glimpse we get in the reveal trailer seems like it could actually get pretty intense. </p>

      <title>More Intel CPU security flaws revealed with Branch Privilege Injection</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We only just had the reveal of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/vusec-reveal-training-solo-more-security-issues-for-intel-and-arm-cpus/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Training Solo from VUSec for Intel and Arm</a>, and now we have another security flaw in Intel CPUs with Branch Privilege Injection.</p>
<p>This was detailed by COMSEC, the computer security group of the Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (D-ITET) at ETH Zürich in their <a href="https://comsec.ethz.ch/research/microarch/branch-privilege-injection/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">new research post</a>. </p>
<p>Who is affected? They said "All intel processors since the 9th generation (Coffee Lake Refresh) are affected by Branch Privilege Injection. However, we have observed predictions bypassing the Indirect Branch Prediction Barrier (IBPB) on processors as far back as 7th generation (Kaby Lake)". And while their testing has been on Linux, it is a hardware issue so all systems will be affected by it.</p>
<p>Explaining it they said "Branch Privilege Injection (<a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45332" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">CVE-2024-45332</a>) brings back the full might of branch target injection attacks (Spectre-BTI) on Intel. Intel’s hardware mitigations against these types of attacks have held their ground for almost 6 years. In our work, we demonstrate how these mitigations can be broken due to a race condition in Intel CPUs".</p>
<p>Their video example:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="jrsOvaN7PaA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0b969abc5ed117c16afe29e3546f2d59.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/jrsOvaN7PaA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As for updates to fix the problem, unfortunately it seems that will come with another performance cut "Intel has developed a microcode update for affected processors and provided us with one to evaluate on Alder Lake. We were able to verify that the microcode update stops our primitives that we use in the paper to detect the vulnerabilities. Our performance evaluation shows up to 2.7% overhead for the microcode mitigation on Alder Lake. We have also evaluated several potential alternative mitigation strategies in software with overheads between 1.6% (Coffee Lake Refresh) and 8.3% (Rocket lake). Please refer to our <a href="https://comsec.ethz.ch/wp-content/files/bprc_sec25.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">paper</a> for more details."</p>
<p>Intel has since put up a <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-01247.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">security advisory</a> on it.</p>
<p>Another time to keep an eye on system and BIOS updates.</p>
<p>AMD / Arm are not affected by this one.</p>

      <title>Rift Riff is a beautifully designed tower defense game about pumping juice</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rift Riff is all about jumping through portals (okay Rifts, whatever) and extracting precious juice. Monsters don't like you doing that though but the juice must flow. It's out now with Native Linux support. <em>Note: key sent by the developer.</em></p>
<p>The gameplay loop in this one is <em>incredibly</em> satisfying with an easy to follow learning curve. Split between two sections — The first is where you run around a special world filled with rifts that allow you to access various scenarios, along with the option to grab new towers and upgrades. The second are the scenarios themselves where you get thrown into when you step through a rift.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6025877471747226616gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6025877471747226616gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><em>The maps are quite simple but well-designed with some invitingly clean and wonderfully vibrant art.</em></p>
<p>Once you enter a level, you have a quick run around to find the specific point you need to place down your home tower (the Extractor), which is what does all the juice pumping. Placing down your Extractor then brings up your tactical options of what towers you've unlocked that you wish to bring with you. You've only got a limited amount of slots to fill with different types of towers, and you're then locked into using them for the run of that particular level, so choose wisely depending on what types of critters are going to come at you in waves.</p>
<p>Which is another point that's nice about it. You know what enemy types you will encounter at each enemy rift and where they will come from.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20224757241747223952gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20224757241747223952gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11790846861747223951gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11790846861747223951gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>After picking your tower types, you'll then directly run around the map to place down all your towers in specific points across the map. Each tower costs a certain amount of juice, so careful placement and watching the waves is the key to winning here. As the waves go on, your home tower will be pumping that delicious juice allowing you to continue to place down <em>more</em> towers and upgrade them.</p>
<p>For each scenario you complete you're then given prisms to take back with you to the special world to unlock towers, paths to more rifts, companions and tower upgrades. It's not entirely linear either which is another interesting idea here. As you unlock more, extra paths will open up but you can mostly do them in whatever order you want, as long as you have the tower types and upgrades you think you'll need.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3489457601747224251gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3489457601747224251gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>A little bit of minor backtracking here at times, but it's all simple and easy and takes a few seconds to run across so not really a problem at all.</p>
<p>During the scenarios you're an actual person running around the map too, which also serves a purpose. You're not some faceless entity dropping down towers from above. You're the one directly interacting with the world and getting that juice pumped, and you even have some little critter following you that does a small attack, with the option to unlock new companions that have different attacks too.</p>
<p>Check out the full feature trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ePCOuvXU-t0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/65d47e13a8dd21a47d39634ca0ba1914.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ePCOuvXU-t0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of the game mechanics involving the enemies are quite unique too, with them having an assortment of different behaviours. Some might just make a run for your Extractor, others might attack the first tower they encounter or only attack towers on fertile ground while they move towards the Extractor.</p>
<p>I was quite burned out after playing endless hours of Bloons TD 6, which is a great game and a fun time in co-op, but thankfully Rift Riff has given me a renewed energy and love of the tower defense genre. Absolutely worth picking up if you love a game that will challenge you without being punishing, while blending in some fun mechanics to keep you on your toes and get you thinking. Accessible difficulty too with the ability to restart not just the whole scenario you're currently on, but the last wave as well. Plus, if you find your towers aren't placed well, you can just refund their full cost back.</p>
<p>Really nice smooth controller support too, making it a great game to get comfortable with and great on Desktop Linux and Steam Deck too.</p>

<em>Pictured - Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em></p>
<p>There's a number of known issues with Wine on Wayland outlined in the release post, that I suggest you read if you were wanting to try the newer Wayland support.</p>
<p>Often with such a major update we end up seeing a few Hotfix builds after, so keep that in mind this may come with new issues.</p>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 update brings new server options like Friends Only and relaxed chat rules for all players</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve are on a bit of a roll lately with multiple nice Team Fortress 2 (TF2) updates coming in to fix up various issues. The latest changes the networking options for making your own game, allowing you to set who can join it.</p>
<p>Following on from the updates on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/team-fortress-2-updated-with-a-whole-bunch-of-fixes-thanks-to-the-community-having-the-source-code/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">May 1st</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/team-fortress-2-gets-another-update-with-fixes-from-the-community-and-relaxed-in-game-chat-restrictions/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">May 12th</a> that pulled in lots of community-made fixes, the May 13th update now allows for Friends Only servers. More players can actually chat in the game now too with the rules being relaxed.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the update notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Re-enabled all players to be able to use voice commands and party chat.</li>
<li>Added more detailed options for server visibility and privacy when creating a server.
	<ul>
<li>The "Use Steam Networking" checkbox has been replaced with a dropdown, allowing the creation of Local, Friends Only, Unlisted and Listed servers -- defaulting to Unlisted.</li>
<li>Using map command by default will no longer create a join-able game.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed a crash on exit under Linux.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A quick follow-up release came after, as Valve forgot to allow you to join your own server if it was set to Friends Only, because you can't be your own Steam Friend. Oops.</p>

      <title>ZOTAC GAMING ZONE Handheld getting a Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 prototype with a Manjaro Linux-based OS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hardware vendor ZOTAC have announced they're working on a new ZOTAC GAMING ZONE Handheld, with a prototype that will be shown off at COMPUTEX 2025 running Linux. The event takes place May 20-23 May, and so hopefully they will be giving out plenty of details then.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Their press announcement was short on any real details simply noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ZOTAC GAMING ZONE Handheld returns with an updated prototype variant, powered by the AMD Ryzen™ AI 9 HX 370 APU, and running an all-new Manjaro Linux-based OS specifically designed for Handheld PCs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19080341711747213429gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - The original ZOTAC ZONE</em></p>
<p>Interesting to note they're going with Manjaro Linux, or at least some variant of it, presumably because Valve have still yet to actually release that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">public SteamOS 3 version</a> they announced previously. Valve are at least making steps towards this, with their newly announced <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/valve-announce-steamos-compatibility-ratings-an-extension-of-steam-deck-verified-for-more-devices/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS game compatibility rating system</a>. Or, perhaps ZOTAC simply want a bit more control and don't want to use SteamOS directly. That is the benefit of Linux after all, vendors can customize it exactly how they want, and still get great game compatibility on Steam with Valve's Proton.</p>
<p>Since it's only a prototype, it doesn't mean it will actually see a release. And could end up just shipping with Windows instead like we've seen before like with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/ayaneo-next-lite-no-longer-ships-with-steamos-like-holoiso-linux-windows-11-instead/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AYANEO NEXT LITE</a>.</p>

      <title>Saleblazers mixes shopkeeping and co-op survival with a fresh patch adding UI scaling for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Saleblazers is an Early Access survival game that seems to be a little more on the unique side, with it adding in a shopkeeper element and now it should play better on Steam Deck and perhaps from your sofa on a living room PC too.</p>
<p>Back in April they added in full controller support, so controls should no longer be an issue. With the latest update they've also now added in full UI scaling. Helping you make it be more readable on a small screen or at a distance. They've also made it so it will default to larger scaling on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Nice to see more developers focus on this! It's such a huge accessibility issue with some games having a tiny UI, which is why I'm glad <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/steam-will-soon-list-what-accessibility-features-games-support-on-store-pages/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve are rolling out accessibility details on Steam pages</a> soon.</p>
<p>The most recent game trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="T8eqlnffAeE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/493ca8ae905af4670fefb7249af16830.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/T8eqlnffAeE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How long can you survive on a hostile island as a humble shopkeeper? Live off the land, build a cozy shop, and defend against nightly horrors in this open world survival shop simulator for 1-8 players.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wield anything you can pick up as a weapon and hone in on unique roles and playstyles.</li>
<li>Build your own custom retail empire.</li>
<li>Hire NPC employees to run your store for you.</li>
<li>Construct electricity generators to hook up powerful late-game items such as self-checkout machines.</li>
<li>Sell everything to dynamically reactive AI customers with unique needs and budgets.</li>
<li>Gather, fish, farm, craft, buy, fight for, or steal to stock your shelves (beware of the police!).</li>
<li>Main narrative campaign takes you on a treacherous journey across 3 unique handcrafted biomes, each with its own boss, stories, and challenges.</li>
<li>Survive a hostile island environment solo or with friends.</li>
<li>Side quests, mini-bosses, and special orders make the open world come alive.</li>
<li>Spend your free time fishing in the local waters or tending to your garden.</li>
<li>Enable PvP invasions and proximity voice chat for unexpected fun.</li>
<li>Dedicated server (beta) support.</li>
<li>Research and craft 150+ items.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It currently has a Very Positive rating on Steam and Valve previously rated it Steam Deck Playable.</p>

      <title>Granvir: Zero Front is a fresh 3rd-person customizable mech-combat prologue out on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love customising mechs and going into battle? Granvir: Zero Front is a new prologue, acting as a long-term demo for the bigger game of Granvir that's due out later. Seems to be worth a look if you love mech action. It's now available on Steam, it's free and has Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Save data from this will also carry over to the full game whenever it releases.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HNXPPHE4SL4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/beac91b4b68d8823103d3c5f6e242c17.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HNXPPHE4SL4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I'm a bit of a sucker for games like this, no doubt I'll be spending quite a few hours in it building my mech. Like a nice cross between Mech Warrior and Armored Core.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Granvir: Zero Front is a third person shooter action roguelite featuring mech building. Experience the prelude to the Millennium Horizon campaign in Granvir as the first resistance response to the Millenium Company invasion. Players battle through a route of their choice reaching extraction and completing side objectives at the cost of valuable resources. Between battles, players can swap out parts for upgrades found on the battlefield and manage their campaign by taking on loans to afford ammunition, aiding the locals for support in battle and more.</p>
<p>No campaign is the same as you manage time, resources and your route to each objective. Each zone impacts what services and resources are available. Use down time between missions to refit and upgrade your Granvir to prevail.</p>

      <title>DOOM: The Dark Ages needs workarounds on Linux with AMD GPUs, a fix has been merged into Mesa</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With DOOM: The Dark Ages about to release for everyone on May 15th, and with Advanced Access available, it seems it needs some workarounds to run on Linux with AMD GPUs. This is likely what <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/steamos-3-7-6-preview-for-steam-deck-released-fixing-a-doom-the-dark-ages-launch-issue/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve already solved in SteamOS for Steam Deck</a>.</p>
<p>On the Mesa driver GitLab, a <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/34944" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">request</a> titled "radv,driconf: Add workarounds for DOOM: The Dark Ages" was merged around 2 hours ago. It notes that the game "crashes and/or misrenders" without the workarounds it provides.</p>
<p>Looking at the code it adds in a new "force_64k_sparse_alignment" configuration setting for AMD RADV (the open source AMD Vulkan driver) and then enables <em>radv_force_64k_sparse_alignment</em>, <em>radv_zero_vram</em>, <em>radv_disable_dedicated_sparse_queue</em> and <em>radv_disable_dcc_stores</em> settings by default in the driver. Which then allows it to run.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1293183581747134022gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Hopefully we'll see this fix arrive in a Mesa release soon.</p>
<p>Going by the current Mesa release calendar the next bug-fix update is 25.0.6 that's due May 14th (tomorrow) and 25.0.7 due out May 28th. For the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/mesa-25-1-open-source-graphics-drivers-are-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently released Mesa 25.1 series</a> the first bug fix update there with 25.1.1 should be due May 21st.</p>

      <title>City-building on the back of a huge creature, The Wandering Village gets a big Story Update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Wandering Village is such a sweet idea for a city-builder, taking place on the back of a huge walking creature. It's in Early Access with Linux / Steam Deck support and a big new update just arrived.</p>
<p>The Story Update brings with it the chance to finally learn more about the world and its inhabitants. The new Story Mode adds in many new characters and a main quest that sheds more light on the past - and future - of the world and its inhabitants, adds over 10 side quests, multiple new soundtracks, new world map locations and an intense final showdown. Sounds like fun and a unique addition to the game.</p>
<p><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5397957851747128298gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I was absolutely hooked on this one when it released but it did suffer from a big lack of content. However, over the last year they've really expanded it across multiple updates that have really helped. The Ruins update back in March especially with the addition of the new biome to walk through, which came with lots of additional content.</p>
<p>Really can't wait for this one to be content-complete to dive in for another full play-through. It's already great right now though with all these updates.</p>
<details class="spoiler_container"><summary class="spoiler_header">Full patch notes, click me</summary>
<div class="spoiler-content">
<h3>What's New</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Story Mode": Introduces many new characters and a main quest that sheds more light on the past - and future - of the world and its inhabitants, adds over 10 side quests, multiple new soundtracks, new world map locations and an intense final showdown</li>
<li>Added "Food Compostation" research - allowing the Compost Heap to turn food into compost/biogas</li>
</ul>
<h4>Improvements</h4>
<ul>
<li>Save files will now show an icon representing the corresponding game mode</li>
<li>Updated icons for all game modes</li>
<li>Various fixes for RTL languages in the UI</li>
<li>Completely reworked how the world map is generated - this should hopefully fix a whole category of map-related bugs. Map bugs may still be visible when loading an existing save file, but they should not affect gameplay too much and should fix themselves after a while</li>
<li>Performance improvements across the board</li>
<li>Gamepad: Radial menu resets when using tools and reopening. No direct filters anymore.</li>
<li>Gamepad: Left on the D-Pad now navigates to the sidebar</li>
<li>Gamepad: Reworked and improved navigation for Research window</li>
<li>Gamepad: Improved navigation for Glossary</li>
<li>Show resources in food stand even if it is disabled</li>
<li>Festival section in Onbu command bar shows all available buildings on a single line</li>
<li>Improved readability for difficulty mode entries in Glossary</li>
<li>Updated sound effects (radio tower, clay deposit)</li>
<li>Resources in food stand can now be traded (e.g. for scavenging events)</li>
<li>Improved display of long titles in Glossary</li>
<li>Proper icon for experimental health potion and some other Onbu missions</li>
<li>Removed obsolete popup when building a monument for the first time</li>
<li>Reworked most game systems to use persistent deterministic random number generators. This should make some random effects that should be consistent actually consistent (such as outcomes of scavenging decisions, spawn locations of wild plants etc), and it helps us to reproduce issues more reliably in the future</li>
<li>Ending credits got a makeover and special soundtrack</li>
<li>Gamepad: hide sidebar glyph while menus are open</li>
<li>Gamepad: costs and rewards of scavenging missions can now be navigated</li>
<li>Added missing UI icons for various status effects and horn commands</li>
</ul>
<h4>Bugfixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Hostility popup not appearing after surviving for 1000km</li>
<li>Fixed UI elements not visible on OpenGL</li>
<li>Fixed some Glossary entries not displaying correctly</li>

<li>Fixed resource category "Knowledge" not being localized</li>
<li>Fixed several cases where tooltips would stick around</li>
<li>Fixed drag-mode persisting when zooming out of village while dragging and then back in again</li>
<li>Fixed loading screen issues</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in villager job distribution</li>
<li>Fixed a potential issue with worldmap models not getting reset properly</li>
<li>Fixed tutorial glyphs for gamepad</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that lead to Onbu’s back turning brown when villagers cleared out storages in some cases</li>
<li>Fixed food stand resoure slots not getting cleared if building was disabled</li>
<li>Fixed toggling of food stand slots not having any effect</li>
<li>Fixed food stands sometimes not getting filled properly</li>
<li>Fixed tutorial sidebar navigation</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Worker Management overlay could be used to unassign scavengers from ongoing missions (and other employed workers on missions)</li>
<li>Fixed Worker Management showing sliders that should not be visible after changing language</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where dialogues that focus on a building could toggle the harvest tool when playing on a gamepad</li>
<li>Fixed automatically pressing the Pinned button when glossary was opened through ring menu on gamepad</li>
<li>Fixed not being able to rename villagers</li>
<li>Fixed Credits autoscroll not being interrupted when dragging with mouse</li>
<li>Fixed Credits not being mouse-draggable from every position (e.g. from gaps between text segments)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in glossary when no tutorial was active</li>
<li>Fixed Onbu movement states that should not be shown being visible in horn command tooltips</li>
<li>Fixed 00:01 remaining time shown for non-postponable decisions</li>
<li>Fixed side display scaling</li>
</ul>
<h4>Balancing</h4>
<ul>
<li>BileExtractor storage size 50 -&gt; 20</li>

<li>Increase production speed of Onbu Pharmacy and Food Liquefier at max. worker count</li>
<li>Bring berry macarons recipe in line with other recipes of the same tier</li>
</ul>

      <title>RimWorld in space, colony sim Stardeus gets a major upgrade with ship combat</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kodo Linija and publisher Paradox Arc have released a massive update to Stardeus, that's a bit like a RimWorld in space with ship-building. Now, it has ship to ship combat too.</p>
<p>The Ship Combat update introduces ship-to-ship combat and NPC ships from various factions. You can choose to fight these battles and NPC ships can also fight amongst themselves. Additionally, you can now also interact with NPC ships outside of combat which opens up various trading opportunities.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10368724341747127361gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">There's various new ship to ship interactions in the update including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hail: </strong>Any ship can hail another to initiate a chat and trigger interactions.</li>
<li><strong>Attack: </strong>A ship can attack another or join an ongoing battle.</li>
<li><strong>Give Gift:</strong> A ship may offer gifts to improve faction relations.</li>
<li><strong>Ask Fuel:</strong> A low-fuel ship can request fuel, affecting relationships.</li>
<li><strong>Trade:</strong> Some ships are open to exchanging goods.</li>
<li><strong>Extortion:</strong> Pirates may demand ransom under threat of combat.</li>
<li><strong>Follow:</strong> A ship may tail another out of curiosity or with later intent.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid: </strong>Threatened ships try to escape and hyperjump away.</li>
<li><strong>Ignore:</strong> Ships may ignore you, which can be a relief when it’s pirates.</li>
<li><strong>Surrender:</strong> Only in combat, and not guaranteed to work.</li>
<li><strong>Insult:</strong> Throw insults and see what happens.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The update also improves Hyperspace travel with new engine types that allow warping directly to distant sectors. Another new feature, Return Beacons, lets players mark and revisit previously explored locations for fast travel. There's also various UI enhancements, a number of new story events, quests, weapons and more.</p>
<p>With this update it's really turning into a much bigger and more interesting game.</p>

      <title>Linux GPU Control Application (LACT) gets a new fan control UI, automatic fan mode threshold on Nvidia</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Linux GPU Control Application (LACT) is a wonderful open source app that allows you to tweak various settings for your GPU on Linux. The latest update brings some great new features, like the new fan control UI.</p>
<p>With the new fan control you're able to actually drag around the points, instead of using a series of sliders. It's a much nicer system, giving you fine-grained control over moving it all around to exactly where you want it. And, it just looks cool. There's also a new option in the UI to set which temperature sensor is used for the curve although they said this specific part "this only works on 6000 series and older AMD cards due to hardware limitations)".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2138753401747126629gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2138753401747126629gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the other major changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Automatic fan mode threshold on Nvidia</strong></p>
<p>Most Nvidia GPUs support turning the fan off below a certain temperature, but this only works in the automatic fan control mode. When using manual controls such as a custom fan curve in LACT, the GPU limits possible fan speeds between 30% and 100%.<br/>
	It is now possible to work around this by switching the fan control to automatic below a configured temperature, allowing the fan to turn off at lower temperatures even when using a custom curve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>More information reporting</strong></p>
<p>There is some new information that is now reported by LACT:</p>
<ul>
<li>OpenCL details, including supported versions and basic hardware properties</li>
<li>GPU instruction set version on AMD</li>
<li>ROP count on AMD</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>New config API</strong></p>
<p>There is a new API for GPU configuration in the unix socket that reuses the same format as the config file.<br/>
	Thanks to this new API, the GUI will now ask confirmation for all settings (and automatically revert if not confirmed), while previously this only worked for clockspeed/voltage settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Finished GUI refactor</strong></p>
<p>All UI components now use the Relm4 library to define GTK UIs. This also resolves some problems with the UI starting to lag after applying settings serveral times related to GTK signals handling in the old implementation.</p>
</li>
</ul>

      <title>Black Mesa &#39;Resonance Decade&#39; update out now with Linux and Steam Deck improvements and a big sale</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Crowbar Collective just released a major update to their Half-Life remake Black Mesa, which includes a whole lot of improvements to celebrate their ten year Steam anniversary.</p>
<p>There's a lot of upgrades for Linux / Steam Deck players here, as it pulls in all the changes from the Beta to the Stable version of the game. To go along with the celebration, the game is 90% off until May 19th so it's truly the perfect time to grab it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7333588061747125964gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>No matter how you choose to play the game, this upgrade should make the experience a lot smoother across the Native Linux version and the Windows version with Proton.</p>

<p>This could potentially be Crowbar signing off from Black Mesa and turning their full attention over to their new game, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/rogue-point-is-a-new-tactical-shooter-from-half-life-remake-black-mesa-developer-crowbar-collective/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Rogue Point that was announced in November 2024</a>.

      <title>Counter-Strike 2 gets weekly missions and a Linux Wayland fix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just recently, Valve updated Counter-Strike 2 to entice players to keep coming back with a new permanent weekly mission system. Additionally, a just released update improves the game on Linux with Wayland.</p>
<p>For the new weekly mission system you'll get one mission each week, which will give you some bonus XP. The mission can be seen and accessed via the Main Menu and Play Menu. Along with that update that landed on May 8th, Valve also added in a bunch of new community maps across Competitive, Casual and Deathmatch.</p>
<p>With the update that came May 12th, if you're on Wayland / Linux there's also a nice bug fix noted "Various fixes for running on Linux with SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland". Plus "Various crash fixes and stability improvements" for smoother gameplay.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11068335221747123548gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>CS2 is still the most played game on Steam. With a 24 hour concurrent player peak of 1,530,261. More than double Dota 2, which is the next most popular game.</p>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 gets another update with fixes from the community and relaxed in-game chat restrictions</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have released the latest small update to Team Fortress 2. Following on from the update <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/team-fortress-2-updated-with-a-whole-bunch-of-fixes-thanks-to-the-community-having-the-source-code/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">released at the start of May</a>, it's another that pulls in some community-provided fixes thanks to the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/team-fortress-2-major-update-released-and-source-available-for-modders-via-the-source-sdk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">source code being available as part of the Source SDK update</a>.</p>
<p>Quite an interesting change here is to do with the chat, as Valve noted they have "Relaxed in-game chat restrictions for certain accounts". The TF2 Reddit was very <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/1kl1sc0/free_to_plays_can_use_chat_again_this_is_not_a/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">excited</a> about this one, as it seems certain accounts that couldn't chat before now can.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The full changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed HUD scope animation exploit (GitHub fix from mastercoms).</li>
<li>Fixed case where the door model for Match Status HUD wasn't initialized before setting the submodel (GitHub fix from rabscootle).</li>
<li>Fixed money not automatically being collected in Mann vs. Machine respawn rooms (GitHub fix from mastercoms).</li>
<li>Fixed stuck Mann vs. Machine bots sometimes causing spawn softlocks (GitHub fix from Mentrillum).</li>
<li>Fixed Mann vs. Machine ammo canteens not affecting energy weapons (GitHub fix from Mentrillum).</li>
<li>Fixed 'Shell Extension' achiemevent not working for energy weapons (GitHub fix from Mentrillum).</li>
<li>Fixed not being able to deploy parachute after landing and becoming airborne without jump button (GitHub fix from FlaminSarge).</li>
<li>Fixed some heap allocated KeyValues leaks (GitHub fix from Dmitry Tsarevich).</li>
<li>Relaxed in-game chat restrictions for certain accounts.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I expect we're going to see a lot more updates for TF2 with the community able to hack away at the code now. Nice to see for Valve's still popular game from 2007.</p>

      <title>Valve announce SteamOS Compatibility ratings, an extension of Steam Deck Verified for more devices</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With SteamOS Linux from Valve about to expand onto devices other than the Steam Deck, like the upcoming Lenovo Legion Go S, Valve just announced a SteamOS Compatibility rating system. I was wondering how Valve were planning to handle this, although they never replied to my email on it. Seems they were cooking in the background as always.</p>
<p>This new system is an extension of the Steam Deck Verified system and will sit along side it. Covering any device that will run on SteamOS that's not a Steam Deck, although you only get a small subset of checks compared with Deck Verified. For the new system it will simply say if games are <strong>Compatible</strong> or <strong>SteamOS Unsupported</strong>.</p>
<p>Valve say they "expect over 18,000 titles on Steam to be marked SteamOS compatible out of the gate". Which isn't a surprise, since Steam Deck Verification <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/steam-deck-hits-18000-games-playable-and-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hit over 18,000 Playable + Verified back in March</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10318916731747083615gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10318916731747083615gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Realistically, Valve can't do a whole lot more than that. Especially when they eventually <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release the previously announced public SteamOS 3 Beta</a>, you'll be able to run it on practically anything. So this seems to make the most sense. There's not a whole lot of times where a game will be unsupported, unless they do some annoying kernel-level anti-cheat (we're tracking <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat game compatibility on a dedicated page</a>).</p>
<p>Just like with Deck Verified, it's all automatic and done by Valve directly. Developers don't need to take any action. Although, ensuring their games work with Proton right now or have a supported Native Linux version would of course help it along. Valve said if there's already a Steam Deck rating, it will automatically get a SteamOS Compatibility rating. For titles that don't yet have one, the same process will apply as it does right now where they go into a queue and Valve will regularly put games through it with Steam Deck and SteamOS ratings appearing then together.</p>

      <title>VUSec reveal &#39;Training Solo&#39;, more security issues for Intel and Arm CPUs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Researchers at VUSec have revealed what they're calling "Training Solo", a set of security issues across Intel and Arm CPUs that sound pretty annoying and serious.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">It's all thoroughly complicated stuff, so they've included a TL;DR (too long; didn't read) in the project post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We present Training Solo, the first systematic analysis of self-training Spectre-v2 attacks that break the core assumption behind domain isolation—even when implemented perfectly. Our work shows that attackers can speculatively hijack control flow within the same domain (e.g., kernel) and leak secrets across privilege boundaries, re-enabling classic Spectre-v2 scenarios without relying on powerful sandboxed environments like eBPF. We created a new test-suite to analyze the branch predictor in a self-training scenario.</p>
<p>We present three new classes of self-training Spectre-v2 attacks, backed by two end-to-end exploits on recent Intel CPUs that leak kernel memory at up to 17 KB/sec. Along the way, we uncovered two new hardware issues (CVE-2024-28956 and CVE-2025-24495) that completely break the domain isolation and re-enable traditional user-user, guest-guest, and even guest-host Spectre-v2 attacks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Going over the blog post they list the three different issues and what generations of CPUs they affect:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>History-based attacks</strong>: "Affected: All Intel CPUs with eIBRS, including Intel’s latest generation Lion Cove which features the BHI_NO feature. Selected ARM CPUs, see vendor website".</li>
<li><strong>Indirect Target Selection (ITS) (CVE-2024-28956)</strong>: "Affected: Intel Core 9th-11th, Intel Xeon 2nd-3rd".</li>
<li><strong>Lion Cove BPU issue (CVE-2025-24495)</strong>: "Affected: Intel CPUs with Lion Cove core (Lunar Lake / Arrow Lake)".</li>
</ul>
<p>Best make sure you check for some updates soon. You'll need a mixture of Linux kernel updates and firmware for this.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have launched the latest mini festival, this time it's a Creature Collector Fest bringing in lots of games that get you to collect little monsters in some form. Showing just how diverse this genre has become, there's a lot more to it than Pokémon-likes.</p>

<p><em>There's not many in the category that have a Linux version and on sale.</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">As for those that are <em>at least</em> <strong>Steam Deck Playable</strong> here's some separate picks for you:</p>

      <title>Steam Deck sales still going strong over three years later</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Back in February we hit the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/happy-three-years-to-the-steam-deck-the-linux-gaming-machine-that-changed-everything/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">three year mark of Valve's Steam Deck</a> with SteamOS Linux, and as we approach the release of the public <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3 Beta for more devices</a>, here's an updated look at the sales charts.</p>
<p>I've been tracking this for a while now, based on Valve's public Global Weekly Top Sellers list. I last showed an updated list of this <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/steam-deck-sales-drop-hard-following-the-nintendo-switch-2-announcement/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in January</a>, when it initially seemed like the Nintendo Switch 2 announcement had put a dent in sales, which turned out to be an error.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Valve don't like to give out sales numbers, so we have to rely on their own lists which are for <em>revenue</em>, not units sold. So keep in mind that <em>one</em> Steam Deck is equal to <em>multiple</em> of the most expensive games. However, it does still mean they're selling quite a lot regularly when you think about how many hundreds of thousands of copies get sold of the top games each week.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's the latest on how it's doing in the Global Weekly Top Sellers chart:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11013784011747051351gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11013784011747051351gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>When you look at the last year, the Steam Deck position averages about #4, which is good news for the long-term health of the platform. We are gradually seeing more bigger games releasing that the Steam Deck simply cannot handle, so it will be interesting to see how the sales change over the next 1-2 years. Although, when you look at the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/heres-the-most-played-steam-deck-games-for-april-2025-balatro-still-top-but-oblivion-remastered-sneaks-in-second/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">most played games for April 2025</a>, it shows that there's an interesting mixture of games new and old in there.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/330-million-hours-played-on-steam-deck-in-2024-up-64-from-2023-steam-year-in-review-2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's own year end review of 2024</a>, they noted that Steam Deck had 330 million hours playtime, which was a 64% increase compared with 2023. I do wonder how 2025 will look when compared! I should also note that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/618709/steam-deck-3-year-anniversary-handheld-gaming-shipments-idc" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The Verge</a> commissioned market research firm IDC back in February, who <em>estimated</em> nearly 6 million handhelds (multiple vendors) had been sold since 2022 with the Steam Deck number around 4 million.</p>

<p>Recently we had the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/paradox-interactive-announce-europa-universalis-v/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">big announcement of Europa Universalis V</a> from Paradox Interactive / Paradox Tinto. Now we know it will only officially support Windows.</p>
<p>Quite a break in tradition here for an in-house Paradox strategy title. Their previous games Victoria 3, Imperator: Rome, Stellaris, Europa Universalis IV, Crusader Kings II + Crusader Kings III and Hearts of Iron IV all had both Native Linux and macOS support.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17457657691747048326gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Originally, their press team couldn't give me an answer when asked if Linux would be supported, simply telling me the press release info was all they were giving out. However, on the official Paradox forum there's a <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/mac-support-or-even-steam-deck-support.1743143/post-30349122" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reply</a> to a post asking about macOS from Paradox Tinto's Studio Manager, Johan Andersson, that clearly says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are currently no plans for anything else than Steam and Windows.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At least on Linux, you should hopefully be able to run it with Valve's Proton. Still, a shame to see such a big series move away from direct support.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck Beta update brings controller fixes, plus an essential game fix for Desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a Steam Beta update for Steam Deck and Desktop that has some essential fixes, one of which was quite a nuisance bug on Steam Deck.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The May 9th update for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/529846144626329322" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Deck</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed controller not working intermittently after Steam restart.</li>
<li>Fixed games failing to connect to the Steam process when the Steam process id contains certain values.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Desktop Mode</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed regression causing friends and chat windows to not load properly when Steam shows the login window at startup.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That controller not working issue has been happening for ages, so it's nice to see it solved now — hopefully. This is in the Beta / Preview update channels you need to opt into. In case you missed it, another recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/steam-deck-gets-a-battery-charge-limit-control-in-the-latest-beta/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Deck Beta update also finally added a battery charge limit option</a>.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">And for <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/545608743298008902?snr=2___" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Desktop</a>:</p>

      <title>End of 10 is a campaign to move people over to Linux with Windows 10 support ending</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Windows 10 is close to being dead now, with support ending this year. So why not try out Linux? Instead of getting a whole new system and having to deal with the increasing amount of AI junk and adverts in Windows 11.</p>
<p>This is where the <a href="http://endof10.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">End of 10</a> campaign has stepped in to get events sorted, and to help more people get into Linux.  Considering that Microsoft are still forcing various requirements for Windows 11, that a whole lot of PCs can't do, it makes sense to try and do something about it that doesn't end up resulting in forcing people into buying new hardware.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4989910651747039214gol1.png"/></p>
<p>On their website that have a growing list of places to get direct help, events you can appear at to get help and instructions on downloading and installing Linux. They also list some pretty standard reasons for trying Linux like it being cheaper, there's no adverts, you having more control and so on.</p>
<p>See more on the <a href="https://endof10.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">End of 10 website</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps something worth sharing to some friends and family that will soon be dealing with this issue.</p>
<p>And hey, with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/fedora-linux-42-is-out-now-with-kde-plasma-desktop-promoted-and-x86-programs-on-arm/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fedora 42 out now</a> that has KDE Plasma being promoted to a flagship edition status, there's never been a better time to try it out. KDE Plasma is my favourite desktop environment since it has a lot of customization possibilities, but also resembles a more Windows-like UI compared with GNOME. Worth getting some more people you know to give it a shot.</p>

      <title>TF2 mod Open Fortress is coming to Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Open Fortress is a mod for Valve's Team Fortress 2 and now it's getting a standalone release on Steam, thanks again to Valve adding the TF2 source code to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/team-fortress-2-major-update-released-and-source-available-for-modders-via-the-source-sdk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Source SDK</a>. A number of other mods are getting Steam releases like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/team-fortress-2-legacy-not-to-be-confused-with-team-fortress-2-classic-is-coming-to-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Team Fortress 2 Legacy</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/team-fortress-2-classic-is-coming-to-steam-thanks-to-valve-adding-tf2-to-the-source-sdk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Team Fortress 2 Classic</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10957253921747038192gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Open Fortress is a fully custom mod that builds on Team Fortress 2’s world-famous gunplay to create a smooth, stylish experience inspired by old-school FPS games. The Open Fortress experience is lovingly hand-crafted to ensure the best possible vibes, remaining true to the essence of TF2’s mid-century aesthetic while taking earnest inspiration from seventies action flicks. Featuring all new maps, all new guns, and an original soundtrack inspired by the funky tunes of the era.</p>
<p>Set several years after the Gravel War, Open Fortress envisions a new age in the Team Fortress universe. In the futuristic world of 1979, the heart of mercenary gunfighting has shifted from covert war in the Badlands of New Mexico to a worldwide free-for-all! Battle it out on a level playing field to seize weapons, power-ups, and a place on the podium from your foes!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Alpha release is available via <a href="https://openfortress.fun/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">their website</a> for now. Currently, the Steam page only has Windows system requirements, so it's not clear if the standalone release will have a Native Linux version.</p>
<p>You can also follow their official account on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/openfortress.fun" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental updated to fix missing saves and a new Proton 10 Beta fixes gamepad breakage</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released two Proton updates just as the weekend hit, both containing some essential fixes for running Windows games on Linux / Steam Deck. So here's all that's new for Proton Experimental and the latest Proton 10 Beta.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The update for <strong>Proton Experimental</strong> was a small one but it has an important fix for potentially missing saves:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue where Steam Cloud downloads could interfere with new Proton prefix creation leading to missing Steam Cloud saves. If any saves are missing after Proton 10 use, check for directories containing <code class="inline-code">corrupted_pfx</code> in the name in your Steam Library - the missing files should be present there.</li>
<li>Fixed some games using DirectStorage not working with Intel GPUs.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a good reminder that you should only be using Proton Experimental for <em>testing</em> or when you <em>need</em> the specific fixes included for certain games. Issues will appear since it's a testing area for Valve. Stick to the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">main numbered versions of Proton</a>.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">For the <strong>Proton 10.0-1f (beta)</strong> release it should hopefully fix up gamepads, for people who were reporting issues with them disconnecting during gameplay:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue where Steam Cloud downloads could interfere with new Proton prefix creation leading to missing Steam Cloud saves. If any saves are missing after Proton 10 use, check for directories containing <code class="inline-code">corrupted_pfx</code> in the name in your Steam Library - the missing files should be present there.</li>
<li>Fixed Space Engineers crashing on a steam deck after changing controller setting with a fresh Proton prefix.</li>
<li>Fixed gamepads randomly stopping working on some setups.</li>
</ul>

      <title>SteamOS 3.7.6 Preview for Steam Deck released, fixing a DOOM: The Dark Ages launch issue</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ahead of the release of DOOM: The Dark Ages on May 15th, Valve have released an update for SteamOS for Steam Deck to get it to actually run.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean it will actually perform well, just that the game will actually run on SteamOS. Good for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">when Valve actually release that Beta for more devices</a> too. Considering DOOM: The Dark Ages has Ray Tracing as a <em>requirement</em>, it probably wasn't going to run great on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/529846144626329379" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SteamOS 3.7.6 Preview: It Runs DOOM</p>
<p>Note: This update is for the Steam Deck Preview channel, and includes new features that are still being tested. You can opt into this in Settings &gt; System &gt; System Update Channel.</p>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a launch failure with DOOM: The Dark Ages.</li>

      <title>Here&#39;s all the games to claim for Steam Deck / Linux from Prime Gaming as of May 9th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's the fresh and up to date list of games available on Amazon Prime Gaming for May 9th, and what compatibility you can expect for Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck. An easy way to build up your gaming collection with these games coming as part of your Amazon Prime subscription.</p>
<p>I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"/> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play. Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now.</p>
<p>You can install games from Epic, GOG and Amazon easily via <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/heroic-games-launcher-2152-released-fixing-amazon-gog-and-epic-games-issues/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Heroic Games Launcher</a> with Prime giving you a code for each game for whatever store it's on. For any games that use anti-cheat be sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat compatibility page</a> to see their status.</p>

      <title>This word-game roguelike looks unique and has one of the longest names I&#39;ve ever seen</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Game marketing, you gotta love it. How can you make your small indie game stand out? A great game doesn't always stand on its own, so why not give it a ridiculously long name. </p>
<p>Why am I not putting the name in the article title like I usually do? Well, it's called "If Letters Had Pants, Would They Wear Them Like This? What About Numbers? What If They Had Small Shovels And They Dug Stuff Up To Put In A Museum?" and uh, yeah that's certainly a choice that was made. It's not the longest name of a game ever but certainly up there in the top I think.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13329989841746795343gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>From PUNKCAKE Délicieux it's a word-game that looks a bit like something i would have done at school, but turned into a fancy little roguelike.</p>
<p>Via the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Make words that let you make words</h4>
<p>Find words in a randomized grid of letters. The used letters will leave empty spaces, which the other letters can bridge, allowing for words that weren't possible before, over larger and larger areas. And if words aren't helping, you can also use bombs to clear up blocking letters.</p>
<p>Your score depends on both the length of the word, and the size of the area it spans. Make longer words over bigger areas to score more points and reach the level's goal before the timer runs out!</p>
<h4>But it's also a roguelike?</h4>
<p>If you manage to complete the level, you will be presented with 3 pairs of pants for 3 different letters. Pants give unique bonuses to letters, a letter can be worth more, or maybe it multiplies the whole word’s value, or maybe it gives you bombs or does other things!</p>
<h4>And there's a museum involved??</h4>
<p>Beneath the earth you will find objects lost to time. (and to their owners) While making words, you also dig the earth and uncover these sometimes-precious items. Find them, sell them, and expand your museum, then place the items in the museum and unlock new gameplay modifiers as the museum’s collection completes!</p>
<p>Plays entirely with the mouse. An average run may last 15 to 30 minutes. You may play with the English, French, or Spanish dictionary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Look at what it did to our poor little link embed. Ridiculous. I love it.</p>

      <title>Killing Floor 3 now set for release on July 24 after being delayed to improve it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Killing Floor 3 was originally due to release in March, but feedback was pretty bad from their Beta and so they delayed it to rework various parts of it. Now, it's set for launch on July 24.</p>
<p>They've been regularly detailing the enhancements to the game across Steam and social media, so hopefully this will make it a good release. Would be a shame for the series to go downhill for the third game after the first two were much loved by players.</p>
<p>“Since delaying the launch of Killing Floor 3, we’ve dedicated the additional development time to responding to the community’s feedback, ensuring the next chapter in the much-loved cult action/horror franchise lives up to our shared vision,” said Bryan Wynia, Creative Director at Tripwire Interactive. “The support from our fans has been incredible, and with the new July 24th release date in sight, we're thrilled to bring that vision to players not just at launch, but through the continued support of new features and content that is a hallmark of our studio.”</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7965042251746793911gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Killing Floor 3 </em></strong>is the next installment in the legendary co-op action/horror FPS series. The year is 2091, 70 years after the events in <em>Killing Floor 2</em>, and megacorp Horzine has produced the ultimate army: an obedient horde of bio-engineered monstrosities called Zeds. Now, the only thing standing between these infernal creations and the future of humanity is the rebel rogue group known as Nightfall. This intense first-person shooter puts players in the role of a Nightfall specialist, joining forces with up to five teammates as they battle through a war-ravaged, dystopian future, surviving unrelenting waves of Zeds, unlocking new skills, and building the ultimate arsenal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are you planning to pick this one up? From the Beta, it did seem to run just fine on Desktop Linux with Proton. On Steam Deck on Low details, the Beta did manage <em>mostly</em> 30FPS too but it did not look good at all.</p>

      <title>GOG begin rolling out dynamic bundle pricing to complete your collections</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Something I'm surprised <a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> didn't have before. They've now begun rolling out dynamic bundle pricing to help you complete your collections. Here's what that means for purchasing on GOG.</p>
<p>Much like other stores (hi Steam), when you go to purchase a bundle you might already have some of the games in it. Steam offered a type of bundle called "Complete The Set" for a long time now, which means you don't end up spending more than necessary just to grab what you don't have. GOG now do this too, finally.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">As they posted on the GOG <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general/were_rolling_out_the_first_batch_of_bundles_with_dynamic_pricing/post1" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">forum</a> at the end of April:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>We’ve just launched the first batch of bundles with fully functioning dynamic pricing. It’s a feature many of you might recognize from other platforms, but for those who don’t, here’s how it works:</p>
<p>When purchasing a bundle, you only pay for the items you don’t already own, making it easy to complete your collection without spending more than necessary.</p>
<p>We know this has been a long-requested feature, and that the lack of it has been frustrating for many of you. That’s why we’re super excited to finally start introducing it to the store, and we hope you’re just as happy to see it live.</p>
<p>Now, what do we mean by “start introducing” and “first batch of bundles”?</p>
<p>Well, right now this dynamic pricing system is available for 24 bundles in the store (you’ll find the full list in my comment below). We'll continue expanding this feature to more and more bundles – new and old – with the goal of eventually covering the vast majority (if not all) of them. You’ll know a bundle has dynamic pricing from the information displayed under its price on the game page.</p>
<p>Note: If you already own all components of a dynamically priced bundle, you’ll be able to “claim” that bundle in the store so it shows as owned.</p>
<p>You might also be wondering: What about various game editions that include base games + DLCs?</p>
<p>We completely agree that bringing dynamic pricing to those would be a huge improvement, for both you and us. It’s something we’re actively looking into, and we hope to expand the system in that direction. We can’t promise an ETA just yet, but we’re optimistic it’ll happen sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>That’s all for now! Give this new system a try, see how it works for you, and let us know what you think.</p>
<p>Thank you all for your support! :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They ended up <em>disabling</em> the system due to various problems with it, but now it's back and live and should be working properly with a few minor quirks they're still working out.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some of the bundles that have this enabled include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gog.com/game/resident_evil_bundle" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Resident Evil Bundle</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gog.com/game/warhammer_40k_bundle" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Warhammer 40K Bundle</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gog.com/game/divinity_original_sin_the_source_saga" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Divinity: Original Sin - The Source Saga</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gog.com/game/rollercoaster_tycoon_bundle" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">RollerCoaster Tycoon Bundle</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gog.com/game/myst_riven_the_definitive_collection" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Myst &amp; Riven: The Definitive Collection</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And there's more listed on the <a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG store</a>.</p>

      <title>Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 now Steam Deck Verified with a fresh update out to improve performance</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We've just had <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-now-steam-deck-verified-with-the-latest-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle get Steam Deck Verified</a> after an update, and now it's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 that's also seen a game upgrade and Valve bumping the rating to Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>The latest update to Marvel's Spider-Man 2 was released today, May 9th. In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2651280/view/530972044511150159" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> the developers noted: "This patch includes various performance optimizations and stability improvements based on player feedback.

<p>What's interesting is that is was previously Steam Deck Verified by Valve, and then <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/marvels-spider-man-2-has-lost-its-steam-deck-verified-rating/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">lost the rating back in March</a>.</p>
<p>Awesome. I haven't gotten around to it yet but it's on my list, big fan of the first game in the series. Wonderful to see patience pay off again to get the best form of it. Really good to see such big games do direct Steam Deck support like this.</p>

      <title>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle now Steam Deck Verified with the latest update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle from MachineGames / Bethesda Softworks has a fresh update out, and with it Valve have now rated it Steam Deck Verified. Nice to see more developers ensure their games work better.</p>
<p>Going by their Steam announcement, they've implemented a dedicated Steam Deck setting for the "Texture Pool Size", which will stop it overloading and causing the game to crash. Other settings have been left as they are. So this likely doesn't improve performance, and according to our pals at <a href="https://steamdeckhq.com/news/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-steam-deck-verified/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDeckHQ</a> there's still some loading time issues too. But at least it will now run properly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/717456821746786117gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>From the Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2677660/view/523090745159058326?l=english" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is now Verified for Steam Deck! Fresh game profiles will now default to optimized settings for running the game on Steam Deck.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Note:</strong> When running the game on Steam Deck, the “Texture Pool Size” is now set to a value called “Steam Deck” to avoid exceeding RAM limits that will crash the game. Other graphics options can still be adjusted to preference.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue where extremely rapid switching of your equipped items with the d-pad at the same time as picking other objects up could result in you permanently dropping important progression items such as your camera, lighter or whip. Players who have experienced this should find those items restored when launching the game with this hotfix installed</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Iraq cave door was closed when revisiting that level, preventing you from revisiting the main chamber</li>
<li>Improvements to DualSense wireless controller Adaptive Triggers to prevent them from quietly “clicking” when looking at friendly NPCs</li>
<li>Menu option added to allow modification of DualSense wireless controller Adaptive Trigger strength, including an “Off” option.
	<ul>
<li>Note: For Steam players, the game now has Steam Input defaulted to Off for PlayStation controllers, so that more players can discover the DualSense features on PC. If you wish to reenable Steam Input, you can do that from the Controller section of the game Properties in the Steam launcher</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the “Forgotten Page” activity note might fail to appear in Sunan’s hut in Sukhothai if you did not pick it up in the Hotel when first arriving in Sukhothai</li>
<li>Fixed one known cause of an issue preventing players from being given the “Archivist” achievement. Players should find that the achievement will pop as soon as gameplay is started after installing the hotfix. Other causes of this bug may exist; please contact Bethesda Support to share details if you continue to experience this issue</li>
</ul>

      <title>System76 COSMIC entering Beta soon and their Serval WS laptop gets a big upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>System76 have launched a brand new and upgraded Serval WS premium laptop that sounds delicious, and I have hardware envy now. Additionally, it seems their COSMIC desktop is due to expand soon.</p>
<p>Their new Serval WS laptop has display bump with a 16-inch, 2560×1600, 240Hz panel. Backed up by an NVIDIA RTX 5070 Ti that should cover all your needs from work to gaming. The processor has been upped as well with the Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU. <em>Overall it sounds like quite the little powerhouse.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18400669431746782846gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Spec highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU.</li>
<li>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 Ti.</li>
<li>Up to 96GB DDR5 RAM (5600 MHz). Base model is 32 GB DDR5 5600 MHz (2x16).</li>
<li>Up to 12TB PCIe 5.0 &amp; 4.0 storage. Base model is 1 TB PCIe4 (up to 5,000 MB/s read, 3,600 MB/s write).</li>
<li>16” 16:10 2K display at 240Hz.</li>
<li>2.5GbE Ethernet.</li>
<li>WiFi 7 + Bluetooth 5.4.</li>
<li>Your choice between:
	<ul>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS with full disk-encryption.</li>
<li>Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The price is a little eye-watering though as $2,999 being a premium high-spec laptop. From a smaller vendor it's not surprising but they also have some of the best Linux support of course. Shipping starts in late May.</p>
<p>As for the COSMIC desktop environment, their press release noted "System76 is working on COSMIC, their new open source desktop environment created for Pop!_OS. COSMIC is soon entering the beta phase. Once cleared for release, users can look forward to more battery life, cooler temperatures, more features, and an overall intuitive software experience."</p>

      <title>Steam Deck gets a Battery Charge Limit control in the latest Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a long time of users asking, Valve has actually added an official Battery Charge Limit setting in the latest Steam Deck Beta update so you no longer need to use third-party tools.</p>
<p>This is probably one of the most-requested features people have wanted to see. Very useful for keeping your battery healthy, especially if you're leaving it charged and docked all the time.</p>
<p>From the May 8th release notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added Battery Charge Limit control to Settings-&gt;Power
	<ul>
<li>This option allows you to set a maximum charge limit for your Steam Deck.</li>
<li>Limiting the charge limit to 80% can be beneficial for long term battery health. This can be useful if your Steam Deck is constantly being charged (i.e. docked), or very rarely has its battery depleted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Moved display dim and suspend timeout settings to Settings-&gt;Power.</li>
<li>Moved 'Show Battery Percentage' setting to Settings-&gt;Power.</li>
<li>Fixed pasting from on-screen keyboard.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Speculative Fix for rare DualSense Edge gyroscope related bug.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Paradox Interactive announce Europa Universalis V</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox Interactive / Paradox Tinto have today announced Europa Universalis V, the next in the series of their popular historical grand strategy games. They said that Paradox Tinto have been designing it over the last five years.</p>
<p>"Europa Universalis V has been crafted with the devoted Paradox fan in mind, incorporating feedback delivered by the fan community over a year of public discussion, and giving this dedicated audience a voice in the realization of this new vision. Europa Universalis V draws inspiration from the latest generation of Paradox historical titles, expanding the range of possibilities available for the largest and most detailed Europa Universalis game ever made. " - Paradox</p>
<p>Check out the announcement trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="MKaGSIm9juI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8a5f51c60c8e24e4d7a46aa69b7ab3d1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/MKaGSIm9juI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features of Europa Universalis V include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>A New and Larger Map: </strong>Using a more accurate map projection to better reflect the size of the continents, <em>Europa Universalis V</em> lets you choose from any of hundreds of different societies. Start as a mighty emperor or a local chieftain or warlord anywhere on earth. A more detailed map allows for a greater number of nations and more varied topographical features.</li>
<li><strong>A Longer Time Scale: </strong>The game’s campaign starts in 1337, the year of the opening of the Hundred Years’ War - the great struggle over the French crown that marked the zenith of the late Medieval era. Lead your nation through the Renaissance, the Enlightenment and other historical ages, choosing how you will adjust to an ever changing world.</li>
<li><strong>Population Based System: </strong>Departing from the familiar province-focused system of earlier games in the series, <em>Europa Universals V</em> represents the population of each province in detail. Manage cultural and religious tensions in your realm, deal with estates as they wax and wane in power, and meet the basic and luxury demands of this varied population.</li>
<li><strong>Thousands of Historical Events: </strong>Watch history unfold before you as the great moments of the past make their mark on your game. Dynamically responding to the game situation, these historical events challenge players to repeat or improve on the great accomplishments of the past.</li>
<li><strong>Detailed Production and Trade System: </strong>Build farms, plantations, crafting buildings and factories to provide goods to satisfy your economic and military needs. Or, if your nation can’t provide the things you need, trade for them from neighboring nations.Some buildings require specific goods to be in supply, so you either invest in new industries or make a deal with your neighbors. Use roads, ports and fleets to expand your trading region and enrich your nation by managing the wealth of the world.</li>
<li><strong>Design a Nation to Suit Your Situation: </strong>Adopt policies and laws to adapt to your situation as you discover new technologies and ideas. Move towards greater centralization or a looser power sharing arrangement. Build an army based on masses of manpower or a more elite professional force. Will you be tolerant of other faiths and cultures, or advocate for a single faith and single culture? A world of possibilities awaits you.</li>
<li><strong>Deep Military and Diplomatic Systems: </strong>Dominate the world through either sword or pen. Rally mercenaries, levies or professional soldiers to your flag as you cut a blood path through history. But be careful! A bloody war fought with levies has a direct impact on your population. Consider a lighter touch, using royal marriages, trade treaties and alliances to expand your power and preserve peace.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>What's not currently clear is if it will have Native Linux support like previous in-house stuff from Paradox. Steam only currently lists Windows PC as supported. I've reached out to Paradox PR to clarify if we'll need to use Proton for this.</p>
<p>There's currently no release date announced for it yet.</p>

      <title>Control an interstellar train in the deck-builder Break Siege out now in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another strategy game with trains? Sign me up. Break Siege from FojoGames just hit Early Access and looks like it could be another good one.<em> If you missed them a few others I found with trains recently were <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/apocalypse-express-is-a-challenging-train-combat-management-roguelike-with-a-demo-you-need-to-try/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Apocalypse Express</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/build-a-train-to-expand-your-deck-and-fight-off-bandits-in-the-demo-for-fogpiercer/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fogpiercer</a>.</em></p>
<p>With each game being a fresh procedurally generated adventure, it's different each time. Here you build up your train as you go, and then engage in explosive real-time battles using various cards. Your train is a bit special too, being able to travel between planets and all. As you progress through it you'll go through various different events, and build up a team of mercenaries to buff you.</p>

      <title>In the survivorlike ARPG &#39;Conquest Dark&#39; you start off nude and build up clothing as you go with multi-life mechanics</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just what the survivorlike bullet heaven genre thingy needed - nudity! Conquest Dark from Eldritch Sword Games actually has quite a number of fun game mechanics worth exploring, the nudity is optional but it has a point. Tested on Desktop Linux with Proton, it works perfectly. <em>Note: personal purchase.</em></p>
<p>To be clear; by default your character will have some underwear on, which you can toggle off in the settings. What's the point then? The developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3238670/discussions/0/594022012433734268/#c594022012433735024" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wanted the world to feel dark, primal, and brutal, and also create strong contrast between the character's initial state and the state at which you end up after acquiring power. The most primal state you can start is naked, just with your fists as weapons, and then progress to a god-like champion with golden armor and a flaming sword.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds fair enough to me. It's not like staring at a willy or boobs is the focus of the game, it's about showing how vulnerable you start off in it. Then again, the same feeling can be gained from seeing you suit-up as you continually level-up from underwear (but hey, options are nice?). You even start off by picking between different undressed characters of different classes, races and genders each with their own set of different initial stats.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Uq7-6ZAYU6E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1762ea94bd3ed98fcf326e2f3d46056f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Uq7-6ZAYU6E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>That's a very nicely crafted trailer too that really helps sell it I think.</em></p>
<p>This was an accidental discovery of mine when browsing Bluesky, coming <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/madmushroom.gg/post/3lolqqaqccs24" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">across a post</a> from the developer where they recently announced they've managed to sell over 63,000 units in the first week of release. They've built up a Very Positive rating on Steam already too and I can clearly see why — I'm already hooked on it.</p>
<p>Conquest Dark has multiple game mechanics that I think are interesting to genuinely make it feel a bit different, and a bit more like a proper ARPG blended with the features popularised by Vampire Survivors. In a way, it's a little bit more like the excellent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/fight-off-the-immense-hordes-in-halls-of-torment-1-0-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Halls of Torment</a> for building up the character with items as you go, although in much smaller more claustrophobic arenas more like the also great <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/brotato-10-is-out-now-and-its-a-damn-good-time/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Brotato</a>.</p>
<p>Actually seeing your chosen character go from wiggling their bits to the world, to being covered in clothing and armour might seem like a small thing on the surface, but it really helps add to that feeling of becoming overpowered that the genre is much loved for.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/915839641746705032gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/915839641746705032gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/609577601746705970gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/609577601746705970gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's so many different types of character builds that you can do that makes the repeated runs really fun, making me itch just to give it another go. My favourite run in it so far was with a bow that I powered up to fire shots that bounce between enemies, while also sometimes setting them ablaze, with multiple multi-shot abilities and constantly picked a buff to my attack speed on level-up that I was just firing arrows constantly and it got quite hilarious. Very satisfying to hear the constant crunch of my arrows tearing through skeletons.</p>
<p>You have a dodge ability in the game too, which you can also power up and turn it into something else. You could make it so as an archer to fire off multiple arrows when you dodge, or completely change it into a leap as a barbarian when you smash down into a group of enemies, which is especially fun if you go through the upgrades to get multiple charges and just repeatedly leap around the arena. There's so many different ways to power-up differently each time.</p>
<p>Here you also get to start with 10 lives. Each life lost results in a health reset, but you'll begin bleeding more and more to have your health go down faster, eventually to your death. There's various ways to counter it (apart from not repeatedly dying) like ability buffs to reduce bleeding, or abilities that end up spawning lots of healing orbs. It doesn't make it all that difficult, but just an interesting life system that keeps you on your toes a bit.</p>
<p>True to the genre, the more you play of it the more of it you'll unlock. You play across a map with different nodes, with each node being split between arena fights, altars you can pop resources into to power up some more, obelisks to power up the enemies to give yourself an added challenge (and some extra resources) and more. When you manage to fully complete an arena fight, you'll also unlock more of the game like extra character classes and abilities.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16983106471746706060gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16983106471746706060gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's not perfected yet though. It's Early Access, so rough edges are to be expected, and in some ways the overall content is limited but there's enough there for hours and hours to play right now. My main wish for it is to have some more arenas that are faster, as in general the game is a bit on the slower side.</p>
<p>The new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3238670/view/523090745159057457" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">roadmap</a> that's been put up has me excited for the future additions too like new events, new weapons and armour, a new class and more.</p>
<p>For a solo developer, this is really impressive and continues to show how you can do a lot with a little.</p>

<p>With the Early Access release they said it will have 3 fully interactive levels to explore with many different types of quests. During EA they'll be adding in more rooms, more customization, new challenges and game modes, an expanded story and potentially multiplayer.

      <title>Palworld devs confirm game changes due to the Nintendo / Pokemon lawsuit</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As we all suspected, recent changes to Palworld game mechanics were as a direct result of the ongoing lawsuit filed against developer Pocketpair from Nintendo / The Pokemon Company.</p>
<p>Their <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20250508" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a> posted on X and their official company website reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We would like to express our sincere gratitude and appreciation for the continued support of our fans over the past few months. We apologize for not being able to share as much information as we would like, but we trust our fans understand how difficult it is to be fully transparent while litigation is ongoing.</p>
<p>Currently, we remain involved in prolonged legal proceedings regarding alleged patent infringement. We continue to dispute these claims and assert the invalidity of the patents in question. However, we have had to make certain compromises in order to avoid disruptions to the development and distribution of Palworld.</p>
<p>On November 30th, 2024, we released Patch v0.3.11 for Palworld. This patch removed the ability to summon Pals by throwing Pal Spheres and instead changed it to a static summon next to the player. Several other game mechanics were also changed with this patch. As many have speculated, these changes were indeed a result of the ongoing litigation. Everyone here at Pocketpair was disappointed that this adjustment had to be made, and we fully understand that many players feel the same frustration. Unfortunately, as the alternative would have led to an even greater deterioration of the gameplay experience for players, it was determined that this change was necessary.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we regret to inform our players that with the implementation of Patch v0.5.5, we must make yet another compromise. From this patch onward, gliding will be performed using a glider rather than with Pals. Pals in the player's team will still provide passive buffs to gliding, but players will now need to have a glider in their inventory in order to glide.<br/>
We understand that this will be disappointing for many, just as it is for us, but we hope our fans understand that these changes are necessary in order to prevent further disruptions to the development of Palworld.</p>
<p>We also want to extend our apologies to our fans for the discomfort and concern this ongoing litigation has caused.<br/>
We remain committed to developing Palworld and delivering exciting new content to our fans.<br/>
<br/>
On behalf of everyone at Pocketpair and Team Palworld, thank you again for your continued support.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><div class="itemdb_embed"><p><strong><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/itemdb/app/40377/palworld/">Palworld</a></strong> | Release Date: 19th January 2024<p class="plain-list-title">Official links:</p><ul><li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/">Steam</a></li></ul></p></div></p>
<hr/>
<p>Regardless of my opinion on Palworld as a game, and how I feel about Nintendo handling this, I think that the whole idea of game mechanics being able to be locked behind a patent so only one company can use it are ridiculous. Just look at the Nemesis system from Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor. Such things should simply not be allowed. The system is not fit for purpose.</p>

      <title>SILENT HILL 2 remake gets a surprise GOG release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Out of nowhere <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/silent_hill_2" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG added the SILENT HILL 2 remake</a> from Bloober Team SA and KONAMI, so now more people get to play this highly rated horror DRM-free. It's also 30% off for a whole week too which is the joint cheapest it has been with the Steam release.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="K5JX6fufUVU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/64bff1c4ef9161bfdca0328bd3dde02a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/K5JX6fufUVU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<blockquote>
<h5>High-end Graphics and Sound</h5>
<p>With ray tracing and other cutting-edge technical enhancements, the world of SILENT HILL and its unsettling ambiance is even realer than before.</p>
<p>And with the inclusion of new, immersive soundscapes, you'll feel like you're standing in the thick of it.</p>
<h5>Larger Environments</h5>
<p>Explore locations and buildings that were once inaccessible, or are newly added in the remake.</p>
<p>Enjoy the same acclaimed story, even while you experience the town of Silent Hill with fresh eyes across an expanded map.</p>
<h5>Over-the-shoulder Camera</h5>
<p>The remake moves from the original's fixed-camera viewpoints to an over-the-shoulder perspective, putting you closer to what James sees, for a more thrilling, more immersive experience as you explore the town and come face-to-face with monsters.</p>
<h5>Evolved Combat Gameplay</h5>
<p>Familiar weapons like the steel pipe and handgun make their return, but now with an updated combat system.</p>
<p>Avoid attacks with carefully timed dodges, aim down sights, and more, making monster encounters more engaging and nerve-wracking than ever.</p>

      <title>Mesa 25.1 open source graphics drivers are out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Eric Engestrom today officially announced the full release of Mesa 25.1, bringing with it plenty of upgrades for open source graphics drivers.</p>
<p>As always, if you want a stable experience it's likely best to wait for the first bug-fix release with Mesa 25.1.1, which is due in about two weeks on May 21st.</p>
<p>From the release announcement Engestrom mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the big news in this release is that the Asahi driver has been fully mainlined into Mesa, as its UAPI was merged into the kernel. This means that custom builds are no longer needed for distros that want to support Apple hardware.</p>
<p>Panfrost also gained support for Mali G720/G925, and YCbCr support in PanVK for v10+ GPUs (Gxxx).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally:</p>
<blockquote>

      <title>Valve developers continue to impress, fixing Proton in less than a day for the Starfield Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bethesda have released a surprise Beta update for Starfield. The update brings with it numerous bug fixes, Creation Kit upgrades and there's even a new Very Low graphics setting option.</p>
<p>What's impressive here is how fast Valve and their contracted developers work. I <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/7064#issuecomment-2855560418" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a> the issue with the new Starfield Beta crashing on load on both Desktop Linux and Steam Deck only 18 hours ago, where you just saw an error message like this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6264289251746622666gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6264289251746622666gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>There's <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/dxil-spirv/issues/225#issuecomment-2858069497" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">already</a> a fix available from developer Hans-Kristian Arntzen. You have to use the "bleeding-edge" Beta of Proton Experimental to play it though, until a new release of Proton Experimental is out properly.</p>
<p>You need to find Proton Experimental in your Steam Library. Go to the Properties, Betas and select "bleeding-edge" (it should be first in the list). Although, keep in mind this will then use the bleeding-edge Beta for any game that's set to Proton Experimental.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18318879001746622865gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18318879001746622865gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16956782961746622866gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16956782961746622866gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Don't expect this new Very Low graphics setting to really help it much on Steam Deck though, it's still performing terrible in my test running through New Atlantis today. Constantly below 30FPS across all upscaling methods, but at least for other areas of the game it might just make it that tiny bit more playable.</p>
<p>Nice to see Bethesda aren't entirely done with Starfield for anyone still interested in playing it through, but I don't think there's any chance of them truly turning it around.</p>

      <title>15 years after being cancelled, pirate-themed action game Captain Blood is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Preservation is important for video games, but that often focuses on games that have been released. Here's a nice win for some developers though, as Captain Blood has managed to get released after being cancelled in 2010.</p>
<p>The game started development in the early 2000s, and then in early 2010 it was cancelled but publisher SNEG managed to help it cross the finishing line. Founded in 2021, SNEG, for those that don't know, is a tiny publisher started by former GOG staff. They're so small they don't even have a proper online presence but they work to bring back older games.</p>
<p>With the release they've even made sure it works well on Steam Deck. Valve have yet to rate it but they said "For those who want to play it on Steam Deck - do it. The game fully supports it. The interface, font size, controller support, and resolution have been adapted to provide the best possible experience from day one".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="GB68zXbKIBo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/73e3335d6b73878df07a417fc362df5a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/GB68zXbKIBo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The game is a peculiar mixture of God of War blended with a pirate ship battles like an early Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, and that might be enough to sell me on it. You just have to keep in mind the game design is very much rooted in the earlier 2000s with Xbox 360 era visuals. <em>A proper old school hack and slash.</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Epic Pirate Shenanigans: As Captain Blood, live the life of the bravest and most fearsome pirate on the Spanish Main (or at least fake it convincingly).</li>
<li>Intense Action: Dive into fiery hand-to-hand combat and show enemy pirates and landlubbers alike who's the boss with various slick combat techniques.</li>
<li>Ship Deck Brawls: Fight off enemy pirates trying to board your ship with unique moves, combos, and executions while blasting enemy ships to pieces with your cannons!</li>
<li>Arsenal of Awesomeness: Arm yourself with cutlasses, pistols, muskets, throwing knives, and hand bombs. Don’t forget those sneaky pirate tricks!</li>
<li>Graphic Novel Vibes: Enjoy a unique art style that feels like you're flipping through a pirate comic book.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Don&#39;t sleep on Cataclismo, building up fortresses like LEGO to defend against hordes is great</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cataclismo is a game where you design and build a fortress to face off against waves of enemy hordes. The LEGO-like building system is a lot of fun, really letting your creativity shine. That is, until all your beautiful staircases and walls inevitably come crumbling down. <em>Note: key via the publisher.</em></p>
<p>It was in Early Access and just in March hit the 1.0 release and I've been having a lot of fun with this. The story campaign isn't really what sells this one at all. I mean, it's a nice way to play-through it, but all I want to do is sit and build awesome looking castles in a LEGO-like fashion until the sun goes down. Just to watch all my archers reign down hell on the approaching horrors.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10021925481746619011gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The gameplay loop here is just endlessly satisfying. As you build up your defences with each individual brick, and there's many different types of bricks and different materials for quick or strong builds, watching it all come together is seriously slick. Even when things go wrong, and everything comes crumbling down (which it will, eventually), that's also just pure satisfaction to watch. So many stairs though, everything needs stairs. So you're going to end up with lots of them and it's a bit chaotic when those come crashing down and you're trying to reroute your people around to ensure the rest of it doesn't go with it.</p>
<p>Elevation is the key here, with different troops needing different levels, which is again where your block placing design will come into it to make full use of everyone you have.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yUL1zq9L89s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/759ca814b11379988c803853988c9924.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yUL1zq9L89s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>An incredibly atmospheric game, with a simple yet inviting style that lets you focus on what it does best. You can get a lot of hours of building and tower defence out of this one spread across the campaign, the skirmish battle mode across different maps and the endless mode to see just how far you can go.</p>
<p>Easily one of the best horde defence games out there thanks to the modular building system. A real gem you shouldn't skip over. It works <em>great</em> on Desktop Linux with Proton. Valve also rated it Steam Deck Playable but doesn't really seem like a good fit on the handheld.</p>

      <title>A Slight Chance of Sawblades is a fun high-score chaser with a demo out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For readers who like their smaller, faster more casual high-score chasers you'll want to check out A Slight Chance of Sawblades. Chinykian Games just put up a demo you can try out which has a Linux version available.</p>
<p>It's raining sawblades in this one. In a tiny little box arena you have to run, dodge and double-jump over them all to last as long as possible, while also gathering tickets to unlock more. The demo offers 1 out of the 3 currently planned modes, and a small slice of the characters, sawblades and backgrounds you can unlock.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="KzSX2JbebcY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8699946cdad4ac25eca52ac334231d3a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/KzSX2JbebcY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Full game highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Game Modes</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Classic Mode</strong> - Jump over sawblades to score points. Do it fast to regain time and delay the inevitable Sudden Death!</li>
<li><strong>Phantom Mode</strong> - The player character is invisible in this mode! Rely on your superior spatial reasoning skills to survive in this unforgiving mode!</li>
<li><strong>Barrage Mode</strong> - Once spawned, every sawblade stays in the room forever. This mode is the very definition of the word "Overwhelming"!</li>
</ul>
<p>Features</p>
<ul>
<li>Skill-based score-chasing action.</li>
<li>High-speed arcade gameplay with time pressure.</li>
<li>Juicy 8-bit style music.</li>
<li>Unlockable characters.</li>
<li>Unlockable game modes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A small and sweet indie game worth blasting through on your coffee-breaks. There's no date set for the full version yet but do give the demo a try and see how high you can make it. I'm useless at it, I've played for a lot longer than expected, determined to get higher and better at it but I'm just getting sliced to pieces. </p>

      <title>Hordes of Hunger turns Vampire Survivors into a fast 3D slasher from devs of Blood West</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With combat that feels more like a faster and slashier Diablo / Path of Exile, the latest game from Hyperstrange is Hordes of Hunger and so far it's a lot of fun. <em>Note: key provided for me.</em></p>
<p>Yes, I know, it really does seem like <em>everyone</em> is trying their hand at making some kind of survivorlike thing, but hey this is another one that actually feels a whole lot different. Not only is it actual proper 3D, but it's much more of an arena hack and slasher just with the progression style of Vampire Survivors with all the orb collecting and ridiculously overpowering yourself.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5980126091746610776gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>One fun addition here is also the quest system. During your run through each map, it will sprinkle in some quests for you to do while you're trying to slice your way through an increasingly powerful and varied horde of monsters. </p>
<p>Not a big fan of the camera system in it currently though, with constantly spinning it around to see enemies coming at me. There's two different camera types. One that's more like a third-person action game that's fully manual, which they say is more developed and one more experimental they said is more like Vampire Survivors with the view pulled up higher and the camera moves slightly by itself to help you (but you can still manually move it). Neither feel particularly great right now.</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Take up Arms</strong> - Craft your own unique build with a range of weapons and special attacks, from a nimble swordfighter to a heavy hammer-wielder. From the castle keep to the desolate remains of your village, fight smart and use the environment to your advantage with choke points, high ground, and breakable structures.</li>
<li><strong>Overcome the Horde</strong> - The monsters are unrelenting, but so are you. Gain destructive and defensive abilities with each level-up to become a finely tuned force to be reckoned with. Strike down swarms with sword aflame, call down lightning as you land, and defy death with divine contracts.</li>
<li><strong>Uncover the Truth</strong> - A father racked with guilt. A prisoner who shuns freedom. A mother covered in blood. Mirah may be the only one who can save her home, but she's not alone. Complete missions in each run to save others from the invasion and discover the true nature of the curse that plagues Mirah’s homeland.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Tested on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 25.04) it's been smooth slashing on this one. No Linux specific issue, Proton just runs it like any other game. Click and play.</p>
<p>It's now in Early Access, and as you might expect there's plenty of rough edges, but seriously promising. They're estimating six months of Early Access to add in more quests, new weapons, new enemies, new maps, new skill tress and more.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px">If you love powering up characters during repeat runs and seeing how ridiculous things can get, this might be the game for you.</span></p>

      <title>Wipeout-like anti-grav racer BallisticNG v1.4 out now bringing lots of new content and Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Even though it was Steam Deck Verified <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/the-wipeout-like-racer-ballisticng-gets-steam-deck-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in February</a>, that was Valve testing against an opt-in Beta (which is a bit weird) but now the big release is here for the anti-gravity racer BallisticNG. This update makes it easily one of the best racers of this type available today.</p>
<p>The 1.4 release brings with it a whole new series of ships along with their own different physics, AI improvements, modding improvements, various changes to improve it on Steam Deck like UI scaling along with a redesigned UI, various new tracks to race through, tweaks to existing tracks, new music, upgrades to the photo mode, lots of improvements to multiplayer and the list goes on. It really is a big upgrade for the game.</p>
<p>Check out the release trailer:</p>

      <title>Metal Thunder puts you in a the gunner seat of an AC-130 with progression popularised by Vampire Survivors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is quite a unique experience. Merging the progression system made popular by Vampire Survivors, with the aerial combat of Call of Duty’s AC-130 missions. Metal Thunder definitely has a fun idea to it. <em>Note: the developer sent a key.</em></p>
<p>Currently in Early Access with it regular updates, I've been having a blast and I've ended up getting quite into it, as it's surprisingly challenging and engrossing trying to get through and survive all the missions as you defend various bases from enemy attacks. Building up an array of different weapons, some of which you can really overpower to rain down some pretty intense looking action.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HIuDzadXPZw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9fa14e07606af7c150b3d29458b54095.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HIuDzadXPZw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>However, there is a <em>stain</em> against it in my book. One I didn't realise until after I had played it. The developer has used generative AI. The Steam store pages notes "We use AI to create store page and some in-game render assets". Speaking to the developer to clarify this, they told me "It's generally for promotional materials, as I don't currently have the budget to hire an artist part/full time yet. It will be phased out in due time".</p>
<p>That still makes me feel really uneasy. I really do hate generative AI being used in games, but I also <em>can't</em> ignore the fact that I've been really enjoying this, hence the uneasy feeling about it. </p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>AC-130 Gunship Combat - Command an AC-130, delivering powerful strikes to defend against relentless enemy waves.</li>
<li>20-Minute Survival Missions - Survive intense, escalating battles where every decision matters.</li>
<li>Procedural Enemy Waves - Fresh challenges each time with random enemy formations.</li>
<li>Upgrades and Abilities - Customize your gunship with powerful upgrades to fit your playstyle.</li>
<li>Unique Operations - Battle across 4 distinct locations at launch with unique objectives in Survival.</li>
<li>Endless Survival Mode - Test your endurance with waves that never stop.</li>
<li>High Replayability - Randomized waves, upgrades, and missions keep the gameplay fresh.</li>
<li>Immersive Visuals and Sound - Experience realistic effects, including a white-hot infrared view for night ops.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Tested on Desktop Linux with Valve's Proton it worked without an issue.</p>

      <title>Detective Dotson is a mystery adventure that&#39;s a love letter to India worth exploring out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a setting that not many games explore, Detective Dotson is a fresh adventure from Masala Games that's out now with Linux support. India is brought to life with some lovely pixel artwork in this new release, it's really quite eye-catching. <em>Note: key provided by the developer.</em></p>
<p>Not a point and click adventure though, this one is a side-scroller where you go through fun little quirky cases that eventually builds up to the darker main overall theme of what happened to your Father. This is a great little casual adventure for people to dive into.</p>
<p>One that gets you to think a little as you build up your evidence board on cases, but not overwhelming and not particularly difficult either. It's all about connecting the dots together, paying attention and exploring a bit of modern India. Check out the launcher trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="KKuNFY6ZeWg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2c8c48e4d43340bfd58891dde1738e14.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/KKuNFY6ZeWg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Play across 4 cases and 4 mini-games, that will see you through around 5 hours of gameplay. It's not too short, and doesn't overstay its welcome, feels just about right.</p>
<p>Speaking about the game and the setting, the Game Director mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Storefronts are filled to the brim with a dime a dozen pixelated pleasures so why should you give ours a try? In a word: home. </p>
<p>You see, 18 percent of the world lives in India — our home. It’s the most diverse and interesting place on the planet. But, you really don’t get to see it in games much do you? We’re pretty much non-existent. So we took it upon ourselves at Masala Games to fix that. </p>
<p>We want to bring our home to you.</p>
<p>India is often (incorrectly) shown as poor or ancient, in media.<br/>
We want to tell stories from modern India — and represent our home more appropriately.</p>
<p>Detective Dotson is a love letter to India! Welcome to our home.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, they even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zplMliWFpc" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">released an animated movie</a> too (English subtitles), which takes place before the game to give some extra context. You don't need to watch it but I thought it was a pretty fun addition to the world.</p>

      <title>World of Goo 2 gets fixes for Steam Deck and now works offline</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>World of Goo 2 from 2D BOY / Tomorrow Corporation has a small update that's been released, cleaning up some issues reported by players and making it run better on Steam Deck. The game came to Steam and other stores on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/world-of-goo-2-is-out-now-on-steam-and-a-great-pick-for-puzzle-game-fans/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">April 25th and it's really great</a>.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The May update for the game highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Offline mode.</li>
<li>Sound initialization.</li>
<li>Steamdeck fixes.</li>
<li>Error display.</li>
</ul>

<p>Turns out, the game <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3385670/discussions/0/601902918586626263/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">wouldn't work</a> if you had Steam set to offline mode. Now it will. Just a nice little fix for players on handhelds.</p>

<p>Bringing some big changes down from Preview, SteamOS 3.7.5 for Steam Deck now in Beta as Valve work towards getting it in the stable release for all Steam Deck players and then eventually the<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> public SteamOS release for more hardware</a>. <em>This is still only supported on Steam Deck for now.</em></p>

      <title>Valve rolls out SteamVR 2.10 with quick recenter, reduced controller and physics jitter and Linux fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

<p>For those of you doing SteamVR on Linux, leave a comment on how you're finding the experience at the moment.</p>
<p>I just recently moved my office around, and finally mounted my second SteamVR Base Station for my Valve Index onto a wall instead of resting on a unit. And made some extra space for a bit more room, so hopefully I'll be doing a lot more VR soon. Although, I do hope whatever the Deckard ends up being doesn't need the Base Stations as it would open it up for a lot more people. And, especially, if it will use Linux like we've seen leaked for a standalone mode, my high hope there is that Valve are sitting on some bigger SteamVR improvements for Linux to come.</p>

      <title>Playtron wanted to take on Windows and SteamOS with their GameOS, now they&#39;re announcing a cryptocurrency</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Reading the press release sounded like a late April Fools joke, but I think we all saw where Playtron were heading. After <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/playtron-plan-to-launch-playtronos-a-linux-based-system-for-gaming/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">originally announcing PlaytronOS</a> (now GameOS), their Linux-powered gaming system, they're now directly moving into crypto.</p>
<p><em>Because of course they are and to the surprise of no one I think.</em></p>
<p>They've previously released a few Alpha builds, gathering funding from a few investors (like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/square-enix-invests-in-playtron-for-their-linux-based-playtronos-first-alpha-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Square Enix</a>) and talked a lot of big talk to the point that I'm sure some people were originally excited about Playtron — somewhere out there anyway. Especially considering they pulled in developers working on various popular open source stuff like Lutris, Heroic Games Launcher, ChimeraOS, Box64 and others. However, this continued crypto nonsense makes me continue to believe it won't go anywhere outside of the crypto-bro crowd.</p>
<p>They're calling it Game Dollar, a "stablecoin" that will be used in GameOS to power purchases, subscriptions, and rewards across Playtron "and other gaming ecosystems in the future". And this goes back directly to the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/the-first-handheld-to-use-playtronos-is-some-web3-thing-the-suiplay0x1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">incredibly weird web3 SuiPlay0x1 handheld</a> that will ship with Playtron's GameOS. They're doing this with support from the stablecoin platform <a href="https://www.m0.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">M0</a> and payments platform Bridge.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“Playtron's GameOS reimagines how we play the games we love. Through this lens it became clear: stablecoins will become a financial backbone for the $500B global gaming economy. That’s why Playtron is excited to announce Game Dollar, the stablecoin built for games and ready to handle massive transaction volume over the next decade,” said Kirt McMaster, co-founder and CEO of Playtron. “Game Dollar will unlock new economic models for developers and marketplaces while enabling consumer incentives only possible via programmable dollars.”</p>
<p>“Programmable stablecoins are the next evolution of digital assets, and Game Dollar is a powerful example of how this innovation unlocks utility for one of the world’s most dynamic sectors,” said Adeniyi Abiodun, Co-Founder and CPO of Mysten Labs. “We’re witnessing the start of a new era where gamers not only play, but participate in dynamic, self-sustaining economies.”</p>
<p>“We’re excited to see Playtron harness M0’s universal stablecoin platform to reimagine the gaming payments experience in a unique way,” said Luca Prosperi, co-founder and CEO at M0. “This collaboration highlights the power of programmable money applied to real-world use cases, and our vision is that this is how the payments and rewards experiences of the future will look like.”</p>
<p>“Gaming is a global community, and financial access shouldn't be a barrier. With Bridge powering seamless entry and exit points for Game Dollar, we're making digital economies more inclusive for players—and radically simpler for developers,” said Zach Abrams, CEO at Bridge. “They get stable, ready-to-use payments infrastructure that takes care of compliance and enables a global reach out of the box.”</p>
<hr/>
<p>At this point, if you're interested in Linux gaming or any kind of alternative to Windows, you're going to be much better off looking elsewhere. Unless crypto is your thing, I guess. Like Valve's own <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS when it eventually gets a public Beta</a>, or <a href="https://bazzite.gg/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bazzite</a>.</p>
<p>When it comes to hardware vendors for PCs, handhelds and more, what are they going to pick? There's Microsoft's Windows, Valve's SteamOS, various other forms of Linux, or weird <em>crypto-fuelled</em> Linux? I really just cannot imagine a serious normal hardware vendor ever jumping in for this.</p>

      <title>Starless Abyss is a seriously cool Eldritch-themed space strategy deckbuilder out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>My new favourite deck-builder? Could well be. Starless Abyss released late in April from Konafa Games and No More Robots blending together the worlds of Eldritch horror and deck-builders in a space strategy theme. <em>Note: key provided by the publisher.</em></p>
<p>I love deck-builders, strategy games and everything space sci-fi so this game is like a little dream for me. Blending together a little from the likes of Slay the Spire, FTL and Into the Breach for the mechanics and theme it's been a huge surprise that really deserves a lot more eyes on it.</p>
<p><em>Tested on Kubuntu Linux (25.04), it works perfectly with Valve's Proton.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7799698821746537472gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Starting off like any good deck-builder you pick your captain, which comes with unique skills and off you go to fight off the Eldritch-themed space horrors that are breaking down reality and causing all sorts of trouble. Then we get to the satisfying gameplay loop where you pick between locations to travel, each with their own different rewards and engage in turn-based card-based combat.</p>
<p>During combat you'll position your ships around a grid each turn, and then play various cards that each have a different energy cost (energy is replenished each turn). What I really liked for the battles is that cards can be used by any ship in your fleet, but ships <em>individually</em> build up heat and so might be unable to use certain cards. It's up to you to balance the heat on each ship and thankfully there's cards that can reduce the heat build up, which also goes down each new turn too.</p>
<p>As you face off against the space horrors and destroy them, they don't just get removed from the grid. They'll leave a floating carcass which will block movement and line of sight, so you need to deal with that too. Positioning really is important. Being able to hover over a ship and see what enemies plan is also a nice touch, something I'm glad other games took from games like Slay the Spire so you can keep planning ahead but it doesn't make it easy.</p>
<p>The events system is a unique one here too. You get special Dice (D.I.C.E), which allow you to bend reality to increase your odds during the events. They won't guarantee you get everything though, and they're a limited resource, but a sweet tweak for an events system.</p>
<p>You get to upgrade your fleet as the game goes on too. There's a shipyard where you can buy new ships to replace one of your current set and each with their own amount of movement, armour, heat and health. Add to that the relics system, where you can give each ship their own set of special buffs (like giving all near ships a shield every turn) and there's a lot of room to really change your play-through on every run.</p>
<p>Another quite clever addition are the Ritual cards. These powerful one-time bonus cards allow you to do certain actions but they come with a cost. They cause other cards to <em>malfunction</em>, which is a nuisance, but they're often necessary for survival and the malfunctions only last for the current combat.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vFmuGZQGKPo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/15866a95e4ed4d730ea24751394daefb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vFmuGZQGKPo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Awaken a Proxima with unique skills and downfalls to help you to take on the horrors.</li>
<li>Command a fleet of upgradable ships across the universe.</li>
<li>Make pivotal decisions when encountering obstacles between combat, which could help boost or decapitate your run.</li>
<li>6 different factions of cards can be combined, collected and combo-ed to defeat the horrors in your own way.</li>
<li>Control your fate using D.I.C.E to increase your chances of survival during random encounters</li>
<li>Embrace the occult using ritual cards to powerfully destroy and beat the competition.</li>
<li>Earn credits to buy and upgrade your cards•Unlock artifacts on your run to transform your ships powers•Unlock multiple different Proxima’s, each with their own unique set of skills and downfalls.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Really crispy pixel art mixed with some great turn-based combat, a thoroughly weird but interesting premise all wrapped up in some pretty cool tunes. Love it. Absolutely worth getting.</p>
<p>It's out now and there's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3450230/Starless_Abyss_Demo/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">also a demo</a>.</p>

      <title>Horror adventure ASYLUM updated for Steam Deck and on the way to being Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Senscape continue to tweak their supernatural horror adventure ASYLUM, with a recent update making a few changes to be on the way to getting it Steam Deck Verified. Also, the developer is still working on the Native Linux version.</p>
<p>Back in April the developer noted in a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/230210/view/564746584593531844" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> that they fixed a "softlock in the morgue" for players using Proton but it's a "temporary patch while we keep working on the native Linux/Steam Deck version". While work on that continues, they also just released <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/asylum/announcements/detail/501698013135110643" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">another</a> patch over the weekend to improve it overall on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Latest patch notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New: Now fully <strong>Playable</strong> on Steam Deck! Only a few tweaks left related to font sizes to get the coveted <strong>Verified</strong> status next.</li>
<li>New: Full controller support validated! Moving the cursor during close-ups with a gamepad should feel much smoother now.</li>
<li>Fix: Greatly improved detection of a connected gamepad to properly show tutorials and input tips.</li>
<li>Fix: Menu settings wouldn't properly detect fullscreen status. Now they do.</li>
<li>Fix: A non-essential transitional cutscene late in the game was missing following a previous fix. It has been reinstated in all its cutscene-y glory.</li>
<li>Fix: Also, 2 frames were fixed in the aforementioned cutscene. No idea what this means, I'm going to trust the changelist on this one.</li>
<li>Fix: That puzzle in the topmost floor still had a few issues involving the timing of certain sound effects. No more.</li>
<li>Fix: Annoyingly, the head bobbing effect persisted while the menu was opened, making it difficult select stuff. Luckily for you, we are now sparing this annoyance.</li>
<li>Fix: Increased tab size in notepad, which is specially useful for the Steam Deck. No, it wasn't you and you don't need glasses, the text was indeed too small.</li>
<li>Fix: Fonts scale better now in lower resolutions, including the menu. Again, another win for Steam Deck!</li>
</ul>

      <title>BULLET YEETERS is an upcoming miniature-mayhem toy-scale PvP fragfest </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm always on the lookout for a good online shooter that works well on Linux Desktop / Steam Deck and BULLET YEETERS is high up on the list of games that could be great. A shooter of miniature mayhem, with a toy-scale with you and others running around big rooms across various game modes.</p>
<p>The developers say clearly it will support Steam Deck, and the PR email mentioned "native Steam Deck support" (which I've asked for clarification on). More details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bullet Yeeters pays tribute to a classic trope in competitive shooters - shrinking its cast down and turning any messy room into an ever-shifting battleground. With beefy guns and a wide cast of characters with their own powers to turn the tide, it’s not just the bullets that are getting thrown around here. Yeet yourself into action with Bullet Yeeters’ funky-fresh jetpack mechanics. Blast into the air at any point, pick your landing spot and launch to high shelves, dense cover or straight in your opponent’s face for a friendly buckshot greeting!</p>
<p>Bullet Yeeters is designed to be accessible to players of all skill levels, starting with gentle bot-matches to get newcomers on their feet, then escalating into increasingly complex modes. There’s classic deathmatches (teams optional) with fast respawns, a tense battle royale where cover is life and keeping your partners on their feet is half the challenge. Oh, and who can forget that childhood favourite - the floor is lava! That garish carpet is now instant death, so make sure you tread carefully, or shove enemies into it for a spicy surprise.</p>

      <title>Fight off a planet-wide fungal catastrophe in the upcoming co-op shooter Mycopunk</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From developer Pigeons at Play and Devolver Digital, Mycopunk is one of those games where you see a few seconds of footage in the trailer, get totally sold and instantly stick it into your wishlist. There's also a demo available to try.</p>
<p>Your ragtag gang of robot rejects have been hired by the universal megacorp SAXON for one last shot at profitable glory (and avoiding the scrap heap). You are the New Atlas Hazard Crew, a ramshackle squad of exterminators sent to uncover the mysteries behind a planet-wide fungal catastrophe. You get an arsenal of crazy weapons and power tools, and you get to supercharge them with what they're saying is a " one-of-a-kind grid-based upgrade system to create the ridiculous sci-fi super-weapon of your dreams". Yeah, I'm definitely 100% sold on this. I need it.</p>
<p>This looks like one of the absolute wildest shooters in terms of world and creature design I've seen for a while. Absolutely love the style of it and the action looks intense too. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nT4jTAMY7m8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ba4f60f9ec566726fc6344d2ca13425b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nT4jTAMY7m8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I tested out the demo on Desktop Linux with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/proton-10-gets-a-first-beta-to-improve-game-compatibility-on-steam-deck-and-desktop-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 10 Beta</a>, and it worked perfectly. Even if the trailer didn't sell me on it, the gameplay definitely would have. Chaotic, good fun and some really interesting game mechanics. Shooting enemies and watching them fall apart, and have pieces remain alive and be picked up by others, it's really something. This has quickly turned into one of my most anticipated games for 2025.</p>
<p>The developer said on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3247750/discussions/0/595147637711205628/#c595147637711214686" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> that they're "planning to get it steam deck ready for full release" too.</p>
<p>This is one to watch, could easily end up being the next big co-op shooter.</p>

      <title>Gears of War is getting a remaster with Gears of War: Reloaded releasing in August</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Microsoft / Xbox Game Studios and developer The Coalition have <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/gears-of-war-reloaded-release-date/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> Gears of War is getting a remaster with Gears of War: Reloaded. It's coming to Steam on August 26th priced at $39.99.</p>
<p>So not only are we getting a prequel with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/gears-of-war-e-day-announced-and-its-coming-to-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gears of War: E-Day</a>, but an upgraded edition of the first game. Nice!</p>
<p>Interestingly, from the Xbox announcement, Microsoft seem to have begun rebranding their PC gaming efforts a little bit. In the store / platform list they said it will be available on "Xbox Series X|S, <strong>Xbox PC</strong>, Xbox Cloud Gaming, PlayStation 5, and Steam, and arrives on day one with Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass".</p>
<p><em>Xbox PC huh?</em></p>
<p>As for what it will have: "Gears of War: Reloaded includes the full breadth of content from the Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, delivering the most complete version of the original game to date. Players will gain immediate access to all post-launch downloadable content at no additional cost — this includes the bonus Campaign act, all multiplayer maps and modes, and a full roster of classic characters and cosmetics unlockable through progression."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6707593961746521019gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>A Microsoft Account is not required for it, without it you'll be able to do cross-play. However, they said if you sign-in you'll get cross-progression and cross-platform invites.</p>
<p>Features they said to expect from it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>4K resolution.</li>
<li>60 FPS in Campaign.</li>
<li>120 FPS in Multiplayer.</li>
<li>High Dynamic Range (HDR).</li>
<li>Dolby Vision &amp; 7.1.4 Dolby Atmos.</li>
<li>7.1.4 3D Spatial Audio.</li>
<li>Variable Refresh Rate (VRR).</li>
<li>4K assets and remastered textures.</li>
<li>Enhanced post-processing visual effects.</li>
<li>Improved shadows and reflections.</li>
<li>Super resolution with improved anti-aliasing.</li>
<li>Zero loading screens during Campaign.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The only bit that really concerns me, is that the Steam page already notes it will use Easy Anti-Cheat. However, Microsoft did at least enable that in Halo Infinite and Halo: The Master Chief Collection so hopefully they will again for Linux Desktop / Steam Deck. You can see the status of more games with anti-cheat on our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated compatibility page</a>.</p>

      <title>Junkyard Space Agency is a &#39;scrappier, multiplayer version&#39; of Kerbal Space Program</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Junkyard Space Agency is an upcoming co-op space agency simulator that the developer said is like a "scrappier, multiplayer version" of Kerbal Space Program. It's being made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>.</p>
<p>Here you build spaceships from parts you salvage. Whatever they may be including pipes, tanks, sheet metal, repurposed electronics. What you make might not look pretty but as long as it gets you into orbit - that's the main thing. It will be playable in online co-op or solo, where you will scavenge to survive and build up your space agency. There's a little survival game to it with your outposts needing supplies to keep going.</p>
<p>There's no trailer yet so here's some screenshots:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7549660561746439565gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7549660561746439565gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17835684671746439564gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17835684671746439564gol1.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>On the <a href="https://nullterm.io/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">official site</a> the developer notes they are "committed to releasing the game's codebase as open-source under a permissive license upon its first public launch. We believe that this project is much bigger than ourselves and that what's envisioned can only become a reality through the collective effort, knowledge, and skills of the community".</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Planned Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Realistic Spaceflight. A space simulation balanced between Newtonian physics and fun. Objects’ orbits are shaped by mass, velocity, and gravity. And more often than not, things explode on impact.</li>
<li>Unique Build Mechanics. Endless ways to build custom ships and bases — inside and out — using modular parts, just like a space-grade constructor.</li>
<li>Co-op or Single Player. Designed with multiplayer in mind, the game can be played on public or self-hosted servers, but also locally.</li>
<li>Persistent World. Players come and go, but the world lives on and keeps evolving. Spaceships and their crews continue flying along their trajectories, and bases operate autonomously — until the supplies run out.</li>
<li>Mod support. An open codebase with full support for modding parts, missions, and even core gameplay mechanics. From day one.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>No release date yet but the Steam page notes it's planned for sometime in 2026. Seems like one that's well worth keeping an eye on.</p>

      <title>Warfare Legacy Collection remasters two classics Flash strategy games and it&#39;s out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm certain plenty of readers will remember the Flash classics Warfare 1917 and Warfare 1944! They're back, better than ever and expanded with the Warfare Legacy Collection now available. <em>There's even full Native Linux support with the release.</em></p>
<p>You'll get to rally British and German troops to fight through the trenches of France in Warfare 1917. Choose between the U.S. forces or the German Wehrmacht in a strategic tug of war in Warfare 1944. There's a brand new expansion that was added for this release too with The Battle of the Bulge. Nice bit of gaming history here, even if you didn't play the originals these are worth blasting through to experience the strategic tug of war.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ue4PlmPnxB4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8cd1c4615c0e53e51fd38c8643ea7d12.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ue4PlmPnxB4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Unlike other real time strategy games here's it's not about building up a base, or running across a top-down map to capture points. It's a side-scrolling tug of war, where you need to keep gaining ground to complete each campaign as you wear down the enemy and take advantage. The key here is in the individual units abilities, along with the special support abilities you get to throw at the other side.</p>
<p>The game doesn't exactly give you an intro, or really explain properly what you have to do, but thankfully it's all pretty simple. It's all about watching the different lanes your troops run through. You'll be constantly reinforcing by sending in new squads across each individual lane as you build up resources. Overall, it's still simplistic, but worth jumping into if you like a few hours of action. It's fast and quite brutal.</p>
<p>"After starting the Warfare series in 2008, it feels good to revisit where it all started, and breathe new life into a project nearly 17 years after its initial release" said Chris Condon at Con Artist Games. "I can’t wait to see everyone storm the battlefields during next month’s launch."</p>

      <title>Zelda 64: Recompiled (Majora&#39;s Mask) adds modding support, texture pack support, optimizations and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Zelda 64: Recompiled is a project to play The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask on modern platforms with many new features, enhancements and now modding support too. <em>The community project is not endorsed by Nintendo in any way and you need to own the original game to use this.</em></p>
<p>Something I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/zelda-majoras-mask-gets-a-pc-port-with-a-new-open-source-tool-for-nintendo-64-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">originally wrote about back in May 2024</a>, as it's a really interesting one that uses the open source project N64: Recompiled to statically recompile N64 binaries into C code that can be compiled for any platform.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Version 1.2.0 has rolled out with some major improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Modding support has been added. Mods can be installed by dragging them onto the game window or by using the "Install Mods" button in the mod menu before starting the game. You can find many mods on the Thunderstore page at <a href="https://thunderstore.io/c/zelda-64-recompiled/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://thunderstore.io/c/zelda-64-recompiled/</a>. More info can be found in the readme.</li>
<li>Texture pack support has been added. Texture packs are managed with the same menu as mods and installed in the same way. Some texture packs can be found on the thunderstore page linked previously.</li>
<li>MacOS is now supported via a Metal renderer. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/dcvz" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">@dcvz</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tanmaysachan" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">@tanmaysachan</a>!</li>
<li>Many graphical optimizations have been added to improve performance on lower end GPUs.</li>
<li>Various UI tweaks and improvements.</li>
<li>A flatpak has been added for the Linux version. Please note that the AppImage has been removed due to some file picker issues it had.</li>

<p><a href="https://github.com/N64Recomp/N64Recomp" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">N64: Recompiled</a> also just recently released the Recomp Mod Tool modding tool, which comes with binaries for Linux and Windows.

      <title>Road trip management RPG Keep Driving added controller support, working on being Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Keep Driving is a road trip management RPG that I'm <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/keep-driving-is-a-refreshing-road-trip-management-rpg/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">quite a big fan of</a>, and now I'll be able to relax a little more on my next run with the recently added controller support.</p>
<p>More about it: "Keep Driving is a management RPG about slowly making your way through a procedurally generated pixel art open world. Pick up hitchhikers with their own personalities and stories; upgrade, customize and repair your car. Solve challenges on the road using a unique turn-based ‘combat’ system, using your own skills and whatever’s lying around in the glovebox to make it through."</p>
<p>In an update <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2756920/view/538852710067208281" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> May 1st the developer noted a bunch of extra content has been added, along with full controller support. In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2756920/view/538852710067208317" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">follow-up</a> post, they also noted it's hit over 100,000 sales and they're now hoping with the latest update they can get Valve to check it again and rate it Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Easy Delivery Co. is a strange and spooky delivery driving sim with a demo worth checking out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Easy Delivery Co. from Sam C / Oro Interactive is a delivery driving sim that mixes together classic PlayStation styled visuals, with bouncing physics and a slightly spooky atmosphere. The developer recently put up a first demo, which works great on Linux with Proton.</p>
<p>More about it: "In Easy Delivery Co., players take on the role of a delivery driver in a once-lively scenic mountain town now plagued by strange weather. Explore an ordinary town filled with odd secrets as you make deliveries and get to know its mysterious residents. Manage your energy, fuel, and temperature while navigating the challenges that come with each package."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1DgkeZBvKfc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2e0d4b09db86f58a629da2f31199111d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1DgkeZBvKfc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's a fun throwback with the style and gameplay, and one that really captured me. I'm keen to see more in the full game. The developer said "Nothing strange going on, no lore, nothing at all, we promise" — not sure I believe that somehow. What's really going on? I definitely need some more practice with it, after losing a few packages when flooring it and bouncing around.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">What to expect from the full release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Earn money, buy drastically overpriced gas and uncover the quirks of this strange little town.</li>
<li>Take in the atmospheric scenery or blitz through the towns (road safety not required).</li>
<li>A quiet town, curious residents, and maybe a secret or two.</li>
<li>Unlock radio towers as you progress, each featuring tracks from Lo-Fi, Drum n Bass, and Jungle artists.</li>
<li>Local split-screen race mode with up to four players.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Stellaris: BioGenesis and free 4.0 &#34;Phoenix&#34; update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A major day for Stellaris as the Stellaris: BioGenesis expansion has released, and the huge free overhaul patch 4.0 "Phoenix" has arrived. If you've been away a while, it looks like a great time to jump back in. This is probably one of the biggest updates to the game since release back in 2016.</p>
<p>Get an overview of the 4.0 update in the below video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZfZcwnZrZf4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1c296c4e19dd43e880a2d2ab5fa6745c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZfZcwnZrZf4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For the new expansion, it sounds like quite an exciting one too. There's overhauled genetic ascension, new biological ships that evolve with your empire, a new player crisis path, three new origins, a new megastructure and more.</p>
<p>I think it may be time for me to have another run through it. Have a look at the expansion trailer below:</p>

<li><strong>Planets produce and consume resources through Jobs.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Districts provide Jobs based on their development.</strong></li>
<li><strong>District Specializations dictate what Job types are provided by Districts and what buildings may be built.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Buildings typically modify the output of the Jobs.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Ruler Stratum has been renamed the Elite Stratum, to better differentiate them from the actual Empire Ruler</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><strong>Pop Groups &amp; Workforce</strong></strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pops are now grouped together based on Species, Strata, Ethics, and Faction.</strong></li>

<li><strong>Pops produce Workforce that fills up Jobs.</strong></li>
<li><strong>A Civilian stratum has been added to represent the masses that do not generally contribute to the empire’s military economy.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>All Pop Groups on a planet have simultaneous growth every month following the existing Logistic Growth formulas.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Underrepresented pops are no longer given population growth bonuses.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fractional growth is not retained from month to month - if a Pop Group would have fractional growth, it has a chance to gain 1 pop that month based on that fraction.</strong></li>
<li><strong>All migration is now handled through the auto-migration system rather than push and pull that previously affected pop growth.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The minimum growth for small colonies has been removed. Early colonization will be reliant on migration from the empire capital.</strong></li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><strong>Empire Focuses and Timelines</strong></strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Empire Timeline keeps track of important milestones of a playthrough, available in a tab in the Situation log view.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Empire Focus Tasks introduces short and medium-term goals for players to strive for, and offers an alternative way of unlocking key technologies.</strong>

<li><strong>Empires can choose between Conquest, Exploration, and Development as their primary Empire Focus, affecting what type of tasks are drawn.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Completing Tasks provides progress towards Guaranteed Technology unlocks that are considered critical for that playstyle.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Task completion is retroactive and will award progress if drawn.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tasks may be discarded for a small cost in Unity.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><strong>Trade revamped into a standard resource</strong></strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trade is now used as the Market currency.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Trade Routes system has been removed.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Trade Production and Policies are now available to Gestalt’s through Logistics Drones</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Traditions, buildings and districts that previously affected maintenance drones now affect logistics drones</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ships now have logistical upkeep paid by Trade</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Based on whether they are docked (free), friendly space (reduced), neutral space (normal), or hostile space (expensive).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Larger ships have higher upkeep.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Juggernauts do not have logistical upkeep, and reduce the logistical upkeep costs for ships in their system by 75%.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Planets now have logistical upkeep paid by Trade based on their local resource deficits.</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local deficit costs vary based on the base market value of the resources.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>

<li><strong>Branch office buildings are now all planet unique. The amount of building slots remains unchanged.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Branch offices can now be opened on other corporate empires.</strong></li>
<li><strong>All buildings now have an influence cost, doubled when building on another corporate empire.</strong></li>

<li><strong>Added new branch office buildings: the Industrial Subsidiary and the Private Security Company.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Criminal Syndicates can now establish commercial pacts, replacing their criminal buildings with the regular version. Regular buildings still provide a crime floor to the host planet if they are owned by a criminal empire.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><strong>Databank Game Library</strong></strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>The main help button now displays the Databank where you can explore brief articles on many in-game concepts.</strong></li>
<li><strong>With this effort, many aspects of the game’s UI have been filled with concepts, helping new players understand core mechanics.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Clicking an underlined link in the UI of a concept that’s in the Databank opens that article and filters other related articles.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The full external wiki is still accessible from a button in the Databank. Clicking it on the Databank start page opens the wiki start page. If a Databank article is selected, that article is opened in the wiki.</strong></li>

<li>The trait selection UI when creating a new template has been improved.</li>
<li>The special project window pops up and can be started immediately after creating a new template if desired. It is no longer absolutely necessary as you can use integration to slowly convert your existing pops.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Habitable Worlds slider in game setup now has a 'Rare' setting. There will still be a handful of habitable worlds in the galaxy, mostly from special events and guaranteed habitable worlds. Normalized initializer spawn odds to use a handful of scripted variables.</li>
<li>Added galaxy precursor selection to game setup.</li>
<li>As it no longer creates hybrids and thus no longer contributes to the inevitable decay of society (and framerate), removed the Xeno-compatibility toggle from Galaxy Settings.</li>

<li>Added the "Venerable Scientist" (Mandarin Language) Voice Advisor</li>

<li>Leader Adjustments:
	<ul>
<li>As part of our game pacing and interruption reduction pass, leaders now gain trait selection moments on even levels rather than every level.

<li>The Under One Rule Luminary still gains leader traits every level.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Leader positions now have a significantly greater effect on what traits will appear when they level up and gain a new skill.</li>
<li>Increased the base number of leader traits to pick from on level up by 1. This is intended to reduce the chance of getting exclusively poor trait options without devaluing other sources of leader trait picks too much.</li>
<li>Added an "Auto Select Leader Traits by Default" option to game settings, which defaults to Off. On game start or if you switch to an empire, it will toggle the setting on the Leaders tab to your selection. In Coop empires, this override only applies when the primary player of the country joins it. Changing the setting mid-game will not have any effect unless you switch countries.</li>
<li>Leader positions now have a significantly greater effect on what traits will appear when they level up and gain a new skill.</li>
<li>Adjective leader trait names reverted, for example Inquisitor to Inquisitive</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Reduced spammy First Contact events</li>

<li>The Gorthikan Alliance now has the Gene Mentorship and Fleeting Excellence traits instead of Artificial Intelligence</li>

</ul>
<h3>Modding​</h3>
<ul>
<li>The actual script file and line are now printed when there are errors logged in scripted triggers and scripted effects, in addition to the previously available information.</li>
<li>Added job game text functionality to hook up with scripted job swaps. You can do job_key.XXX, Planet.job_key.XXX or Country.job_key.XXX, where XXX is GetName/GetNamePlural/GetIcon. (So e.g. "My miner name: [miner.GetName]")</li>
<li>City Sets no longer require Ships Sets to be defined, see Wilderness or Solarpunk as an example</li>
<li>Pop Groups:
	<ul>
<li>Added `create_pop_group` effect, use this instead of create_pop</li>
<li>kill_pop has been replaced with kill_pop_group. For ease of use kill_single_pop and kill_all_pop scripted effects have been made.</li>
<li>Add `transfer_pop_amount` effect that transfers pops from a pop group to another
		<ul>
<li>This is an incredibly flexible effect so in addition we have replaced all instance of resettle_pop (code) with resettle_pop_group (script effect).</li>
<li>Replaced all instances of pop_change_ethic (code) with pop_group_transfer_ethic (script effect)</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The trigger num_pops is replaced by pop_amount since there are now 100 times more pops</li>
<li>Moved resource upkeep and production for pops from species archetype and traits to the resource tables for archetypes and traits, instead of them being part of the pop categories</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jobs, Districts, Buildings, and Specializations
	<ul>
<li>Added tags to jobs, allowing us to easily group them for use in triggers num_pops_with_job_tag and num_country_pops_with_job_tag.</li>
<li>Districts now support a list of specialization slots defined in zone_slots = { }, these slots define which specializations are valid in this district.</li>
<li>If start = <specialization_name> is defined for a zone_slot, the specialization slot will automatically include this specialization.</specialization_name></li>
<li>Zone Slots have include = { } and exclude = { } lists, typically held in inline_scripts which define which specializations are valid in the zone slots</li>
<li>District specializations are built in zone slots inside districts and have building slots, defined by max_buildings = int</li>
<li>Valid buildings for district specializations are defined by using any of the included_building_sets, excluded_building_sets, include, and exclude lists. Note that exclusion takes precedence over inclusion.</li>
<li>Buildings must now belong to at least one building set.</li>
<li>District specializations also support district_planet_modifier and triggered_district_planet_modifier which are planet scope modifiers that are automatically scaled with the number of districts on the planet of the same type that the district specialization is in.</li>
<li>When a resource is spent to build a building or enact a decision, it is stored locally and can be accessed in script such as “on_queued” and “on_unqueued”, see Wilderness buildings for an example</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Biological Ships:
	<ul>
<li>Added a new scope "ship growth stage" or "growth stage" for short. Used for the sub-designs of stages that grow. Ship Designs contain everything that is true for all designs, while Growth Stages contain everything that's related to a specific Ship Size. Triggers have been updated.</li>
<li>Added the "add_evolution_progress" console command, that adds evolution progress to all bioships in a fleet.</li>
<li>You can now specify "growth_stage" in the "create_ship" effect to set the growth stage to use at creation (starts at 1)</li>
<li>Added bioship_can_grow trigger to evaluate if a bioship has the potential to get growth progress</li>
<li>Added target_focus parameter to ships and components to control if it focuses fire or spreads it among targets</li>
<li>Added on_hit effect for weapon component templates</li>
<li>Added repair_shield_percentage, repair_amount, repair_armor_amount, repair_shield_amount effects</li>
<li>Added the has_armor_percentage and has_shield_percentage triggers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Message Scripting:
	<ul>
<li>There is now an event_message_type in events that lets you override the default message type EVENT_MESSAGE_TYPE. This can e.g. provide separate message settings.</li>
<li>create_message target supports faction scope (clicking the message will open the factions view with that faction selected if it is listed).</li>
<li>create_message target supports federation scope (clicking the message will open the federation view if the player is in a federation).</li>
<li>Message notification background is now separated from the message type icon.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Species Trait Tags:
	<ul>
<li>Species traits now support tags, similar to ship weapons. These are primarily used for the new triggers listed below as well as the new add_random_species_trait in the modify_species effect.</li>
<li>To see how this is used check the “add_random_trait_evopred” effect in the biogenesis_effect.txt file.</li>
<li>Added new field localized_tags to species traits used to show the corresponding categories in the trait tooltip</li>
<li>You can now add one or more `portrait_override` to trait, in case you want specific exceptions to the archetypes and species classes limiters. For example, if you wanted to make an egg laying, flat tailed, funny lookin, fast swimming, warm blooded duck billed web footed burrow digging p p p p p p platypus.</li>
<li>Added `species_class_override` and `archetype_override` triggers to trait. If those triggers return true, then the trait ignores the associated requirements (species_class or allowed_archetype)</li>
<li>Added "trait_has_all_tags" trigger that returns true if the trait in the scope has all the traits in the list</li>
<li>Added "trait_has_any_tag" trigger that returns true if the trait in the scope has at least one of the trait in the list</li>
<li>Added "trait_has_tag" trigger that returns true if the scope trait has the tag used for the trigger.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>on_actions:
	<ul>
<li>Added the on_resolution_vetoed on action.</li>
<li>New on_action on_favor_gained that gets triggered when a country receives a favor.</li>
<li>New on_action on_research_option_added that gets triggered every time a new permanent research option is acquired.</li>
<li>Add on_ship_enter_fleet and on_ship_leave_fleet on actions</li>
<li>Added the on_resolution_put_to_vote on action</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Game Rules:
	<ul>
<li>Removed unused can_resettle_planet game rule and renamed can_resettle_planet_no_owner_check to can_resettle_planet.</li>
<li>Removed can_colonize_with_pop game rule and moved its checks to can_colonize_with_species.</li>
<li>Added should_leader_gain_trait_every_level game rule.</li>
<li>Added the species_has_uncapped_habitability_on_planet game rule, this sets the habitability ceiling for a species to use the HABITABILITY_CEIL_UNCAPPED define instead of the HABITABILITY_CEIL define</li>
<li>Created new rule can_uplift for species</li>
<li>Added the will_leader_survive game rule that replaces the leader death toast with a survival one.</li>
<li>Added the should_colonize_use_terraform game rule, used to get the behavior Wilderness has with terraforming</li>
<li>Added the should_hide_pop_group_size and should_hide_planet_sector_pop_amount which Wilderness uses to obfuscate the amount of pops on a planet</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added the script effect "copy_traditions_from = { target = FROM exceptions = { tradition1 tradition 2 } }" that copies tradition from a target country into the scoped country</li>
<li>Added "add_ascension_perk" and "remove_ascension_perk" effects, scope must be a country, adds or removed the specified perk syntax: add/remove_ascension_perk = perk_key</li>
<li>Added "copy_ascension_perks_from" effect: Copies the Ascension Perks of the target country into the scoped country. They are added to the existing perks, and the potential/possible triggers are respected. The perks listed in the exceptions list are not copied. copy_ascension_perks_from = { target = FROM exceptions = { perk1 perk2 } }</li>
<li>Added "remove_tradition" effect. Remove the target tradition from the scoped Country. remove_tradition = tradition_key</li>
<li>Added effect "remove_tradition_tree" Remove the target tradition tree from the scoped Country. remove_tradition_tree = tradition_category_key</li>
<li>Added spawn_design to static galaxy system data, which forces a specific design to spawn in the system.</li>
<li>Added gamesetup_settings script for configuring the settings list in game setup.</li>
<li>Scripted loc can now be used in concept tooltips and the top bar tooltips.</li>
<li>Added the used_defense_platform_capacity_percent trigger, letting you check how much of a starbases defensive platform capacity is used.</li>
<li>Added "playme" console command as shorthand for human_ai and ai_ignore_was_human.</li>
<li>Added auto_trait_prio support for planet classes</li>
<li>TerraformLinks resource block now has the planet as from scope</li>
<li>Added desc parameter to top bar multi-resource groups.</li>
<li>Added spawner_planet event target link for armies to replace the old pop link</li>
<li>Added parameter to Fallen Empire scripts to prevent using custom empire designs, see the Fallen Hive Empire for an example</li>
<li>Added parameter to force the spawning of neighbors on system initializers, see the Fallen Hive Empire for examples</li>
<li>Added support for leader class-specific skill level modifiers.</li>
<li>Added support for triggers in starbase_level pictures</li>
<li>Added "city_graphical_culture" triggers that test a given graphical culture (or that of a target scope) against the graphical culture used for the scoped country. If the target is also a country, it compares both the graphical cultures used for cities</li>
<li>Graphical cultures now have `ship_selection_weight` to calculate their chance of being picked by empires</li>
<li>The "graphical_culture" trigger now works on species (return the culture associated with the species class) and can take a target, so like "graphical_culture = FROM" will return true if 'this' and 'FROM' have the same graphical culture</li>
<li>You can now specify a global design when creating a starbase, but it only works for designable starbase size (ie the space citadel)</li>
<li>Orbital and Planet Deposits now support habitat_modifier, which as you might expect from the name, applies a static modifier to the habitat(s) in the system.</li>
<li>Added a update_node_portraits_if_gestalt_effect scripted effects</li>
<li>Added documentation to the common/global_ship_designs directory</li>
<li>Added keyboard shortcuts to scripted actions</li>
<li>Support setting animation state from scripted action</li>

<li>Modifed Empire Creation so it can handle normal in-game triggers. Removed local_human_species_class and local_human_origin triggers that were used in this context.</li>
<li>dynamic_capacity can now be used for all resources not just those that use special_max_amount</li>
<li>Moved AI only origins into their own file</li>
<li>Added trigger parameter allowed_planet_classes_override to traits in order to override planet classes listed by allowed_planet_classes</li>
<li>Added ai_should_not_restrict_system game rule</li>

<li>Added the inner_radius trigger to determine the size of the gravity well of a solar system</li>
<li>count_species_traits trigger now only filters by category when one is passed as a parameter</li>
<li>Since we build the citadel anywhere, we needed a way to set its position. the easiest way was to do it in code, so now when you've set a starbase in your megastructure, the code will generate it automatically. However the megastructure will not be destroyed by code, so if you want to do that you still need to do it manually.</li>
<li>build_outside_gravity_well flag in megastructures is deprecated, replaced with `build_type = inside_gravity_well/outside_gravity_well/around_planet` used to determine where and how to place a megastructure</li>
<li>Added scripted triggers for has_purity_ascension, has_cloning_ascension and has_mutation_ascension</li>
<li>Added the can_add_mutation_traits scripted trigger</li>
<li>Added is_purity_authority, is_cloning_authority and is_mutation_authority scripted triggers</li>
<li>Added the generate_new_species_and_pop scripted effect to quickly add new species and pops to a planet.</li>

<li>Added the colony_age_years trigger</li>
<li>Updated thrusters, FTL Drives, Cloaking Devices, Ship Reactors, Combat Computers and probably more to use scripted triggers</li>
<li>Added custom_tooltip_with_modifiers support to starbase buildings and modules</li>
<li>Added the upgrade_path parameter to ship components. For core components, components that have the same upgrade path are shown on the same row</li>
<li>The "end" value of a Situation stage is now a scriptable value instead of just an int. It's evaluated when the situation is spawned, and then stays at that value for the duration of the situation</li>
<li>Added Planet as a possible scope for the `has_deficit` trigger</li>
<li>Added the "damage_army" effect</li>
<li>You can now restrict civics and origins by graphical cultures by using the "graphical_culture = { <restriction> }" restriction in possible or potential. It works like every other civics/origins restriction.</restriction></li>
<li>Added "add_random_species_trait" to modify_species, which takes a trigger that's applied to all the possible species traits, and randomly adds one that fulfills the trigger.</li>
<li>Added definition for invisible extra large turret</li>
<li>Added a country_uses_bio_ships scripted trigger</li>
<li>Technology Swap can now change the Area and Categories of the tech. For example, Corvettes (engineering, voidcraft), can become Brawlers (Society, Biology).</li>

<li>Added planet_building_capacity_add, allowing planets to function like starbases producing multiple things at the same time</li>
<li>Static Modifier Custom Tooltips can now have parts of their localization designated to be multiplied when a static modifier is applied. This allows for modifiers such as defensive_stations_tracking_add to be defined entirely in script</li>
<li>Origins can now be given a room and city_graphical_culture argument to automatically change the players designs when the origin is selected. The AI should respect this too.</li>
<li>The resources that appear in the top bar are now scriptable and conditional. See how Wilderness handles the Consumer Goods/Biomass swap as an example</li>

      <title>Open source evolution sim Thrive adds currents, bioluminescence, additional environmental events and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Quite a big release for the open source evolution sim Thrive, with some major new features being added to the latest release of this scientific survival game. I really love watching this game evolve, it has some really fun and unique ideas that we've not seen in such a game before and every update like this greatly expands it.</p>
<p>It's in Early Access with Thrive 0.8.2 bringing in some big features like currents, so you and other cells will be pushed around a bit more, along with some moving water particles being added for a bit of visual flair. Currents change and push other things so the game is a fair bit more dynamic.</p>
<p>There's a bunch of new events that have been added like glaciation events and meteor impacts and they've overhauled the tutorial to prevent some player confusion. My favourite addition though? Bioluminescence! They said it's been on their list to add in for a long time, and it's finally in, so you can make yourself look pretty.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Sl1k6tzvufQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b8a2726cc291e51c27538cce50e586d9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Sl1k6tzvufQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some more of what was added includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>More polished environmental tolerances with organelles now affecting the tolerances.</li>
<li>Added resolution scaling options to render at lower resolutions for more performance.</li>
<li>Added a loading screen for stages during which graphics are loaded and shaders compiled to reduce stuttering during gameplay.</li>
<li>Upgraded to Godot 4.4.1.</li>
<li>Added a button to play the game at double speed.</li>
<li>Reordered the organism statistics panel to put less important stats at the bottom and make the compound balances visible without scrolling down.</li>
<li>Balancing tweaks and made AI members of the player species dying affect the population.</li>
<li>Various graphics and GUI tweaks.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The game is free and open source, but you can buy it from stores to support the development. It has Native Linux support and Valve rated it Steam Deck Playable.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fancy a challenge? no brake no gain is an upcoming arcade precision-driving game where skill outshines speed. The developer just recently released the first demo.</p>
<p>You go through a series of levels with various different types of challenging, some of which will push your fancy finger-work on a controller that's for sure. As you attempt to get the best time, you're also trying to keep yourself on track in some of the most ridiculous places that a vehicle really shouldn't be driving.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="r_LLak_0QFI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2ea25400c5e1c004f5dd174acb7064f0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/r_LLak_0QFI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Arcade Precision Driving - Feel the thrill of tight, responsive controls that reward skill and creativity. Master each challenge with pinpoint accuracy as you weave through traps, perform daring maneuvers, and reach the mysterious idol in style.</li>
<li>Garage Customization - Upgrade your cars to handle tougher challenges with confidence. Fine-tune speed and handling, and paint your vehicle to match your personal style as you prepare to conquer every challenge.</li>
<li>Versus Minigames - Gather your friends for local multiplayer chaos! Compete in exciting game modes like Capture the Flag, Pass the Bomb, and Survival. May the best driver win!</li>
<li>Dynamic Levels - Conquer wild, unpredictable tracks filled with lasers, moving platforms, explosive barrels, and other inventive obstacles. Adapt, react, and push your skills to the limit!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The demo appeared to work great on my desktop Linux system with Kubuntu. Quite fun and definitely a real challenge. Well worth taking a look.</p>

      <title>Glass Cannon is my next indie obsession, a chill turn-based shoot-em-up roguelike with wild weapon combos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I cannot stop myself clicking play on Glass Cannon, it's a properly great and unique shoot 'em up experience that twists the genre in a fun way that's too easy to get obsessed with. <em>Note: personal purchase.</em></p>
<p>The game gives you a small arena with a set amount of enemies you need to destroy. The problem is, you only have a limited amount of shots before the enemies will come at you to potentially destroy you and it's game over. Thankfully, there's no urgency here, since it warps the genre into a turn-based strategic roguelike where you get to build up a deck of weapons and over-power them into some ridiculous builds.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17547616101746276147gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17547616101746276147gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>After each round (if you survive) you get credits depending on kills and number of shots used. Or any little money orbs you also manage to shoot through and collect. You then use this to buy weapon mods that can have serious game-changing abilities, along with spinning a weapon wheel to either upgrade a current weapon or acquire another.</p>
<p>In a way, it reminds me of games like Balatro. Especially with the UI design, and how it takes a genre and refreshes it along with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/help-ive-discovered-nubbys-number-factory-a-plinko-style-roguelike-where-you-stop-the-sun-exploding/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nubby's Number Factory</a>, for the sheer craziness of it along with the shop system.</p>
<p>The shop and upgrade system is where the game really shines. Each weapon you get has a certain amount of slots to build them up with modules. These module upgrades can be pretty awesome that add abilities to weapons like zapping other enemies near the bullet, increasing the size of the bullet, sending out spikes if you get hit, cloning itself and … you get the idea. My personal favourite weapon module is the Brawler, which spawns a brawler that jumps at enemies when the projectile is destroyed.</p>
<p>Some of these modules can even be stacked together, so you can really add up to some hilarious weapon builds.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7852289601746276810gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7852289601746276810gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>What also makes it interesting, is that you cannot move unless moved by a weapon or another object. Add to that the different types of weapons like a grappling hook that hits enemies and moves you to the last position of it, a cutting disc that will slice through many enemies (and you if you're unlucky), a grenade that explodes, a rocket that will push you back as you fire but it moves slowly and more. <em>There's a lot of ways you can mix and match things.</em></p>
<p>Really a challenge to get through it too, mostly due to the limited amount of shots you get on each round. Different types of enemies require more power and often multiple hits, along with certain enemies having special effects that can mess with you that you need to learn. It's all about the bouncing. Each weapon has a different amount of times they will bounce off of enemies and the walls, so you need to maximise what you do. In that way, it also ends up feeling a bit like playing shoot 'em up version of cue sports.</p>
<p>Thankfully, even when you don't manage to kill all the enemies, it's only game over if their combined hits to you reduce your HP to zero, otherwise you just automatically heal before the next round.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LTWk9NP8USI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c16d5cd41f02271afee2f867769885f3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LTWk9NP8USI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer isn't quite finished with it, promising some new types of cannons for you to start with, along with other types of arenas, all of which I'm incredibly keen to see.</p>
<p>I really have been completely hooked by it. I cannot think of another game like this and I am surprised to see that it's being so overlooked because it's such a brilliant idea. Developer LisiSoft is really onto something special here and I think you absolutely have to make this your next game. This is all I'm going to be playing for a while. I need my next hit.</p>
<p>Out now with Native Linux support. It works perfectly on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 25.04) and on Steam Deck too. There's no controller support, but the controls are so ridiculously simple that Steam Input makes it a non-issue for Steam Deck. A great one to take with you wherever you go and whatever device you're on.</p>

      <title>Wine 10.7 released with an interesting loading time performance improvement</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Wine 10.7 development release is out now, and in the highlights they noted an interesting sounding performance improvement for select games.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights of the release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>User fault fd support to improve write watches performance.</li>
<li>Support for Float format conversions in WindowsCodecs.</li>
<li>More work on the new PDB backend.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For that first bullet point, it comes from a <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/merge_requests/7871" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">merge request</a> titled "ntdll: Use UFFD for tracking write watches when possible" from CodeWeavers developer Paul Gofman that notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The primary motivation for this patchset is performance improvement. The issue was originally observed with Streets of Rage 4 game which was sometimes loading [levels] for about 1-1.5 min (while that was happening almost instantly on Windows). The performance problem is coming from .Net Core memory management / garbage collector code. That huge performance issue was caused not only by direct turnaround difference for write watched memory access but also by specifics of the [algorithm] which was using different memory pools / strategies [effectively] based on memory access timing and was resulting in especially unfortunate pattern hitting write-protected (for write watch) pages much more often than it normally would. Since then something has changed either in the game or in .Net Core it is using, and the difference in level loads is not that dramatic without this optimization, but still it is some 6-8 sec without this patch instead of 1.5-2sec with this patch or on Windows, suggesting that it still provides a huge performance improvement at least for .Net Core memory management.</p>

      <title>Pac-Man meets a time-stopping survivor-like bullet heaven in Maze Mice out in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Maze Mice is the latest game from the developer of the popular Luck be a Landlord, and while many developers continue making their own form of Vampire Survivor-like, this is probably the most unique so far that truly mixes things up as it feels a lot more like Pac-Man.<em> Note: key provided for me.</em></p>
<p>Not just a survivor-like meets Pac-Man but it also ends up a little like a reverse-Snake, as all the enemies start lining up in a big long line as they chase after you. The key here is to plan ahead, and pick what direction you're going to be running in to grab some XP orbs to unlock and upgrade more skills that auto-fire while you're moving.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it is not a race against time (well, not exactly) since it has a time-stopping mechanic where nothing happens unless you move.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xdejN8ANL2o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/96b36c01fcc43baf081fa444ea48acd5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xdejN8ANL2o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I love the <em>idea</em> of it. I <em>really</em> do. Initially, I wasn't entirely sure if it had enough to hook me in for long. The game mechanics the developer has taken and put in a blender here are certainly a very weird and interesting combo, but I thought the time-stopping mechanic was actually working <em>against</em> it.</p>
<p>After you play more though, and survive for longer, you begin to understand why the time-stop mechanic is actually great. Even with you able to just stop everything, there's still a surprising urgency to it, especially when you've repeatedly managed to back yourself into a corner and you're on your last little bit of HP.</p>
<p>Still, I would really like to see more dynamic elements and events on the map to just spice things up a bit more, and help it have some more staying power for the long run. As I've progressed through, I've enjoyed unlocking more abilities to have another run through and see what weird combinations I can make. And I look forward to unlocking even more.</p>
<p>It's out now in Early Access, so it has only just begun life with the developer hoping to add in more upgrades, characters and stages.</p>
<p>“Seeing the love for Luck be a Landlord has really motivated me while working on my second commercial title, Maze Mice,” said Dan DiIorio, lead developer and founder of TrampolineTales. “I can’t wait to watch everyone skitter through mazes, achieve high scores, and unlock cheesy upgrades!”</p>

      <title>The UPERFECT UColor O2 is a brilliant portable monitor</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After recently having the chance to review the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/the-uperfect-umax-24-is-a-gorgeous-addition-to-any-desk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">rather large UPERFECT UMax 24</a>, the team at <a href="https://uperfect.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">UPERFECT</a> sent over the much more portable 16 inch <a href="https://uperfect.com/products/16-inch-3k-oled-120hz-monitor" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">UColor O2</a> for me to take a look over.</p>
<p>In terms of portable monitors, if you're after something that's easy to carry around, this is an excellent feature-filled all-rounder. To ensure that I gave it a thorough look, I've been using it constantly over the last month and I've really come away impressed by the durability of it as well as how gorgeous it is overall.</p>
<p>Compared with the UMax 24, the one quality-control issue I had with the UMax were the wobbly side buttons for interacting with the on-screen controls and swapping inputs. Thankfully, the UColor O2 doesn't have this issue, the buttons feel nice and solid.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9379547871746203244gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Arriving with everything you need out of the box to get you going you'll get the monitor, a kick-stand cover, 2 x USB-C to USB-C Cable, 1 x Mini HDMI to HDMI Cable, a power adapter and screws for mounting. It's has VESA-compliant holes all ready if you decide to mount it somewhere.</p>
<p>Everything worked as expected, and using my Steam Deck LCD once again as the testbed for it, there hasn't been a single issue. Absolutely perfect, and games look <em>fantastic</em> on it. The image quality is great, remaining exceptionally clear at various angles.</p>
<p>With the on-screen display there's a blue light filtering option which goes across 4 levels, so if you need to tone it down to save your eyes you can. You also get access to change the brightness, contrast, eco mode, DCR and sharpness. On top of that you can change black levels, hue, saturation and colour temperatures to get it exactly where you want it for maximum comfort.</p>
<p>Considering how thin it is, and how much I travel between locations a fair bit nowadays (along with multiple small people running around), the durability and feel of it has impressed me. And uh — sorry UPERFECT, that includes it being fully dropped 5 or 6 times (probably more…) without it causing a problem. It's truly a rock solid device. I'm not going to suggest you go throwing it around, but it's good to see a portable actually be portable between locations, moving around bags and being <em>dropped</em>.</p>
<p>I am especially a big fan of the magnetic cover it comes with, which doubles up as a stand making it easy to set it up wherever you go. All together, this is now my go-to whenever I'm moving around because it's just so easy to slot into a bag and off you go while being fully featured.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18334254211746203326gol1.jpeg"/></p>
<p>Really light too, making it super-simple to carry around single-handed without a fuss.</p>

<p>Even when I'm at home and not travelling about, the UColor O2 has made break-time even better at my desk just quickly flicking it on and picking up a gamepad. As much as I <em>love</em> the Steam Deck, and I <em>love</em> getting away from my desk with it, I've actually found myself playing a lot more at my desk with it since I can get a bigger quality screen, with a lighter gamepad in hand while also keeping an eye on the unrelenting barrage of emails that have been coming in lately.</p>
<p>A little gripe with it is the same as the UMax, I just wish the speakers were that little bit louder, but still good enough for a portable monitor. Additionally, the on-screen UI for adjusting settings is annoyingly fiddly to work with, as is the case of basically every monitor ever. I saw my face in screen way too often after accidentally turning it off. Once you get used to the buttons though it makes sense with certain buttons mapped for quick-access to brightness, volume and video input with another button going into the full menu of all the options.</p>
<p>If you absolutely <em>require</em> a device that has a built-in battery though, you'll want to look elsewhere, as it does need to be directly powered. However, they <em>do</em> actually have another model (not tested) that has a built-in battery that's worth a look available at the same store link below as the O model (the O2 is what's tested here).</p>
<p><em>Thank you to UPERFECT for their trust in sending it over.</em></p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://uperfect.com/products/16-inch-3k-oled-120hz-monitor" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">out on their store</a>. Priced normally it's £474.19 but they currently have it listed on sale for £263.44.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma drops LTS releases but will do extra bug fix releases, along with a new Steam-like hardware survey</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>KDE developer Nate Graham has written up a <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2025/05/01/notes-from-the-graz-plasma-sprint/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> detailing some planned changes coming to the KDE Plasma desktop, including doing away with the LTS (Long-Term Support) releases and instead extend the supported time for each release.</p>
<p>Instead of their not-so-great LTS releases where Graham admitted they were just backporting fixes "usually without even testing them", they're going to "lengthen the effective support period of normal Plasma releases a bit by adding on an extra bug-fix release, taking us from five to six".</p>
<p>They're also going to be thinking again on reducing the amount of Plasma releases a year from three down to two, which would allow them to better align with Kubuntu and Fedora releases. They will be discussing that again at the Akademy event in a few months time.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9798146081746187873gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9798146081746187873gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - My KDE Plasma (Kubuntu) main desktop</em></p>
<p>On top of that KDE Plasma is moving away from QML-based theming, as it's "just inherently dangerous because QML is code; there’s not really a way to make QML theming safe", <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/3rd-party-kde-plasma-global-themes-and-widgets-can-lead-to-data-loss/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">like the 2024 data loss issue</a>.</p>
<p>As for gathering data from users, they're also going to be changing how they do it, since they're collecting "very little data from people who have opted in (because it’s off by default)". What they're going to do is make the system work more like the Steam Hardware Survey, and show a box on the screen asking you to participate in the survey (with an option to disable it). Sounds like a good idea. Developers need data so they know where to focus.</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s the games to claim for Steam Deck / Linux from Prime Gaming for May 2nd</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's the fresh and up to date list of games available on Amazon Prime Gaming for May 2nd, and what compatibility you can expect for Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck. An easy way to build up your gaming collection with these games coming as part of your Amazon Prime subscription.</p>
<p>I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"/> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play. Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now.</p>
<p>You can install games from Epic, GOG and Amazon easily via <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/heroic-games-launcher-2152-released-fixing-amazon-gog-and-epic-games-issues/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Heroic Games Launcher</a> with Prime giving you a code for each game for whatever store it's on. For any games that use anti-cheat be sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat compatibility page</a>.</p>

      <title>THE FINALS broke again on Linux Desktop / Steam Deck, Valve updated Proton Hotfix to fix it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>THE FINALS has a repeating issue where major updates will break it in some way, with the latest update causing the game on Desktop Linux / Steam Deck to freeze a few minutes into a match.</p>
<p>After numerous reports flowed in to the Proton GitHub page for it, Valve managed to find the cause of the problem and have released an update to Proton Hotfix to solve the freezing. Valve have also now set Proton Hotfix as the default for it, where it was previously set to Proton Experimental.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13694374701746182865gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13694374701746182865gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>If you have manually set THE FINALS to a different Proton version, you should untick the compatibility box to let it automatically go to Proton Hotfix. More on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-change-the-proton-version-on-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">how to change Proton versions in my guide</a>. If you don't have Proton Hotfix downloaded, it will automatically get downloaded on Steam when you go to launch THE FINALS. As long as you don't have a different version of Proton manually set on it.</p>
<p>Testing myself with Proton Hotfix today and a full match worked just fine.</p>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 updated with a whole bunch of fixes thanks to the community having the source code</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Back in February, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/team-fortress-2-major-update-released-and-source-available-for-modders-via-the-source-sdk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve released the source code for Team Fortress 2 (TF2)</a> into the Source SDK, which allows modders to see how it all works and get their standalone mods onto Steam. But also, it allows them to fix up issues directly in Team Fortress 2.</p>
<p>While not actually open source, as it uses Valve's non-commercial license, having the source there has resulted in lots of people submitting their own fixes. At time of writing, there's 375 open pull requests of the Source SDK GitHub, most of them coming in after the TF2 code was added to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15741915481746181235gol1.jpg"/></p>

      <title>Epic reduce their cut to 0% for the first $1 million in revenue for devs on the Epic Games Store</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some interesting industry news for you here. Epic Games have announced a change to the revenue model of the Epic Games Store, as they try to pull in more developers and more gamers to actually purchase things.</p>
<p>Announced in a <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/new-epic-games-store-webshops-and-revenue-share-update" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> on May 1st, Epic will take a 0% store fee for the first $1 million revenue developers make per app per year. After that, it goes back to their normal 88%/12% split.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this seems to be an expansion of their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/epic-games-launch-first-run-and-now-on-epic-with-100-revenue-for-devs/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Epic First Run program they launched back in 2023</a>. For that though, developers had to be exclusive for at least six months. Seems this simply wasn't good enough, so now all developers will get it.</p>
<p>Not surprising they're doing this, when you see how player spending on third-party games on the Epic Games Store has <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/amazons-previous-vp-of-prime-gaming-said-they-tried-everything-to-disrupt-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">gone down two years in a row</a>.</p>
<p>On top of that they've also announced "Webshops" to release in June 2025 that enables developers to "launch their own webshops hosted by the Epic Games Store". This seems to be mainly a target for mobile by the sounds of it as Epic say it means developers can offer "out-of-app purchases, as a more cost-effective alternative to in-app purchases, where Apple, Google, and others charge exorbitant fees". People who use the Webshops will "accrue 5% Epic Rewards on all their purchases".</p>
<p>This was announced only a day after a judge ruled massively in Epic's favour against Apple (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659246/apple-epic-app-store-judge-ruling-control" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The Verge</a>).</p>
