      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ruffy and the Riverside could be one of the best platformers of 2025, and it's going to release with Native Linux support on June 26th. The release date was revealed today on the PlayStation blog, but it's a confirmed date for all platforms.</p>

Unleash your imagination in this quirky open-world action game that literally lets you change the world! It's seriously clever and one you have to try. </p>
<p>The game was going to launch in Q1 but they said the date was moved to June 26 to "ensure a simultaneous release on all platforms and to make this the best possible game it can be".</p>

      <title>The UPERFECT UMax 24 is a gorgeous addition to any desk</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In need of a new monitor? UPERFECT sent over a review unit of the UPERFECT UMax 24 and I've come away from it thoroughly impressed with it. <em>Disclosure: the review unit was not required to be sent back.</em></p>
<p>You might know the name UPERFECT from some of their great looking reasonably sized portable monitors. </p>
<p>Now, <em>technically</em>, this <em>is</em> a portable monitor but it's on the rather large size at 24.5 inches so it's really pushing the limits here of what's possible (no battery, it's USB-C powered). Portable then, with an asterisk, that it's not something you're going to stick in an ordinary bag. But it is super simple quickly to pack it down and move.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, it's still pretty light and easy to move around anywhere and I've tested this between multiple locations for setting it up. What makes it <em>great</em> is the quality built-in stand. Anywhere you can find the space for it you can just stick it down, plug in and away you go.</p>
<p>First impressions are everything of course, and the UPERFECT UMax 24 doesn't disappoint. The flip-out stand on the back, despite being quite thin, feels decently strong. Unless you're really doing something stupid, I don't see it breaking. And, bonus, it's actually incredibly stable with it too. More so than I actually expected. I thought there would be a fair bit of wobble (I've seen some awful stands for things in my time), but it's as solid as a rock with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7947054001742385653gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7947054001742385653gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>My testing with it has been mainly with a Steam Deck attached to it. Although it will support basically any device that can be hooked up via the full-featured Type-C and mini-HDMI ports on the side.</p>
<p>This is hardware I've always wanted to try! But I don’t have a reference here against any other portable monitor, besides the Elecrow CrowView Note that has an integrated keyboard, but they’re different markets and this absolutely blows that out of the water. So with that in mind, I’ve only usually tested more traditional monitors of which I’ve been through many over the years. And yet, the UPERFECT UMax 24 sold itself very quickly. That said as well, I will be surprised if there’s many such portable monitors with a built-in stand of this size that will be able to beat it - it’s just that good.</p>
<p>Originally, I had my Steam Deck hooked up to the additional HDMI port on my main work monitor. That's been quite a nuisance to swap between, so having a dedicated monitor like this has actually been thoroughly great. Not just due to having an extra (always nice), but because the UPERFECT UMax 24 is properly gorgeous. Easily giving my main monitor for work and play a run for its money.</p>
<p>It comes with everything you need out of the box including a USB-C to USB-C cable, a mini-HDMI to HDMI cable, a power adaptor and even VESA mounting screws. As you don’t have to use the stand, you can attach it to a mount as well, like a traditional monitor.</p>
<p>In terms of features it’s ridiculously packed too. You get a nice 165Hz, 2560 × 1440 (QHD) IPS screen that supports HDR and Freesync. It also has a blue light protection feature and 100% sRGB so in motion while playing games, it looks brilliant. Although the screen is capable of 165Hz you’ll only get up to 144Hz with the HDMI, but the USB-C port gives the max 165Hz.</p>
<p>The 178° viewing angle is <em>wonderful</em> too. I’ve set this up and moved it about for a few co-op sessions over the last week, and it hasn’t given a single issue on that. The screen remains crisp and clear from quite a ways over to the side of it so there’s many ways this can be used from gaming to work.</p>
<p>The only build quality issue here that I can see are the buttons on the side to power it on and manage the on-screen UI for adjusting volume, picture and so on. I’ve actually never found a monitor that didn’t have rubbish buttons, so I’ve just come to expect that. They’re not overly bad, just they feel a bit wobbly and cheap compared to the rest of it. Bit weird to have everything else about it so nice.</p>
<p>Nothing to really note about the on-screen UI to adjust things either. It’s a bit fiddly with the buttons, as it always is on monitors but generally acceptable to do what you want to adjust the picture, turn on </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6241084421742389717gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6241084421742389717gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Wonderfully thin too (563 × 324 × 16 mm (8 × 12.76 × 0.63 inch)), so it really doesn’t take up much room other than being on the larger size overall. Despite the sleekness of it, the durability of the monitor itself feels close to perfect. Apart from those side buttons, the build quality is truly fantastic and the design of it is great with a nice thin border on it so it doesn’t look too imposing. Zero issues with ports lining up that I've seen across other devices, they look perfectly placed.</p>
<p>As for sound quality, don't go expecting the world here, it's nothing special. It's "2*8Ω 1W" according to the specs sheet, which is perfectly <em>fine</em> for me and wasn't a problem during co-op but a little bit louder would have been nice to have. Loud enough to be clear enough to enjoy playing games on it, even while my (somewhat loud) fan heater was going to not cause any problems.</p>

<p>When it comes to such a review, I’ve been trying to think of things to add in. However, I’m not one to unnecessarily pad any of my articles with fluff just to hit some sort of mark. The fact is: if you’re after a display that’s quite portable, very versatile <em>and</em> big then this might be your best bet — the ultimate portable monitor for all your needs. However, if truly easily portable is your definite need, going for the smaller model <em>might</em> be a better idea. Overall though, my time with it has been absolutely great. Really do love it. </p>
<p><em>Thank you to UPERFECT for their trust in sending it over.</em></p>
<p>If interested you can purchase it <a href="https://uperfect.com/products/24-inch-monitor" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">directly from their website</a>. At time of writing the normal price is $539.99 but it’s discounted to $439.99.</p>

      <title>Fedora Linux 42 Beta and Fedora Asahi Remix 42 Beta released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fedora Linux 42 Beta and for macOS hardware Fedora Asahi Remix 42 Beta are both now available for some testing to help make another great Linux distribution release.</p>
<p>One exciting major addition here for Fedora Linux 42 is that the KDE Plasma desktop has now been promoted to "edition status", meaning you can consider it a flagship experience and that their support of the KDE Plasma desktop will be good.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8894099091742390503gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8894099091742390503gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Fedora KDE 42 Beta</em></p>
<p>Additionally they also now have a Fedora COSMIC spin, the new in-development Rust-based desktop environment from hardware vendor System76.</p>
<p>Another change for Fedora Linux 42 is the installer, which introduces a new "Web UI" as the default for Fedora Workstation (GNOME). They said "This means that users can enjoy a smooth installation experience, with features such as an installation progress indicator, built in help, configuration review and more. This new feature also includes Wizard which will allow users to skip what they don’t need during installation". On top of that it adds ina proper guided partition manager for easy installs.</p>
<p>More in the <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-linux-42-beta/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release announcement</a>.</p>
<p>On the Fedora Asahi side it includes all the main improvements from Fedora Linux 42, plus a notable change of the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/FEX" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">integration of FEX in Fedora Linux</a> which they say "provides an easier way to run x86 and x86-64 binaries out of the box via emulation".</p>

      <title>Palworld cross-play has arrived along with a new cosmetic system and Pal transfers between worlds</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pocketpair have released the latest update for their smash-hit monster catching game Palworld, bringing cross-play for all platforms along with other features and bug fixes. At last, I can get my console friends to run around with me on Linux thanks to Valve's Proton.</p>
<p>There's also a new Global Palbox you can use to transfer them between worlds, a bigger Pal storage system, a new cosmetic system to change your style without affecting your armour stats, a photo mode and more. One of my favourite changes is that Pals will no longer block building - at last! That was quite a nuisance when you have a lot of them running around doing things.</p>

      <title>Steam Beta improves download speed of Steam Client updates on Linux / Steam Deck and other fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve just released a fresh Steam Client Beta available for all platforms that includes some feature tweaks and a healthy injection of bug fixes.</p>
<p>Since it's a Steam Client update, it applies across the board on Linux, macOS and Windows systems. However, there's one change that's very specific to SteamOS / Steam Deck:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>'Enable Steam Play for all other titles' is always enabled on SteamOS, updated the UI accordingly to stop showing a non functional toggle.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This toggle is still there in the Desktop Linux client. It likely won't be long before they just remove it entirely for Desktop Linux too, and just leave it to have the drop-down for you to pick the default version. Proton is so good now, it seems odd to have a toggle to turn it off.</p>
<p>Here's all the other changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed brief layout shift of elements (one or two frames) when navigating back to the library section.</li>
<li>Fixed Steam Client window focusing multiple times on startup.</li>
<li>Fixed Update News window being covered by Steam Client window at startup.</li>
<li>Fixed notifications displaying in wrong position in some games.</li>
<li>Fixed some instances where windows fail to render after display events.</li>
<li>Improved consistency and clarity of download/install/update UI:</li>
<li>Byte counts, when displayed, refer to the number of bytes to download.</li>
<li>Progress bars and percentages, when displayed, refer to the total progress of the install/update, which includes work before, after, and during the download. The exception is the top (blue) progress bar on the downloads page, which shows the bytes downloaded.</li>
<li>Time remaining estimates refer to the total progress of the install/update. These estimates will be very rough at first but will become more accurate as Steam learns more about the performance of the user's network and disks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Big Picture</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue that could allow the keyboard to cover the target text area when summoned from a game.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>macOS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added Steam Overlay support for games using HDR rendering.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Linux</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved the download speed of Steam client updates.</li>
<li>No longer applying compatibility tool filtering to shortcuts.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare issue where non-steam Protons could get assigned an incorrect compatibility tool.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed crash when using "Hexgaming Phantom Controller", related to Gyro Timestamp Information.</li>
</ul>

<p>I do have some very fond memories of the first game. They were one of the first lot of indie developers that decided to start bringing their games officially to Linux, so it's nice to see that continue. Can't wait to dive in. Once we get some more details on the release I'll be sure to let you know.</p>

      <title>War Thunder major Hornet&#39;s Sting update adds Ray Tracing for AMD and intel GPUs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>War Thunder has been updated with the first major expansion of 2025. Titled Hornet’s Sting it adds in Ray Tracing support for AMD and Intel GPUs. There's but coming though.</p>
<p>But…not in the Native Linux version. Ray Tracing, and multiple upscalers, are only available via DirectX 12 and not their Vulkan renderer. So unless you play with Proton, you're getting left further behind on this one. That said, Proton doesn't appear to actually work properly for it right now either.</p>
<p>At least on my AMD Radeon 6800 XT system, the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a> makes the latest update unplayable with graphics missing all over the place. And then going into a match, it gives multiple errors and the game will quit. Trying with Proton Experimental, and it's the same problems.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12825420141742307299gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12825420141742307299gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12831924381742307302gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12831924381742307302gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>So right now for War Thunder, you might <em>have</em> to stick with the Native Linux version to at least have it working, just without all the recent fancy graphical additions and upscalers.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ufk9SI6q1GA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/92b5b7daba707efb553f5c895c55d3d5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ufk9SI6q1GA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's quite a lot of new content in this update from new aircraft like the F/A-18 Hornet and others, new naval and ground vehicles, three graphically overhauled maps, a new "Maneuver and limits mode" for jets that "allows you to perform much tighter maneuvers and to get the little-but-so-needed nose authority to launch a missile", some interface updates, a UAV Picture-in-Picture Mode and more. One I'm quite happy about is the addition of new tank guns sounds, to help make them more unique.</p>
<p>I do really enjoy the battles in War Thunder, but seeing Linux get left behind like this is quite frustrating. And their spectator camera has been left feeling so <em>broken</em> for many <em>years</em> at this point, which makes it seriously annoying when waiting around or trying to see what friends are doing if you're with a crew when you're out.</p>

      <title>Half-Life 2 RTX demo has launched on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Half-Life 2 RTX now has a demo available on Steam for those of you who want to check out what Orbifold Studios have done to the Valve classic with ray tracing. <em>You do need to own Half-Life 2 to be able to play the mod.</em></p>
<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ravenholm and Nova Proskpekt demo coming March 18th.</p>
<p>The fight for freedom begins anew. Experience the award-winning game that has captivated millions of players worldwide with its immersive story, thrilling combat, and mind-bending physics, fully overhauled with full ray tracing, new hand-crafted, physically based textures, enhanced high-poly models, and updated lighting, all in stunning 4K.</p>
<p>Half-Life 2 RTX is a free DLC for all Half-Life 2 owners developed by Orbifold Studios, a collective of passionate, community-assembled developers behind Half-Life 2: VR, Half-Life 2: Remade Assets, Project 17, and Raising the Bar: Redux.</p>
<p>Half-Life 2 RTX uses the latest version of RTX Remix leveraging new RTX Neural Rendering technologies, cutting-edge full ray tracing, accelerated by NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, and NVIDIA Reflex to bring one of the greatest video games of all time to life in a whole new light.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="j31ISEd8xRM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/91449e1064f5c4924d85d7ccc9b83c27.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/j31ISEd8xRM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Just out of curiosity, I did give it a try on my Kubuntu Linux system. Although this is with an AMD Radeon 6800 XT, so I was expecting it to barely run at all. It does actually run though with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the latest Proton 9.0-4</a> but as you can probably imagine, it performs awfully out of the box on my system.</p>
<p><em>If you press ALT+X, you can open the Remix menu to change settings.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13632835401742304703gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13632835401742304703gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Fiddling with a few settings then caused it to crash and quit.</em></p>
<p>I'm curious to see what your thoughts are now it's available for testing. Do you think it's too bright? Or do you love the enhancements? Let me know.</p>

      <title>Stardew Valley modding on Linux / Steam Deck takes a step with the Nexus Mods app</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The team at Nexus Mods have released a new version of their open source and cross-platform Nexus Mods app, with Stardew Valley modding now considered close to being ready for everyone. Eventually, this app will replace the Vortex app, once it's ready and supports more games.</p>
<p>Release 0.8.2 has added in a new "Unsupported Games" flag, with Stardew Valley currently the only one <em>not</em> hidden away. With Cyberpunk 2077, Baldur's Gate 3 and Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord placed behind this new option as they're not quite ready for everyone (but still work rather well). One of their team mentioned to me this is a <em>soft</em> launch, and as long as it goes well it will eventually be recommended as your main mod manager for Stardew Valley.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13423552191742302828gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13423552191742302828gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Nexus App 0.8.2.0</em></p>
<p>A lot more that's actually new with this release including better game detection and versioning, an external changes page to help you track everything and remove any problem files being tracked, improvements to the mod Collections feature, Stardew Valley mods that are packaged without a top-level folder will now install correctly, more information added to the Health Check diagnostics for Stardew Valley and various bug fixes.</p>
<details class="spoiler_container"><summary class="spoiler_header">Changelog, click me</summary>
<div class="spoiler-content">
<p><strong>More Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Collections from Nexus Mods are now installed in a read-only state to ensure the collection is as the curator intended it. Cloning and editing collections will be added in future.</li>
<li>The Collection Download page now includes an Instructions tab with both collection and mod instructions.</li>
<li>Collections can now be removed from loadout without deleting them from the Library using the menu option in the header.</li>
<li>The header has been redesigned to be more compact.</li>
<li>The Settings UI has been updated to match the latest brand guidelines.</li>
<li>Stardew Valley mods that are packaged without a top-level folder will now install correctly.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Technical Changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All games except Stardew Valley have been moved behind the "Unsupported Games" flag in Settings. If you were modding Cyberpunk, Baldur's Gate 3 or Mount &amp; Blade II:Bannerlord in a previous release, you will need to enable this option to continue managing your mods.</li>
<li>The app can now differentiate between a mod installed as part of a collection and the same mod installed directly from the Library.</li>
<li>When installing collections for Stardew Valley, any unrecognised mods are now installed relative to the "Mods" folder instead of the game folder.</li>
<li>Conflicting mods within a collection are now installed in an order that respects the rules set by the curator.</li>
<li>Large numbers are now displayed with comma separation or abbreviations.</li>
<li>File sizes now only show decimal places above 1GB.</li>
<li>Edits to mod files are now saved to External Changes instead of merging into the source mod.</li>
<li>Added a new "Give Feedback" button to the bottom of the main window.</li>
<li>When two different versions of the same SMAPI mod are installed into the loadout, diagnostics will use the most up to date version to display messages.</li>
<li>Errors communicating with the SMAPI server will now silently be recorded in the logs rather than showing a pop up.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mod updates now correctly show the number of mod files with updates rather than the number of new versions between the current and latest releases.</li>
<li>The left menu now displays the correct name of a collection if the internal manifest and website don't match.</li>
<li>A Command Prompt window will no longer be open behind the app on Windows.</li>
<li>The Success Rating for a collection now shows the correct value.</li>
<li>If a collection has less than 3 votes on the Success Rating, it shows as grey instead of red.</li>
<li>Collections with no required mods can now be installed.</li>
<li>Fixed multiple places where the app UI would freeze when making large numbers of changes in quick succession.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the workspace could be broken by a saved page no longer being available.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the SMAPI version and game version comparison diagnostic was not running correctly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Known Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The sort order for some columns does not work as expected.</li>
<li>The game version is not checked when adding a collection meaning you can install outdated mods without being warned.</li>
<li>The table header sorting and collapsible section states are not saved and reset each time the view is loaded.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</details>
<p>There's some niggling issues with the app loading times on Linux though. Depending on what you have installed and how the Nexus Mods app searches for things and sets everything up, you may have a few minutes to wait. I've <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/issues/2865" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reported it</a> and they're looking into it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11042794581742302986gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11042794581742302986gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Nexus App 0.8.2.0, with some Stardew Valley mods added</em></p>
<p>Really pleased to see the progress on this. Having a proper full mod manager supported on Linux (and so Steam Deck) like this will remove a big pain point for players wanting to expanding their games.</p>

      <title>Discord wants developers to stick it inside their games with a new SDK</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the great things about modern online gaming is how (usually) easy it is to link up with friends. You have your friends list on Steam, GOG, Epic and others but what about Discord? They want a bigger piece of the pie now.</p>
<p>Announced yesterday, Discord have launched a new Discord Social SDK, a toolkit for developers to embed Discord into their games. This will then add in your Discord friend list, enable game invites directly for people on Discord, cross-platform messaging and more. All without a Discord account actually being needed.</p>
<p>It doesn't support Linux though, as only Windows 11 and macOS have been announced. Hopefully this won't cause any issues with running Windows games via Valve's Proton compatibility layer.</p>
<p>Some developers have already signed up to use it including Theorycraft Games, Facepunch Studios, 1047 Games, Scopely, Mainframe Industries, Elodie Games, Tencent Games and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12712226211742298531gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12712226211742298531gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Supervive with Discord, Credit: Discord</em></p>
<p>It doesn't necessarily need to <em>replace</em> other methods, but give developers the option to hook into it. So developers could bundle together Steam and Discord friends lists for example. It will be interesting to see if many more developers opt to use Discord, and how players ultimately end up feeling about it.</p>

      <title>Surprisingly, Valve rated Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced and Rainbow Six Siege as Steam Deck Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 19/03/25 —</strong> at 10:14 pm yesterday, Valve once again changed the rating for both games. Putting them both back to Unsupported. The compatibility notice on each game now simply notes how the anti-cheat is not configured to support the Steam Deck. No reply from Valve press yet, likely as they're at Game Developers Conference (GDC).</p>
<p>Hopefully we won't see repeating issues like this for games that have anti-cheat.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Even though both of them have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat</a> that blocks Linux platforms from playing online, Valve have suddenly rated both Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced (and so GTA Online) and Rainbow Six Siege as Steam Deck Playable.</p>
<p>Many people have had issues with how Valve rate various games on Steam Deck, with a few outliers showing up as Verified when they don't perform well or Unsupported when they actually work fine. With the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/steam-deck-hits-18000-games-playable-and-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Deck recently hitting 18,000 games playable / verified</a>, Valve really need to ensure the system is working well to not give the wrong idea.</p>
<p>The new ratings now appear on the store pages for both games, which you can also see via SteamDB (<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3240220/history/?changeid=28004229" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GTAV</a> / <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/359550/history/?changeid=28004220" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">R6 Siege</a>) showing testing was done and published.</p>

<p>And since the ratings are live on Steam, they then show as compatible when looking directly on Steam Deck too.</p>

<em>Pictured - how Rainbow Six Siege appears on my Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>We know that Rockstar themselves <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/grand-theft-auto-v-gets-battleye-anti-cheat-breaks-online-play-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">intentionally blocked GTA Online for GTA V when they added in BattlEye</a>. As they say clearly it's simply not supported on Steam Deck. Although single-player works, a Playable rating is very misleading.</p>
<p>For Rainbow Six Siege it has been blocked the entire time, although they did just launch a new update with additional anti-cheat measures.</p>
<p>Trying out Rainbow Six Siege on Desktop Linux and it clearly does not work when trying to join a match, getting kicked pretty rapidly before the game properly begins.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14489418911742294045gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - getting kicked from Rainbow Six Siege on Desktop Linux</em></p>
<p>Trying to reconnect after this also does not work.</p>
<p>I then had to wait an hour before being able to test on Steam Deck, since it counted me as a leaver and locked me out. Same issue on Steam Deck though, it simply doesn't work. The live Playable rating from Valve is wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18515369001742297826gol1.jpeg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - getting kicked from Rainbow Six Siege on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>Thankfully, Valve do have their two hour play time and two weeks refund period, but still — issues like this are not the best look for ongoing trust in Valve's Steam Deck verification system. Ideally, Valve should have some sort of manual rating lock on games that have these kinds of anti-cheat blockers, so they can't mistakenly get a rating that leads to player confusion. That way, if there's a legitimate change, Valve can get it checked properly first.</p>
<p>Especially important if Valve are going to continue with new Steam hardware based on Linux, as Valve did say "The future of hardware at Valve is bright" <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/330-million-hours-played-on-steam-deck-in-2024-up-64-from-2023-steam-year-in-review-2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">and noted 330 million hours were played on Steam Deck in 2024</a> so this trust in their system is vital.</p>
<p>I've reached out to Valve press about this and will update if any reply is received.</p>

      <title>Must-have Steam Deck games under £10 in the Steam Spring Sale 2025 </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the Steam Spring Sale 2025 in full swing now, here's some updated recommendations for games to grab for the Steam Deck. I already gave a few suggestions in the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/steam-spring-sale-2025-is-live-now-heres-some-great-budget-games-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">initial sale launch post</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3986939351742296144gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>For this next set, I've picked out a bunch that I also think are really great and worthy of adding to your Steam Library. Again, I consider these generally a no-brainer that all gamers should try. So much entertainment for such low prices it's nuts. Steam sales are also.</p>
<p>These are all great:</p>
<h4><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/870780/Control_Ultimate_Edition/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Control Ultimate Edition</a> (£8.74)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Winner of over 80 awards, Control is a visually stunning third-person action-adventure that will keep you on the edge of your seat.</p>

</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1492299371742296567gol1.jpg"/></p>
<h4><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/28590/_Crysis_Remastered_Trilogy/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Crysis Remastered 1+2+3</a></h4>
<p>Okay, technically three games, but stick with me here. The first is also only rated Playable (but works well), because yes - the Steam Deck <em>can</em> run Crysis. The third in the series is also just over that £10 mark by itself but still worth it! Together they're £13.49 as a bundle so works out <em>less</em> than £5 each.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2898030271742296730gol1.jpg"/></p>

<h4><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/108710/Alan_Wake/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Alan Wake (£2.84)</a></h4>

<p>A Dark Presence stalks the small town of Bright Falls, pushing Alan Wake to the brink of sanity in his fight to unravel the mystery and save his love.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6955734221742296850gol1.jpg"/></p>
<h4><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/22370/Fallout_3_Game_of_the_Year_Edition/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Fallout 3 (£5.27)</a></h4>
<p>Only rated Playable but it really works well overall.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prepare for the Future™ With Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition, experience the most acclaimed game of 2008 like never before. Create a character of your choosing and descend into an awe-inspiring, post-apocalyptic world where every minute is a fight for survival.</p>

<h4><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/22380/Fallout_New_Vegas/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Fallout New Vegas (£4.49)</a></h4>
<p>Only rated Playable but it really works well overall.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As you battle your way across the heat-blasted Mojave Wasteland, the colossal Hoover Dam, and the neon drenched Vegas Strip, you’ll be introduced to a colorful cast of characters, power-hungry factions, special weapons, mutated creatures and much more. Choose sides in the upcoming war or declare “winner takes all” and crown yourself the King of New Vegas in this follow-up to the 2008 videogame of the year, Fallout 3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6427193481742297053gol1.jpg"/></p>
<h4><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/377160/Fallout_4/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Fallout 4 (£6.49)</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Bethesda Game Studios, the award-winning creators of Fallout 3 and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, welcome you to the world of Fallout 4 – their most ambitious game ever, and the next generation of open-world gaming.</p>
<p>As the sole survivor of Vault 111, you enter a world destroyed by nuclear war. Every second is a fight for survival, and every choice is yours. Only you can rebuild and determine the fate of the Wasteland. Welcome home.</p>

<h4><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1328670/Mass_Effect_Legendary_Edition/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Mass Effect Legendary Edition (£4.99)</a></h4>
<p>I was a little torn on including this but it's such a fantastic series. The EA app can be a nuisance, but overall it works well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Mass Effect™ Legendary Edition includes single-player base content and over 40 DLC from the highly acclaimed Mass Effect, Mass Effect 2, and Mass Effect 3 games, including promo weapons, armors, and packs — remastered and optimized for 4K Ultra HD.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/960602281742297157gol1.jpg"/></p>
<h4><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1237970/Titanfall_2/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Titanfall 2 (£2.49)</a></h4>
<p>One of the best single-player FPS experiences around. The EA app can be a nuisance, but overall it works well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Respawn Entertainment gives you the most advanced titan technology in its new, single player campaign &amp; multiplayer experience. Combine &amp; conquer with new titans &amp; pilots, deadlier weapons, &amp; customization and progression systems that help you and your titan flow as one unstoppable killing force.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7314967891742297233gol1.jpg"/></p>
<h4><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/379720/DOOM/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">DOOM (£1.59)</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Developed by id software, the studio that pioneered the first-person shooter genre and created multiplayer Deathmatch, DOOM returns as a brutally fun and challenging modern-day shooter experience. Relentless demons, impossibly destructive guns, and fast, fluid movement provide the foundation for intense, first-person combat – whether you’re obliterating demon hordes through the depths of Hell in the single-player campaign, or competing against your friends in numerous multiplayer modes. </p>

</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3886611961742297384gol1.jpg"/></p>
<h4><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sub/648168/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Middle-earth: The Shadow Bundle (£5.99)</a></h4>
<p>Includes both Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and Middle-earth: Shadow of War. They're both Verified too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fight through Mordor and uncover the truth of the spirit that compels you, discover the origins of the Rings of Power, build your legend and ultimately confront the evil of Sauron in this new chronicle of Middle-earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5119845451742297514gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Finally, a special extra shout out for:</p>
<h4><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Balatro</a> (£10.87)</h4>
<p>It's just above that £10 mark but it's quite essential so you know what they heck everyone keeps talking about. It's also a genuinely great game that just deserves it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The poker roguelike. Balatro is a hypnotically satisfying deckbuilder where you play illegal poker hands, discover game-changing jokers, and trigger adrenaline-pumping, outrageous combos.</p>

      <title>GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) version 3.0 is finally out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Not gaming news but big news in the open source world - the GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) version 3.0 is finally out now.</p>
<p>As someone who uses it every day for various images here on GamingOnLinux, the new non-destructive editing and text styling with editing are going to save me a whole lot of time overall. Nice to see this open source image editor become a fair bit more modern.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16108531181742292264gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some highlights of the 3.0 release include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Need to tweak a filter you applied hours ago? New in GIMP 3.0 is non-destructive editing for most commonly-used filters. See the changes in real time with on-canvas preview.</li>
<li>Exchange files with more applications, including BC7 DDS files as well as better PSD export and many new formats.</li>
<li>Don’t know how big to make your drawing? Simply set your paint tool to expand layers automatically as needed.</li>
<li>Making pro-quality text got easier, too. Style your text, apply outlines, shadows, bevels, and more, and you can still edit your text, change font and size, and even tweak the style settings.</li>
<li>Organizing your layers has become much easier with the ability to select multiple items at once, move them or transform them all together!</li>
<li>Color Management was again improved, as our long-term project to make GIMP an advanced image editor for all usages.</li>
<li>Updated graphical toolkit (GTK3) for modern desktop usage.</li>
<li>New Wilber logo!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Valve have released a quick follow-up update to the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/steamos-3-7-0-preview-brings-the-beginnings-of-support-for-non-steam-deck-handhelds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">big SteamOS 3.7 preview on Steam Deck</a> to fix up some issues people have been reporting with the sound quality.</p>
<p>SteamOS 3.7.1 "Safe and Sound" includes these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a sound quality regression on Steam Deck OLED.</li>
<li>Fixed a sound volume regression on Steam Deck LCD.</li>

<p>I didn't actually notice issues across mine but it seems quite a few people did. Nice to see Valve get that sorted so quickly.</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer Part 47: Before I Was Born</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-46-bursting-bubbles/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Part 46: Bursting Bubbles</a></strong></p>
<p>So far the oldest game binary I have launched has been the original Linux port of <em>Doom</em>, after reading an article by Jason Heiss outlining how to launch legacy a.out executables on later Red Hat Linux versions. This brought me back to 1994, both the year I was born and the year that the Linux kernel reached its milestone 1.0 release. Linux as a project however dates back to 1991, first announced by Linus Torvalds on the comp.os.minix newsgroup my father also frequented at the time.</p>
<p>Browsing an old SunSITE archive I came across the jetpack-linux.tar.z tarball, which contained an unusual X11 game built and packaged in June 1993. <em>Jetpack</em> itself was first released by Mark Bradley in 1992 under a restrictive source licence requiring his written consent to any changes, contributing to its obscurity. Getting the game to start was even more complicated than it was for the X11 build of <em>Doom</em>, although both are a.out executables demanding an X server running at 8-bit colours.</p>
<p>After extracting the game files to the paths specified in the tarball, I discovered that I also needed to create symbolic links of the libX11.so.3 and libc.so.4 libraries in the top-level directory of my file system. From there I found that <em>Jetpack</em> would only launch from the Failsafe session accessible in the display manager, as even a window manager as basic as Blackbox would cause the game to fail with an "X Error of failed request: BadAccess (attempt to access private resource denied)" warning.</p>
<p>As with many other X11 games the default control scheme is odd, but <em>Jetpack</em> is even weirder than most by demanding the use of a three button mouse; there are keybinds for moving your character left or right, but to fire the titular jetpack you must press the middle mouse button. As such it becomes easier to just control the entire game using the mouse, which is cumbersome at first but does somewhat succeed at imitating how the game would feel if it were played with a joystick.</p>
<p>Similar to <em>Xkobo</em> the game features simple but attractive graphics, smooth scrolling, and a strong arcade premise. You begin each level at a set of doors and must find a key to unlock them to reach the next level, with the game awarding you a bonus if you return fast enough. Text will berate you severely for not completing a stage in time, which can be rather aggravating given most of the level layouts and item drops are randomly generated. Even the praise feels hollow if it is down to just luck.</p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10492595251742290613gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10492595251742290613gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13801891831742290614gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13801891831742290614gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>There is one pre-defined "DEMO" level that functions as a tutorial of sorts, but getting this to load requires knowing how the game was configured at compilation. There are no sound effects, but considering that OSS support was not even merged into the Linux kernel until 1994, this can be very much excused. Perhaps due to limitations such as these Mark Bradley would soon shift his focus to Mac OS, releasing an expanded shareware version of <em>Jetpack</em> for Macintosh not long after.</p>
<p>The Mac OS version has twenty five levels and does have music and sound effects. I was able to extract the WAV files using the resource_dasm utility, with the music consisting of short repeating loops. These I cut into roughly one minute tracks, apart from the menu music which I kept at thirty seconds, which I then made work with a modified version of my MIDI scripts using the play command from SoX instead. I also got the X cursor to change to the "shuttle" theme for added flare.</p>
<p>The only UNIX flavour I have found still packaging <em>Jetpack</em> is NetBSD, which still has the original jetpack.tar.Z source tarball backed up through pkgsrc. Using this I was able to build an ELF binary after passing "-L/usr/X11/lib" on the "XONLYLIB" line of the generated Makefile, which also allowed me to change where it looks for the score and level files to be in the same directory as the executable; levels are easy to parse text files, which when renamed to jetpack.lev001 will take the first slot.</p>
<p>Beyond being built for ELF the game still has all of the same limitations as the old a.out binaries, but it will at least attempt to start on modern versions of Linux now. Supplying the 8-bit colour depth it demands can be realized through a nested Xephyr session, allowing me to further modify my launch script to even have the game be playable on my current Arch Linux machine; <em>Jetpack</em> refused to build from there, but the ELF binary I made on Red Hat Linux 7.3 works just fine.</p>
<p>In a lot of ways this is more convenient as the mouse focus can be grabbed by the Xephyr window, and I no longer need to fall back to to a Failsafe session or modify my XF86Config-4 file each time I want to play. I am not even breaking Mark Bradley's restrictive licence in order to do this, as I did not modify any of the source code, just a few of the paths specified in the Makefile. I somehow seem to have gotten stuck in this particular time period, as the next game I played also dates to 1993.</p>

      <title>Atomfall from Rebellion is Steam Deck Verified ahead of release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rebellion are set to release Atomfall on March 27th, their survival-action game inspired by real-life events set in Northern England. The good news is that it's Steam Deck Verified already. <em>As a Brit myself, I'm going to have to play this aren't I?</em></p>
<p>While the main release is on March 27th, you can play three days early with Advanced Access from the Deluxe Edition.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck Verified status went live today with Valve testing it against the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a>.</p>

<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A survival-action game inspired by real-life events, Atomfall is set five years after the Windscale nuclear disaster in Northern England.</p>
<p>Explore the fictional quarantine zone, scavenge, craft, barter, fight and talk your way through a British countryside setting filled with bizarre characters, mysticism, cults, and rogue government agencies.</p>
<p>From Rebellion, the studio behind Sniper Elite and Zombie Army, Atomfall will challenge you to solve the dark mystery of what really happened.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Player Driven Mystery</strong>: Unravel a tapestry of interwoven narratives through exploration, conversation, investigation, and combat, where every choice you make has consequences.</li>
<li><strong>Search, Scavage, Survive</strong>: You’ll need to scavenge for supplies, craft weapons and items, and fight desperately to make it out alive!</li>
<li><strong>Desperate Combat</strong>: With weapons and ammunition scarce, each frenetic engagement will see you blend marksmanship with vicious hand-to-hand combat. Manage your heart rate to hold a steady aim and ensure you have the energy you need to reach for your cricket bat and land the killer blow.</li>
<li><strong>Green and Unpleasant Land:</strong> The picturesque British countryside, with rolling green hills, lush valleys, and rural villages belie the dangers that await you. Navigate cult-controlled ruins, natural caves, nuclear bunkers and more as you explore this dense, foreboding world.</li>
<li><strong>Reimagining Windscale:</strong> A fictional reimagining of a real-world event, Atomfall draws from science fiction, folk horror, and Cold War influences to create a world that is eerily familiar yet completely alien.</li>
</ul>

      <title>CS:Legacy announced as a full standalone remake of Counter-Strike 1.6</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For classic Counter-Strike fans, you may want to keep an eye out for the just announced CS:Legacy from the team behind CSPromod. This is not a mod but a full game due out sometime in Early Access in 2025.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CS:Legacy is a fully standalone remake of classic Counter-Strike 1.6, built from the ground up on Valve’s official Source Engine 2013 SDK, releasing on Steam Early Access in 2025.</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Full Remake, Not Just a Mod</strong> – Built from scratch with <strong>100% custom code, 3D assets, levels, textures, characters, UI, weapons etc. </strong>We own the entirety of our work, which guarantees the game's future and unlimited potential.</li>

      <title>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Initially Ubisoft said it wouldn't be supported, then they said it would be and now Valve have said that Assassin's Creed Shadows is Steam Deck Verified. <em>This new status was first noted in my article on the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/steam-deck-hits-18000-games-playable-and-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Deck hitting 18,000 playable games</a> but it's easy to miss if you skipped over it.</em></p>
<p>From the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3159330/view/572625355297260282" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have some exciting news to share: our talented developers gave Steam Deck players the option to play Assassin’s Creed Shadows at launch ; despite initially announcing we wouldn’t be able to support until later. Indeed, the team made great progress over the past few weeks and was able to make it happen for launch, despite the fact the team thought it would not be the case. It is now fully confirmed the game is "Steam Deck verified" for launch on March 20th.</p>
<p>We know many of you who play on Steam Deck have requested this, so we’re thrilled to be able to bring Shadows to this platform. While graphical settings will be locked at launch, you’ll be able to choose the upscalers you want, and we’re looking into providing further options in future updates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You'll most likely be able to unlock the graphical settings if you set the "SteamDeck=0 %command%" launch option. Unless they're locking it differently to other developers who have done the same.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="9DOgHjPLs3I"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1053ce939ff2486bd678844a41c5bca4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/9DOgHjPLs3I" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With it being Steam Deck Verified, that's good news for Desktop Linux players too, since this means it will work fine on your more powerful systems. Valve verified it against <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the latest Proton 9.0-4</a>.</p>
<p>For the Steam release it will launch with support for collectible virtual trading cards, badges, emoticons, and background images exclusively on Steam. The game does have Denuvo though, so be careful swapping any Proton version around, as you can end up locked out for a day.</p>
<p>What do we think? Will it see a nice clear 30FPS at least?</p>

      <title>Nightingale gets font improvements for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nightingale from Inflexion Games continues improvements during Early Access, with the latest patch out now with the developer trying to get it Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>The game was already rated Steam Deck Playable, with one of the two marks against it being the text small and difficult to read. The latest update notes (amongst many other things) - "Ensured font styles now meet Steam Deck requirements". The other issue Valve noted is that it "sometimes shows mouse, keyboard, or non-Steam-Deck controller icons" so hopefully they'll solve that next.</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1928980/view/534344680625669759" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Nightingale City Update</a> it also adds in these major changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Defend Nightingale City</strong></p>

      <title>Supernatural horror adventure ASYLUM from Senscape is finally out - Linux version delayed</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>12 years after the successful Kickstarter, the supernatural horror adventure ASYLUM from Senscape has finally seen a release. Although the Native Linux version has unfortunately been delayed.</p>
<p>Writing on the Steam forum the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/230210/discussions/0/552359157631578362/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">developer said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, I know a few of you were waiting for a properly native Linux version. Regrettably, it won't be ready for launch because of an annoying issue: the game makes use of MP4 videos, a codec which Linux doesn't support by default, and the Unreal plugin we were using to handle this stopped working with the 4.27 version. Very annoying, because the game launched and performed flawlessly, except that many videos were missing 🫠<br/>
<br/>
HOWEVER! We tested the game with Proton and it performs great. The "Proton Hotfix" version works just fine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a follow-up post the developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/230210/discussions/0/552359157631578362/#c552359350148037993" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noted</a> they also tried WebM:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We tried, and no. Unreal 4.27 has crappy WebM support, the videos stuttered all the time. Believe me, we tried lots of approaches, and the solution seems to be resurrecting an old VLC plugin that has been discontinued for years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For now then, it <em>should</em> hopefully work if you use Proton. However, some players have replied to note the videos are not working for them even with Proton. So it might still need some improvements.</p>
<p>Check out the release trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qqlZ8NY4FNs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3155d2077be6a1846714d144fb0e6a90.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qqlZ8NY4FNs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Nice to see it finally get launched though, that was a long wait. I'll be following along for any Linux updates on it.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Both the OpenRazer driver and Polychromatic app for users have seen upgrades in the last few days to bring improved Razer device support to Linux. Not supported directly by Razer though, this continues to be a community effort.</p>

<ul>
<li>Add support for Razer Huntsman V3 Pro.</li>
<li>Add support for Razer Blade 15 Base (Late 2020).</li>

      <title>Mech combat game Mechanized Corps: Rebirth arrives in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Back in 2014 the mech combat game Dark Horizons: Mechanized Corps arrived on Steam in Early Access but it was eventually abandoned. Now, a few of the original team got back together to bring it back as Mechanized Corps: Rebirth.</p>
<p>So if you're in the mood for a new mech shooter, perhaps this is one to keep on your radar. Giving a very brief bit of background their team <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3434530/discussions/0/505068966120635859/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">said this</a> in a post on Steam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, Mechanized Corps: Rebirth (MCR) is by a few original Max Gaming developers from the previous Early Access game Dark Horizons: Mechanized Corps (DHMC) and games Lore: Aftermath and Dark Horizons: Lore Invasion (DHLI).<br/>
<br/>
Last year, in 2024, a few of the original Dark Horizons Universe folks got back together to revive the tabletop game and, at the same time, wanted to bring a PC gameplay experience back to Steam.<br/>
<br/>
From a scope standpoint, we feel that MCR is a much more reasonable game for X10. We want to provide solid mech gameplay and fun multi-player and single-player action and ensure we use the work we do on the tabletop game to enhance the PC experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All owners of the original have been gifted the new edition free.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="v061EdKveSc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7acc8a6abfe5a80c79f93211a85f619d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/v061EdKveSc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Current Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instant Action (play offline with AI-driven squad mates versus AI enemies).</li>
<li>Multi-player (fight online with friends against AI opponents or take on other players head to head in online arenas.</li>
<li>Manage your pilot (review stats and change faction allegiances).</li>
<li>Squad Management (Create or Join a Squad for online gameplay).</li>
<li>MC Hanger (Select your chassis, edit it, buy a new chassis, and create your ultimate machine of war!).</li>
<li><em>Campaign missions are not currently available.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>It has Native Linux support and a demo is available. They hope to finish it sometime around mid-2026.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck hits 18,000 games playable and verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another seriously impressive milestone has been hit. The Steam Deck now has 18,000 games that Valve have rated to be either Playable or Verified.</p>
<p>For a little background here on how long it's taken for the Steam Deck to hit these milestones across 2024 we had <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/steam-deck-officially-hits-over-13000-games-playable-and-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">13,000 in January</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/steam-deck-hits-14000-games-rated-playable-or-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">14,000 in March</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/steam-deck-hits-15000-games-rated-playable-and-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">15,000 in May</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/steam-deck-reaches-over-16000-playable-and-verified-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">16,000 in August</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/steam-deck-hits-17000-games-playable-and-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">17,000 in November</a>. With this being the <em>first</em> milestone hit during 2025. In case you missed it Valve also announced recently that during 2024, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/330-million-hours-played-on-steam-deck-in-2024-up-64-from-2023-steam-year-in-review-2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">330 million hours were played on Steam Deck</a>, which was a big increase from 2023.</p>
<p>When filtering specifically just to games on Steam at time of writing there's 6,012 Verified, 11,989 Playable and 4,593 Unsupported. As shown on <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5BappType%5D%5B0%5D=Game&amp;refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified&amp;refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B1%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Playable" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA RTX Remix released, plus Half-Life 2 RTX demo arrives March 18 - looking way too bright</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA have released NVIDIA RTX Remix, their modding platform that allows developers to enhance games with full ray tracing. Additionally, Half-Life 2 RTX is getting a demo on March 18th.</p>
<p>After a year or so in Beta, the release of NVIDIA RTX Remix brings with it DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation support. NVIDIA said that "Since that initial RTX Remix release, over 30,000 modders have experimented with hundreds of classic titles, and over 1 million gamers have played RTX Remix mods". It's open source and uses DXVK (part of Valve's Proton), under the MIT license, but only available for Windows via the NVIDIA app.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4EbVvrCuOBM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5e378b9344c0f731b37e144908361acf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4EbVvrCuOBM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Additionally, Half-Life 2 RTX that takes Valve's classic game and shoves ray tracing into it will get a demo on March 18th. They've shown off some more footage of it, and I'm thoroughly torn on it. I love the idea of enhancing games, and the newer textures look like a big improvement while keeping the style but overall this looks <em>far</em> too bright and shiny and just seems like it's lost part of what made it special. Still, as another sort-of tech demo of what the possibilities are with such upgrades, it's still quite interesting.</p>

      <title>As Epic Games continue ignoring Linux / Steam Deck for Fortnite they&#39;re putting it on Windows Arm</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ignoring one smaller market while gleefully supporting another, Epic Games have announced they're getting Fortnite along with Epic Online Services Anti-Cheat on Windows Arm.</p>
<p>Announced March 13th by Epic Games in a <a href="https://onlineservices.epicgames.com/en-US/news/windows-on-snapdragon-support-is-coming-to-epic-online-services-anti-cheat-and-fortnite" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are working with Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. to add Windows on Snapdragon support to <a href="https://onlineservices.epicgames.com/en-US/services-games" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Epic Online Services Anti-Cheat</a>, also known as Easy Anti-Cheat, and make Fortnite available for Windows on Snapdragon devices later this year. This will help developers bring more games to more devices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Worth noting that Epic's Easy Anti-Cheat <em>does</em> support Linux (including Steam Deck with SteamOS Linux), and there's many games that are supported (check <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">out our dedicated anti-cheat section</a>). However, EAC <em>doesn't</em> support the kernel-level side of it on Linux, which has resulted in a number of games actually <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/ea-respawn-now-block-apex-legends-from-running-on-linux-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">removing support like Apex Legends</a>.</p>
<p>Tim Sweeney of Epic Games <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/fortnite-on-linux-steam-deck-not-until-tens-of-millions-of-users/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously said</a> back in late 2023 that it wouldn't make sense to support Fortnite on Steam Deck until it has "tens of millions of users". I still have my doubts Epic will <em>ever</em> do it, even <em>if</em> the amount of Steam Deck users and SteamOS devices (with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a public SteamOS Beta coming</a>) continue to increase, since Epic firmly see Valve as a competitor with their Epic Games Store. Not that the Epic Store is actually doing well, as it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/amazons-previous-vp-of-prime-gaming-said-they-tried-everything-to-disrupt-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">continues coasting on revenue from Fortnite</a> while seeing a cut in third-party game spending.</p>
<p>Still, money talks, and what Sweeney said does still make sense purely from a business standpoint — they want to see the big bucks come in from each platform they add. Especially when Epic have others to keep happy like Tencent, Disney, Sony and more who have invested in them. Windows overall is already big, and Windows on Arm is likely to get bigger quite quickly with Epic noting it's a "rapidly growing segment of the PC gaming market".</p>
<p>Who knows, maybe Epic and Sweeney will prove me wrong one day and actually get Fortnite on Linux platforms. For that, we need those millions of users, and our only hope clearly is Valve for that. So I do hope we get a Steam Deck 2 and eventually a proper living room box. Valve did only just reveal that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/330-million-hours-played-on-steam-deck-in-2024-up-64-from-2023-steam-year-in-review-2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">330 million hours were played on Steam Deck in 2024</a> up 64% from 2023 so there's plenty of hope there.</p>

      <title>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3 announced and in development</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 was clearly a big success, so much so that Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3 has now been officially announced as in development.</p>
<p>There's no real details about it yet, other than it now being in development. Shared via a press release from Focus Entertainment Publishing, Games Workshop, and Saber Interactive they said more information will be revealed at a later date.</p>
<p>From the press release: "We have been honored by the incredible response from fans following the launch of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. We will continue to support the game with exciting content and regular updates in the coming years. Today, we are thrilled to announce that the adventure will continue with Space Marine 3. Players can look forward to an immersive campaign, a multiplayer mode, and innovations that will redefine the standards of third-person action games. Developed in close collaboration with Games Workshop, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3 will take the genre to new heights by introducing large-scale battles that are even more spectacular," said John Bert, Deputy CEO of Focus Entertainment Publishing, a subsidiary of the PULLUP Entertainment Group.</p>
<p>"Space Marine 2 has proven to be a transformative game for Saber. ​ It is the culmination of everything we have learned about game development in our 25 years in the business. ​ We are now starting to develop Space Marine 3, a game that carries with it tremendous expectations from our rapidly expanding fanbase. ​ While we will continue to support and grow the Space Marine 2 universe over the coming years, we will take all our learnings and apply them to an even bigger and more spectacular game for the third instalment. We view this as an opportunity to create a true love letter to the Warhammer 40.000 universe." said Matthew Karch, CEO of Saber Interactive. </p>
<p>Not really surprising since the developer revealed Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 managed to hit 4.5 million sales back in October 2024.</p>

      <title>Former Blue Systems devs form Techpaladin Software to work on KDE with Valve as their first client</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's one I missed from earlier this week. KDE developer Nate Graham announced the formation of an open source consultancy company called Techpaladin Software, with their first client being Valve to continue improving the Steam Deck desktop mode which uses KDE Plasma.</p>
<p>Techpaladin Software is co-owned by Nate Graham and another developer Linux fans may know, David Edmundson. Plus "about a dozen of Blue Systems' current people" will also be working there.</p>
<p>Nothing really changes here, other than the formation of the new company. As Graham said "it’s the result of a mutual decision made between the owner of Blue Systems, myself and David Edmundson, and Blue Systems' other personnel who are moving over". And that "Techpaladin will sponsor almost all of the same people Blue Systems did, and they will continue to enjoy the same wide latitude to improve KDE software for a living with a high level of personal and professional freedom" and they will be a KDE e.V. Patron too.</p>
<p>As for their business model? It's similar to Blue Systems. Companies pay them to work on open source software like KDE. And they're "inheriting Blue Systems' contract with Valve Inc. as our first client" so they "will continue to maintain and develop large amounts of KDE software relevant to the Steam Deck".</p>

      <title>PowerWash Simulator 2 announced for release in 2025 with split-screen co-op</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ah hell, here we go again, I'm going to be hooked on it. FuturLab have revealed PowerWash Simulator 2 is coming and it will be this year too. The first is definitely a don't knock it until you try it type of game. It's so weirdly relaxing and works great on Linux with Valve's Proton so I'm keen for an expanded sequel.</p>
<p>There's some really nice additions in this one too. Not online will online co-op return, but they're also adding in split-screen play. Awesome. Really great to see split-screen making a return to more games. It also adds in an all-new customizable home base system.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cFwqxoF7MwM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bbd63dbe3e50234466b2673d6fde9ebe.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cFwqxoF7MwM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>"PowerWash Simulator 2 feels like a natural evolution from its predecessor. The original game’s design was all about eliminating anything that detracted from the pure satisfaction of taking something dirty and making it clean. PowerWash Simulator 2 is all about adding in even more avenues for players to achieve that same sense of satisfaction, with new tools, features and quality of life improvements," says Dan Chequer, Design Director at FuturLab. "We're really excited to see players dust off their power washers and get stuck into this brand-new campaign, that brings you even more to clean, and even more ways to release the pressure."</p>
<p>"We couldn't be more thrilled to finally announce the sequel to one of our most successful titles. With over 17 million players worldwide, PowerWash Simulator has allowed us to self-publish a sequel, an exciting challenge we are delighted to undertake," says Chris Mehers, COO of FuturLab. "We look forward to bringing players the next step-up in the PowerWash Simulator series."</p>

      <title>SILENT HILL f has now been fully revealed with a new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Originally revealed back in 2022, KONAMI have now properly lifted the lid on SILENT HILL f and graced us with a new trailer. The game developed by NeoBards Entertainment Ltd. with a script from Ryukishi07 who people may know from the likes of Higurashi When They Cry, Umineko When They Cry and Ciconia When They Cry.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Ag157nqMV0Q"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e865572e648a7af49bdaec6df709c674.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Ag157nqMV0Q" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1960s Japan, Shimizu Hinako's secluded town of Ebisugaoka is consumed by a sudden fog, transforming her home into a haunting nightmare.</p>
<p>As the town falls silent and the fog thickens, Hinako must navigate the twisted paths of Ebisugaoka, solving complex puzzles and confronting grotesque monsters to survive.</p>
<p>Immerse yourself into Hinako's world imagined by renowned author Ryukishi07, with entrancing music, including pieces by Akira Yamaoka, and beautiful visuals in a gripping tale of doubt, regret, and inescapable choices. Will Hinako embrace the beauty hidden within terror, or succumb to the madness that lies ahead?</p>
<p>Discover a new chapter in the SILENT HILL series, blending psychological horror with a haunting Japanese setting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's no date for the game yet but a Steam release is confirmed so we'll be able to play it with Valve's Proton. The setting sounds really interesting so I can't wait to play.</p>

      <title>330 million hours played on Steam Deck in 2024 up 64% from 2023 - Steam Year In Review 2024</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have released their Steam Year In Review 2024 and it's full of interesting data, as well as going over all the changes Valve made to Steam during 2024. Nice to see the Steam Deck and Linux doing so well overall for Valve.</p>
<p>A large part of the post is a refresher on features Valve shipped like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/steam-families-has-officially-launched-with-a-big-steam-client-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Families</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/steam-game-recording-has-officially-launched/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Game Recording</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/steam-store-pages-are-about-to-get-a-lot-cleaner-valve-puts-an-end-to-game-advert-spam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cleaning up store page publisher spam</a>, launching <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/valve-makes-paid-advanced-access-a-clear-feature-on-steam-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Advanced Access</a>, major <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/the-first-stable-steam-and-steam-deck-update-of-2024-is-here/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">improvements to the Steam Workshop</a>, requiring developers to list if their game <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-games-will-now-need-to-fully-disclose-kernel-level-anti-cheat-on-store-pages/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">uses Kernel-Level Anti-Cheat</a>, improvements for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/valve-makes-a-big-improvement-for-native-linux-games-in-a-steam-beta-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">running Native Linux games</a>, requiring <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/valve-announces-new-rules-for-games-with-ai-content-on-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">developers to disclose their use of AI</a> and lots more. We're also currently waiting on Valve shipping that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">public SteamOS Beta that should be sometime soon</a>.</p>
<p>Once you get through the details of what Valve did, then we get to some of the juicy statistics.</p>
<p>There's some interesting bits in there like how the "Steam Deck generated an incredible 330 million hours of Steam playtime in 2024 alone—a 64% increase over 2023". That's pretty impressive on the number of hours but even more so when it increased by such a huge amount. Valve said the future of their hardware is bright too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The future of hardware at Valve is bright. Steam Deck, SteamOS and SteamVR are delivering tons of value to players and devs, built on top of a decade of investments into UI, linux compatibility, input support, custom silicon, motion tracking, displays, battery efficiency, and more. Every developer making PC games benefits from these investments, and players can now enjoy their PC games in so many new contexts. Hardware teams at Valve are delighted to see Steam in the living room, the airport, the backyard, and wherever else customers want to bring their library of PC games.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for the growth of Steam, Valve gave us some numbers on that too and it's quite impressive, although they're not giving us new monthly active users (sadly).</p>
<p>Valve said that 1.7 million new users who came from a "top 2023 release went on to enjoy more than 141 million hours of playtime in additional games" along with them spending "$20 million on in-game transactions across hundreds of other games—plus another $73 million on premium games and DLC across thousands more products".</p>
<p>2024 was a big year for new releases too, Valve said it was the "platform's best year ever in terms of customers buying newly released games". Giving a little more detail about how new releases did in 2024; including revenue from the first 30 days following a game release, including pre-purchase revenue and using any Early Access dates instead of a 1.0 release in 2024, Valve listed some major takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Release revenue per year has increased almost exactly 10x since 2014.</li>
<li>In 2024, more than 500 new titles exceeded $250,000 in New Release revenue (up 27% from 2023).</li>
<li>In 2024, more than 200 new titles exceeded $1 million in New Release revenue (up 15% from 2023).</li>
</ul>
<p>One success story that was highlighted is TCG Card Shop Simulator, Valve said it was one of the most successful launches of 2024. Developed by OPNeon Games from Malaysia, Valve noted how the developer is from a "territory that makes up only 0.5% of global traffic on Steam" and their game managed to get "well over a million customers in its first month". Going back to the note above about new customers sticking around from a 2023 release, Valve said about "10,000 of them went on to buy TCG Card Shop Sim".</p>
<p>In closing Valve said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2024 is in the history books, but our work to improve Steam and Steamworks continues. All year long we'll be attending conferences, hosting roundtables, reading forum comments, and working hard on Steam so that the Year In Review 2025 is packed with more improvements.</p>

      <title>DXVK 2.6 brings expanded Nvidia Reflex support and lots of game fixes for Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>DXVK is a tool used by Proton that translates Direct3D 8 / 9 / 10 / 11 to Vulkan. It's one of the projects that enables Windows games to run so well on Linux platforms like Steam Deck. Version 2.6 was just released.</p>
<p>You don't need to do anything, as Proton pulls in updates from DXVK directly in future releases. However, if you do wish to upgrade DXVK early, be sure to read <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-update-dxvk-and-vkd3d-proton-in-proton-and-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my dedicated guide on it</a>.</p>
<p>DXVK 2.6 includes expanded support for Nvidia Reflex when paired up with Proton Experimental for games that use DirectX 11. Noted games it works with includes "God of War, Overwatch 2, Quake Champions and some others". It does not work with "most Unreal Engine 4 games in D3D11 mode" so you should use DirectX 12 where you can.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Then there's lots of game-specific fixes for the likes of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assassin's Creed 3 and Black Flag</li>
<li>Watch Dogs 1 &amp; 2</li>
<li>Stalker: Clear Sky</li>
<li>Baldurs Gate 3</li>
<li>Cardfight!! Vanguard Dear Days 2</li>
<li>Trine 5</li>
<li>God of War</li>
<li>Clanfolk</li>
<li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</li>
<li>CivCity: Rome</li>
<li>Global Operations</li>
<li>Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit 2</li>
<li>Silent Hill 2</li>
<li>Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell</li>
<li>Trainz v1.3</li>
</ul>
<details class="spoiler_container"><summary class="spoiler_header">Full changelog, click me</summary>
<div class="spoiler-content">
<h2>D3D10 / D3D11</h2>
<h3>Nvidia Reflex support</h3>
<p>When running Proton Experimental and an Nvidia driver with <code class="inline-code">VK_NV_low_latency2</code> support, Reflex can now be enabled in D3D11 games that support this feature. This includes <strong>God of War</strong>, <strong>Overwatch 2</strong>, <strong>Quake Champions</strong> and some others. Approximate input latency can be displayed in these games by setting <code class="inline-code">DXVK_HUD=latency</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Reflex does <strong>not</strong> work in most Unreal Engine 4 games in D3D11 mode since <code class="inline-code">LatencySleep</code> and other related functions never get called. This cannot be worked around inside DXVK; prefer using D3D12 for affected games.</p>
<h3>Bug fixes and Improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Worked around a common game bug that would cause garbled output on Nvidia when using MSAA. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/4480" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4480</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4731" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4731</a>)<br/>
	This affects games such as <strong>Assassin's Creed 3 / Black Flag</strong>, <strong>Watch Dogs</strong>, <strong>Stalker: Clear Sky</strong>, and others.<br/>
<strong>Note:</strong> This may have a small impact on performance on memory usage in affected games, including on AMD GPUs, where this issue did not manifest in rendering issues due to hardware details.</li>
<li>Potentially improved GPU-bound performance in games that use NVAPI UAVOverlap feature, such as <strong>Baldurs Gate 3</strong>.<br/>
	While this feature was supported before, our previous implementation was too conservative. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4691" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4691</a>)<br/>
<strong>Note:</strong> LIke other vendor extensions, this does not work on Windows.</li>
<li>Removed <code class="inline-code">d3d11.dcSingleUseMode</code> option. Submitting deferred command lists multiple times will now behave as expected by default.<br/>
<strong>Note:</strong> This may increase memory usage in some games. Fixes rendering issues in <strong>Cardfight!! Vanguard Dear Days 2</strong>.</li>
<li>Slightly improved GPU-bound performance in modern games that extensively use pixel shader UAVs, such as <strong>Trine 5</strong>. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4693" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4693</a>)</li>
<li>Slightly reduced CPU overhead in some games that use resource binding methods inefficiently, such as <strong>God of War</strong>.</li>
<li>Fixed layered D3D11 video processor view creation. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4651" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4651</a>)</li>
<li>Added support for the <code class="inline-code">ID3D11On12Device1</code> interop interface.</li>
<li><strong>Clanfolk</strong>: Worked around a game bug that would cause missing geometry on Intel. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4716" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4716</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</strong>: Fixed a case of invalid Vulkan usage. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4684" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4684</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Watch Dogs 2</strong>: Worked around a game bug that would cause the sky to flicker on RDNA3 GPUs. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4717" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4717</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>D3D8 / D3D9</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a race condition that could lead to crashes in games doing multi-threaded asset loading. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/4613" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4613</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4646" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4646</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed various issues that would occur when disabling shader support via the <code class="inline-code">d3d9.shaderModel</code> option. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/4625" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4625</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4629" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4629</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where games using both software and hardware cursors would not transition between the two smoothly. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4670" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4670</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed a regression that would cause textures to not be bound correctly in some games. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4694" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4694</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where games that request half-rate Vsync would run at quarter-rate instead.</li>
<li>Fixed minor issues that would cause wine test failures. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4732" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4732</a>)</li>
<li><strong>CivCity: Rome</strong>: Added vendor ID override to make the game render shadows on Intel GPUs. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4739" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4739</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Global Operations</strong>: Fixed rendering issues (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/4138" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4138</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4678" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4678</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit 2</strong>: Fixed missing fog. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/4113" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4113</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4653" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4653</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Silent Hill 2</strong>: Fixed an issue where the menu would render incorrectly with the <em>Silent HIll 2 Enhancements</em> mod. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/3943" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#3943</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/3948" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#3948</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell</strong>: Worked around alt+tab and shadow rendering issues. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4656" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4656</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4660" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4660</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Trainz v1.3</strong>: Worked around alt+tab issue. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/4116" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4116</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4659" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4659</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>General Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Reworked Vulkan swapchain implementation to be more robust. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4609" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4609</a>)</li>
<li>Improved efficiency of multisample resolves on tiling GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression introduced in DXVK 2.5 that would cause memory allocation errors on certain unified memory setups, including the Qualcomm proprietary driver.<br/>
<strong>Note:</strong> This does not mean that DXVK will officially support Android, or proprietary mobile drivers.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash if an application unloads the SetupAPI DLL. This issue affected various AdvHD-based visual novels. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/4662" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4662</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4668" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4668</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where software rasterizers such as Lavapipe would not be considered when setting <code class="inline-code">DXVK_FILTER_DEVICE_NAME</code>. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4716" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4716</a>)</li>
<li>Resource initialization is now always performed on the asynchronous transfer queue if possible, and no longer uses additional memory on drivers that support Vulkan sparse residency features. This may save up to 64 MiB of VRAM in some games.</li>
<li>Worked around an <code class="inline-code">std::regex</code> bug that would cause games to instantly crash when using Japanese locale. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4669" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4669</a>)</li>
<li>Worked around potential 32-bit crashes caused by stack alignment issues in GCC-compiled binaries. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4627" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4627</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4633" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4633</a>)</li>

      <title>Steam Spring Sale 2025 is live now - here&#39;s some great budget games for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have launched the first of their planned four major seasonal sales for 2025, with the Steam Spring Sale launched featuring plenty of big discounts and demos.</p>
<p>They also have a fresh trailer to mark the event featuring a bunch of different games:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="C-4SwzW0KoA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9c0ca8c3c9b72da2b26a77caee2a7e31.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/C-4SwzW0KoA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For this event Valve have also put up a Deep Discounts section again, so you can look to find some of the biggest discounts they have during the sale. No sale on Steam Deck hardware though, that's more likely later on in the year.</p>
<p>Going over the list I've managed to pick out a number of different games I think are worth grabbing. All of them suitable for those of you on a budget and I've stuck to those that are <img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"> Steam Deck Verified only, to ensure no matter what they should work great on <em>both</em> Steam Deck and Desktop Linux as a whole.</img></p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It looks very much like Advance Wars. LAVABIRD and First Break Labs have announced that Warside is set for launch now on April 14th.</p>
<p>You'll be able to battle across icy snow environments, sandy deserts, toxic wastelands and more in various modes including solo play (campaign and skirmish), co-op and PvP. There's a buit-in mission editor for you to make your own battles too. Various different types of combatants to command including snipers, medics, mortar teams, artillery, tanks, submarines, and warships. You get to pick between fourteen different commanders to progress through it, with each of them having different passive skills and special battle powers.</p>

      <title>Palworld is getting crossplay in &#39;late March&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pocketpair have announced that sometime real soon you'll be able to team up with players across different platforms in the popular monster catcher Palworld.</p>
<p>They said it will come in "late March" but didn't give any other specifics on the date. We'll just have to wait and see. In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/541100079887417458" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This update will implement multiplayer between different platforms and the ability to move Pals between worlds.</p>
<p>Crossplay is supported between all currently released platforms, including Steam, Xbox, PS5 and Mac. Please enjoy crossplay with your family and friends!</p>
<p>For more details, please check the release notes that will be published on the day of the update.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15703146961741869775gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>In case you missed it, Pocketpair announced a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/palworld-gets-a-roadmap-including-co-op-crossplay-world-transfers-for-pals-and-an-ending/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">roadmap back in February</a> with plenty more planned to arrive for the game including actually having an ending. Nice to see one part of the roadmap will be coming soon! Optimization is included in their plans, which will be good to see, since it definitely could do with some to perform better on devices like the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Palworld is rated Steam Deck Playable by Valve and Gold on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1623730" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a>. I've played quite a lot of it and can confirm for Desktop Linux users it does run great. </p>

      <title>Hello Sunshine has you walking in the shadow of a giant robot so you&#39;re not fried by the sun</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just announced from Red Thread Games (Dreamfall Chapters, Draugen, Dustborn) is Hello Sunshine, a mysterious survival game where you're following a truly massive robot and keeping to their shadow to not get fried by the sun.</p>
<p>I have to admit the whole idea of this has me fully intrigued. I love a good giant robot, and the teaser trailer certainly left me wanting a whole lot more. The trailer doesn't actually show any proper gameplay though, more just introducing the world and the giant robot.</p>
<p>Check it out below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="XI-HO3uoCmQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6a9009baae43472bc0ceb247ab9e2f2c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/XI-HO3uoCmQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The Steam page at least gives us a much clearer idea of what you'll be doing, along with some actual clear in-game shots. Here's some more about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello Sunshine is a mystery survival RPG set in the sun-scorched ruins of a corporate empire. You play the final employee. Your mission: reach the tower at the end of the road, and help decide the fate of what remains of this world.</p>
<p>To survive the blistering heat and deadly sun, you'll walk in the shadow of a towering war machine, scavenging for supplies and searching for pieces to the puzzle.</p>
<p>When the sun sets and the robot stops to charge, you'll  make camp, craft new gear, and repair your mechanical guardian. But the wasteland is freezing cold at night. Stay close to the robot to keep warm.</p>
<p>The journey to the tower is long. You won't make it on your own. As the sun rises, the robot starts walking. Follow — and stay alive until the end of the road.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Definitely going to be keeping an eye on this one! Sounds really unique and it will be playable in online co-op too.</p>

      <title>Moon Studios developer of Ori and No Rest for the Wicked goes &#39;fully independent&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some good industry news for you today. Moon Studios who made Ori and the Blind Forest, Ori and the Will of the Wisps and their current Early Access game No Rest for the Wicked have gone "fully independent".</p>
<p>The news was shared in their latest update video for No Rest for the Wicked where Gennadiy Korol, the Co-Founder and Director of Moon Studios said: "After months of negotiations, we reached an agreement to buy the publishing rights for No Rest for the Wicked back so that Moon Studios could become fully independent". Following that the Creative Director, Thomas Mahler, said: "We believe this will give you even more confidence in our vision, because we're free to build No Rest for the Wicked exactly how we want".</p>
<p>Just a small part of the below video where they talk about a huge update coming to the game on April 30th:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CzAtYaSYZms"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e85095d0a0185040f064d09eb6a2c873.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CzAtYaSYZms" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>No Rest for the Wicked is rated Steam Deck Verified and Platinum on ProtonDB. So it appears to work well on Linux with Valve's Proton.</p>

      <title>Bazzite Linux announced two new editions designed for game developers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bazzite Linux, a popular choice for people wanting to put Linux on their handhelds or living room PC, is getting two new editions designed to help developers.</p>
<p>Writing on their official forum, the two new editions will be Bazzite DX and Bazzite GDX. As developer NiHaiden said in the announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Building upon the incredible work by the <a href="https://artifacthub.io/packages/container/amyos/amyos" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">amyOS</a> developers, we are officially announcing the creation of Bazzite DX and Bazzite GDX (Game Developer Experience).</p>
<p>Bazzite DX will be developer focused edition which will include general developer goodies, just like Bluefin DX or Aurora DX. This will be a general developer image, so it will be scoped to match our existing developer modes.</p>
<p>Bazzite GDX is the one we’re excited about the most. This will be a game-developer focused edition of Bazzite filled with awesome tools (like Godot) and whatever goodies the community builds with us. It’s purpose is to be a kickass game developer workstation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They're now available in a prototype Alpha testing stage for any developer or user wanting to help test and give feedback on how to make it a success.</p>
<p>An interesting idea, and given the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/steamos-like-bazzite-linux-has-some-nice-growth-thanks-to-great-handheld-pc-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">rise in popularity of Bazzite</a>, it might make sense. Giving developers a similar stable platform to develop, test and play their games across a range of supported hardware. Even though Valve have SteamOS, they haven't put it out to the public yet, so Bazzite has really been picking up a lot of slack here. It will be interesting to see what they will bring to the table.</p>

      <title>Spell-combining co-op survivor-like The Spell Brigade adds a new character and a new game mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A game that continues to review well by players, with it hitting a good sales milestone not long after launch, The Spell Brigade from Bolt Blaster Games has a big update out now with a brand new character. It has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>More about it: The Spell Brigade is a survivors-like with online co-op for 1-4 players. Team up with your wizard friends to slay hordes of dark creatures. Complete team-based objectives, unlock new upgrades, and create overpowered spell synergies. Friend nor foe is safe in this friendly fire bullet hell!</p>
<p>Not seen it before? Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xNplw0h5Qkk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6e9709435bef05e3b9fe80a0965195c7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xNplw0h5Qkk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">New additions:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Wizard: Maggie: The Spell Brigade welcomes the eleventh wizard to their ranks. Maggie uses her bird-like features to spot pickups from far away and wields a unique spell called "Aurora Wings," which casts mystic birds across the battlefield that pick off targets one by one.</li>
<li>Wizard Traits &amp; Ranks: Following community feedback, Bolt Blaster Games has reworked and rebalanced each wizard's stats and effects. Every mage now has unique attributes that define their specific role within a team. Examples include Reginald's luck-based abilities, Aldric's occasional healing powers, and Kavin's... distinctive Kavin-ness. Each wizard now also has their own rank, which players can level up to show off their shiny badges to their teammates.</li>
<li>Single Spell Mode: A new covenant called "Solitary Focus" challenges players to rely solely on their Starter Spell. As players progress, this single spell evolves to extraordinary power levels, offering a fresh strategic approach to their runs.</li>
</ul>
<p>They said it will also be discounted during the Steam Spring Sale with 25% off (it's biggest discount so far) which begins later today. Looks like another great one to add to your library, which I still haven't had a chance to properly dive into yet.</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s what was shown off during the Humble Games Showcase 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Humble Games Showcase 2025 just recently went live and with it we have some new game announcements and trailers. So here's what you might have missed to keep you up to date.</p>
<h4>The Pre-Show</h4>
<p>Firstly, they had a little pre-show where they showed off a couple of teasers.</p>
<p>The first of which was <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3467710/Wall_World_2/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Wall World 2</a> (2025)</strong>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The world of the Wall awaits. Wall World 2 builds on the mining rogue-lite experience with expanded mechanics, new challenges, and deeper gameplay. Explore procedurally generated mines full of new discoveries and dangers. Extract valuable resources, harness lost technologies, and upgrade your robospider and exosuit to survive against hordes of raging monsters. Venture through incredible biomes and uncover the secrets entombed in the depths of the Wall.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CBwohPsHDl4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/14b80574f65bcbddbbe17ce9144263e6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CBwohPsHDl4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>They also showed off a trailer for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2303350/Sticky_Business/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Sticky Business</a> but that's not a new game and actually released back in 2023.</em></p>
<p>Next up for actual announcements in the pre-show was <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2744010/Urban_Jungle/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Urban Jungle</a> (21st March).</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Urban Jungle is a charming and relaxing simulation game that invites you to transform small, ordinary apartments into lush, green havens by placing delightful plants with savvy. But no worries, you won’t have to deal with watering or pest control – the plants just need a good spot, and that's enough to create the comfiest and coziest home of them all. Oh, and don’t forget to pet your cat!</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="j44G5_9sEWA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/20d6c0ef50775dfc420825ed9151efca.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/j44G5_9sEWA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Then they moved onto a new trailer for <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2412240/Bubble_Ghost_Remake/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bubble Ghost Remake</a> (27th March)</strong>.</p>

      <title>A Sweeping Journey Down The Path In The Woods: Slay The Princess Pristine Cut Interview</title>
      <author>alexa_bement</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>When you make your way out of the cabin in the woods at the end of a production cycle, what happens next?</p>
<p>With the release of Slay The Princess: The Pristine Cut DLC, I asked Black Tabby Games developers Tony Howard-Aris and Abby Howard about the game's past and present, as well as the future of Black Tabby Games, and even some <em>very</em> important lore about the Voices. Let's dive deeper into the woods with the developers of Slay the Princess:</p>
<p><strong>When you originally released the game, what were your expectations for its reception compared to what you've received?</strong></p>
<p>Tony says of Slay The Princess, "We had pretty high expectations for how it would sell based on a combination of wishlist data and general engagement on social media and our Steam forums. But then the actual performance wound up blowing those already high expectations out of the water, which is great! Really, really freeing. In terms of audience/critical reception, we were a little shakier before the game came out.</p>
<p>The game takes some unexpected metaphysical and poetic turns that weren’t communicated in the demo, and we figured they might be some harder pills to swallow for some players? So we were a little nervous until we sent builds of the finished game to our testers - and even though the reception there was great, we were still a little nervous before launch. We were expecting something that would maybe be around 87% positive on Steam, not 97% positive."</p>
<p>Slay The Princess: The Pristine Cut currently sits at the 97% positive review rating based on 17,513 user reviews, has sold half a million copies, and has a 90% on Metacritic and a 96/100 on OpenCritic. It also won the OTK Video Game Awards's Best RPG, The Horror Game Awards' Player's Choice, and World Soundtrack Awards' Game Music Award. It seems the Princess has climbed even higher than the height of her Tower form!</p>
<p><strong>What made you decide to expand on Slay The Princess?</strong></p>
<p>Abby said that "it was a combination of things, first and foremost being an AMA we did about a week after launch– a few folks asked us if we were planning on doing any DLC, and at the time the answer was no, but I think that very night we wound up deciding that there actually were some areas we thought deserved to be more fleshed-out. I think having a little breathing room after the launch was also a big part of it. It was such a scramble to get the base game done by our deadline that we didn’t have the opportunity to step back and give it a nice long look, and see the areas that still needed a little extra something.</p>
<p>And personally, I didn’t love that there were “holes” in the pattern of the game. Most Chapter 2 princess forms have two Chapter 3s, one that’s a fusion with another princess and one that’s unique to them, and several Chapter 2 princesses only had a fusion, leaving these little holes that I didn’t love. But I don’t see any more of those holes now! I’m very happy with where the game is, and we’ve had plenty of time to sit around hemming and hawing over it this time. The Pristine Cut was very satisfying to finish!"</p>
<p>The Pristine Cut was announced in December 2023 and released almost exactly a year to the original release date of the game after months of development. In addition to a new ending and an expanded Apotheosis and Fury, the Pristine Cut brought three new routes to focus solely on Damsel, Prisoner, and Spectre respectively. Each of these Princesses now mutate further to play with the consequences of a specific outcome from the original release.</p>
<p>Tony added to the discussion of the time constraints with finishing the original release, "Time was a huge, almost self-imposed constraint on Slay the Princess’ development so we wouldn’t spend too much time away from Scarlet Hollow, our other, ongoing title. But I think the intensity that came from constraining our time led to a lot of really interesting decisions that ultimately elevated Slay the Princess as a finished product. So much of the flow of the narrative and its game-world is dream-like, so working quickly and exploring any idea that felt natural contributed a lot to nailing that vibe. The original demo for Slay the Princess was made in about two weeks." The original demo was released on August 5th of 2022, with an expanded demo then coming out in March of 2023, and the full original game in October 2023.</p>
<p><strong>What was the writing thought process and approach like, coming back to the game to expand on the existing narrative compared to the original cut?</strong></p>
<p>Tony said "A lot of it came down to looking at the big-picture themes of the game and asking ourselves, “What haven’t we said about this?” It helped that we at least knew what chapters we were expanding — even the new Princesses all are offshoots of chapters that are already in the game, so that narrowed it down.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it felt like we needed to spend more time on the fleshy parts of being alive. The physical parts of love. Deeper explorations of what it means to be trapped in a loop that’s changing, but <em>only a little bit</em>. How does having a different vantage point change the shape of the story? How does that change or redeem the shape of a relationship? And there’s something in there that I feel is a really important farewell and book-end to the game in general, even if people wind up playing it out of order. I’ll let the readers figure out what I’m talking about with all of that ;)."</p>
<p>I suspect I know exactly which new route Tony is alluding to there, but if you know, you know. Indeed, Slay The Princess is a <em>very</em> physical game, with its ability to convey just about every single form of body horror you can think of at one point or another while still being hauntingly beautiful. Add in the love story at the center of the game between the severed halves of the cycle of transformation, and said love certainly got physical many times over.</p>
<p>"Slay the Princess is also the kind of game that, despite its heavily branching narrative, lends itself very well to updates," Abby added. "It would not be anywhere near as easy to add the kinds of sweeping updates we’ve been able to add to, say, our other game, Scarlet Hollow– that game’s narrative structure is much more of a braid, where the wide branching paths have to intersect constantly, and are held up by a delicate scaffolding of everything that came before. Slay the Princess was always about exploring these unique little pathways and seeing just how far they could be pushed, and honestly, the bits we’ve added slotted in very nicely to the existing structure– again, like filling holes!"</p>
<p>Without spoilers, certain 'what ifs' that went unaddressed in the original release about the premise of the games' looping narrative and the rules it works on were finally answered in the Pristine Cut. With these holes filled up, pretty much every possible outcome feels explored by the full game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8006686671741858281gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8006686671741858281gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p><strong>What drew you to decide to write a story about the themes present in Slay The Princess?</strong></p>
<p>"Themes in general, I feel, tend to come about organically after you’ve figured out the core story that you’re working on," Tony said on the matter. "They always just sort of happen while you’re exploring the text. For Slay the Princess, we knew we were telling a story about a being that was shaped by the perception of others (The Princess) and the story of someone who was terrified of the danger that being posed (The Narrator). But getting at the deeper themes of it took a lot of extra digging. It was a lot harder than, say, Scarlet Hollow, where the story is so detailed and so rooted in the physical world.</p>
<p>Slay the Princess is so abstract, you know? I think it was around the time I started playing with that first conversation with the Shifting Mound—the one you have after you finish your first “route”—that I really started figuring out the themes. That this was a story about change and its relationship with death. That it was ultimately a love story at its core. Once we figured that out, the Stranger chapter, which we’d been stuck on for a while, and which Abby likes to describe as an “overture” for the game, really came together, and that’s around the point the themes became very <em>conscious</em>, if that makes sense."</p>
<p>"It’s exactly what Tony said," Abby added. "I feel like themes are often not something I start with when writing. Rather, I just start playing with ideas that interest me, and as those ideas are fleshed out, the theme starts to become obvious. At a certain point when you’re working on something, it’s important to step back and try to pinpoint what you might be fixating on, the underlying fascination with whatever larger idea is lurking under the surface of your work, so you can communicate it more effectively. And I do think most things have some underlying thesis, even if the writer didn’t know it!"</p>
<p>The first conversation with the Shifting Mound happens right after where the second demo stopped. By that point, it was clear the Princess was some kind of entity changing to your perception and the Narrator was trying to prevent you from knowing this- the only way to kill her without dying yourself was to immediately do as you're told without engaging in conversation with her. Yet without the deeper theme revealed by this conversation and the rest of the original release, Slay The Princess would seem like just another horrific looping-your-choices-matter game. However, the decision to make the looping and choice mechanics directly tied to a story of the choice between a perfect stasis and letting go of something to make room for the cycle of new invokes a question of what it means to be alive or happy, elevating the game's storytelling abilities far beyond my personal expectations.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5341535641741858307gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5341535641741858307gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p><strong>As I understand it, with the Pristine Cut the game is officially finished except for console porting. Now that you're nearing the end of the developmental journey on Slay The Princess, how do you feel reflecting back on the entire process?</strong></p>
<p>Abby said she is "mostly just very proud of the work the team has done. Everyone really gave it their all, and I love how it all came together! I feel like Tony and I learned a lot of valuable skills that are helping us make our other game even better going forward, and have broken a lot of personal barriers that are helping us understand what we’re capable of, even as a small team.</p>
<p>Animation, for instance, is something I started learning for Slay the Princess, and I’m really happy with how far I’ve come just since the very start of development! It’s so helpful in our line of work, and it was something I had always told myself I was incapable of trying. Just goes to show, the hardest part of learning a skill is defeating that little voice that’s telling you it’s impossible to even get started. The second-hardest part is getting good… and it’s a close second…"</p>
<p>Tony agreed to being proud of the work done, adding that "Something I profoundly appreciate about working in video games is that, more than any other form of media, games are living, breathing artifacts. Interaction changes them. Nothing is set in stone. I love nothing more than to look back at a release and, even if it went well, even if people <em>really</em> liked it, going back and making it better. Figuring out what more could be said. I’m very glad we had that opportunity to do that for Slay the Princess, and I am so proud of everyone who worked on it with us. Everyone has grown so much."</p>
<p>With all the success of the original release and the overwhelmingly positive reaction to the Pristine Cut, the inspiring journey they took is worth its weight in gold. The animations in the game and its release trailers are so stunning you would never guess it was done by someone learning as she went! If this development story teaches us anything, it's that nothing is impossible indeed!</p>
<p><strong>What advice would you give to someone wanting to make a branching narrative or psychological horror like Slay The Princess?</strong></p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16540003831741858340gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16540003831741858340gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>"I think the most important thing is to figure out exactly what ideas really interest you," Tony said. "Figure out exactly what story you <em>want</em> to tell. People can tell when a project really comes from the heart, and they love that. At the end of the day, art is about connection. It’s about communicating with other people. So you have to know what you want to communicate. I’ll also say that, if you’re looking to tell a story with a video game, you need to ask yourself <em>why</em> this story needs to be a video game. You need to ask yourself what is it about <em>this medium</em> that makes it right for your story. What works for a novel won’t necessarily work for a game, and vice versa. For us, at the end of the day, it comes down to how important it is for our readers to experience the events of our stories directly, as characters, as opposed to reading <em>about</em> events from an outside perspective.</p>
<p>If it’s <em>important</em> for your player to step directly into someone else’s shoes, or if it’s important for the player to <em>wear their own shoes</em> somewhere they otherwise would never wear them… that’s when you want to make a game."</p>
<p>Visual novel games like Slay The Princess are named as such for being text-heavy and full of dialogue and choices. As Tony alludes to, video games have always stood out from other mediums for being the most interactive, making them perfect for Slay The Princess' choose-your-own-adventure narrative device. The player is always right with the Hero's constant confusion as he deals with the surreal nature of the game, and the choices feel like the players' own. While I would of course love to see the game in other formats, Slay The Princess is definitively meant to be a video game. And one full of heart and creativity, which drew me to the game in the first place and made that connection discussed. I almost cried while playing on both original and Pristine release.</p>
<p>"As for advice on narratives and psychological horror in particular," Abby added on, "I think a nice big piece of advice is to never get too precious with what you’ve already done. If you wind up zoning out or otherwise not enjoying the work you’re doing, there’s a chance that players/readers won’t enjoy it, either. This is our mantra at Black Tabby Games, that if something sucks to work on, it will probably suck to play!"</p>
<p>The developers discussed multiple times in the past having a strict policy on cutting content. If something isn't working, it's cut. Slay The Princess alone had multiple updates cutting down voice lines and other small pieces they felt unnecessary to streamline the experience.</p>
<p>"I also recommend reading nonfiction," Abby added. "Reading fiction can help a lot in understanding what kind of prose style you want to use, but nonfiction is especially helpful for writing horror. I feel there’s no better place to turn than reality to help you understand what horrifies you and why."</p>
<p>Reality is indeed very terrifying- while the game is very fairytale in nature, the body horror of every conceivable angle probably came from something much more grounded in reality, and that gives the game a harsh edge to truly lean into the horror angle. Nonfiction it is!</p>
<p><strong>What's next for Scarlet Hollow and potential future projects?</strong></p>
<p>"Well, first thing’s first," Tony said, "we’ve got a <em>big</em> patch in the oven for Scarlet Hollow that’ll be releasing at some point before Episode 5. Now that we have Slay the Princess under our belts, we’re a lot more confident in tackling some interesting narrative challenges that were left unsolved in the first couple of episodes. Like, what happens if you <em>don’t</em> go into the woods with Stella? Can we still bring everything together into the same compelling, overarching narrative if we afford our players a little more agency early on?</p>
<p>This was a big, unsolvable problem for us for a while, but having a little extra distance helped us come up with some really good solutions, and we can’t wait to share it with folks. No release date to share, but it’ll be sooner than people think. And then from there, Episode 5 sometime next year, and then we’ll be releasing 6 and 7 together."</p>
<p>Scarlet Hollow is the pair's first and ongoing game that releases chapter by chapter in an ongoing story, from which Slay The Princess was made as a smaller project they could make all at once in order to fund its future. How exciting that trying their hand at another type of visual novel has given them new ideas for the scope of their golden child!</p>
<p>"And after <em>that</em>, Abby’s got an excellent comic to finish, and we’ve already got some ideas for a third game that we’re <em>really</em> excited for," Tony continued. "We might be branching out from visual novels a little bit with that one."</p>
<p>You heard it from him, we may see a new genre of game from Black Tabby Games in the future! With how quickly they mastered visual novels, what else could they learn and grow and succeed in?</p>
<p>Now that we've heard a lot about the development process behind Slay The Princess, it's time for the <strong><em>real</em></strong> questions…</p>
<p><strong>Which Princess would be the most difficult ghost to contend with in Phasmophobia?</strong></p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7510811721741858358gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7510811721741858358gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>On this question, they disagreed.</p>
<p>Abby's vote was "The Wraith, she’s already a ghost, plus she’s mad at you. The possession angle would also be fun when it comes to multiplayer, as your friends can haunt you while their bodies are being twisted horribly by her." Meanwhile, Tony simply said this: "Adversary. I’ve played Phasmophobia. Those guys don’t have any weapons. Get punched to death."</p>
<p>With the exception of Damsel, every Princess is dangerous in their own way. No matter which one you pick to be a ghost in the ghost-hunting video game classic, those players are in for a world of hurt. I have to say that Tony's answer is objectively the funniest, but Abby's is objectively the scariest and would make for a fun mechanic. Watching people scream as their friends die in Phasmophobia never gets old, imagine if they got to watch that?</p>
<p>While this is valuable information, nothing comes close to the ultimate question of the interview I had to put on the table:</p>
<p><strong>You said before the hero and his voices have Minesweeper in their head. Which voice is the best and worst at Minesweeper?</strong></p>
<p>I am referring to a question on their post-original release Reddit AMA. When asked what else is in the Hero's head besides stiff drinks and corners, Tony's response was Minesweeper. We cannot leave it there. We need to know <strong>how</strong> they play Minesweeper.</p>
<p><strong>"</strong>Ooooooh this is a GOOD question," Tony said. "I don’t know if you knew this about me, but I was actually <em>really</em> into Minesweeper for a while. Even now, it’s still my go-to thing to do when I’m stuck on an airplane without WiFi."</p>
<p>In Slay The Princess, we have the following voices to work with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hero</li>
<li>Broken</li>
<li>Cheated</li>
<li>Skeptic</li>
<li>Contrarian</li>
<li>Paranoid</li>
<li>Cold</li>
<li>Stubborn</li>
<li>Smitten</li>
<li>Opportunist</li>
<li>Hunted</li>
</ul>
<p>Eleven voices in your head, and only one can win. Who will come out on top?</p>
<p>He began to explain how this goes down. "There’s a bunch of voices we can rule out quickly. Smitten has no Minesweeper related strengths, Hero is generic. Broken is… Broken. I’m not sure he has the confidence to get good at the game." Indeed, Smitten would be too distracted by thinking about the Princess, the Hero is just a basic protagonist, and you can't get Broken to do anything at all. So that's three of them eliminated off the bat. What about the remaining nine?</p>
<p>"So there’s two important components of Minesweeper," Tony explains. "There’s accuracy, of course. If you hit a mine, you’re donezo. But there’s also speed. You only really “win” if you’re faster than other people. Skeptic’s an overthinker, so he’s out. Cold’s too bored all the time to do anything quickly." Two more eliminated by being too slow. We're down to six in the lineup. If speed wasn't a factor, perhaps Skeptic would still be in the game, given he's one of the more strategic voices, but it's no surprise Cold doesn't care enough. It's worth noting that Contrarian wasn't mentioned at all, presumably because he's automatically eliminated by nature of never wanting to do what you're supposed to.</p>
<p>"Another important thing to know about Minesweeper is that it’s <em>bullshit</em>. Specifically, the way the game’s set up, it’s <em>really</em> easy to get stuck in a position where you literally have a 50/50 chance of losing, with nothing you can do about it. This knocks out Stubborn, who would start raging at it, and Cheated, who would also rage at it. Paranoid is out of the running because he would just spend way too much time on those spaces, unable to commit." Alas, both Cheated and Stubborn do get mad very easily when they can't win a game. If there was a Minesweeper computer in the headspace to flip off a table, you know they would be rushing to flip it first.  Four eliminated! Only two voices left in the run to win at head Minesweeper, which means...</p>
<p>"This leaves us with Hunted, who’s a good all-rounder, and Opportunist, who’s a backstabbing sleaze, but who has such I-work-in-an-office energy that you just <em>know</em> he’s played too much Minesweeper while other people were doing most of the heavy lifting." Of all the Voices, Hunted tends to have the most practical input besides Hero, being one of the only ones good at keeping you alive besides Paranoid and Skeptic, so it's no wonder he made it to the finals. So if it's between the conniving backstabber and the straightforward but helpful survivalist Voice, who comes out on top?</p>
<p>"But ultimately I’ve gotta go with Voice of the Hunted. He’s fast, but he also has that survival instinct that would screw over some of the more persistent voices." Opportunist has been defeated! Considering his spine tends to disappear so he can suck it up and gain the upper hand, it's not a surprise he lost to Hunted. Hunted has much more of a spine to work with and sticks to trying to survive. No time to bend like a folding chair, got too many mines to sweep!</p>
<p>"I don’t play Minesweeper like that," was all Abby had to say to this question.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9812460141741858409gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9812460141741858409gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>With the cabin door open and the outside world visible again, it's clear the path to Slay The Princess' finish was a rich and vibrant one full of learning experiences and growth in every area of creativity, and of course, Minesweeper too. And all of it was done with the focused self-discipline of a due date to ensure everything stayed flowing and brought us the masterpiece of a horror visual novel we have now. Abby and Tony's development story just goes to remind all of us that anything is possible if you set your mind to doing it. Even Slaying a Princess' Development!</p>

      <title>Ubisoft announce Steam Deck support for Assassin&#39;s Creed Shadows at launch</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In a surprise turnaround after <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/no-support-for-assassins-creed-shadows-on-steam-deck-at-launch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously stating</a> the Steam Deck would not be supported for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Ubisoft have now said it actually will be.</p>
<p>The official Assassin’s Creed account on X/Twitter <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1899863156995903687" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10051083501741857803gol1.jpg"/></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many of you have been asking about Steam Deck.  We are happy to say that we are supporting Steam Deck at launch and are currently awaiting the level of classification from Valve. More info to come soon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Previously, Valve rated it as Unsupported on Steam Deck with their rating that went live on February 8th. At time of writing, the Steam page still shows this Unsupported rating so it will be interesting to see what Ubisoft have changed to actually get it supported. Hopefully Valve will give it an appropriate rating and not just bump it up to Verified if it has poor performance like we've seen a couple of times in the past.  Valve's rating is usually correct though, just a few random outliers that don't match up.</p>
<p>The game is due to release on March 20th on Steam so we don't have long to find out.</p>

      <title>Machine Mind blends real-time action with survival and RTS elements to make a fun mix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Chudo-Yudo Games are working on Machine Mind, an interesting mixture of strategy and action genres blended together. There's a demo available to try with Linux support, along with an expanded playtest.</p>
<p>Set on a barren world after some sort of nuclear war following a virus that swept the planet (that sounds familiar…), Earth has become a wasteland filled with raiders. Your ship has crash-landed, and now you have to survive. Here though, your consciousness was stored in some sort of computer system, so you take control of a customizable vehicle and go on your way to build it up and create a base of operations. The game appears to be about you surviving long enough, so that you can launch yourself back into space.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="eCse8YS6qeQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b9093b8c8febc64c7b807b43fa92421f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/eCse8YS6qeQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's a lot of customizable vehicle action games, but not many blend in the strategy side of it like this too. An interesting mixture that I'm definitely keen to see more from and the demo worked great.</p>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Crafting: Create weapons, modules and equipment from the resources you gather to improve your vehicles and fortify your base.</li>
<li>Building: Reconstruct dilapidated bases, build fortifications and facilities to ensure your survival in the dangerous environment.</li>
<li>Fighting: Join exciting battles against raiders and bosses by using advanced weapons and combat modules.</li>
<li>Modular machines: Build and modify your rovers using various modules to attune them to different tasks, from resource gathering to fighting.</li>
<li>Tactical control: Plan your actions and assign roles to your vehicles to maintain your strategy.</li>
<li>Automation: Assign transport rovers to complete various objectives like gathering, building and defence by using strategic game mechanics.</li>
<li>Survival in extreme conditions: Face not just your enemies, but forces of nature, such as sandstorms and radiation.</li>
<li>Exploration of different biomes: Navigate various locations, from deserts to abandoned factories, each full of resources, enemies and secrets.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Cyber Knights: Flashpoint the cyberpunk XCOM-like hits full launch on May 15</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Inspired by games like XCOM 2, Shadowrun and Invisible Inc the latest from Trese Brothers with Cyber Knights: Flashpoint is set to leave Early Access on May 15th with a new update out now. <em>It's also on sale for the next 24 hours.</em></p>
<p>Much loved for their previous games including Star Traders: Frontiers and Templar Battleforce, their cyberpunk heist adventure with squad-based stealth and RPG mechanics has expanded a whole lot during its time in Early Access. One addition that's live now is their first retirement storyline, a sort-of end-game point and they plan to add multiple of these in for when one of your characters is ready to retire.</p>
<p>There's even a new trailer to show off all their progress:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5cumHBWrUGE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/77c189eb3f9c18113cefc258f40434f4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5cumHBWrUGE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking more about this retirement feature they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Retirement Storylines are pinnacle opportunities in your Cyber Knight's career, accessible only when you've built a rep as the Knight that gets things done. Multiple offers will give you the opportunity to get started on a chain of escalating missions leading to one last big heist that could get you out of the game for good.</p>
<p>Come out on top, and you'll have a window of time to decide (and complete any lingering unfinished business with your mercs or other contacts) if you want to take the retirement opportunity, or continue running the streets.</p>
<p>Some Knights can't give up the thrill of the heist, and will continue to play hard and fast until they go out in a blaze of glory. Others are convinced better opportunities will come, for either a better life offworld or with more room in the opportunity to set up the squad members they've become closest to with a better life as well.</p>
<p>When you retire or die, you'll get a series of game-end screens sharing what becomes of you and your squad members, a key stats &amp; achievements summary, and your save-game will be memorialized so you can come back and export appearance or talent tree builds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm very much looking forward to a proper full playthrough with the 1.0 content. They have plans post-release too but they haven't revealed what just yet.</p>

      <title>Amazon GameLift Streams allows devs to run their own streaming platform - supports Linux and Proton runtimes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Amazon recently announced their new GameLift Streams service, allowing game developers to spin up their own game streaming solutions.</p>
<p>This reminds me of what happened with the shutdown of Google Stadia, where Google also attempted to turn it into a solution developers could directly use but that died with Stadia's shutdown. Perhaps Amazon will be more successful here, although this may be a sign their own Amazon Luna is not doing particularly well.</p>
<p>Amazon first announced this on March 6th noting it allows developers to upload their games onto fully-managed GPU instances in the cloud, and then get streaming in minutes with "little or no modification of their code". For players the service will work across PCs, phones, tablets, smart TVs and WebRTC-enabled browsers (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox and Safari were named directly). This is a white-label solution, meaning developers can fully integrate it with their own services, stores, websites and so on.</p>
<p>Companies already using it include Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc., Jackbox Games, Ludeo, and Xsolla.</p>
<p>From the press release: “With more than 750 million people playing games running on AWS every month, we have a long history of supporting the industry’s game development, content creation, player acquisition, personalization, and more,” said Chris Lee, general manager and head of Immersive Technology at AWS. “Amazon GameLift Streams can help the game industry transform billions of everyday devices around the world into gaming machines without rebuilding game code or managing your own infrastructure. For game developers, this creates exciting new revenue and monetization opportunities that weren’t possible before.”</p>
<p>Their <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/2025/3/amazon-gamelift-streams-empowers-developers-to-stream-games-to-virtually-any-device" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> also specifically noted how it supports "Windows, Linux, and Proton runtimes".</p>

      <title>Time-travelling adventure Old Skies from Wadjet Eye Games arrives April 23</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wadjet Eye Games have announced their next game, the time-travelling adventure Old Skies, is now set for launch on April 23rd. It will have full Native Linux support.</p>
<p>More about it: "Fia Quinn is a time traveler, accompanying clients of the ChronoZen Time Travel Agency on jumps to other eras to make sure they don't rewrite important aspects of history. Some of these people are merely curious. Others have unresolved business. As long as they can pay for the trip, their motivations don't matter to Fia... until they do."</p>
<p>There's also a new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nAQ9UMzqZUQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/23356dcef04976b0c72180996836da9e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nAQ9UMzqZUQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some info from behind the scenes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Old Skies' designer, Dave Gilbert, has been releasing story-driven adventure games for almost two decades through his tiny independent studio, Wadjet Eye Games. Nearly all of his games have been set in a supernatural version of his beloved hometown of New York City.</p>
<p>Although he has collaborated with other indie developers more recently, Old Skies is Dave's first personal project since IGF-nominee Unavowed in 2018. He's been working on Old Skies for almost six years, after first playing with the time travel concept in a game jam that he entered using a pseudonym.</p>
<p>Old Skies ups the ante for Wadjet Eye's output with high-res 1920x1080 graphics hand-drawn by artist Ben Chandler, an original musical score by composer Thomas Regin, and professional voice acting from Wadjet Eye's largest cast to date. Though Old Skies can be enjoyed by anyone, plenty of references and Easter eggs are waiting for those familiar with Unavowed and the Blackwell mysteries.</p>

      <title>Get ready for some chaos as POSTAL 2: VR has been announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Running With Scissors along with Flat2VR Studios and Team Beef have announced the chaotic action game Postal 2 is coming to VR with a completely overhauled experienced. POSTAL 2: VR sounds like a lot of fun, I'll definitely have to check this out with my Valve Index.</p>
<p>From the press release: "POSTAL 2 VR isn’t some half-baked port—it’s being meticulously rebuilt for maximum virtual reality debauchery. Manual weapon handling, gesture-based NPC interactions, and physics-driven melee combat let you get your hands dirty (sometimes literally). The inventory and mini-map have been completely redesigned for VR, giving you easy access to every tool of destruction at your disposal.

      <title>I hope Valve are watching closely with Microsoft working towards an Xbox Handheld</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With Microsoft pushing to improve Windows on handhelds, and reportedly working with a specific partner on an Xbox-branded gaming handheld, Valve should be watching closely with their Linux plans for Steam Deck and SteamOS.</p>
<p>This news comes across two reports. There's <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-hardware-report-project-keenan-next-gen-xbox-2027" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Windows Central</a> that noted how there's an actual Xbox-branded gaming handheld that Microsoft are working on with a third-party hardware vendor. And then also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338778/microsoft-xbox-handheld-pc-gaming" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The Verge</a> reporting on Microsoft's wider plans to improve Windows on handhelds.</p>
<p>This could end up being a big problem for Valve, potentially derailing their efforts on the Steam Deck and Linux as a whole. You may think I'm being perhaps a bit <em>alarmist</em> here but vendor lock-in is a <em>serious</em> thing. It makes me think back to the time where Valve's Gabe Newell <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/valves-gabe-newell-talks/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">called</a> Windows 8 a "catastrophe" and how Valve had embraced Linux as a "hedging strategy" against more Windows lock-in.</p>
<p>I hope Valve are watching closely on this, because you can be guaranteed that Microsoft will be continuing to try and push more people towards the Microsoft Store, Game Pass and Xbox Cloud Gaming. Naturally they will be, Microsoft will want any hardware that's first-party or third-party to be properly worth their time and money investments into them. As they continue to refine the Windows handheld experience, potentially making it look more Xbox-console like, then of course it will be tied more to the Windows Store too. And if done well, that's less people looking to Steam. Not everything lasts forever.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve preparing a public Beta of SteamOS</a>, and all their work that has gone into Proton to get Windows games running on Linux (that I noted in my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/happy-three-years-to-the-steam-deck-the-linux-gaming-machine-that-changed-everything/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">three years of Steam Deck anniversary article</a>), it's clear that Valve are still on the right track not to be tied to one operating system and having their own software and hardware together. So, with that in mind, I sure do hope they're continuing to work on a Steam Deck 2 and eventually a proper more powerful living room console — all powered by Linux.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You can grab yourself a nice Gaming Pillow, various versions of the Deckmate attachment system and more with discounts. Time for you to finally see what the fuss is about?

      <title>Mesa 25.1 will default to Zink+NVK instead of the old Nouveau OpenGL driver for NVIDIA on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Time for a bit of modernisation. With the upcoming Mesa 25.1 release, Collabora developer Faith Ekstrand announced a big change for NVIDIA GPU users. If you're not using the proprietary NVIDIA driver, that is.</p>
<p>The old Nouveau OpenGL driver will no longer be used by default, and instead they're going to be switching it out of the box to use Zink + NVK. A <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/29232" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">merge request</a> for Mesa to do the change for "turing and above", that being the likes of the GeForce RTX 20xx series and GeForce GTX 16xx series and newer, was opened back in May 2024 with it just about to be pulled in now.</p>
<p>Confused? As a reminder — Zink is an OpenGL implementation on top of Vulkan. While NVK is a Vulkan driver for NVIDIA GPUs. Ekstrand mentioned how Zink has "matured a lot" and they're "fairly confident that Zink+NVK will be an improvement over Nouveau GL across the board".</p>
<p>Mesa 25.1 is due a fourth release candidate on May 7th, or the 25.1 final release if it's deemed ready. So not that long to wait on this.</p>

      <title>The Triple-i Initiative gaming showcase returns for 2025 with a teaser</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Looks like we're set for a bunch more interesting game reveals! The Triple-i Initiative gaming showcase has announced a return for 2025 and it's likely another good one.</p>
<p>This is something that was teased by many indie game devs <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/triple-i-initiative-teased-by-devs-of-vampire-survivors-darkest-dungeon-risk-of-rain/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in March last year</a> and then a showcase arrived in April where we had announcements like Slay the Spire 2, The Rogue Prince of Persia, Brotato DLC and many others.</p>
<p>A very brief teaser is live now featuring Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core, The Alters, Endless Legend 2, No, I’m Not A Human, and Enshrouded:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="q-kxf97IwQA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6d8464878f8867d88546061aed136196.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/q-kxf97IwQA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“We’re still newbies in this whole ‘video game showcase business’, so our goal with the second edition is not to try to fix something that isn’t broken. The show was well-received last year so we stuck to the same short and impactful formula while making it bigger and better of course! Players can expect a show packed with back-to-back exciting announcements and… that’s it. No ads, no hosts, no sponsors, just games,” said Benjamin Laulan, Evil Empire’s COO.</p>
<p>The whole idea for it started with Evil Empire wanting a flashy way to announce The Rogue Prince of Persia, but they decided to pull in other studios to show off their next big thing. From what they say the reveals from last year picked up over 13 million views on YouTube.</p>
<p>“This year, Evil Empire doesn’t have a flashy new game to unveil (sorry!), but since we loved making the show we want to keep the party going for everyone anyway. Dropping all these announcements from our corner of the gaming world in one big blast makes sure the entire show is fun to watch for our players, and for us too! We’re very thankful to all our fellow studios who worked with us to make this possible again.” said Bérenger Dupré, Evil Empire’s Marketing Director.</p>
<p>It's a great idea to build up support for some smaller studios, especially with how certain other events seemingly go on forever with lots of adverts, sponsors and all sorts stuffed in. Nice to see such a focused event with no fluff. Various developers have begun teasing their inclusion in the event like Shiro Games, 11 bit studios, Amplitude Studios, SHUEISHA GAMES, Square Glade Games and more as time goes on now the 2025 has been teased.</p>

      <title>First trailer live for Skull Horde where you command an army of dead soldiers as a floating skull</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From developer 8BitSkull (BORE BLASTERS, Void Scrappers) their next game is Skull Horde, an auto-battling dungeon crawler where you raise up an undead army while floating around. It's going to release this year with Linux and Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>I really liked both BORE BLASTERS and Void Scrappers, so I'm keen to see more from 8BitSkull. Hard to really get a good idea from the trailer though but looks quite chaotic during all the battles.</p>
<p>Check out the first trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="g7xEcIPxSr0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bf1034cf9be996eaff19591b1d78023e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/g7xEcIPxSr0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Betrayed by his own flesh and blood, buried, and forced to spend an eternity underground, our necromancer protagonist has a literal bone to pick, and goes on a revenge mission against the rest of his body. Call upon your fellow living-challenged and watch your minions do your bidding independently, in real-time auto-battles.</p>
<p><em>Skull Horde</em>’s procedurally generated dungeons are populated with unique enemy types, each with their own strategies to send you back from whence you came. Each run provides new ways to take down fleshfolk as you collect loot and boons from chests and shrines, upgrade and merge units, and unlock powerful perks that combine with each playable character’s strengths.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>No Body? No Problem!: Stunt on the haters (your own body) as one of multiple playable characters with unique special abilities, including the option of being a floating skull.</li>
<li>Super Soldier Squad: Turn your army into the finest assortment of expendable minions that money can buy, combining loot found in the dungeons to gain great advantages, and merging multiple units to make them stronger.</li>
<li>Procedurally Generated Dungeons: No two dungeons are alike and each level features a variety of enemy types, ensuring that builds must be tinkered and tweaked to overcome their attacks. Unique challenges that reward new unlocks and content will also keep you on your skele-toes.</li>

      <title>Hilarious physics-based 2D multiplayer brawler Oblin Party is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tellus Games have released Oblin Party, a physics-based 2D party party brawler where you have direct control over your two hands made with Godot. It has Native Linux support and should work great on Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>A highly dynamic funny brawler where you use your wiggly arms to throw yourself around the various chaotic maps. You can play it via local multiplayer or online too for 2-4 players. The main idea is to force your friends off the map to win, by whatever means necessary. Outwit them using physics fun with your arms or pick up a weapon.</p>
<p>It's not just you with the physics though. The maps are wobbly as well and react to both of you, so things do get pretty funny in it. There's even a single-player time-trial mode so you can get better at the physics system.</p>
<p></p>

      <title>Muffles&#39; Life Sentence is a new dark comedy RPG where you swap your face</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a first episode that's completely free, Muffles' Life Sentence is a really weird dark comedy 2D RPG where have to swap your face and it's well worth a look. </p>
<p>Here you've been sent to prison where their doctors do clearly pretty terrible things to you depending on your crimes. Your new body has no face and they've sewn your mouth shut, and so you end up being called Muffles. You do have a rather overly-chatty cellmate though to make up for it, who clearly can't understand a word you're trying to say. It has card-based combat and deck-builder elements, with you unlocking more as you go with the face and memory system and so far it just seems thoroughly great.</p>
<p>It's seriously weird and quirky, and a rather unexpected pleasure to find this week. Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7G-M6zQ3xWA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f8213ae0ba2f16838dc01b631c03c5fc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7G-M6zQ3xWA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features (from the Steam page):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Unlockable faces to swap identities and gain new abilities.</li>
<li>Deckbuilding card combat without grinding or random encounters.</li>
<li>A colorful cast of absurd criminal monsters.</li>
<li>Statuses that include: Panic Attack, Looking for Shiv, and Poison.</li>
<li>Visuals boasting 3 whole colors.</li>
<li>A great soundtrack you need to see to believe.</li>
<li>A serial story released in episodes.</li>
<li>Puzzles that aren’t TOO tedious.</li>
<li>Dee is in this games.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A dark comedy RPG with quirky characters and a pretty interesting looking story. You can play it on Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the latest Proton 9.0-4</a> where I tested it working great. A game that definitely deserves a lot more eyes on it. One of the most unusual games I've tried out recently.</p>
<p>With the first episode free, the second episode is out now (paid) and a third episode is on the way.</p>

      <title>Completely ridiculous online 1v1 shooter STRAFTAT added a Linux version</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>STRAFTAT originally launched in October 2024, and just recently the developer added a Linux version. It's a completely ridiculous competitive 1v1 online shooter with quick rounds and lots of weapons.</p>
<p>Each round in the game takes place on a different map, with each map having a different set of weapons. The weapons are pretty ridiculous, as is the game as a whole. Pretty fun though. The Linux version arrived with the Music Update v1.2.2 which also added in a whole bunch of new music tracks, a match history feature, new maps and a new "overpowered bukanee-like smg".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SofVVFEkWNg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cba9faff7d937d3e78fad2bbe3070ea1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SofVVFEkWNg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While the game is free to play there is also a single DLC you can buy that gives you over 70 additional maps and 10 extra guns. The DLC content is available to both players, as long as the game host has it, which seems entirely reasonable to me.</p>
<p>A really over the top game for when you and a friend (or a random person online) fancy blasting each other to pieces for a few rounds when you have some free time.</p>
<p><em>The Lemaitre Bros previously released BABBDI in 2022, which is a short, first person exploration experience.</em></p>

      <title>Worms 2 Plus patch for the Team17 classic gets revamped online multiplayer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Remember the classic Worms 2? Modders continue improving it with the Worms 2 Plus patch, which recently had a major update that makes playing online way easier. I previously wrote about this mod patch <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/play-worms-2-on-linux-with-the-worms-2-plus-patch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in April 2022</a> and it's great to see it continue on.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12488220111741697976gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Carlmundo/W2-Plus/releases/tag/1.7" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Version 1.7</a> of the patch was just released with all these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Revamped online multiplayer!
	<ul>
<li>Play via TCP over a Worm2NAT Relay Server (thanks to fkWorm2NAT by Dawid8)</li>
<li>No port forwarding required</li>
<li>IP addresses are now hidden</li>
<li>Multiple computers with the same external IP can now play on the same server and games</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>IPX is now used for LAN/VPN games only</li>
<li>Added 9 terrains from Worms 1/Reinforcements/United (Ported to W:A by CarmineLynx, converted using W2TerrainConvert by Dawid8)</li>
<li>Installation automatically sets the recommended resolution for your screen</li>
<li>Settings app improvements - new option for separate Cavern map resolution</li>
<li>Improvements for Wine in online games</li>
<li>Improved the "disabled LAN" image in the menu</li>
<li>Updated menu text to reflect the purpose of IPX</li>
<li>Fixed:
	<ul>
<li>In-game crash that occurred when you zoomed in during an online game</li>
<li>Layout of the game statistics screen for high DPI users (Dawid8)</li>
<li>TOOLS level (from W:A) now has it's background image (Dawid8)</li>
<li>Issue with limits of "Amount of fire" and "Override fuse" in Weapon editor</li>
<li>Minor typo present on game statistics screen</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Updated cnc-ddraw to v7.1</li>
<li>Updated C++ Redistributables</li>
<li>Optimised modules: fkMissions, fkSettings (Dawid8)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The patch has loads of other extras included from previous updates. Making it the best way to play. I sure do love seeing classics get such huge community support like this.</p>
<p>You need a copy of the <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/worms_2" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">game from GOG</a> which is currently on a 79% discount until March 15th. So good timing! Then you can then run games from GOG on Linux with the Heroic Games Launcher making it really easy. In this case it needs Wine / Proton.</p>

      <title>Isle of Reveries looks like a fun classic Zelda-like with some interesting game mechanics</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Inspired clearly by the likes of classic Zelda and the Game Boy Color, Isle of Reveries is one for fans of retro games that want something new and fresh.</p>
<p>Here you'll be travelling through the overworld and various dungeons, each of them split into distinct biomes with each area having their own unique mechanics from puzzle-focused areas to "open-ended, straightforward combat gauntlets".  You play as a little owl named Lief, who has a fairy companion that can copy various objects in the game world. As the developer said: "Need to shoot an enemy from a distance? Copy and spawn the arrow-shooter. Need to keep a switch pressed? Copy and spawn a block." — sounds fun.</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A large world that doesn’t hold the player’s hand, filled with charming anthropomorphic characters.</li>
<li>Eight dungeons, each with their own distinct theme and key item.</li>
<li>Key items that are useful in both combat and puzzle solving, and remain so after completing the dungeons they’re found in.</li>
<li>Use the fairy companion to copy and spawn various objects found in the world, including puzzle blocks, torches, mushrooms, and more.</li>
<li>Dedicated jump button so that there’s always space to equip the most relevant items.</li>
<li>Take a break from the adventure and enjoy bug catching and fishing.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a demo available on Steam right now and it's <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/desertcucco/isle-of-reveries/description" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">crowdfunding on Kickstarter</a> with the goal really close to being hit.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a new stable update for the Steam Client across Desktop and Steam Deck. There's a couple of new features, along with a lot of bug fixes.</p>
<p>Going through the changelogs these are specific to the Steam Deck:</p>
<blockquote>

      <title>Control Ultimate Edition is adding HDR, ultrawide, FOV scaling, updated DLSS and DLAA</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A nice surprise! Control Ultimate Edition is set for a big update today to bring in a bunch of extra graphics features and tweaks along with some bug fixes. <em>It currently works on Linux with Proton and is Steam Deck Verifed.</em></p>
<p>Here's all that's changed in update 1.30:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>OUTFITS</strong><br/>
The following outfits are now available to all players. The outfits can be accessed and equipped from the Control Point in the Central Executive Sector area.</p>
<p>• Astral Dive Suit (formerly a pre-order exclusive)<br/>
• Tactical Response Gear (formerly a pre-order exclusive)<br/>
• Urban Response Gear (formerly a pre-order exclusive)<br/>
• Extradimensional Suit (formerly obtainable in the AWE DLC by finishing SHÜM)</p>
<p><strong>MISSIONS</strong><br/>
All players will receive the mission Dr. Yoshimi Tokui’s Guided Imagery Experience, featuring voiceover by Hideo Kojima. The mission is playable when you pick up the Dr Tokui Tapes collectible in the Extrasensory Lab of the Research Sector. (This mission was previously exclusive to the PlayStation 4 Digital Deluxe version of Control.)</p>
<p><strong>GRAPHICS</strong><br/>
• Added HDR support<br/>
• Added new Ultra ray tracing preset, which gets you more rays per pixel and higher temporal stability<br/>
• Added ultrawide monitor support for up to 48:9 monitors<br/>
• Added an FOV scaling setting for the gameplay camera<br/>
• Updated SDR to 10bit (from 8bit), which reduces visible color banding<br/>
• Improved graphics adapter detection at startup, with automatic selection between DX11 and DX12<br/>
• Implemented screen aspect ratio fixes for ultrawide monitors<br/>
• Your current monitor resolution can now reliably be selected from the screen resolution and rendering resolution menus<br/>
• Added rendering resolution support beyond 4K<br/>
• Implemented texture streaming fixes<br/>
• Ray tracing bug fixes</p>
<p><strong>DLSS SUPPORT</strong><br/>
• Added DLSS support for arbitrary resolutions<br/>
• Added DLAA support<br/>
• Updated DLSS to DLSS 3.7, with higher temporal stability<br/>
• Film grain added back to DLSS SR<br/>
• Fixed shadow resolution when DLSS is enabled<br/>
• Added resolution dependent mip map bias for DLSS. This enhances texture quality, for example when applying the DLSS Performance setting.</p>
<p><strong>GENERAL</strong><br/>
• Updated the audio on cinematics and end credits to remove unintended channel mixing. You will no longer hear anything that isn’t intended to be heard. (It wasn’t the Hiss, it was us. Sorry.)<br/>
• Several bug and crash fixes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I really enjoyed playing through Control, it had me absolutely hooked when it arrived quite a few years ago now. If you haven't played it yet you're in for a good time. One of those where you just keep on pushing through, as you just really want to know more.</p>

      <title>Fallout and DOOM get combined in the Fallout: Vault 666 mod</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a fun one to start your week off right. Modder Carl Asami has combined the worlds of Fallout with DOOM for you to blast through. Originally released back in January, the modder has continued improving it since release. You even get your own Dogmeat companion that will fight along side you.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the Mod DB page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>War. War never changes. And neither does-</p>
<p>THE DOOM DWELLER- you were chosen by THE OVERSEER to enter VAULT 666 and locate THE WATER CHIP. If you fail, your home, your friends, and your PET BUNNY will perish.</p>
<p>Traveling the Wasteland, your investigations lead you to a CAVE ENTRANCE. But what's this? No vault dwellers in sight, but more mutants than you can shake a boomstick at! It stinks like rotten meat!</p>
<p>So, pump that POWER FIST, rev that RIPPER, and unload your 10MM, right into the face of HELL! Welcome to VAULT 666!</p>
<p>Death in the Vault is about to change!</p>

      <title>Roll20 co-creator reveals bullet hell MMO Wyld Land with a demo up now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the co-creators of the popular Roll20 virtual tabletop Roll20 has revealed Wyld Land, a free to play bullet hell MMO. Made in the spirit of similar games like Realm of the Mad God and Nuclear Throne, it's sure to be a delight for bullet hell fans that want an easy game to quickly jump into.</p>
<p>A demo is available now, although it appears to be fully-featured. Giving you "over 30 hours of content, including 14 dungeons to explore and unique bosses to encounter" and I've tested it working perfectly on Linux with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a>.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="n4aCiwoQyW8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/57bb9178200b2d328a35839e3de91e0d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/n4aCiwoQyW8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intense bullet hell combat:</strong> Masterfully maneuver through waves of bullets as you unleash destruction. Wield assault rifles, fusion cannons, and more.</li>
<li><strong>Built for solo and multiplayer:</strong> Dive into the run alone or team up with runners in real-time. <em>Wyld Land</em>’s servers are purpose-built for the most frenetic twitch gameplay.</li>
<li><strong>Death is not the end: </strong>You can’t retrieve your equipment if you’re dead. But persistent upgrades – known as Echoes – gradually make you better prepared for your next run.</li>
<li><strong>Deep build customization: </strong>Customize your build through equipment, mix and match weapons, and discover new abilities mid-run to create your perfect dungeon delving character.</li>
<li><strong>Ever-changing dungeons: </strong>Dungeons in <em>Wyld Land</em> are procedurally generated – no run is ever the same. And when you’re ready for the next challenge, mutate the world through corrupted shards. The bigger the challenge, the greater the rewards.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>More about the developer: Bag of Holding is a new game development studio founded by Roll20 co-creator Riley Dutton, focused on "creating sustainable games for passionate communitie"s. Wyld Land is their debut title.</p>
<p>Riley Dutton said: “Bag of Holding was created to make the games we want to see in the world. We make no secret of our inspirations – we love Realm of the Mad God, Enter the Gungeon, and Nuclear Throne, and so many others, and we want Wyld Land to join this incredible pantheon. We can’t wait for players to get their first taste of what Wyld Land offers, and with our plans for the future, we want you to be playing for years to come.”</p>

      <title>Death Stranding 2 has a new trailer and PS5 release date - hopefully a PC release isn&#39;t far off</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p style="text-align:justify">I am so unbelievably excited to play Death Stranding 2, and the new 10 minute trailer gives us a healthy dose of what to expect from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">A release date for PS5 has been announced for June but they're not talking PC release date yet, so we likely have a while to wait on this one. Going by the dates of previous Sony PS5 to PC releases, we're probably going to be waiting at least a year on it. Shame, but it gives Valve a lot of time to continue to improve Proton, so hopefully when it releases we won't see any Linux compatibility issues.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="eT_A2gPhTIw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/95b5dd8a9d36e972bfe798674fa109e6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/eT_A2gPhTIw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Few trailers make me really sit back and laser-focus like this. That was definitely something. I need it.</p>
<p>In addition a special concert tour was announced, to celebrate the music in Death Stranding. This tour will have a full orchestra that will start on November 8, 2025. More on that <a href="https://www.deathstrandingconcert.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>At least by the time it comes to PC we should have any expansions and updates all done too.</p>

<li>Maps can now be zoomed-out on the cartography table.</li>
<li>The structure generation is more deterministic, making it easier to share your experience with others when you find great world seeds.</li>
<li>Multiple performance improvements to make the game smoother.</li>
<li>Mob spawning is now more reliable and efficient.</li>
<li>You can now sit on stairs, slabs and blocks from mods supporting it. Plus commands to sit and lay anywhere.</li>
<li>The hollow logs now have a ladder variant, allowing players to climb through them.</li>
<li>Multiple textures have been improved.</li>
<li>More sounds have been added for a more immersive gameplay.</li>
<li>Dropped kelp no longer plagues the waters.</li>
<li>Knockback and critical hits got fixed.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the original (which has a Linux version) on March 25th the free anniversary patch will release with "dynamic parks" that will "change in appearance to reflect the different expansions each player has added to their game, to give a personalized tribute to players’ unique experiences with Cities: Skylines". Additionally these creator pack DLCs will also release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emerging Downtown, a pack focused on adding a variety of building sizes and construction styles to cities’ busy downtown areas.</li>
<li>Countryside, adding a selection of rural charm from small-town libraries and food markets to quaint, humble town halls.</li>
<li>The Harvest Harmony Radio Station, a country-inspired selection of musical tracks to fit any rural construction project.</li>
</ul>
<p>Earlier on March 18th, Cities: Skylines II also gets an anniversary patch with "a selection of new in-game parks and buildings themed around celebrating the series’ birthday". Plus these creator packs which can be purchased individually or free as part of the Ultimate Edition:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dragon Gate, a content pack inspired by Chinese architecture and “market quarter” locations.</li>
<li>Leisure Venues, including new entertainment options, parks, and leisure locations.</li>
<li>Mediterranean Heritage, which adds buildings inspired by 15th-19th century architecture from Spain, Italy, Portugal, and Southern France.</li>

<p>“We founded Colossal Order with the dream of creating a city-builder that would bring more freedom and creativity to the cities players can build,” said Mariina Hallikainen, CEO of Colossal Order. “With Cities: Skylines, that dream not only came true, but thanks to the continued support of our amazing fans, we had the opportunity to keep growing and building this game and community many years after its release and take it even further than anticipated. It's been an incredible journey that's taught us so much — and still has more to teach — and we are forever grateful to everyone who made it possible and who joined us along the way.”</p>

      <title>Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 mod for Stardew Valley is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The big and impressive Baldur's Gate 3 mod for Stardew Valley is out now bringing with it a bunch of new content for fans of both games. It's not just some basic skin on top of the game either, a lot of love went into this one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A new village has recently been built north of Pelican Town, and its new residents seem... rather unusual.  You can find the entrance to Baldur's Village at the top of the southern mountain map, right next to Linus' tent.  </p>
<p>Baldur's Village is a large expansion mod for Stardew Valley, inspired by Baldur’s Gate 3. It introduces a brand-new village map and NPCs while staying true to the game's original atmosphere. Among them, Astarion features a fully developed personal storyline and is available for marriage. </p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>New map and NPCs.</li>
<li>General event for players to quickly meet new characters.</li>
<li>Fully romanceable character Astarion | Events with Astarion.</li>
</ul>
<p>The mod named Baldur's Village is available from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/30888" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Nexus</a>. You might even be able to use <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/nexus-mods-app-makes-improvements-to-collections-fixes-baldurs-gate-3-script-extender-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nexus' new cross-platform mod launcher</a> for it since Stardew is one of the supported games.</p>
<p>While it's now available, they're not done with it. Depending on support they do plan to expand it further with Halsin’s romance storyline, and then expand the world-building, gameplay and more.</p>

      <title>Tactical FPS Due Process has a permanent price reduction</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Due Process the tactical FPS from Giant Enemy Crab is seeing a small resurgence thanks to the recent big discount and renewed development, and so their team have given it a permanent price drop now.</p>
<p>It's gone from $14.99 to $9.99 / £11.99 to £8.50 which should hopefully pull in a few more players. Apart from a update small blip recently, the game <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/the-tactical-fps-due-process-anti-cheat-now-supports-linux-plus-it-has-a-huge-discount/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">has the anti-cheat now enabled</a> for Linux / Steam Deck so you should be good to go on it.</p>
<p>See the most recent update trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="oHi8G6iXFg0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1df80afd7421c417751e743fd1ca8ff5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/oHi8G6iXFg0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Due Process is a tactical FPS about planning and teamwork that rewards communication with teammates, allows players to draw a "playbook" directly onto the map during the planning phases, and presents a novel situation each play session thanks to a bounty of procedurally generated, hand-curated maps.</p>
<p>Fresh maps make Due Process great. Levels are built in-house via a procedurally assisted level generation process and are delivered weekly via steam update, which means you won't be playing on the same stale level. Our level designers edit each level before it goes out and are constantly trying new concepts.</p>
<p>Teamwork starts with a goal. Discuss your strategy over voice chat, and use the planning phase to draw up a plan of attack. Deploy your assets wisely over the course of three rounds, as anything fielded from your armory won't come back if destroyed or lost.</p>

      <title>Wine release their first build of Mono with the new name Framework Mono v6.14</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/microsoft-donates-the-mono-project-to-the-wine-team/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Back in August 2024</a>, Microsoft donated (or offloaded if you wish) the Mono project to the Wine team, and now the first post-move release is out under the new name Framework Mono.</p>
<p>From the release announcement: "This is the first release of Framework Mono from its new home at Winehq. It includes work from the past 5 years that was never included in a stable release because no stable branch had been created in that time. Highlights are native support for ARM64 on macOS and many improvements to windows forms for X11."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">What's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Native support for macOS on ARM. Cis-compilation on ARM macOS is now assumed to be compiling for macOS, not cross-compiling for iOS.</li>
<li>System.Windows.Forms:
	<ul>
<li>Fixed various resource leaks on X11.</li>
<li>Redesigned Clipboard and Drag And Drop implementation on X11.</li>
<li>Stability improvements on X11.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improved support for generated COM interfaces.</li>
<li>Fixed some common cases where processes would hang on exit.</li>
<li>Added Georgian translation.</li>
<li>Many warning fixes. The Linux amd64 build no longer warns when compiling the C portion of the codebase, and this is enforced for new changes via CI.</li>
<li>Many bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For people confused on all the naming, this was also explained as there's multiple projects that use the name Mono</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Framework Mono is the project previously hosted at <a href="https://github.com/mono/mono" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/mono/mono</a>, which was then simply called Mono. I have made this change to distinguish it from "monovm" and "Wine Mono", which are different projects. Framework Mono is a cross-platform runtime compatible with .NET Framework.</li>
<li>"monovm" is a separate fork of the Mono runtime that's part of modern .NET and can be used instead of CoreCLR.</li>
<li>"Wine Mono" is a downstream distribution based on Framework Mono that is used in Wine to replace .NET Framework.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And to clear up .NET:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>.NET Framework is a proprietary Windows component that supports cross-platform executable code using an object-oriented model.</li>
<li>.NET Core was an open-source project supporting many of the same languages and APIs as .NET Framework but mostly incompatible with it. .NET Core was renamed to ".NET" when version 5 was released. I call it "modern .NET" to distinguish it from .NET Framework.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Whisker Squadron: Survivor does a barrel roll with Star Fox and survivor-likes smashed together - out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a while in Early Access, Whisker Squadron: Survivor has launched that attempts to blend together the on-rails shooting from Star Fox with a few elements of the bullet heaven survivor-likes popularised by Vampire Survivors. <em>Note: key provided for me.</em></p>
<p>Unlike a traditional on-rails shooter this is based on you completing randomised 30 minute runs, with everything changing each time you go through as you take on what's known as The Swarm. For those unaware, on-rails basically means you never stop, everything moves with you, so it’s like you're on rails. Get it? Here you destroy enemies, and collect their scrap to level up and unlock abilities as you go through a run.</p>
<p>With the full release now available they've added in a full 3 act campaign mode with a final mission, voiced characters, a finished more in-depth story along with new upgrade items.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="a__GX7rE-kA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/deed3e3dcd51b7ec6854a70939f7b340.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/a__GX7rE-kA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The visual style is <em>impeccable</em>. I really do love the vibrant artwork on it, all fitting with the theme so perfectly. When you're in some of the tougher battles with lots of enemies, it really looks spectacular. The action as well is great overall, especially once you get part way through a run with the mixture of enemy types, there’s plenty to keep you on your toes and to ensure the game grabs your attention. Enemies all have different attacks too. So with the randomness you never do entirely know what to expect from it. Especially intense when you have enemies firing lasers directly at you, another setting off a circular disc area attack and others firing beams across the whole area. <em>It can be a little crazy at times.</em></p>
<p>There's a lot of replay value here too, since it's a survivor-like game with randomisation in enemies, upgrades and what you'll face in it.</p>
<p>I think given people's love of Star Fox, it was always going to be <em>tough</em> for them to hit the mark with this one. The movement especially has to be pretty-much perfect. The developer has received a fair bit of negative feedback on that, since they removed the "Tilt" ability allowing you to more finely tune where your ship was pointing. There's been a lot of complaints on its removal but it could <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2140100/discussions/0/597393615056019724/#c597393727567215582" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">possibly</a> return sometime.</p>
<p>For me though, I think it all feels pretty good. Accessible with the basic movement around the screen, then there's your roll to parry enemy bullets and also a little side-swipe barrel roll too. Together they feel like it does enough right on movement to make it feel good while also remaining a challenge.</p>
<p>Some parts I wasn't a fan of though.</p>
<p>When you finish each level you pick a node from a map. You probably know this feature well by now from many different games and genres. Each node has something potentially different from new enemies to rewards. The map for each section is quite small though.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17533264861741364150gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17533264861741364150gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here’s where some odd design comes in. Some nodes contain Cursed Choices that are forced on you. Pick one and get a buff, but also an (at times maddening) debuff like one hit death or get stunned every time you’re hit. For a game that’s pretty streamlined, it’s a bit punishing. Annoyingly so, because the progression in it is so god damn <em>slow</em>. You have to play a <em>lot</em> of runs to get even some of the basic extras in it and the permanent upgrades are even worse at how slow they are to unlock.</p>
<p>Another annoyance is that you also have to go through a whole entire run. You can’t save and quit during it. That may work for some types of games, but in my opinion, not this one. Picking a node on the map is literally the perfect time to let people save and come back, I don't get why this wasn't added.</p>
<p>Personally as well I found the characters distracting and a little annoying for this. I just wanted to blast through a chaotic Star Foxy take on the survivor genre. I think they should have left the story side for their other in-development Whisker Squadron game where it would have been a better fit.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12321683631741364662gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12321683631741364662gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>At its core it’s a pretty fun on-rails shooter that blends in rogue-lite progression with survivor-like features, but with a few odd design choices and one that really could have benefited from more player choice and more rewarding progression to create chaos as you fly through it. Tough to really give it a final thought, I'm a bit torn on it overall.</p>

      <title>Secret Agent Wizard Boy is Harry Potter meets Goat Simulator and it&#39;s chaos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From John, Evan and David Szymanski - names you might know from the likes of DUSK, My Friendly Neighborhood, Kyle is Famous, Butcher's Creek, Squirrel Stapler and more it's a thoroughly chaotic and ridiculous game about toppling an evil crime syndicate hidden beneath a prestigious wizarding school. <em><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/all-three-szymanski-brothers-are-working-on-a-chaotic-harry-potter-inspired-game/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I tried the demo back in October </a>which worked great on Linux with Proton.</em></p>
<p>A sandbox-style chaotic sim that really is Harry Potter meets Goat Simulator, that's probably the best possible way to describe it because it's thoroughly nuts. You know you're in for a good time when the Steam page notes how it has a "complete lack of safety nets or boundaries", so it firmly leans into the comedy of what might happen with the physics simulation going on. You'll likely find numerous ways of doing things they don't expect or plan for and that's part of the point of it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5-VikuMq7_A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/97a608b40e89d67aaf7fd051902e683c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5-VikuMq7_A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The game runs perfectly as expected with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a>. As perfect as an Early Access from a tiny team can be, that is. The developers noted: "Building such a game is difficult in several ways. Mainly, designing and developing a game driven by emergent physics and object/AI behaviors is difficult without lots of feedback from players and testers. We need lots of feedback to ensure the game keeps the right balance of open-ended sandbox gameplay and interesting world progression, and to identify what bugs and general quirks work against the fun rather than adding to the fun."</p>
<p>A lot of things will kill you in it, and it can end up pretty funny. There's a target in the opening courtyard, and if you hit it a big bouncing pad appears. For science of course, I tested hitting it again while in the air and yep - fell then to my death as the bouncing pad vanished.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12045695041741355506gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I respawned, accidentally picked up a plant (was aiming for something else), so I threw it away to the side. Ah — but I didn't think of the physics. The plant <em>must</em> have hit someone, as a watering can came flying at my head and…dead again. Either that, or the watering can was hit and just bounced back at me. Never can tell with the physics in this one, it's so over-the-top. There's also actual traps to worry about too, some deaths just made me facepalm because they were <em>obviously</em> a trap. At this point I've completely lost track of how many times I've died, or what I'm supposed to be doing.</p>
<p>Brings back fond memories of playing various PS1 games for endless hours doing as many stupid things as possible.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A multitude of spells to learn and inflict on others.</li>
<li>Chaotic, barely contained physics-based mayhem.</li>
<li>Open-ended goals to accomplish (or ignore) however you see fit.</li>
<li>Online co-op, although actual cooperation is unlikely.</li>
<li>Retro-themed third person action, straight from the days of Unreal Engine 1.</li>
<li>Landmines and other non-magical ordnance.</li>

      <title>Competitive FPS &#39;FragPunk&#39; has launched on Steam and works on Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The new kid on the block here is FragPunk, an online competitive FPS that feels like a noisy flashy version of Counter-Strike blended with Valorant and the good news is the anti-cheat is enabled for Linux / Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Compatibility notes: this was tested on the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a> on Desktop where it was fine, but on Steam Deck there's an initial problem with you seeing a black screen (with audio) in Gaming Mode. Remembering on Desktop I had to accept their Privacy Policy, I loaded FragPunk in Desktop Mode on Steam Deck where it worked - I could use the touch screen to accept it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12793829551741346799gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4119417621741346683gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Then I switched back to Gaming Mode once that was done, where it then worked fine on Steam Deck. <em>This was the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/marvel-rivals-out-now-free-on-steam-and-works-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">exact same problem that Marvel Rivals had at launch</a>.</em></p>
<p>It's free to play with some pretty in-your-face monetization but it's clearly quite popular. Although, it remains to be seen if it will manage to do what few do and actually stick around for a while. Are the gimmicks of it good enough to keep people interested? Maybe!</p>
<p>Here you unlock over 150 "Shard Cards" as you play more of the game. These give each team certain bonuses, with each player voting on what cards to add into the game at the start of each round. It makes it a little weird, silly and actually pretty refreshing. You could get more HP, a turtle on your back to block bullets,</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4279810071741342389gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4279810071741342389gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20725042801741342391gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20725042801741342391gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

<p>Nice to see the anti-cheat enabled too. It claims it's called "Phanuel Anti-Cheat" when you load it, but it seems it's actually a variant of NEAC, which works in other games with Proton like Marvel Rivals and NARAKA: BLADEPOINT. <em>See <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">more anti-cheat compatibility on our dedicated page</a>.</em></p>
<p>Performance on my desktop (Kubuntu 24.10, AMD Ryzen 5800x, Radeon 6800XT) on max settings at 1440p seems pretty much perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11495601901741342548gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11495601901741342548gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15034419991741342550gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15034419991741342550gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

<p>An issue I have observed on my desktop though is that the mouse likes to leave the screen. I had to set it to Fullscreen, instead of a Borderless Window to get around the issue. I thought perhaps Gamescope might help, but that then caused mouse input in matches to be broken.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck performance on Low is initially a bit all over the place though. It seems to default on Steam Deck to DirectX 11, so changing it to DirectX 12 and reloading then allowed me to use FSR 3 (FSR 3 seems locked behind DX12, you get FSR 2 for DX11). After that the performance with FSR 3 on Balanced during matches stuck pretty close to 60FPS.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19694866231741346059gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19694866231741346059gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>

<p>Changing it over to FSR 3 Quality, and it still performed well there too.</p>

      <title>Bullet heaven survivor-like shoot &#39;em up Gunlocked 2 announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>FromLefcourt have announced Gunlocked 2, a bullet heaven survivor-like shoot 'em up that takes all the goodies from the first game and greatly expands on it. The first game is really good, and works well on Linux / Steam Deck with Proton, taking all the fun stuff from games resembling Vampire Survivors with the upgrade system but in a neat space shoot 'em up package.</p>
<p>More about it: "Movement is your weapon. A sci-fi action roguelite and shmup combined, in Gunlocked 2 you'll pilot and upgrade a state-of-the-art warship against endless waves of deadly aliens. Deep customization, branching paths, truly novel weapons, and tons of unlockables offer endless replayability set against the infinity of outer space."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="GFG5OTNJIeU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/73c5e9e93d8136850e5d757d51f1d333.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/GFG5OTNJIeU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In the press email to me the developer mentioned: "A rebuilt, heavily optimized version of the previous engine, Gunlocked 2 should run even better on Steam Deck and Proton than the original."</p>
<p><!-- squire --></p>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>New in the sequel:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Expanded Customization: </strong>18 unique pilots, customizable warships with their own strengths and styles, and 100+ infinitely stackable upgrades offer new creative freedom.</li>
<li><strong>Branching Paths:</strong> Warp gates let you seamlessly jump to different zones that offer unique battles and rewards. Every run offers new choices!</li>
<li><strong>Refined Control:</strong> A new dodge ability gives players more control. And 360-degree analog movement brings Gunlocked out of the retro era and firmly into the present.</li>
<li><strong>Play How You Want:</strong> Play for 2 minutes or 20, Gunlocked 2 fits perfectly into whatever free time you have, then save and resume later. But death is still permanent!</li>
<li><strong>Modular Difficulty:</strong> Difficulty modifiers now come in multiple levels, and can make the game as hard or as easy as you'd like.</li>
<li><strong>Glorious Pixel Art:</strong> Huge, full color sprites with detailed animations make every bullet, bomb, and laser explode with style.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The game is currently <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fromlefcourt/gunlocked-2/description" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">crowdfunding on Kickstarter</a> and has 26 days to hit the $13,500 USD goal. They're hoping to launch it in Early Access for community involvement in Q3 2025.</p>

      <title>Proton Hotfix updated to fix The Finals and Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced (offline) on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have released a new Proton Hotfix update which solves issues with both The Finals and Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced (offline play) on Linux / Steam Deck.</p>
<p>For The Finals, the game broke once again <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/the-finals-broken-on-linux-steam-deck-yes-again-with-update-5-12-0/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">after a recent patch that I covered recently</a>, so it's great to see Valve reacting quickly to fix the problems.</p>
<p>The story for Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced is a bit different though, as like the previous Grand Theft Auto V "Legacy" edition, this will <em>only</em> work for single-player offline play. Rockstar updated the anti-cheat to BattlEye <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/grand-theft-auto-v-gets-battleye-anti-cheat-breaks-online-play-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in September 2024</a>, and have chosen not to enable its support for Linux as they continue to say Linux platforms like Steam Deck are simply not supported.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14821354771741337184gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced</em></p>
<p>Announcing the update Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais said on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/plagman.bsky.social/post/3ljr2gyatic2c" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>: "A Proton Hotfix has been deployed for The Finals, as well as GTA V Enhanced's offline mode".

<p>If you have manually picked a version of Proton for either title, just uncheck the box for it in the properties, as Proton Hotfix will be set as the default now by Valve.</p>

      <title>Mining sandbox adventure Core Keeper gets its first major post-release update on March 10</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Core Keeper from developer Pugstorm has a fresh major content upgrade coming, the first post-release update and it's going to release really soon on March 10. The 'Bags &amp; Blasts' update will bring a whole new sub-biome, a brand new skill tree and one of "Core Keeper's biggest bosses yet".</p>
<p>Check out the update trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="C0WfnRSzUlM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f974b2e675f3dd8130c76c15eff6c1e4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/C0WfnRSzUlM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

      <title>Trailmakers 2.0: Pioneers is out now and it&#39;s like a whole new game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Trailmakers has managed to pull in a lot of happy players since the original 2019 full release, and the developers at Flashbulb have been busy building up the massive free update with Trailmakers 2.0: Pioneers that's out now. <em>Note: my key was originally provided by their PR team.</em></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="jIPBtURAWxU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2bbf95c845d821dd54623523936ef8d7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/jIPBtURAWxU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Just to remove any doubt right away if you're excited to jump in — the game works great on Linux Desktop / Steam Deck with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-4</a>.</p>
<p>It's currently rated Steam Deck Playable, due to Valve noting it requires manually bringing up the on-screen keyboard. In my testing, that was still the case with this update. Not a big deal though, but it would be good if the developer fixed that and it's not an issue on Desktop Linux of course. For the Steam Deck, I would suggest tweaking the graphics settings down just one level with the default being "Pretty but Slow" down to "Middle Road", as it just helps it keep more at 30FPS to make it smoother.</p>
<p>What we've been given with this update is practically a whole new game. It's a huge update, and quite surprising to see it be released free for all existing players as a plain update. While all the sandbox stuff is still there, it's a lot easier to get into now thanks to the brand new cinematic intro, new tutorial and a full campaign mode to play through.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>“Our players have shaped Trailmakers since its release in 2018, constantly pushing the boundaries of creativity and making vehicles that amaze us at every turn. Pioneers expands the breadth of possibilities, deepens exploration, and challenges players to build and survive like never before,” said Flashbulb Games Co-Founder Ole Teglbjærg. “Pioneers is a major step forward, but the future of Trailmakers is even brighter.

      <title>FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH gets a smaller download on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Square Enix have updated FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH and they've managed to cut down the download size for the Steam Deck and by quite a bit too.</p>
<p>Version 1.003 was released today, March 6th with these notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improved overall game stability, including several bug fixes.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the application sometimes crashes while playing the game on a PC using certain AMD Radeon products.</li>
<li>Reduced the package size when downloading on Steam Deck.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Comparing a fresh download between my Steam Deck and Desktop Linux, the Steam Deck download for it is now 88.1GB whereas on Desktop it's showing as 144.2GB. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2599237011741273177gol1.jpeg"/></p>
<p>Developers can actually set up a special Steam Deck only content depot on Steam which they could use to put in smaller texture packs, smaller movies and so on (as just two basic examples). <em>Not many developers actually do this. </em></p>
<p>Nice to see our favourite handheld get the update treatment from major studios, especially making it easier to actually get the game downloaded saving a whole lot of time and bandwidth for people.</p>

      <title>THE FINALS broken on Linux / Steam Deck (yes again) with Update 5.12.0 </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A reoccurring theme here with THE FINALS from Embark Studios is that it appears to break on Linux / Steam Deck each major upgrade, and it has happened again with the launch of Update 5.12.0.</p>
<p>It's not clear yet what's happening, but it could be anti-cheat related. Their update notes did mention a tweak to their anti-cheat, but it may also be unrelated since this situation has happened before multiple times and then fixed by Valve in a Proton update.</p>
<p>For me, when I go to launch it gets to the Easy Anti-Cheat loading screen and then quits with this error box:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5500218841741272607gol1.png"/></p>
<p>There's already replied noting this on the Proton <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/7317" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub ticket</a>. Hopefully Valve's Proton developers can take a look soon, and we may see a Proton Hotfix update like we've seen in the past.</p>

      <title>Path of Exile 2 gets a fix for Linux / Steam Deck being detected as cheating</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Grinding Gear Games are showing clear support for Linux / Steam Deck with Path of Exile 2, ensuring it continues working properly.</p>
<p>Ahead of the huge Content Update 0.2.0 coming that they keep teasing, it seems a recent smaller patch to the game caused problems. Playing on Linux / Steam Deck with Proton would throw up a pretty alarming warning, noting how they'll only tell you once about using cheating software and continued use would terminate your account.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it was a false alarm. The developer released 0.1.1f Hotfix today that <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3732353" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">notes</a>: "Fixed Steam Deck and other Wine-based clients being incorrectly warned for modifying the client."</p>
<p>Great to see continued and prompt support on issues like this.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">

      <title>11 bit studios working on getting Frostpunk 2 up to Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>11 bit studios latest game Frostpunk 2 was recently rated Steam Deck Playable by Valve, with the developer noting they are working towards getting it bumped up to Verified.</p>
<p>Writing in a post on Steam the developer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601580/view/498314610455087556" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re glad to inform that Frostpunk 2 is playable on Steam Deck!<br/>
<br/>
The Story Mode is fully stable and playable, with solid performance. Thanks to your feedback, we’re aware that Utopia Builder mode has some UI issues, and late-game saves might take longer to load.<br/>
<br/>
We're working on further performances and an official control layout fixes to earn the Steam Deck Verified badge ✅</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see another developer keen to improve their game.</p>

<p>More about it: "Frostpunk 2 elevates the city-survival genre to a new level. Take the role of a Steward and lead your city through a cascade of calamities taking place in a postapocalyptic, snowy setting. Build large city districts with their string of endless needs and demands. Navigate through conflicting interests of factions that populate your metropolis. As the needs of the city grow and factional power at its core rises, only you can steer the society towards an uncertain future."</p>
<p>The developer also updated their roadmap recently to note on May 8th a free major content update will arrive, along with the Spectrum DLC sometime in August.</p>

      <title>FINAL FANTASY XVI removed Denuvo Anti-tamper</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Square Enix released a fresh small update to FINAL FANTASY XVI on March 4th, noting a couple of minor fixes but it appears they also removed Denuvo Anti-tamper. The game originally launched on Steam on September 17, 2024.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2515020/view/520831973411782758" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a> only notes these two changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Graphics not displaying properly on certain screens.</li>
<li>Textual errors in select languages.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2515020/history/?changeid=U:58860670" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> picked up that Denuvo was also removed and it's no longer listed on the Steam page.</p>
<p>So if you stick to skipping over titles with Denuvo, it may be time to give it a try. This change also means it will no longer have problems with you switching Proton versions on Linux / Steam Deck, which can end up causing you to be locked out for 24 hours.</p>
