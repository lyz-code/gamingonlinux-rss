      <title>Cyberpunk 2077 gets a huge update, expansion teaser and fixes the Steam Deck preset</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Edgerunners Update is out now for Cyberpunk 2077, along with the Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty expansion getting a reveal and a 2023 release date. Some fixes included for Steam Deck finally too.</p>
<p>A big new feature is cross-progression between all platforms if you want it. So you can play it pretty much anywhere that has this update and sync it all up. In a world of the Steam Deck making PC gaming portable, this is a really nice feature that I hope more games add in. It would be ridiculous to list everything that's new but some of it includes: easy wardrobe changes, 3 new gigs, a bunch of new weapons, a new mini-game, lots of balancing, new poison perks, new secrets to discover and modding updates.</p>
<p>As for the Steam Deck, these specific fixes made it in:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>[Steam Deck] Fixed an issue where the dedicated preset was applying Ultra settings instead of properly crafted graphics settings.</li>
<li>[Steam Deck] Fixed an issue where the game became unresponsive after trying to change Key Bindings.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The first one was a pretty big problem that I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/cyberpunk-2077-gets-an-official-steam-deck-setting-but-seems-broken/" target="_blank">personally highlighted back in March</a>, because it gave the impression that Cyberpunk 2077 ran way worse than it should on Steam Deck. It's surprising it took them multiple months to fix a simple settings issue but that's par for the course when it comes to Cyberpunk 2077 development isn't it?</p>
<p>Oh there's the new expansion too and you can see the teaser trailer below:</p>

<p>You can buy it to play on Linux with Proton or Steam Deck <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1091500/Cyberpunk_2077/" target="_blank">on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Survival game Vintage Story adds 200+ new blocks, lightning, water physics update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's pretty staggering just how advanced Vintage Story is becoming as a survival game. It's still relatively unknown but in my eyes it already rivals many popular games and another huge upgrade is out now. Vintage Story is not available on Steam, which is probably one of the biggest reasons it's not so well known. The developer isn't ruling it out but they want to hang onto that 30% that Valve would take.</p>
<p>Version 1.17.0 is out now named the "Stable De-Jank and Game Juice Update" and it's honestly massive.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18998033991662484754gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18998033991662484754gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6119340881662484751gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6119340881662484751gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Click to enlarge the images.</em></p>
<p>Some of the big new features include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Lightning strikes and Desert storms.</li>
<li>200+ new blocks.</li>
<li>A huge water physics update.</li>
<li>300 types of shields.</li>
<li>More and prettier flora.</li>
<li>New and improved fauna.</li>
<li>Improved Creature AI.</li>
<li>Extensive updates to the visuals in many places.</li>
<li>Massive performance tuning.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And the list goes on for quite a while, the changelog like most updates for Vintage Story is <a href="https://www.vintagestory.at/forums/topic/9392-stable-de-jank-and-game-juice-update-1170/" target="_blank">rather long</a>. Perhaps mostly importantly though, you can now pet the animals. Okay, it's not the most exciting feature around but it's rather sweet.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17529118201662483809gol1.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17529118201662483809gol1.gif"/></a></p>
<p>This is the survival game for those of you who love depth and difficulty, with a huge varied world to explore.</p>

      <title>Void Scrappers is my new favourite coffee-break game — try the free Prologue</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Void Scrappers Prologue, the new free version of the bigger upcoming Void Scrappers is out now and I had a chance to try it before release and came away very impressed. This is easily going to be my new coffee-break game at my desk, and my next time-sink to stay up far too late with in bed with my Steam Deck.</p>
<p>It is yet another <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/a-genre-is-born-horde-games/" target="_blank">horde game / Vampire Survivor-like</a> or whatever else you wish to call it. One day I will perhaps get sick of it but it's still not today. It's a bit more like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/uh-oh-gunlocked-is-like-vampire-survivors-in-space-and-just-as-absorbing/" target="_blank">Gunlocked</a> in the way that it's a space sci-fi game with you controlling a ship but you fly around the area instead of being given a small scrolling area you're confined to.</p>
<p>This one becomes completely ridiculous the further you go into it and I've been having so much fun with it. The builds you can make are pretty great too, even with the limited selection available in the Prologue it makes for an entertaining time. Here's some footage mixed between my Fedora Linux desktop and the Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="x_EDky2n8NA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ff79bca69ca2bdb00e2345780603398c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/x_EDky2n8NA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What's surprising is just how smooth it feels already. The Prologue is just a glorified demo of a game that's not properly out yet but it feels so good already that I think the developer is onto a winner here.</p>
<p>You can try the free <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2126420/Void_Scrappers_Prologue/" target="_blank">Void Scrappers Prologue on Steam</a> with Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Classic pixel-art RTS &#39;TFC: The Fertile Crescent&#39; gets an online co-op Horde Mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>TFC: The Fertile Crescent is a really criminally overlooked pixel-art RTS that just got a major upgrade for all players.</p>
<p>A first major update for the Early Access title brings with it some big new features like the online co-op Horde Mode. Previously only available in single-player, you can now build up and survive with a friend online. That I honestly can't wait to try!</p>
<p>They've also added in more options you can tweak for single-player skirmish battles, you can add AI players to online matches and there's various other gameplay improvements too. Online play also got the ability to password protect games, so no more random people jumping into your lobby if you don't want them. You can also now actually kick players from an online lobby too.</p>
<p>Some other gameplay features were also added in like map pinging to allies, sending resources to allies, several improvements to the AI and lots of bug fixes.</p>

<p>A really great game that all base-building RTS lovers need to try.</p>
<p>I like this one so much, I gave it a little video overview for you:</p>

      <title>Prodeus cancels the Native Linux version, focusing on Proton compatibility (updated)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Prodeus, the crowdfunded first-person shooter that blends together new and old design styles, will no longer be doing a Native Linux version and instead will ensure it works nicely with Proton.</p>
<p>The team at Bounding Box Software had been quiet for some time on their plans here, seemingly ignoring all questions about Linux for many months so it's good to finally get a proper answer. Still, for those of you still sticking to <em>only</em> Native Linux games, this probably stings a little.</p>
<p>Here's what <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/prodeus/prodeus/comments?comment=Q29tbWVudC0zNzU3MDYwNw%3D%3D" target="_blank">they said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="flex">
<div class="w100p">
<p>We are making sure the game runs on Proton and will be doing a pass at reaching full green status on the Steam Deck once the game is fully out. Unfortunately, we won't be able to make a Native Linux build, there were far too many issues and we couldn't get it to run properly. The Proton version of the game has a much smoother experience and the tests on Steam Deck showed great promise. We apologize for any inconvenience this might cause.</p>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: in their Discord, a developer added this clarification:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A little clarification on the Linux News. Right now the Unity tool chain for making native Linux builds is still experimental. While they say you can do it, it does not work all that well and, as stated above, there are graphical errors and various other issues that make the game unplayable. A Linux build may still be a possibility in the future but at this time it is on hold until Unity's Linux tool chain is in a better state and we have the resources to dedicate to figuring it out properly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It does in fact already run extremely well with the Proton compatibility layer both on Linux desktop and Steam Deck, take a look at one of my earlier videos of it on Deck below:</p>

<p>Prodeus is set to be released at some point soon it seems, with a release date announcement due to be revealed at the upcoming Realms Deep 2022 that will take place from Friday - Sunday, September 16-18 2022.</p>

      <title>Even MORE invites for Steam Deck purchases will start going out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You've heard this before right? As of today, Valve will be sending out even more emails each time to invite people to purchase their reserved Steam Deck.</p>
<p>This is sounding a bit like déjà vu isn't it? You're not dreaming though. They just recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/steam-deck-reservations-continue-to-grow-now-at-its-highest-point/" target="_blank">updated shipping windows</a> and said reservations are higher than ever, before that back in the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/even-more-steam-deck-purchase-invites-are-going-out-from-now/" target="_blank">middle of August</a> Valve announced that more invites were going out, following a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/valve-speeds-up-steam-deck-production-some-more-all-existing-reservations-this-year/" target="_blank">production ramp-up</a> announcement at the end of July. Here we are again and Valve developer Lawrence Yang just said on <a href="https://twitter.com/lawrenceyang/status/1566824774885842944" target="_blank">Twitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For those curious - yes, Steam Deck order emails are going out on Labor Day (they just went out). We also bumped up the number of order emails per batch with today's release.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if you're expecting an order email to come through, which as a reminder is every Monday and Thursday, keep your eyes firmly peeled on that inbox. You'll also get a notification inside Steam too.</p>

      <title>SiNKR 3 is a wonderful end to a clever wordless puzzle game series</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love puzzle games? Check out the new Native Linux release of SiNKR 3. It's a wordless puzzle game that needs you to hook and pull various objects and it's quite a gem. Note: key provided by the developer.</p>
<p>While the idea may seem simple enough having you click the end of a hook to have it pull towards the end and capture some shapes on the way, it does gradually add in a few clever ways to make you think. Multiple types of shapes that need to be pulled into the correct hole, hooks you can click to flip them to one side, you can hook into another hook to pull it around and much more.</p>
<p>You will need to study the whole level before you start moving anything around to get a feel for where things need to be placed. Some of them are quite…puzzling.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8698838091662395103gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8698838091662395103gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>From what the developer Robert C. Wahler told me, this seems like the final game in the series too. Speaking about the release the developer told me: "SiNKR 3 is a wordless puzzler that introduces mechanics gradually and attempts to maximize the “aha” moments and make the player feel smart. I hear the first two games did just that.".</p>
<p>It's a thoroughly relaxing game too and the simplicity really is the key on this one. Some simple tunes to listen to, gameplay that doesn't really tell you anything that you just figure out as you go but never too frustrating since you can do a multi-step undo and restart at any point. There's just no failure here, you go at your own pace. Then you get to the later levels and realise I was lying about how relaxing it is because you'll be clawing at your brain for an answer. It has a great mix of easing you in and then hitting you with the challenge.</p>

      <title>The Kubuntu Focus NX is a small and mighty Linux desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Kubuntu Focus team recently announced the <a href="https://kfocus.org/spec/spec-nx.html" target="_blank">Kubuntu Focus NX</a>, a small but surprisingly mighty little Linux desktop.

Thanks to the great port selection, one can easily add an eGPU to run large ML pipelines or turbo-charge rendering performance when needed." — Michael Mikowski, General Manager, The Kubuntu Focus Project</p>

      <title>JSAUX announce their new Steam Deck Dock with an M.2 SSD slot</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need more storage space for your Steam Deck when docked up to a TV or monitor? JSAUX have returned with their next-generation Steam Deck Dock and it sounds pretty interesting.</p>
<p>I've been <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/no-need-to-wait-on-valve-the-steam-deck-docking-station-from-jsaux-is-great/" target="_blank">thoroughly impressed</a> with their first two models, as I continue using the upgraded version of the original all the time. It works great but they clearly wanted to push the boat out with this one. With a whole new design that incorporates a M.2 SSD, you're not going to run out of space any time soon when using it.</p>
<p>From the press release it launches on September 7 at 7AM PST / 2PM UTC and will have a $99 early-bird price for the first 100 orders, the normal price will be $129. So this is clearly a lot more of a premium option compared to their first attempts. They will also be offering the M.2 Dock with a couple different SSDs bundled at various prices.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15294152471662375822gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15294152471662375822gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Features:</p>

<div class="shg-rich-text shg-theme-text-content">
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>6-in-1 Docking Station for Steam Deck. Equipped with an HDMI 4K@60Hz/2K@120Hz output, a Gigabit LAN Ethernet input, a USB-C port for charging, two USB-A 3.1 ports, and most importantly, also with an M.2 card slot, letting you explore a new way to play with Steam Deck.</li>
<li>Support M.2 interface SSD hard drive, and data transfer up to 900MB/S, allowing you to enjoy a more extreme Steam Deck gaming experience.</li>
<li>It comes with a 4K@60Hz / 2K@120Hz HDMI 2.0 output When it's connected to an external 4K monitor, it provides a sharper and smoother visual experience, so you can enjoy the visual feast on your games.</li>
<li>Full charging speed for your Steam Deck. The JSAUX Steam Deck docking station supports 100W max. power delivery, which is enough power to charge your Steam Deck at full speed (45W) when paired with the original charger.</li>
<li>The JSAUX all-in-1 Steam Deck docking station blends hub and stands together perfectly, so you can keep your desktop neat and organized.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<p>My one complaint remains the same as their previous models, with the Ethernet slot annoyingly being on the side which makes it stick out in a bit of an awkward way. Other than that, the design looks pretty lovely.</p>
<p>I've been told GOL is getting a review unit again, so I'll be taking a good look at this one at some point soon.</p>

      <title>Psychological horror detective adventure Saint Kotar gets a Linux version</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nearly a whole year after the release, the point and click psychological horror detective adventure game Saint Kotar now has a Native Linux version available. This was crowdfunded on Kickstarter back in 2020 with €50,178 in funding, so it's nice to see it successfully deliver, although more than a little late.</p>
<p>"In this story-and-choice driven psychological horror detective game, you play as Benedek and Nikolay – two troubled godly men in search for their missing relative in an ancient God-devoted town called Sveti Kotar. Here, an unknown presence preys upon the weak and sways on devil worship and witchcraft. Evidence points to your missing relative being involved in the grisly murders and the occult, but what is the truth? Are you also to blame for what happened?"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="x0-wUltXxlc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dc4f28bf32d0b92824a9014530b56a37.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/x0-wUltXxlc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Solve the mystery behind your relative's involvement with the town's bizarre and morbid rituals.</li>
<li>Switch between two realities to get to the bottom of the town’s horrifying secrets.</li>
<li>Take caution as your choices will affect both story and gameplay.</li>
<li>Discover hidden locations and complete side tasks to uncover the whole story.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Red Martyr Entertainment CEO Marko Tominić said this about the game: “I love a good mystery, weird, dark stories. I love them, so I want to create them as well. I believe we succeeded in that, as the most praised aspect of the game is the story, and the atmosphere that is the essential part of it.".</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/saint-kotar?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1358530/Saint_Kotar/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Currently <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/saint_kotar" target="_blank">GOG</a> do not have the new Linux build.</p>

      <title>Scathe is definitely not the FPS experience I was expecting</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Scathe is a brand new FPS from Damage State and Kwalee that seemed interesting from some previews before release. I took a look and did not come away impressed. You could say I'm being scathing of this one. It does work out of the box on Linux desktop and Steam Deck but that's about where the good points end. Note: key provided by the publisher.</p>
<p>You are Scathe, a bright-white eyed enforcer forged by the "Divine Creator" tasked with travelling through a maze of demons. It's a very simplistic setup, and you can pretty much do-away with any kind of story intro here and lose nothing of value.</p>
<p>While it does have a nice idea it just felt weak and honestly, so many games have done it better. You do clearly get a feeling that it's a version of Doom left at the bottom of a bargain bin before pretty much everyone started shopping for games online. The biggest problem is that it doesn't quite know what it wants to be. It's fast as hell like an arena shooter but offers up enemy AI that just runs at you in a line. Add to that the unlimited ammo and no reload of the first weapon and it's just not fun.</p>
<p>Seriously, the amount of times I've stood still and just held my finger down as enemies lined up to be killed — what's going on? There are some enemies that don't do that but they might just walk aimlessly, or spawn right in front of you and explode on you.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qpFCOMXthzs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c739d7f515c084f59b9d45d68895b5ad.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qpFCOMXthzs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's also supposed to be a bullet hell but it's far from it. For a bullet hell, it has a surprising lack of enemies that actually swarm you properly and fire plenty, which is often due to the very simplistic AI. Not only that but you are so fast you can just pretty much run past everything, add the dash ability to your normal speed and why even fire a bullet unless you absolutely get cornered (not very often at all). Honestly the only time I found it to be hell were the annoying shrieking bouncing balls that explode at you, but even those don't swarm in enough to be much of an issue.</p>
<p>This could have been a good game but it's just buried under boring gunplay, frustrating enemies and nothing to really make it stand out from other better shooters that are either cheaper or around the same price.</p>

      <title>Various BioShock games get a 2K Launcher calling it a &#39;Quality of Life Update&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Apparently now a Quality of Life Update means adding a launcher to existing games and breaking them, if you're 2K that is.</p>
<p>Just recently BioShock Remastered 1 &amp; 2, plus BioShock Infinite all had this "Quality of Life Update". Expecting some sort of bug-fix and polishing that the name implies, it was nothing of the sort. Instead, the patch notes for all three simply state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week's update features various quality-of-life improvements, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Account linking option added in-game</li>
<li>The addition of a new Launcher which includes a Store to purchase new content</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For BioShock Infinite I can confirm the update breaks launching the older Native Linux port from Virtual Programming. Not great for those of you sticking to Native versions and paid for that.</p>
<p>Looking over various reports, many people are mentioning that the launcher update has <em>broken</em> all three for them on Steam Deck. Confusing though, as testing all three across desktop Linux and Steam Deck and all three worked out of the box for me with Proton 7.0-4 and no other changes and I wasn't even shown a launcher on Steam Deck. All good, until I tried running them again on desktop and sometimes the launcher just doesn't show up so they don't run. Frustrating.</p>
<p><em>You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1GvONkE9S0" target="_blank">see my video guide</a> on how to switch between Proton versions or a Native Linux build if it exists.</em></p>
<p>Infinite was noted to be <em>Unsupported</em> on Steam Deck anyway, but forcing Proton 7 makes it work in my testing.</p>
<p>As for BioShock Remastered 1 &amp; 2, neither of them had a Native Linux version so players on desktop Linux and Steam Deck were using Proton. The problem here is that both had been through Deck Verified with the first being "Playable" and the second being "Verified".</p>
<p>Thankfully, the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/x4wk6w/how_to_bypass_the_2k_launcher_on_bioshock/in2ug1j/" target="_blank">community</a> has stepped in to provide multiple workarounds for these games if the launcher has broken them for you. If you add these as a launch option (under Properties for each game) it <em>should</em> work for all titles across desktop Linux and Steam Deck to skip the launcher and I've tested them personally working:</p>
<p>BioShock Remastered 1:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">bash -c 'exec "${@/2KLauncher\/LauncherPatcher.exe/Build\/Final\/BioshockHD.exe}"' -- %command% -nointro</code></p>
<p>BioShock Remastered 2:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">bash -c 'exec "${@/2KLauncher\/LauncherPatcher.exe/Build\/Final\/Bioshock2HD.exe}"' -- %command% -nointro</code></p>
<p>BioShock Infinite:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">bash -c 'exec "${@/2KLauncher\/LauncherPatcher.exe/Binaries\/Win32\/BioShockInfinite.exe}"' -- %command% -nointro</code></p>
<p>There's been a <u>lot</u> of unhappy gamers on Windows too, so 2K have a bit of a storm brewing with all three titles getting negative reviews on Steam. Hopefully they will learn from this. It's just another reminder of the problem with launchers and publishers just stuffing them into games with no real benefit to users.</p>

      <title>A genre is born: Horde games</title>
      <author>anewson</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vampire Survivors entered Steam Early Access in December 2021, and was described by the developer as "a gothic horror casual game with rogue-lite elements." The game skyrocketed to success almost immediately, and at time of writing has over 100,000 Steam reviews and an Overwhelmingly Positive rating.</p>
<p>The game sees you fighting off massive waves of enemies with increasingly powerful abilities. The mix of arcadey action, roguelike randomization, run-based gameplay, and a low price point was a massive success, and, predictably, Vampire Survivors inspired a whole industry of similar titles. Thus we are left with the question: what are the key elements of the genre that exploded into existence with the success of Vampire Survivors?</p>
<p>While many elements were present in earlier games, like Crimsonland in particular, Vampire Survivors was actually inspired by a mobile game named Magic Survival. Whether by refinement of its predecessors' formulae or blind luck, Vampire Survivors has brought these elements to the masses.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18084453771662152541gol1142.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18084453771662152541gol1142.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Let's call games in this genre horde games. It's not a bad name; you do indeed fight a horde, and it evokes the "survival horde modes" from older shooters; typically an ancillary game mode where players fight to survive as long as possible against impossible odds. How do we define a horde game? Allow me to suggest the following criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li> Run-based gameplay where you survive as a single character against hordes of enemies</li>
<li> Create a build during your run by choosing from randomized abilities and powerups</li>
<li> A dramatic increase in player power and enemy numbers/difficulty during the run</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>The primary objective of each run is to survive rather than progress in the traditional sense. There are no checkpoints or levels, but rather different maps to play your run on. There are notable horde games where your run progress through stages, but the stages are weakly differentiated - not comparable to, say, moving to a new stage in Dead Cells. These games also typically have strong meta-progression elements through unlockable characters, stages, and powerups. I am loathe, however, to<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/39049601/view/3208260558159850714" target="_blank"> include meta-progression as a fundamental property of the genre</a>, as one could remove meta-progression from all of these titles and be left with essentially the same game (and besides, what run-based game doesn't have meta-progression these days?).</p>
<p>A crucial element of the horde game is the randomization of power-ups. The classic setup sees you given three or four choices each level-up, with the possibility of re-rolling your choices at some cost. This is the primary roguelike influence, as the random variation forces players to adapt to each run and build a strategy around the random power-ups they have access to. This makes each run feel unique, adding a massive amount of replayability.</p>
<p>Finally, although a little less tangible than the other two criteria, is the idea of rapid growth in player power and enemy difficulty. Indeed, in the description of Vampire Survivors the dev states that the power-ups are there to "rapidly snowball" the player against the enemy hordes. In this way each run feels like a distillation of the power creep of a traditional RPG; you start the run extraordinarily weak, struggling to overcome groups of rats, bats, and slimes, and end the run as a demigod, vanquishing masses of enemies immediately as they appear.</p>
<p>Of course, there are other attributes of horde games. Aesthetically, they are generally top-down, two-dimensional, and somewhat visually simple to keep things manageable when the horde really ramps up.  Horde games are also (no doubt thanks to VS) priced extraordinarily affordably: typically 2-3$ USD. Indeed it's possible that, thanks to their high replayability, the Horde game genre offers some the highest average playtime-per-dollar in any genre.</p>
<p>Let's take a brief look at a few of the better genre offerings <em>not</em> called Vampire Survivors.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Nomad Survival</h4>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3247206141662152865gol1142.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3247206141662152865gol1142.jpg"/></a><br/>
Nomad Survival sticks close to the horde game formula. It plays very similarly to Vampire Survivors, but feels more complex and nuanced. You can learn more active and passive skills and figuring out a good build is crucial to making it past the ten-minute mark. There are some excellent additions to the genre that Nomad Survival brings, including mouse control of your character, fine-tuning of run difficulty, pets, and "heritages" - powerful run modifiers that affect how you play. Find it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1929870/Nomad_Survival/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>20 Minutes to Dawn</h4>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13368811741662152974gol1142.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13368811741662152974gol1142.jpg"/></a><br/>
Perhaps the most popular successor to Vampire Survivors is 20 Minutes to Dawn, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/20-minutes-till-dawn-is-like-vampire-survivors-with-guns-m-goodbye-free-time/" target="_blank">which we have covered</a>. The primary innovation here is to trade out the typically passive abilities (in the sense that they don't require targeting) with a twin-stick shooter style of gameplay. Upgrades improve the properties of your gun, turning your pea-shooter into a weapon of mass destruction. The dark, high contrast colour palette is nearly monochrome, and an appropriately foreboding synth soundtrack accompanies each run. Find it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1966900/20_Minutes_Till_Dawn/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Boneraiser Minions</h4>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4391503421662152797gol1142.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4391503421662152797gol1142.jpg"/></a><br/>
A <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/boneraiser-minions-is-probably-my-next-100-hour-indie-obession/" target="_blank">particular favourite</a> of GamingOnLinux, Boneraiser Minions swaps out the character's direct-damage abilities with the ability to raise a host of undead minions that defend your character. The visual aesthetic and audio are excellent, and the minions mechanic notably changes the gameplay to make for a more evasive protagonist than other horde titles. Find it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1944570/Boneraiser_Minions/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Soulstone Survivors</h4>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14866368861662152790gol1142.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14866368861662152790gol1142.jpg"/></a><br/>
Soulstone Survivors is a 3d entry into the genre, and a ton of fun. Rather than damage-on-touch, the game telegraphs enemy attacks with danger zones, which I found makes for more forgiving and enjoyable gameplay. There's a ton of status effects you can apply to enemies, and thanks to a great set of 3D animations the combat feels especially satisfying. Try the prelude <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2113430/Soulstone_Survivors_Prologue/" target="_blank">free on Steam</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>In addition to the games mentioned here, we can include <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/halftime-heroes-is-basically-a-3d-vampire-survivors/" target="_blank">Halftime Heroes</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/grim-horde-is-chaotic-and-theres-a-good-game-hiding-in-there/" target="_blank">Grim Horde</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/void-scrappers-is-an-upcoming-space-horde-shooter-inspired-by-vampire-survivors/" target="_blank">Void Scrappers</a>, Spellbook Demonslayers, and Neophyte as worthy genre entries. There are plenty of games that may not be horde games proper, but feature similar enough gameplay to warrant a mention. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/just-king-blends-vampire-survivors-action-with-slay-the-spire-progression/" target="_blank">Just King</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/uh-oh-gunlocked-is-like-vampire-survivors-in-space-and-just-as-absorbing/" target="_blank">Gunlocked</a> are two excellent games with horde-like gameplay, but stray from the formula in interesting ways.</p>
<p>So what do you think? Have a game to include or criteria to change in our noble pursuit of defining gaming's newest genre?</p>

      <title>Splitgate development is over, as the devs move onto their next game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/677620/Splitgate/" target="_blank">Splitgate</a>, the first-person shooter with portals, is no longer getting actively developed as the developer has seemingly given up with it to move onto a new game.</p>
<p>Announced in various places like their <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/blogs/important-announcement-about-splitgates-future" target="_blank">official blog</a>, it reads like they were trying to salvage something that needed too much work to become better "we’ve spent a lot of our time trying to rework old content and systems that were originally built by a handful of people" and "in order to build the game fans deserve – and to build it in a way that isn’t trying to retrofit and live operate an existing product – we are ending feature development of Splitgate".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9332497301662136030gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9332497301662136030gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>So they're now instead moving onto a new game that sounds very much like it will just be Splitgate 2. They said it will be a "shooter, it will have portals, and it will be built in Unreal Engine 5" and it will also be free.</p>
<p>The good news for fans of Splitgate, is that it's not actually going anywhere. They will keep it all online, it may get bug fixes here and there and a fresh free Battle Pass is rolling out on September 15 but that seems like the last of new stuff for it. They also have an <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/faq" target="_blank">FAQ</a> up for any burning questions you might have.</p>
<hr/>
<p>At one point it seemed like it was going to truly be the next big thing. In August of 2021 around the time of their Open Beta, it saw a high of over 60,000 people playing at once. That was short lived though, with it losing the majority of that over only a few months. It rarely sees more than 2,000 online at any time now.</p>
<p>So they're not saying it directly, but it clearly wasn't the continued success they were likely hoping for and with all the funding they gathered initially — they're trying to do something else.</p>

      <title>Move over Wordle, I&#39;m all about Farmbound now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Is the hype of Wordle over yet? Okay good. Need something new to try each day? Why not take a little look over at <a href="https://kryogenix.org/farmbound/" target="_blank">Farmbound</a>.</p>
<p>The idea for this little browser game is simple but I love it. You combine seeds to make crops, combine crops to make fields and then harvest nearby crops and fields for points. Oh, you can also use water and fertilise them to grow too but you don't get a choice in what you get as it rotates what it gives you to place down on the board.</p>
<p>The idea is just to get the best score for the day, until you can try a different one the next day. It's a daily bit of match-3 browser-based fun.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16595875331662121246gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16595875331662121246gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>You can also follow them on <a href="https://twitter.com/FarmBoundGame" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, where they seem to be giving out what the first lot of pieces you'll be getting each day are to help you plan — not that it helps me, I'm clearly too dumb for this as well. The pieces are the same for the whole day though, so you can just restart if you wish that keeps it nice and relaxed.</p>

      <title>[I] Doesn&#39;t Exist: AI Breathes New Life Into Text Adventures</title>
      <author>FergusOSullivan</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/doesnt-exist-a-modern-text-adventure-is-one-you-need-to-try/" target="_blank">[I] Doesn’t Exist </a>is an up-and coming text-based game by LUAL Games that will combine old-school adventuring with modern design, most notably a narrative AI that promises to smooth out the player experience. We caught up with the developers at Gamescom 2022 in Cologne, Germany to see how this ambitious project is progressing.</p>
<p><a href="https://lual.games/" target="_blank">LUAL Games</a> is made up of two recent graduates who studied game design, Luzia Hüttenmoser and Anna-Lena Pontet, both from Zürich, Switzerland. <em>[I] Doesn’t Exist</em> started as a bachelor’s project that quickly took on a life of its own, especially one it was picked up by ProHelvetia, a Swiss arts council.</p>
<p>Further funding was secured by setting up a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/i-doesnt-exist/i-doesnt-exist-a-modern-text-adventure" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> campaign and launching a demo for the game via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1943420/I_doesnt_exist__a_modern_text_adventure/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://lulatschia.itch.io/i-doesnt-exist" target="_blank">itch.io</a>. However, the team’s modest goal of 10,000 Swiss francs (roughly £9,000) was overshot by a massive margin and a total of nearly CHF25,000 (about £21,000) was raised.</p>
<p>“It’s amazing,” says Luzia, the game’s artist, “you never know what to expect when starting out.” Both developers emphasize that everything about their new-found situation is a first: it’s their first game, their first Kickstarter, even their first time engaging with the media. To have their demo be as successful as it is was a huge relief after what Luzia calls a “stressful and nerve-wracking” experience.</p>
<h2>Demo</h2>
<p>There’s little doubt in either Luzia or Anna-Lena’s mind that it’s the demo that propelled the <em>[I] Doesn’t Exist</em> Kickstarter campaign to its dizzying success, and playing it you’re tempted to agree. Tasked with the mission to open a mysterious door set in a tree, the player makes their way through a forest, collecting items and solving puzzles.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7291102321662120225gol13804.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7291102321662120225gol13804.png"/></a></p>
<p>The demo -- which will also be the game’s first act out of three -- is a relatively straightforward affair: there’s a clear linear progression from your starting point to the end, about half an hour later. As simple as it is, though, you can already feel the work the artificial intelligence is doing, there’s none of the clunky interaction like in the text adventures of yesteryear. </p>
<p>For example, to open up a radio with a screwdriver, you just need to type “open radio” and the AI will figure out that you meant to do so with the screwdriver you have in your inventory. You don’t have to remove each screw one by one like in older games, or tape up cats like Gabriel Knight did.</p>
<p>The demo ends after about thirty minutes of gameplay with a great hook, one that both twists what the player thought they were doing as well as teasing greater adventures once the full game comes out. It needs to be played to be believed, but you’ll probably walk away wanting to pledge a few bob to Kickstarter yourself once you experience it.</p>
<h2>Future Features</h2>
<p>The game is set to come out some time in mid 2023, and meanwhile the team is hard at work getting it finished. The demo that was shown at Gamescom has a few improvements already over the downloadable version, such as some added visual effects, like seeing leaves fall in a slow breeze in the forest. </p>
<p>Another update affects gameplay more drastically, adding text effects that convey the player character’s state of mind and could very well affect your own. If the player character is anxious or angry, for example, the text will become bigger and also take on different colors. It’s a simple, but effective addition. Other planned features include better animations for the player character, as well as a bigger role for the mushroom you met in the demo. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17168115761662120226gol13804.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17168115761662120226gol13804.png"/></a></p>
<p>Anna-Lena, the game’s coder, is also planning to further improve the AI. “It makes for a much smoother experience for the player,” she says, “but also means a lot less work for us.” Though the AI in <em>[I] Doesn’t Exist</em> is still entirely reactive -- it only responds to player input, it can’t work out anything on its own -- by further refining it Anna-Lena should be able to avoid manually entering different options for commands, for example. “Using the AI makes it a lot easier to add things on the fly.”</p>
<p>If <em>[I] Doesn’t Exist</em> will prove a success on launch, Anna-Lena hopes that both LUAL Games and other studios will be able to use narrative AI to make better games across the spectrum, or even create tools that will help creators of all stripes make their dreams come alive. For now, though, they’re putting their noses to the grindstone and getting their current project done. We’re looking forward to seeing the finished product.</p>

      <title>OBS Studio 28.0 rolled out with HDR, 10-bit, Qt 6 and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>OBS Studio is the free and open source video content creation kit for livestreaming and recording. Probably the best software in the world for it and OBS Studio 28.0 is out now. It's how I create all my videos and do any livestreaming too!</p>
<p>Some of the big new features included in this release are 10-bit and HDR Video Encoding Support, however, that is mainly for Windows as right now the Linux stack just isn't ready for it but work is ongoing on all fronts towards it in various places. So eventually we should see it too. The toolkit they use for the user interface saw a major version upgrade with Qt 6, making it easier for them to keep updating the UI in future too.</p>
<p>Changes just for the Linux client include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Switched rendering on Linux from GLX to EGL, which should result in a better experience.</li>
<li>Added support for the H264 Format in the Linux V4L2 (video capture device) source.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where right-side modifiers wouldn't be detected on Linux.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where OBS could hang after closing the properties dialog on Linux.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus the missing "What's New" dialog is now supported on macOS and Linux too:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17169702631662119844gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17169702631662119844gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the other highlights of this release for all platforms includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added the ability to select a separate video mix for the virtual camera.</li>
<li>Added obs-websocket 5.0 as a first-party plugin.</li>
<li>Added new default Theme "Yami".</li>
<li>Added the ability to automatically split recordings based on file size or duration, or manually via hotkey.</li>
<li>Added Accessibility section to the settings window, providing the ability to change colors of certain UI elements (with presets or Custom).</li>
<li>Added native SRT/RIST outputs.</li>
<li>Added support for sending chat messages to YouTube from within OBS.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus hundreds of general tweaks including support for custom FFmpeg options in media sources, significantly improved reconnecting when streaming disconnects, the ability to relatively center multiple sources and loads more on top of plenty of bug fixes too.</p>

      <title>dbrand reveal the full details of Project Killswitch for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After waiting quite some time, Project Killswitch from dbrand for the Steam Deck is finally coming but there's been a few changes and it seems not everyone is happy with it.</p>
<p>This is the special case and solid protection for the Steam Deck that dbrand has been teasing for months now, with a reservation fee that was about $3. Now they've announced that it launches on September 25th but it has been split across two packages. Shipping is free for USA + Canada but everywhere else the cost will depend on what exactly you order and dbrand said in their usual marketing speak "If you don't like it, move.".</p>
<p>The "Essential Kit" will cost $59.95 and includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>1x <a href="https://twitter.com/dbrand/status/1522692534937526272" target="_blank">Project Killswitch Case</a></li>
<li>1x <a href="https://twitter.com/dbrand/status/1540402838504968201" target="_blank">Magnetic Kickstand</a></li>
<li>1x <a href="https://twitter.com/dbrand/status/1496291413771829253" target="_blank">Customizable Skin</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For an extra $15.00, the Travel Kit adds:</p>
<ul>
<li>1x <a href="https://twitter.com/dbrand/status/1497352475602530305" target="_blank">Travel Cover</a></li>
<li>2x <a href="https://twitter.com/dbrand/status/1551997011808903168" target="_blank">Stick Grips</a></li>
</ul>
<p>What's different is not just that it's been split in two, but their announcement didn't even mention the screen protector that was supposed to come with it. In a Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/x3elm7/comment/imp8b1k/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank">comment</a>, they attempted to clear that up by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="_a5_x7qimk18YbGSwE8Fy">
<div class="_292iotee39Lmt0MkQZ2hPV RichTextJSON-root">
<p>Screen protectors are indeed a part of the project and have been in-market for about 6 months. Our data indicates the majority of Project Killswitch reservations holders have already purchased a screen protector from us.</p>
<p>As a result, there was no unique kit created which bundled this component in. Rather than creating a kit which would be redundant for the majority of reservation-holders that already own a screen protector, we opted to simply make the screen protector an optional add-on to the Project Killswitch UI.</p>
<p>In other words: if you're among the minority of reservation holders that hasn't purchased a screen protector yet, you will still be able to on the Project Killswitch UI. It just won't be built into a "Kit" option.</p>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The announcement also didn't mention that reservations are supposed to get free Stick Grips but they later cleared that up in a Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/x3elm7/comment/impbgza/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank">comment</a> to confirm reservations do still get those.</p>
<p>They've had a <em>surprising</em> amount of backlash on Reddit about the changes they've made to it, with the Steam Deck Reddit seeing quite a lot of unhappy comments about it. dbrand at least seem to offer refunds of the $3 reservation fee if you're unhappy.</p>
<p>With dbrand coming out pretty late on this, with multiple options already out there like the <a href="https://deckmate.me/" target="_blank">Deckmate</a> stand or the <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/steam-deck-stand-protector" target="_blank">Standing Case</a> from JSAUX, I do have to wonder how their sales of this will go down.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck Client Beta updated with Mode Shift support in Steam Input</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve continues tweaking and improving the Steam Deck software both the Steam Client and SteamOS. A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3370402903759152855" target="_blank">new Beta</a> is available with more improvements to Steam Input. This is available for anyone in the Beta or Preview update channels. You can change it in Settings &gt; System &gt; Steam Update Channel.</p>
<p>I've seen quite a few complaints and worries that as Valve gradually replaces the old Steam Input configurator with the new one (which will come to desktop too), that features were missing. Seems Valve are listening, since this adds in Mode Shifts to the newer one on the Steam Deck amongst other things.</p>
<p>Here's what's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Slider controls now allow more precise input for large ranges, and accelerate changing the value the longer left/right is held.</li>
<li>Fixed up and down direction on gamepad sometimes skipping rows on the keyboard when connected to an external display</li>
<li>Fix errors when operating emoji keyboard in Steam and desktop modes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steam Input:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Add support for Mode Shifts in the new configurator</li>
<li>Fix a case where two controllers could show the same slot in the Controller Reorder screen</li>
<li>Fix a case where a controller could not show up in-game until the overlay was toggled</li>
<li>Fix the Page Up/Down glyphs being swapped in virtual menus</li>
<li>Fix an issue where Switch controllers could show up w/ a duplicate device</li>
</ul>

<p>Another month has finished and the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey?platform=combined" target="_blank">Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey</a> has been refreshed. It shows once again that the Linux user share has risen.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">Steam Tracker</a> has been updated as usual but here's the chart to save you a click:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1064900451662103696gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1064900451662103696gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>When you go to the Linux details page, these are the most popular distributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 13.69% +6.09%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 10.89% -2.98%</li>
<li>"Manjaro Linux" 64 bit 8.93% -2.47%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS 64 bit 8.20% +8.20%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS 64 bit 7.06% -2.22%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 20.3 64 bit 4.54% -1.75%</li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 4.46% -0.44%</li>
<li>Flatpak runtime 64 bit 4.34% +4.34%</li>
<li>Other 37.89% +6.29%</li>
</ul>
<p>It's probably no surprise then that the most popular GPU currently being used on Linux is the Steam Deck too. The Steam Deck GPU accounts for 13.72% of Linux gamers on Steam, with the next most popular being the AMD Radeon RX 480 at 4.81%.</p>
<p>Clearly, the Steam Deck and SteamOS are taking over Linux Gaming and rather quickly too. Interestingly, if you filter to Windows, the Steam Deck GPU doesn't even show up so it's likely overall only a tiny amount of people are actually using Windows on it.</p>

      <title>Crusader Kings III: Friends &amp; Foes releases next week, other DLC prices going up</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox Interactive has announced the Crusader Kings III: Friends &amp; Foes event pack releases September 8 and they also mentioned some price rises.</p>
<p>Firstly, mentioned in a <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/ck3-changes-to-flavor-pack-pricing.1538700/" target="_blank">forum post</a>, the price of Flavor Packs (like Northern Lords and Fate of Iberia) will increase from 6.99 USD to 12.99 USD. Paradox said this was to "reflect the overall value of this kind of content moving forward" so expect that price for future similar packs starting September 13. However, the main game and the Royal Court expansion prices remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Also Crusader Kings III: Friends &amp; Foes was announced that arrives on September 8. This is an event pack, <em>not</em> a big expansion, adding in over 100 new events and a bunch of new music to accompany you on your conquests:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="jOFJ4TfJ1tg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b257bfbd5713a7b1fd9398625495cb0d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/jOFJ4TfJ1tg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Crusader Kings III is simply one of the best games they've made to me, next to Stellaris for having plenty of depth and not being completely overwhelming and confusing like some of their other titles. I must admit my temptation to get a whole bunch more events is something.</p>
<p>You can buy Crusader Kings III from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/crusader-kings-iii?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158310/Crusader_Kings_III/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Core Keeper has a new roadmap with a mini-update due soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Core Keeper, the delightful pixel-art mining sandbox adventure that you can play solo or online with friends has a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1621690/view/3242049605274459372" target="_blank">roadmap</a>. It sounds pretty exciting too with a mini-update coming out soon.</p>
<p>For the small update coming this month, they're going to be adding in various decorative features, which they say are based on direct requests from the community. That's just really to keep us going until the bigger update, The Desert of Beginnings, due in November which will add in the likes of:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new biome — Desert of Beginnings</li>
<li>A new sub-biome — Molten Quarry</li>
<li>Ra-akar The Sand Titan (sounds like a boss mob)</li>
<li>Multiple new enemies</li>
<li>A new vehicle</li>
<li>Steam Achievements</li>
<li>New material: Galaxite</li>
<li>+ more to be revealed</li>
</ul>
<p>Even before that, they have a spooky seasonal event due for Halloween in October so that should be fun too! Plus a Christmas event planned for December and then even further out a Crystal Biome planned but no date on it.</p>
<p>Their previous big update trailer if you missed it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7wrQNpT6QNQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/22c933b365cc37743f1ced94584f366d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7wrQNpT6QNQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Whenever I manage to get some proper free time, I can't wait to dive into this one properly for many hours. From what I played of the early game, it was wonderful.</p>
<p>Available to buy from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/core-keeper?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1621690/Core_Keeper/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Cross-vendor Mesh Shading for the Vulkan API is now here</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Today the Vulkan API specification 1.3.226 was released and it brings with it an exciting new extension with VK_EXT_mesh_shader. This was worked on by people from NVIDIA, Valve, Intel, ARM, QUALCOMM, Igalia and AMD.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This extension provides a new mechanism allowing applications to generate collections of geometric primitives via programmable mesh shading. It is an alternative to the existing programmable primitive shading pipeline, which relied on generating input primitives by a fixed function assembler as well as fixed function vertex fetch.</p>
<cite>Vulkan API <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/chap50.html#VK_EXT_mesh_shader" target="_blank">documentation</a></cite></blockquote>
<p>One of the reasons it's important, is that it not only brings cross-vendor mesh shading to Vulkan succeeding NVIDIA's own version, it also had a focus on improving compatibility with DirectX 12 so it brings us that little bit closer. Should hopefully be good for projects like Proton with VKD3D-Proton that translates Direct 3D 12 to Vulkan when running Windows games.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compatibility with DirectX 12 was very important for this extension, therefore it follows the same capabilities, minimum limitations and restrictions.</p>
<cite>Christoph Kubisch, Principal Developer Technology Engineer, NVIDIA</cite></blockquote>
<p>More info available on the Khronos Group <a href="https://www.khronos.org/blog/mesh-shading-for-vulkan" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>To go along with it, NVIDIA have a new <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" target="_blank">Vulkan Beta Driver</a> version 515.49.15 available with support hooked up and ready for testing. NVIDIA also updated their open source <a href="https://github.com/nvpro-samples/gl_vk_meshlet_cadscene" target="_blank">example</a> to support it too. Hopefully Mesa drivers (AMD / Intel) will have it hooked up for Mesa 22.3 due later this year.</p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher gets an emergency hotfix for Epic Games Store logins</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently it seems something changed over on the Epic Games Store and so third-party programs trying to login like the <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> would fail. Thankfully a fix was found.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/derrod/legendary" target="_blank">Legendary</a>, the name of the kit that the Heroic Games Launcher is built upon for its Epic Store integration was updated and so the Heroic Games Launcher has pulled the latest version in. With Heroic version "2.4.2 HOTFIX #2" you should be good to go on logging in and downloading games once again.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4212718031662044097gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4212718031662044097gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Giving it a test myself with the new hotfix and yup — it works again. Great work to the developers doing this.</p>
<p>This is of course a good reminder that the Epic Store doesn't support Linux and the Steam Deck in any way, so they can break anything whenever they like and it's up to the people working on third-party stuff like Legendary and Heroic to figure it all out for us. This is why buying from Steam directly (or Steam keys from legit stores) is usually your best bet for Linux and Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Controller support for V Rising planned, better Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Stunlock Studios have revealed quite a lot of their plans for V Rising, the popular open-world vampire survival game.</p>
<p>A game that can run well enough on Steam Deck and Linux desktops with the Proton compatibility layer. However, a sore spot for Steam Deck players is that there's no controller support and playing it on Deck can be a bit of a hassle. The good news is that's going to change!</p>
<p>In their "<a href="https://blog.stunlock.com/dev-update-15-future-visions/" target="_blank">Dev Update #15: Future Visions</a>" post along with many other gameplay improvements coming, this was mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Players might also be happy to know that we’re looking into adding controller support, and we’re increasingly confident that it’s something that will be possible for us. This would be a major step in the direction of being able to port to consoles and other platforms, as well as offer better support for Steamdeck. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see more developers paying attention!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14669197511662036087gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14669197511662036087gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You can buy V Rising on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/v-rising?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1604030/V_Rising/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>These were the most popular Steam Deck games in August 2022</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has revealed what the most popular games were on Steam Deck for August 2022, so here's the list. Announced on <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1565067858790711296/photo/1" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, they have sorted it by hours played and it is once again full of unsurprising titles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Vampire Survivors</li>
<li>Cult of the Lamb</li>
<li>ELDEN RING</li>
<li>Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered</li>
<li>Stardew Valley</li>
<li>No Man's Sky</li>
<li>Hades</li>
<li>Multiversus</li>
<li>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition</li>
<li>MONSTER HUNTER RISE</li>
</ul>
<p>They are all some of the most popular games on Steam as a whole, so it directly translates to what people are playing on Steam Deck it seems. All pretty good choices too! Interestingly though, it's also made clear that for a game to be popular on Steam Deck it doesn't need to be fully Verified as multiple in the list are only tagged as Playable.</p>
<p>I've done numerous videos on various games, including some of those in that very list:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="iV1eLjqn1lE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f584a37fb48812cbd8698fe1abf16903.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/iV1eLjqn1lE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

      <title>Arcane Waters is an upcoming open-world pixel-pirate adventure game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to sail the high seas? Love pixel artwork? Check out the upcoming game Arcane Waters which will let you do some pirating adventures alone or online with others too but it's mainly an online focused game.</p>
<p>Featuring trading, exploration, combat and of course farming as well because it seems every game needs that now too. With handcrafted environments you'll be fighting monsters, as well as other players across both land and sea. Honestly it seems like a lot of fun, like a pixel take on Sea of Thieves but with an expanded take on it. Early Access is due on November 15, check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ujOPFNhvUDQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/828af23c37d6730136930733421997b3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ujOPFNhvUDQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>FIGHT - When you leave the safety of your farm, you'll have to fight to survive! On the high seas, fight tense real-time cannon-blasting battles against pirates and huge monsters. On land, take part in thrilling active-time fights with strange creatures to reveal hidden treasures. You’ll need your wits about you!</li>
<li>FARM - Starting with a humble farm, plant seeds, water them and pick your crops. Eventually you will unlock other farms to increase your yield and diversify your produce.</li>
<li>Explore - A vast open world awaits you or your team as you sail to distant lands. Explore multiple different biomes, each with their own unique towns, valuable goods for sale and dangerous monsters, to complete quests and help each other level up.</li>
<li>TRADE - Whether you grow your own food, or buy it from traders, you will need to find the best price to sell and make a profit. This will mean sailing far from home to discover new continents and towns where your goods are highly sought after.</li>
<li>CRAFT - Use items dropped by enemies or sold at stores to make your own weapons and armor, and either use them yourself or sell them on the public Auction for a profit!</li>
<li>LEVEL UP - Stay neutral to avoid being attacked by other players, or join a guild to help fight for your place in the world. Level up by completing quests, finding new locations, and utilizing your skills. Use Perk points to increase stats based on your chosen specialties, and use your hard-earned gold to buy new equipment to help you progress even faster.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For Early Access the developer seems to think it will be finished in 2023, depending on player feedback. Currently they said it supports "thousands of players concurrently" and some of the features they're building for it will directly involve a great many players "coordinating together in a shared experience".</p>
<p>As for the amount of content, it sounds like there's plenty ready for the initial Early Access release with the core elements ready and 4-5 unique regions, with a total of 7 regions planned. Each region has unique quests, items, foes and so on.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1266340/Arcane_Waters/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck Tips and Tricks Part 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Since a lot of people liked the first set of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/top-quick-steam-deck-tips-and-tricks/" target="_blank">tips and tricks for the Steam Deck</a>, here's a Part 2 with just a few more that some of you might find useful. Some done before in other videos or articles but this is an easy reference for you.</p>
<p>A video below going over each step, along with the text below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="m_Yw0GQHs3o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d47652455dbc9c013984945519a50161.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/m_Yw0GQHs3o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Guide:</p>
<ul>
<li>First up, schedule updates to late night when you’re not on it if you don’t want games always doing a full update when you boot up. The Deck will still seem to do shader cache updates though but I’ve been doing this on desktop for years, it’s also great for those of you on limited bandwidth plans.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12800768271661960424gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12800768271661960424gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<ul>
<li>If a game has a VSync option or a frame limiter, try using that instead of the one built into the performance menu on the Steam Deck, as it can add a bit of extra input lag. How much you feel it depends very much on the game but give the in-game options a try and compare, you might get a nicer experience.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom" target="_blank">GE-Proton</a> is a community-made version of Proton, the Windows translation layer for running games. At times, it <em>can</em> run games that the official Valve Proton cannot until Valve update it. Despite what some seem to think, you don’t need to use GE-Proton for everything and a lot of people don’t need it at all. However, it does have fixes for certain games, so give it a try. To set it up go into desktop mode and load up the discover software centre, then search for a program called <a href="https://davidotek.github.io/protonup-qt/" target="_blank">ProtonUp-Qt</a> which is a handy installer. Once open, pick the version you want and hit install and wait for it to finish. Once done, back in Gaming Mode you can simply pick a game, go to the little Cog icon on the right and into Properties. Compatibility on the left, tick the box and then pick the compatibility layer you wish to use for it.</li>
<li>Want to change how you control the Steam Deck in desktop mode? Load up Steam, go into the Settings to Controller and go into Desktop Configuration. There you can change what button does what and what controls the cursor. Might make it just a little bit nicer for you like setting the Start button to the Windows key to open the Plasma menu, you can do all sorts with it (although they really need to update the style of it to the new configurator).</li>
<li>Are you not getting along with the Steam on-screen keyboard? Try out <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.cubocore.CoreKeyboard" target="_blank">Core Keyboard</a>, you might find you like it more or it has less issues than the Steam On-screen keyboard. It's also a good idea to have backup, for times when Steam has issues. You can install it in Discover.</li>
<li>Just a small one, but you can drag the "return to game mode" icon onto your status panel to be able to quickly get to it without having to minimize everything to desktop.</li>
<li>Did you somehow lose your return to gaming mode shortcut for the desktop mode? Well, here’s how to add it back. Right click the desktop and create a new text file, name it whatever and paste this inside:<br/>
<code class="inline-code">[Desktop Entry]<br/>
	Name=Return to Gaming Mode<br/>
	Exec=qdbus org.kde.Shutdown /Shutdown org.kde.Shutdown.logout<br/>
	Icon=steamdeck-gaming-return<br/>
	Terminal=false<br/>
	Type=Application<br/>
	StartupNotify=false</code><br/>
<em>That's copied directly from my existing one. </em><br/>
	That’s it, save it and done. It will also only give you the warning the first time.</li>
<li>Shop around! While the Steam Deck is primarily meant for Steam and they want you to buy direct, there’s plenty of legitimate stores out there selling Steam keys that have constant sales and game bundles. These include <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/" target="_blank">Fanatical</a>, <a href="https://www.greenmangaming.com/" target="_blank">Green Man Gaming</a> (and so on) and you should keep an eye on <a href="https://isthereanydeal.com/" target="_blank">IsThereAnyDeal</a> to find the best price.</li>
<li>And I will take this moment to suggest you don’t use the Epic Games Store. Buying on Steam or at least a Steam Key, will give you far better integration and just less hassle for the Deck. Like today for example, where Epic seemed to break something so Legendary and the Heroic Games Launcher <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/issues/1754" target="_blank">wasn't able</a> to login to Epic.</li>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

      <title>The Zachtronics Solitaire Collection releases September 6</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Okay so perhaps <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/last-call-bbs-the-final-game-from-zachtronics-has-left-early-access/" target="_blank">Last Call BBS</a> being their actual final game was a sweet little lie from Zachtronics. Well, sort of, as The Zachtronics Solitaire Collection is technically not exactly a new game.</p>
<p>Arriving on September 6, this is a bundling of all their popular solitaire games they snuck into their other older games. However, they've also gone and updated them with "4K graphics" and added a <em>bonus</em> new solitaire variant you will only find in this big collection.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="O4-fywWcWLE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/404d50fccbd4742b4cc8289644956ece.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/O4-fywWcWLE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Here's what's included:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shenzhen Solitaire</strong>: A FreeCell-inspired solitaire variant with a three-color deck based on mahjong tiles.</li>
<li><strong>Sigmar’s Garden</strong>: A tile matching game using the alchemical symbols from Opus Magnum.</li>
<li><strong>Proletariat’s Patience</strong>: An asymmetric solitaire variant where some cards are grouped by suit while others are stacked by alternating colors.</li>
<li><strong>Kabufuda Solitaire</strong>: A challenging solitaire variant using Japanese kabufuda cards where additional free cells are unlocked by making sets.</li>
<li><strong>Cluj Solitaire</strong>: An original solitaire variant where you can “cheat” by placing cards wherever you want, so long as you’re careful.</li>
<li><strong>Cribbage Solitaire</strong>: A score-based solitaire variant using modified Cribbage rules and an actual Cold War aircraft recognition deck.</li>
<li><strong>Sawayama Solitaire</strong>: A reimagined version of Klondike that is faster, more strategic, and more often winnable than the original.</li>
<li><strong>Fortune’s Foundation</strong>: A brand new and extra-challenging solitaire variant using a deck of Tarot cards that presents a fortune when you win.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As far as we know though, for real, they won't be making any actual full new games because they really are moving on. Still, having all of these in one collection does seem like quite a bright idea for people who just want their Solitaire fix in a few different unique styles and ways of playing.</p>
<p>It will be available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1988540/The_Zachtronics_Solitaire_Collection/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Infinity Engine reimplementation GemRB continues improving Icewind Dale 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Classics like Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, Icewind Dale and more running on the Infinity Engine should live on forever thanks to open source reimplementations like <a href="http://gemrb.org/" target="_blank">GemRB</a>.</p>
<p>While we do have the Enhanced Edition for many of them thanks to Beamdog, it's probable that eventually GemRB will be the best way to play all of them as we've seen with other open source reimplementations like OpenMW for Morrowind and OpenXcom for the classic X-COM. GemRB enables people to bring them to new platforms, better modding and continue improving them long into the future.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1323488611661946172gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1323488611661946172gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Icewind Dale 2</em></p>
<p>GemRB v0.9.1 just went up recently and here's what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>New features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Icewind Dale 2 can be progressed to well into chapter 5</li>
<li>Faster loading and saving, faster OpenGL rendering</li>
<li>Use magic device skill, precise shot, iwd1 bard song choice</li>
<li>SDLAudio plugin now supports ambients</li>
<li>Console history is now preserved, more text colors externalized</li>
<li>Logging is now done via fmt (bundled headers)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Improved features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Python3 support (now the only option)</li>
<li>Unicode support (iconv not optional any more!)</li>
<li>Spellcaster ai, effects, scripting, projectiles, weapon style customization</li>
<li>Audio, drawing, appimage, ini spawns</li>
<li>Bugfixes</li>
</ul>

      <title>SokoChess combines Chess with the Sokoban block-pushing formula</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SokoChess is certainly an intriguing game blending together two very different types of gameplay, to create something that's a little peculiar but quite fun. <u>Note</u>: key provided by the developer.</p>
<p>This is a minimalist puzzle game about pushing around Chess pieces into other pieces. Not as simple as it sounds though, and it will give your brain something of a workout. You might get one piece into a correct place, push your piece somewhere else only to be captured by an opposing piece you've moved somewhere.</p>
<p>Daisy Games, the developer, say it's "more than just a chess puzzle game" as it introduces various extra elements not in Chess like cracked tiles that break after moving over them, locks that need you to pick up a key and more. So it's Chess with Sokoban on steroids but somehow still minimal and relaxing.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nyUJq8s-VMM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7fbf218070ed98da68fb822d7246d9e2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nyUJq8s-VMM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You have 70 levels to play through, which like any good puzzle game start off plain and simple, with you just capturing a couple of Pawns by pushing them to the correct tile. It gradually makes the layout of the levels more complex, as it starts introducing more elements to challenge you. Some of the levels really will make your brain sweat and I am apparently far too dumb for it but I've been enjoying trying to think ahead and get it right.</p>
<p>Wonderful little gem worth picking up easily.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1960400/SokoChess/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Valheim gets patched to prevent the world resetting</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Quite an important update has rolled out for the open-world survival game Valheim, with a bunch of changes related to the saving system to prevent some big problems. For a little while some people have unfortunately seen their worlds getting reset, which this patch solves.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18873732421661944595gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18873732421661944595gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here's what's new in the update:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Autobackup system added that will keep one 2-hour and one 12-hour backup by default and can be customised in misc settings. Default setting on dedicated servers is 4, which can be customised with new parameters (-backups -backupshort -backuplong).</li>
<li>The game will now save after you sleep, or at 30 minute intervals, and the timer is reset when using the manual save console command. The save interval can be customised on dedicated servers using the new parameter (-saveinterval).</li>
<li>Using the console save command now also saves the character file</li>
<li>The dedicated server manual PDF has been updated with the new parameters.</li>
<li>World save gets disabled if it’s a corrupted world file or if it’s an incompatible world version and the game will return to the main menu. Dedicated servers will shut down if the world is corrupt.</li>
<li>A change to Steam Cloud saves to avoid a particular crash during saves that could corrupt the world save.</li>
<li>The game returns to a pause state if a multiplayer host is alone in a multiplayer session if all players leave (like it was previously).</li>
<li>Players can no longer create a world with the same name when Steam Cloud saves are enabled.</li>
<li>Characters with duplicate filenames will now be hidden.</li>
<li>Characters with different names from the filename will be displayed to differentiate between renamed files</li>
<li>Local and legacy characters will now be deleted properly if Steam Cloud is enabled</li>
<li>Beehive VFX on-hit fix</li>
<li>Removed the ability to craft/build the Midsummer items</li>
</ul>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox has today confirmed that Victoria 3 will be releasing on October 25, plus it's available for pre-order with a new trailer too.</p>
<p>"Victoria 3 is a deep socio-economic and political simulation that endeavors to represent the needs and desires of every person on earth across a century of dramatic technological and social upheaval. Growing populations will have to be fed, but they will also make political demands to increase or maintain their power. Pass laws and social reforms to reflect the wishes of your citizens, or try to impose a brighter future on a nation that may not appreciate your forward thinking."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZZhUadmaP8M"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/686063972290dbfdc097c93958e0843c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZZhUadmaP8M" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Infinite Replayability: Rewrite history as any of dozens of nations from the Victorian Era, from industrial powerhouses like Great Britain and Prussia to populous giants like Russia and Qing China or powers in waiting like Japan or Colonial Canada.</li>
<li>Deep Societal Simulation: Every inhabitant of your nation is simulated, whether farmer or clerk, capitalist or craftsman. Each has personal beliefs, political preferences and, most importantly, a standard of living to maintain.</li>
<li>Challenging Economic Gameplay: Develop your economy through the development of new industries and institutions, trading surplus goods to the many markets of the world and importing what your population needs to make life affordable.</li>
<li>Diplomatic Brinkmanship: Anything you can win through war can also be achieved at the negotiating table. Open diplomatic plays, calling on allies for support, as you press demands on weaker or rival nations.</li>
<li>Political Development: Manage the various political factions in your country through laws and reforms. Can you improve the life of your citizens, if it means angering established authorities?</li>
<li>A Living World: Watch the map change before your eyes, as newly constructed railways run between burgeoning cities, many of which were mere hamlets decades before.</li>

      <title>Steam Deck Verified and Playable hits 5,000</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There it is, the big one! Through the Deck Verified system we now have 5,000+ games listed as either Verified or Playable for the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>With it hitting around 4,500 earlier in August, we're still seeing a lot of games being checked over the course of a month. However, there's tens of thousands still to be done. The actual number of titles playable will be far greater since this is only the formal verification and even some games tagged as Unsupported do work fine (or can do with minor tweaks).</p>
<p>Going by <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified&amp;refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B1%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Playable" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, which includes unlisted titles, these are the current numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verified - 2,132</li>
<li>Playable - 2,869</li>
<li>Unsupported - 1,948</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the recently Verified titles include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1954200/Kena_Bridge_of_Spirits/" target="_blank">Kena: Bridge of Spirits</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/646270/60_Parsecs/" target="_blank">60 Parsecs!</a></li>

      <title>AMD announced &#34;Zen 4&#34; with Ryzen 7000 series, RDNA3 teased</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AMD has revealed their next-generation Zen 4 processors with the Ryzen 7000 series that will be launching September 27.</p>
<p>They're saying it will give a "double-digit" IPC (instructions per cycle/clock) uplift compared to the previous generation. AMD are also claiming they will be a lot more efficient than before, leveraging the power management tech from their mobile processors.</p>
<p>Here's the models they've announced for now:</p>

<p>This also comes with the new AM5 platform with dual-channel DD5 memory support, up to 24 PCIe 5.0 lanes and they say AM5 will be supported through to 2025. So you're going to be good for the next few generations of AMD processors with AM5. Installation they said will be <em>easier</em> than before with the 1718 pin LGA socket, it supports AM4 coolers too.</p>
<p>These are the chipsets that will be offered:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>AMD X670 Extreme: Bringing the most connectivity and extreme overclocking capabilities with PCIe 5.0 support for graphics and storage.</li>
<li>AMD X670: Supporting enthusiast overclocking with PCIe® 5.0 support for storage and optional graphics support.</li>
<li>AMD B650E: Designed for performance users with PCIe® 5.0 storage support and optional graphics support.</li>
<li>AMD B650: Designed for mainstream users with support for DDR5 memory and optional PCIe® 5.0 support.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>AMD X670 and X670E will be available in September but the B650E and B650 set land in October.</p>
<p>We also got a brief teaser of their next-generation GPUs with RDNA3 as well. During the event AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su mentioned it uses 5nm chiplets, to provide a "more than 50%" performance per watt uplift compared to RDNA2.</p>

      <title>Seems I&#39;ll be replaying Half-Life 2 again soon but this time in VR</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Half-Life 2: VR Mod is on the way and will hit official Beta on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/658920/HalfLife_2_VR_Mod/" target="_blank">Steam</a> on September 16th, so I guess I'll be playing it all over again then.</p>
<p>Seems currently it has no Native Linux version but don't let that stop you, it's probable that Proton will run it quite well. The developers said they do plan to open the source code too, they just need to get it approved by contributors and ensure there's no technical or legal issues. Once that's done, no doubt someone will do a proper port anyway.</p>
<p>It will be free, since it's a mod but you do need to own a copy of Half-Life 2.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="q-08KCheaGg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5aeed7d62f94a5276c4b50e3ab1ddd34.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/q-08KCheaGg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full room-scale VR with tracked motion controls. Physically walk around, pick up objects and climb ladders the way that only Virtual Reality allows.</li>
<li>Intuitive and realistic weapon interactions, with quick and easy weapon switching via a radial menu, ammo storage over your shoulder, functional iron-sights, two-handed weapons, and manual reloading.</li>
<li>Control options including; full left-handed support, a laser sight, and arcade style "quick reload".</li>
<li>Comfort features like motion vignette and 3rd person vehicle camera. (Note: there is currently no teleport movement option.)</li>
<li>Playable on any VR headset which is supported by SteamVR.</li>

      <title>Necrosmith is a budget indie banger</title>
      <author>anewson</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Necrosmith is a roguelike real-time strategy management game. You create minions and release them to scout your surroundings, defend your castle, gather loot, and destroy enemy lairs. The game has no Native Linux release but runs <em>flawlessly</em> through Proton.</p>
<p>The game plays much like Majesty, an old favourite of mine, but with the minion-creation mechanic replacing the micro-economy of Majesty. You start out constructing skeletons, zombies, and orcs from body parts scattered about your keep, and as you find higher-tier body parts you begin building vampires, harpies, giants, steampunk mechs, and far more. The ultimate objective is to survive long enough to build yourself an altar to escape. In practice, this involves surviving three waves, each lasting around ten minutes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18375896091661848265gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18375896091661848265gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Necrosmith thankfully has an active pause, so you can respond to the frenetic enemy waves with a considered use of the mana and body parts at your disposal. Some of the most fun the game offers is in discovering secret recipes, each of which comes with a stat bonus. Mix skeleton and zombie parts and you might get a half-rotten undead. Slap a mechanoid leg on a vampire and create a crippled vampire. Mix and match dragon and harpy parts for a wyvern, or put mantid limbs on an Ent for a giant stick bug.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="IXG1_KuGwlY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1f267cc8f0af364f5060f515176d3b12.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/IXG1_KuGwlY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In between runs you can spend persistent currency on a variety of powerful upgrades and spells. Surround your keep with acid fog, blast enemy lairs with lighting, and heal your monstrous minions. While these spells start relatively weak, with upgrades the cool-downs fall and effectiveness increase dramatically. The real powerhouse of your run is in the blueprints you start finding in ruined enemy lairs which dramatically improve your minions with health, damage, farther sight, and faster speeds.</p>
<p>While you can control a single unit at a time using WASD, the majority of the time your minions will wander about according to their own whims. To quote the developer in the game description on Steam, "to tell the truth, the dead are pretty, uhm, dumb." Indeed, I have lost more than my fair share of runs because my minions decided to wander off into the wilds with enemies descending on the keep. That said, once you learn the quirks of the AI your minions are fairly competent; they successfully kite enemies, destroy lairs, and march towards the closest enemy wave.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13271162181661848323gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13271162181661848323gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>As for problems, the game is missing some quality of life features and endgame replayability. When your run ends you are booted back to the menu without a summary of how well you did, there are few keybinds and no way to rebind them, and the game sorely needs a "defend keep" command for your absentminded minions. I finished the game in about 14 hours and without a difficulty setting or NG+ mode I don't feel a strong urge to continue. Perhaps your mileage will vary.</p>
<p>In summary Necrosmith is a great indie RTS management package, of particular interest to Majesty fans, with a great soundtrack and a steal of a price.</p>
<p>You can buy the game on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1949190/Necrosmith/" target="_blank">Steam</a> or <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/necrosmith" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>

      <title>Kena: Bridge of Spirits gets Steam Deck Verified ahead of the Steam release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a gorgeous looking story-driven, action adventure that was exclusive to the Epic Store but the time is up and it's coming to Steam now. It's also been Steam Deck Verified ahead of release.</p>
<p>I'm liking this trend of seeing more and more games getting that verification before release, hopefully this will continue happening! The only issue this game has on Steam Deck according to the compatibility notes, is that you might need to manually switch the controllers around in the Deck UI if you use an external controller.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WYZsj9H7SXo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b4ca89b7359db7503bf4aaaf75476d2d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WYZsj9H7SXo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For the Steam release it comes with a big update that adds:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>New Game+</strong></em>: Begin a new adventure after completing the game, starting with all your abilities, upgrades, and Rot as you face new combat encounters, challenges and unique enemies.</li>
<li><em><strong>Spirit Guide Trials</strong></em>: Sharpen your skills and unlock rewards in The Trials, including: Wave Defenses, Obstacle Courses, and the chance to take on key boss-fights again and again.</li>
<li><em><strong>Outfits</strong></em>: Unlock brand new outfits for Kena to wear by mastering The Trials.</li>
<li><em><strong>Charmstones</strong></em>: Discover Charmstones that can be equipped to provide different advantages and disadvantages to customize your playstyle.</li>
<li><em><strong>Enhanced Photo Mode</strong></em>: Includes more fun poses, unique lighting setups, and even a moving camera feature!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It releases <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1954200/Kena_Bridge_of_Spirits/" target="_blank">on Steam</a> on September 27.</p>

      <title>Wine 7.16 out fixing up Saints Row, Wow64 support in X11 driver</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Slightly later than they usually put up the releases, the Wine team released <a href="https://www.winehq.org/announce/7.16" target="_blank">Wine 7.16</a> on August 28th bring new features and bug fixes for the Windows translation layer.</p>
<p>This is the compatibility layer that allows you to run various Windows applications and games on Linux (and forms part of Steam Play Proton). Once a year or so, a new stable release is made but the development versions are usually fine to use.</p>
<p>Highlights of this release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Wow64 support in X11 driver.</li>
<li>Session storage in MSHTML.</li>
<li>Unicode regexp fixes in MSXML.</li>
<li>IME improvements in Edit control.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow64 is an interesting one, as that is basically a compatibility layer on Windows for running 32bit apps on 64bit.</p>
<p>22 bugs were noted as solved with this release including problems with the new Saints Row, so it should now actually work without having to <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/wvvqy2/saints_row_2022_not_working_under_wine_or_proton/ilhwu3w/" target="_blank">modify</a> the exe file. Others that were mentioned to have fixes recently include Visual Novel Doukyuusei, Ragnarok Online, Star Citizen, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, Watch Dogs, Amazon Games App and more.</p>
<p>Need help installing apps with Wine? Try out <a href="https://usebottles.com/" target="_blank">Bottles</a>, it's what I use on desktop and Steam Deck and it keeps on getting better constantly.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck has a new Client Beta with more Steam Input improvements (updated)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A small but interesting Steam Deck <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3254434504248152987" target="_blank">update available</a> in Beta and Preview, which you can try out right now.  To try it out hit the Steam button, got to Settings &gt; System and change the Steam Update Channel to either Beta or Preview. You can revert it to Stable any time.</p>
<p>Here's what's new as of August 26th:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed scrolling on home recommended screen due to discovery queue</li>
<li>Fixed issue where What's New section was not populated properly</li>
</ul>
<p>Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Replaced the Big Picture configurator in desktop mode with a windowed view of the new Configurator. This currently only applies to desktop mode on Steam Deck.</li>
<li>Improve styling of command names</li>
<li>Fix bug w/ renaming "Move By Amount" mouse bindings</li>
<li>Fix action set layers not carrying through Gamepad triggers outputs from button bindings</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I went to test out the new Configurator in desktop mode, but all I'm still seeing (using Preview) is the original Big Picture styled configurator so I'm not entirely clear where Valve has actually changed that or if it's just not working as they expect. Beta / Preview for a reason after all. <strong>Updated</strong>: it <em>doesn't</em> use the new configurator for the <em>main</em> Steam controller settings, but it does work for games directly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13565787241661536900gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13565787241661536900gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: on August 27th, Valve put up <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3254434504252025483" target="_blank">another</a> small Beta / Preview update that includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve touch menu cursor performance and responsiveness</li>
<li>Fix regression w/ Touch Menu transparency from August 18th Beta client</li>
<li>Change navigation of controller command buttons to keep your current selected column when scrolling</li>
<li>Fix issue with Nintendo Switch Controller glyphs on the On-Screen Keyboard</li>
</ul>

      <title>Escape the rising waters and take on refugees in Diluvian Winds - new trailer up</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Diluvian Winds continues looking interesting. Alambik Studio and Goblinz Publishing are working to bring out a 2D management and building game where you're trying to fight against the rising water that's left you exiled.</p>
<p>Take on refugees and continue building up a little city, as you take on the role of the Guardian, an individual who refuses to leave their lighthouse so you've got a front-row seat to the rising tides. A brand new trailer was released recently which you can view below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ApcvIR8EqMc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5ce1dfdcd1c4ed407f47cd64e3d08c6f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ApcvIR8EqMc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<div>Expand your community - Each Lodged Refugee will make changes of varying magnitude around the Lighthouse, making it more resilient to the gradually rising waters.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Enter a poetic universe combining Sail Punk architecture,</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Which survival path will you take? Will you float, fly, or dive?</div>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can wishlist / follow it on <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/diluvian_winds" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1561040/Diluvian_Winds/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, it will release with Native Linux support</p>
<p>There's also a Prologue coming out in September but the full game has no release date yet.</p>

      <title>No more dungeons, overtake the overworld tile by tile in Overboss</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Overboss looks like a fun idea. Coming from the same team that gave us Legend of Keepers, it has you emerge from the underworld to take over the overworld. This is actually a digital version of the <a href="https://www.brotherwisegames.com/overboss" target="_blank">board game</a> of the same name, which was from the same people that made Boss Monster (a favourite of mine).</p>
<p>You go through grabbing tiles to place on the map to build it up, then you get to place down monsters or a mini-boss and continue building up the world with various tiles giving different point bonuses. Placement seems to be key here and it will have a competitive element to it with you being able to face off against others online as you each compete to be the Overboss.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck 2 is absolutely coming, new booklet from Valve confirms</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3401926123919972634" target="_blank">just released</a> a rather fancy Steam Deck Booklet to introduce Valve, Steam and the Steam Deck to the new markets across Asia they're about to expand into and it gives some fun details.</p>
<p>A lot of it goes over all the stuff those of us across western markets already know, including where Valve has servers located, info on their previous hardware and how things like the Steam Link and Steam Controller enabled the Steam Deck to actually be a thing.</p>
<p>It also confirmed, again, that SteamOS will be getting a generic installer so that anyone will be able to install the latest SteamOS available from the Steam Deck on their PC. Along with that, hardware vendors will also be able to use it so we'll eventually see devices from others with some already looking into it like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/gpd-talk-about-cooperating-with-valve-for-steamos-on-their-devices/" target="_blank">GPD</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/onexplayer-looking-at-shipping-handhelds-with-steamos-like-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">OneXPlayer</a>.</p>
<p>What about a Steam Deck 2 then? Well, it doesn't get much more firm than "In the future, Valve will follow up on this<br/>
product with improvements and iterations to hardware and software, bringing new versions of Steam Deck to market." which was taken from the last info page:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16227428811661499754gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16227428811661499754gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>The page mentions they want it to be "even more open" than the first generation too. I'm not sure how they plan to improve on that, since it's already one of the most open mainstream gaming devices around but I'm keen to see what they have planned.</p>
<p>What do you think about the future of the Steam Deck and SteamOS?</p>

      <title>SD GUNDAM BATTLE ALLIANCE works out of the box on Steam Deck and Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SD GUNDAM BATTLE ALLIANCE is a brand new release from ARTDINK and Bandai Namco Entertainment. The good news is that it works out of the box at release on Steam Deck and Linux desktop. Battle Alliance is pretty much a hack and slash, blended together with some Anime visual novel story elements in between missions. Available to play solo or online with up to 2 others.</p>
<p>Unlike a lot of releases, there's no issues with movie playback here it all just works. For the Steam Deck specifically, the only quirk I noticed was needing to manually bring up the on-screen keyboard but apart from that it worked pretty great out of the box with all the defaults.</p>
<p>Some Steam Deck footage:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="13O8jy2_TnE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/57b86d4896e13d0e055c0bfa9746abf7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/13O8jy2_TnE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I've also tested it working just fine on my Fedora Linux desktop too where it runs very well.</p>
<p>So far it seems users on Steam are pretty <em>mixed</em> on it. As a <u>huge</u> Gundam fan, I'm not entirely sure what I think of it either. SD GUNDAM BATTLE ALLIANCE is a clear fan-service game but that's not a bad thing. The developer has put in a lot of work and attention to detail in it for Gundam fans, with plenty of different mobile suits available to unlock and upgrade but it does feel a bit lacking overall — mainly the combat, which is quite a basic hack and slash. The environment art is somewhat dull for a 2022 release too.</p>
<p>That said, I'm actually enjoying it a lot, mostly because I am a big fan of the various Gundam universes and stories. Stomping around as a few of my favourite machines and blasting away others is still pretty entertaining.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/sd-gundam-battle-alliance?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/824550/SD_GUNDAM_BATTLE_ALLIANCE/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>CrossOver 22 released for running Windows apps and games on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/" target="_blank">CodeWeavers</a>, the company that works on Proton with Valve and supports Wine development, has announced the released of CrossOver 22.0.0. This is their special proprietary interface for helping users across Linux, macOS and Chrome OS work with applications and games designed for Windows on their platform of choice.</p>
<p>One of the big new things about this release is the refreshed user interface, with the last upgrade to the UI being CrossOver 15 many years ago and no redesign since CrossOver 9. They said their goal with the redesign was to make it "more intuitive to use and offer a more modern look and feel" enabling "users to find the things they need to do most often and to bring the CrossOver interface in line with our branding".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7379494741661453479gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7379494741661453479gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the other big changes to come along with the UI redesign include extensive changes to the installation process, an updated search function. What you get is a more guided install path for many applications, while also still letting you override things to your liking.</p>
<p>They also revamped the bottle view, where you actually install things. Plus there's a new Home view, which is a mash up of their old All Bottles and Favourites views.</p>
<p>CrossOver 22 includes Wine 7.7, Wine Mono 7.2.0 and vkd3d 1.4. They say you also get initial support for DirectX 12 with a "handful" of games running well along with fixes to Office 2016/365 bugs. Seems like they might be having issues with GTA Online <a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/support/forums/general/?t=27;msg=266856" target="_blank">bans</a> though, so be warned.</p>
<p>Why use CrossOver instead of something like <a href="https://usebottles.com/" target="_blank">Bottles</a>? Well, it's largely all about support. You're paying for supported software, while also directly helping Wine and Proton development because CodeWeavers sponsor Wine. CrossOver also has many paid staff working on it, with more quality assurance testing so there's that too. It comes down to what you prefer - choices are great.</p>

      <title>One Lonely Outpost gets a new trailer and a delay until 2023</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One Lonely Outpost is an upcoming sci-fi colonization life and farming sim that was crowdfunded on Kickstarter. It was due this year but it's now delayed but it seems progress is good.</p>
<p>Early Access has now been moved to March 2023 as they clearly mentioned they want to avoid "remotely giving any of you a potentially bad, or even rough game". Delays communicated properly are fine, as long as developers keep people informed (especially for crowdfunded games) there's never really a problem. In this case, the new trailer showcases a game that looks like it's quite nicely coming together that you can see below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nxxwpJ--DI0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d010ee9abd93602d7e59b6b1fd33fc22.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nxxwpJ--DI0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Planned Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Plan your colonist’s farming adventures. Will you explore? Plant? Craft? Build a close-knit community? Delve into mysterious dungeons? Or all of them at once?</li>
<li>Fill out the Omninac by experiencing life on the new planet. Categorize crops, minerals, seasons, animals, and more!</li>
<li>Terraform the desert with a trusty robotic pet. Fertilize the ground, secure water sources, and make the air breathable.</li>
<li>Farm, mine, explore, and carve out a habitat for humanity.</li>
<li>Establish a colony and develop the basics. Your loneliness will be over once colonists start coming - but where do things go from there? Well, time to make some choices.</li>
<li>Pick the Synthetic route and unleash the power of science, hybrid plants, spliced genes (turns out glowing cabbages are great night lights), and unleash productive robo-cows on the newly sprouted grassland</li>
<li>...or go the Naturalist route, carefully tending to all-natural Earth-based crops and livestock, focusing on quality over quantity. Each path has different rewards - and attracts different colonists.</li>
<li>Usher in a new dawn for humanity, building a genuine off-world utopia for your colonists.</li>
<li>Connect with the newfound community, cultivating relationships, and who knows, maybe even finding love among the pioneers?</li>
<li>And just as important as the future, delve into the past of the old world. Just what lies hidden beneath this ancient planet's surface...?</li>
</ul>

      <title>Valve testing new mobile Steam app with QR codes for sign ins</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve are now testing a new version of the Steam app for Android and iOS, which comes with a much more modern design and a QR code login system too.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/3335498663100828298" target="_blank">announcement</a> Valve say it has been rebuilt "on a new framework and modernized the design", joking that 2015 called and wanted their app back. As before you can browse the store, get Steam Guard codes and confirm trades but you also now get the brand new QR code sign in system that many other applications also offer (like Discord). So you can scan it with your phone on the web, and not have to enter a password.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10911149881661438734gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10911149881661438734gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>The new app also has smarter notifications, an improved library views and there's also now multi-account support which has become increasingly important especially with the Steam Deck now too. There's a new <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamMobileApp" target="_blank">Steam Group</a> you can join to get updates on it.</p>
<p>I would have taken some shots, but seeing as I'm now on iOS myself it's limited to 10,000 people and that filled up within seconds of the original announcements. Here's some shots from a reader on Android (click to enlarge):</p>

      <title>Steam Deck reservations continue to grow, now at its highest point</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has confirmed two tasty bits of info today for those waiting on getting a Steam Deck, and for those curious about how things are currently going.</p>
<p>While a Valve developer <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/steam-deck-production-better-than-expected-q4-emails-already-going-out/" target="_blank">teased recently</a> that production was better than expected so more people are getting their purchase emails, as of today the new reservation windows are actually up and so you might find if you were in Q4 you might <em>now</em> be in Q3. As they said on <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1562526092128587783" target="_blank">Twitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Great news! We are making more Steam Decks than ever, and have just updated shipping window estimates for reservation holders. If you were previously in the Q4 (Oct-Dec) window, take a look - you might be in Q3 now!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for how things are going?</p>
<p>Well, it's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u5uHyEF9uY" target="_blank">clearly a success</a> but how much of one? In a follow-up Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1562526092128587783" target="_blank">post</a> they gave a tiny bit of insight without revealing any numbers but it's obviously good news:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another fun stat - the number of Steam Deck reservations being made on a daily basis continues to grow, and is at its highest since our launch earlier this year!📈</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exciting times. This is great for the Steam Deck and SteamOS of course but also Linux Gaming as a whole. No surprise to see the Steam Deck has been in the top 5 of the <a href="https://steamdb.info/topsellers/" target="_blank">Weekly Global Top Sellers</a> for nearly half a year and a lot of that at number 1.</p>
<p>Hopefully at some point we will see more games with anti-cheat roll out support for Steam Deck and Proton, so all Linux gamers can benefit from it. Looking at you, Destiny 2.</p>

      <title>Boneraiser Minions is probably my next 100 hour indie obsession</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Stop me if you've heard this before, but I've discovered another game that takes elements from Vampire Survivors and makes it nicely unique again. Enter the world of Boneraiser Minions. Another really cheap indie game that's released recently at around $1.99 / £1.69 and you can get a great many hours out of this one. It works perfectly on Linux with Proton and it is Steam Deck Verified too.</p>
<p>You run around and attempt to survive and avoid attacks, while collecting up the bones from people your minions skewer. Get enough bones to level up and you can raise the dead, making a bigger army to take on those villagers, heroes and bosses too. Initially you don’t know what any of the options do when you level up, so you’re discovering all the minion types, minion upgrades and special relic power ups as you go.</p>
<p>Here's some of my footage that I recorded from Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HQxZG1XxrTM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ae899c856aade8a88984da6dc2a5f11a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HQxZG1XxrTM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I've truly been having a blast with this one. I'm always on the lookout for indie games that will keep me going for a long time, without taking too much brainpower when needing some downtime and this fits the bill perfectly.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Boneraising auto-battler action: Dash around avoiding enemies and collecting their bones to raise and upgrade minions who fight for you! Each minion type has their own fighting styles, from melee pulverisers, to bomb lobbers and magical missilers.</li>
<li>Multiple game modes: There's several game modes to keep play fresh. From the Mausoleum Awakening where you must protect your crypt against King Gigald and his forces, making best use of traps and contraptions you place before the show. There's the Endless Skirmishes where the aim is to simply see how long you can last against an ever growing horde of meanies. The Daily/Weekly Challenge were you compete against the world on an equal footing. And then there's Clashful Cards, a collectable adversarial card game, a bit of respite from the endless boneraising!</li>
<li>Relics and Spells: There's not just bones to suck on during the fight. You will find curious Relics with strange boosts and abilities, or Spell Scrolls with powerful attacks or buffs to be used at the perfect time!</li>
<li>Boneraise Lore meta: Between games use collected coins to increase your abilities and boneraising powers, such as learning to raise Enboned Giants and Possessed Deamons. Meta can also be upgraded and refunded, encouraging you to play around and find your perfect meta loadout!</li>
<li>Heroic Force meta: You must also bolster the forces against you too if you wish to survive King Gigald. Why not provoke a Beggar's Revolt, Goblin Looters, or Mercenary Cyclops, and use their bones to raise an ever greater army of dead!</li>
<li>Class Heritage meta: By stealing heroes souls you can also learn new abilities and perks for a particular class. Each class offering their own playstyles!</li>
<li>Steam Leaderboard: Battle your foes, and your friends, to reach first place on the online Steam leaderboard! Even after defeating King Gigald the crusade wars are endless, and only the greatest legion of undead ever assembled will reach the top spot!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Waves and Waves 2: Notorious are now free after developer passed away</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/107600/Waves/" target="_blank">Waves</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/217120/Waves_2_Notorious/" target="_blank">Waves 2: Notorious</a> are two rather good twin-stick shooters and sadly, the developer behind them has died after a battle with Cancer and as a dying wish has made both games free to keep for everyone.</p>
<p>Announced in a post on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/217120/discussions/0/5733664933461392610/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, their partner "CJ" mentioned how Rob Hale passed away a fortnight ago (post dated August 14th) and they wanted to make the announcement sooner but understandably that was a little difficult. As they said setting the games free was "something Rob was considering anyway within the past two months as their health entered into more substantial difficulties, so I hope this can be seen as a parting gift to all those out there that haven’t yet played either of these games".</p>
<p>I did play Waves 2: Notorious <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/waves-2-notorious-an-absolutely-mad-twin-stick-shooter-arrives-on-linux/" target="_blank">back in 2019</a> after speaking with Hale, and it was quite a joy to play through.</p>
<p>The post on Steam ends with a note: "So I hope all of you out there, whoever you are and however Rob’s games have reached you, that you can at the very least hold a special place for the Waves games, and that they continue to bring you many more hours of chill, challenge, and possibly even frustration, but most of all I hope that you can continue to feel the passion and love that Rob poured into these games long after the pain of their passing begins to fade."</p>
<p>Rest in peace, Rob Hale.</p>

      <title>Wii U emulator Cemu 2.0 out, goes open source and gets Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It has finally happened. Cemu, the Wii U emulator has a big new 2.0 release and it is now officially open source and available for Linux too.</p>
<p>For Linux, most people do need to compile it from source as there's only an Ubuntu package right now but the developer has said in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cemu/comments/wwa22c/cemu_20_announcement_linux_builds_opensource_and/" target="_blank">announcement post</a> that they're looking into AppImage and Flatpak to make it easier. While Cemu should work fine on Linux, they also mentioned there are some lingering issues mostly around the user interface. Part of the reason it was open sourced, was that the main developer had been doing it alone for quite a while and so now it's open source hopefully more people will help develop it further.</p>
<p>Main changes for Cemu 2.0 include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Major:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cemu is now open-source!</li>
<li>Preliminary Linux builds are available, but be warned that they are still very rough around the edges</li>
<li>Going forward, we simplified the versioning a bit by using shorter version numbers (2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3..)</li>
<li>Updated all dependencies. Most notably SDL (input &amp; motion) and wxWidgets (UI).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other changes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a crash in the H264 video decoder. Resolves crash on Smash title screen</li>
<li>Made nsysnet a little less crash prone. Fixes crash in Call of Duty: Black Ops II</li>
<li>Fixed a logging related crash that could occur under very specific circumstances. Seen in Wind Waker if letting the game idle on the title screen for 2 minutes.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could happen when the path to Cemu.exe contained unicode characters</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could happen when loading .elf homebrew</li>
<li>The account list in the title manager save exporter is no longer empty</li>
<li>Latency for wiimotes should be a bit better now</li>
<li>Added symbol/function list to debugger + other small debugger/assembler improvements</li>
<li>Implemented API: coreinit.FSOpenFileExAsync (used by some homebrew)</li>
<li>Many more under-the-hood changes and fixes</li>
<li>Some more work towards a Stop&amp;Restart emulation feature. Not ready yet but we are getting there</li>
</ul>

      <title>Command armies over voice comms, Radio General - Water Rats expansion out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Radio General - Water Rats is the first paid expansion for the positively rated unique strategy game, where you call the orders over your microphone.</p>
<p>If you've not played it before this is a real-time strategy game where you're like a general sat in a tent. There's no special real-time minimap here, all your info is gathered via reports that help you make decisions. However, not all info is correct and some tough decisions need to be made, all over the radio. It's genuinely quite a clever game and this new expansion gives you 7 new campaign missions (all playable in co-op!), a new Air Support unit with level-up veterancy perks (usable in non-DLC campaign missions too!), bridge construction with Engineers and over 90 new historical photos and videos.</p>
<p>You can check out some gameplay done from the developer below:</p>

<p>You can buy the game and the DLC <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1011610/Radio_General/" target="_blank">on Steam</a>. Available with Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Games publisher PQube accused of &#39;predatory practices&#39; and being manipulative (updated)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PQube, a games publisher that has over 50 games on Steam, has been accused of engaging in "predatory practices".</p>
<p>Toge Productions and Mojiken Studio, who are currently working on the slice of life adventure game A Space For The Unbound, accused PQube of some pretty shady behaviour on <a href="https://twitter.com/ASFTUgame/status/1562319004949028864" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and in an official Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1201270/view/3247679104801781500" target="_blank">news post</a>.</p>
<p>In the statement they mentioned that PQube had left them feeling "manipulated and exploited" leading to a terminated agreement. According to Toge and Mojiken, the people at PQube pulled in funding from a diversity fund that's <em>supposed</em> to help underrepresented game devs. However, instead of giving it to the developers they hid it and then used it for their own gain, including using it to negotiate an increase in their own revenue share from the developer.</p>
<p>We've heard about and seen plenty of pretty terrible publishing agreements over the years, but if this is true this is a pretty new low for a publisher to use the position of a developer for their own gain in such a way.</p>
<p><em>Have asked PQube for a statement, will update if they reply.</em></p>
<p><strong>Update: PQube sent us this statement:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have honoured all obligations of our publishing agreement and have supported Toge Productions at every stage of product development throughout their delays and difficulties.  This support has included offering significant further funding, over and above grant funding, to support development, porting and marketing.  Toge Productions have sought for some time to unilaterally enforce unreasonable revised terms to our agreement and it is disappointing that, as a result of not achieving that and despite PQube's significant efforts to accommodate this, they have sought to deal with the matter in this way.  We will respond through the appropriate channels.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA Vulkan Beta Driver 515.49.14 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA has released the latest update to their special <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" target="_blank">Vulkan Beta Driver</a>, for developers and users who want to test out the very-latest stuff. Designed mostly for developers, normal every-day users should probably just stick to the regular driver</p>
<p>Here's what's added / changed in version 515.49.14:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New:
	<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_attachment_feedback_loop_layout.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_attachment_feedback_loop_layout</a></li>
<li>Added support for chaining VkShaderModuleCreateInfo when creating compute and ray tracing pipelines</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixes:
	<ul>
<li>Don't read pipeline state when it's not valid for the pipeline library stage</li>
<li>Fixed issue clearing 3D depth images where the end slice(s) weren't cleared completely</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Vulkan applications would crash when running under Wayland</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>open-gpu-kernel-modules release:
	<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/releases/tag/515.49.14" target="_blank">https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/releases/tag/515.49.14</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>VK_EXT_attachment_feedback_loop_layout is a new extension worked on by people from Valve, Collabora, Google, Igalia, Samsung and Arm. As the official spec reads:</p>
<p>"This extension adds a new image layout, VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_ATTACHMENT_FEEDBACK_LOOP_OPTIMAL_EXT, which allows applications to have an image layout in which they are able to both render to and sample/fetch from the same subresource of an image in a given render pass."</p>

      <title>Hearts of Iron IV - By Blood Alone set to release on September 27th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After being announced back in June, we now actually have a release date for the latest Hearts of Iron IV expansion from Paradox with By Blood Alone coming on September 27th. By Blood Alone centers the political and military fortunes of Italy. The historical path, as always, is open to those who want to relive the dramatic years before and during the war.

      <title>Total War: WARHAMMER III 2.0 out with Immortal Empires, Linux update &#39;as soon as possible&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Creative Assembly and SEGA have announced the massive Total War: WARHAMMER III 2.0 patch which comes along with a Beta version of Immortal Empires. <u>ICYMI</u>: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/total-war-warhammer-iii-cautiously-builds-upon-a-tried-and-true-formula/" target="_blank">check out our previous review from BTRE</a>.</p>
<p>The Immortal Empires Beta is a new grand-scale campaign mode for Total War: WARHAMMER III. If you own all three games in the series, it's free. It brings together the Legendary Lords, gameplay mechanics, war units and much more from across the trilogy into one colossal mode.</p>
<p>"Immortal Empires represents the world-encompassing vision we've been aiming towards since we first partnered with Games Workshop, and it's great to see that become a reality". Said DLC Director, Richard Aldridge. "It's the most ambitious game mode we've ever worked on and will usher in years of post-release content for Total War: WARHAMMER III".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bG9N3xvTQl0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/15a136ce065020380e8375e8329e0c9e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bG9N3xvTQl0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You will also find the Champions of Chaos launch today as well that contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Four New Warriors of Chaos Legendary Lords: The Champions of Chaos have risen through the ranks thanks to their infamous deeds to become the favoured of the four Dark Gods, they are; Valkia the Bloody, the deadly but daemonic consort of Khorne. Festus the Leechlord, the deranged plague-doctor of Nurgle. Azazel, Prince of Damnation, the ecstatic heir of Slaanesh. Vilitch the Curseling, the conjoined sorcerer-twin of Tzeentch.  </li>
<li>A New Campaign Experience: In the ancient arena-city of Zanbaijin, the servants of the Chaos gods have clashed for millennia and the souls of those who fall in battle are sealed within the Altar of Battle. As a Champion of Chaos, you must earn the gaze of your master through bloodshed and ritual before taking the arcane power as your own. From there, the true test awaits.</li>
<li>Over Fifty New Units: Charging into bloodthirsty combat alongside their Champions is diverse host of battlefield units, including the Warshrine of Chaos which bestows terrible gifts upon those who make the appropriate sacrifice, Chaos Knights who ride as a wall of blades and spiked armor to crash through the enemy ranks in an explosion of torn flesh, and the Chosen, an ironclad group of elite slaughterers who form the inner circle of their lord's warband.</li>
</ul>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JCRTUdarkuM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e3919524f3913eb0e08d8fbec89a702e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JCRTUdarkuM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For those of you sticking with the Native Linux version port done by Feral Interactive, I spoke with them today about when to expect all this in the port and they said this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All of the Update 2.0 content, including the Immortal Empires beta and the Champions of Chaos and Blood for the Blood God III DLCs, will be made available on Linux as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Please bear in mind that this update brings a huge amount of new content and significant code changes, all of which need to be incorporated into and tested in the Linux version before release.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also not to be missed is the new Blood for the Blood God III DLC, a very gory effects-pack, that's free if you picked up the pack for the previous two games. It adds in blood spurts, limb and head dismemberment, blood-drenched UI elements, global campaign events that generate greater carnage in battle, and much more.</p>
<p>You can grab Total War: Warhammer III on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/total-war-warhammer-iii?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142710/Total_War_WARHAMMER_III/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>ProtonUp-Qt for easy GE-Proton installs on Linux and Steam Deck v2.7.0 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/DavidoTek/ProtonUp-Qt" target="_blank">ProtonUp-Qt</a> is a simple and great way to manage the likes of GE-Proton (previously known as Proton GE), the Luxtorpeda compatibility tool for Native Linux game engines and more.</p>
<p><em>For those confused on the GE-Proton naming: it switched from being Proton-GE to GE-Proton <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton7-1" target="_blank">back in February</a>, although it seems a lot of people still just call it Proton-GE. Confused? I know I am.</em></p>
<p>Anyway, ProtonUp-Qt is the "easy mode" to install GE and other compatibility layers on Linux and Steam Deck as it gives you a nice UI to work with and you just click a few buttons. New in ProtonUp-Qt v2.7.0:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added DXVK Nightly builds</li>
<li>Added button to install Proton-GE and Boxtron for Steam Flatpak directly from Flathub</li>
<li>Added <a href="https://github.com/Frogging-Family/wine-tkg-git/releases/tag/7.x%2B" target="_blank">Proton-Tkg CI builds</a></li>
<li>Fix bug where download would crash with error message 'no space left' <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/DavidoTek/ProtonUp-Qt/issues/87" target="_blank">#87</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's how it looks:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17665355551661262309gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17665355551661262309gol1.png"/></a></p>

      <title>Steam Deck production better than expected, Q4 emails already going out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has confirmed that production of the Steam Deck has gone better than expected, and so even more (yes again) people will be seeing their emails to purchase one.</p>
<p>This has happened multiple times recently, so things are going very well over at Valve. Back at the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/valve-speeds-up-steam-deck-production-some-more-all-existing-reservations-this-year/" target="_blank">end of July</a> Valve announced they had sorted issues with their supply chain, then in the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/even-more-steam-deck-purchase-invites-are-going-out-from-now/" target="_blank">middle of August</a> they also announced the number of emails going out was increasing.</p>
<p>Now we're back again because developer Lawrence Yang mentioned on <a href="https://twitter.com/lawrenceyang/status/1561835173800321024" target="_blank">Twitter</a> yesterday:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi all, a few of you may have received an order email for your “Q4 window” Steam Deck reservation today. This wasn’t a mistake! Production has outperformed our estimates, and we’ll be moving more Q4 folks into the Q3 window.</p>
<p>Official announcement and info coming soon. 🎉</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No other announcement has arrived yet, so likely an official Steam news post coming later this week. As a reminder, emails to purchase a Steam Deck go out every Monday and Thursday. <strong>Update</strong>: Yang also <a href="https://twitter.com/lawrenceyang/status/1562079471825350656" target="_blank">clarified</a> on Twitter the reservation dates haven't been updated just yet.</p>

      <title>Cities: Skylines is getting another expansion with Plazas and Promenades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Plazas and Promenades is the next expansion for the city-builder Cities: Skylines, giving you the option to build up some special pedestrian zones. Build up your dream on-foot experience with it, apparently. Goodbye noise and air pollution huh?</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="d0Q8RN9ut4s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9a5a4b6c49e49bfb2e7a454f45e16afe.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/d0Q8RN9ut4s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Main DLC features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pedestrian Streets: </strong>let your citizens walk freely on pedestrian-only streets! Place them in your city like any other road and create new green city centers free of most vehicles and pollution.</li>
<li><strong>Pedestrian Zones and New Policies: </strong>activate three zone-specific policies for your city including Slow Driving: all roads in the pedestrian zone, except highways, get a speed limit of 20 miles/hour. Sugar Ban: increases the average lifespan of citizens in the pedestrian zone but decreases their happiness. Street Music: increases happiness and noise pollution in pedestrian commercial zones.</li>
<li><strong>District Specialization: </strong>we added 3 new district specializations: offices, high-density residential areas, and high-density commercial zones. Setting a specialization on a district affects all zoned squares in that district that will spawn buildings with a different visual appearance and a gameplay effect. Each specialization features 24 new modern wall-to-wall buildings!</li>
<li><strong>City Service Buildings: </strong>service buildings are important, but how about awesome-looking service buildings? Connect them to pedestrian zones by matching their visual style and provide services that contribute to good happiness values.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There will also be two content creator packs and two radio stations released at the same time. No exact date has been shared yet as far as I can see but they did say at release the main DLC will cost 14.99 USD / 12.99 GBP / 14.99 EUR.</p>
<p>You can pick up Cities: Skylines from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/cities-skylines?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/255710/Cities_Skylines/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Mask of the Rose from Failbetter Games delayed until April 2023</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Failbetter Games put a new <a href="https://www.failbettergames.com/news/production-update-and-ui-revamp" target="_blank">production update</a> post up recently for Mask of the Rose that went over the user interface, but they also announced a delay. What is Mask of the Rose? A visual novel dating sim all about mystery, set in the wonderfully weird gothic world of Fallen London. For players of Sunless Sea and Sunless Skies, it gives you a new way to experience the universe,</p>
<p>Originally due towards the end of this year, they said in the post how they've seen signs of "an over-tight schedule: mounting stress levels, team members becoming reluctant to take time off". Instead of getting people to do overtime, cut features and other such ideas they decided to just delay the game instead.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_Vzt2XceW-c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f17eb5cabf22ce48f415e3a305d5beb1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_Vzt2XceW-c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Seems sane enough to me. Given how great their previous games were, it would be nice to have another quality game from them as their writing and world-building is always awesome.</p>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>(Re)invent yourself: who were you before the Fall? Who will you be now?</li>
<li>Create outfits from a selection of clothing and unusual accessories to unlock different story options</li>
<li>Fall in love with a cast of diverse Londoners, each with their own secrets</li>
<li>Matchmake among your friends, or seek love for yourself (by any definition you like)</li>
<li>Write love stories in a delightful minigame, and use them to impress the new Masters</li>
<li>Pick up odd jobs to earn money and gather resources. How are you at rat catching?</li>
<li>Solve the first murder since the Fall, with the assistance of the victim</li>
<li>Discover cosy, mysterious and magnificent locations in a dark and delicious version of Victorian London</li>
<li>Seek deeper and deeper secrets over multiple playthroughs</li>
</ul>

      <title>Survival city-building game Synergy certainly looks different</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A city-builder not quite like the others it seems. Synergy from Leikir Studio and Goblinz Publishing has a pretty great pastel colour style to it. This is a survival game too, not just a standard city-builder. One I apparently missed that was announced during the PC Gaming Show.</p>
<p>"Humans live on a hostile planet. To ensure their survival, they must learn to survive in extreme weather conditions and in an environment that is not conducive to their development. Careful and pragmatic management of resources has become essential to the survival of human race, as has the morale of the population."</p>
<p>You can see the original reveal trailer below:</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Manage weather, seasons, extreme conditions and natural disasters.</li>
<li>Build a city with the happiness of its inhabitants as its main goal.</li>
<li>Explore and analyze their world in order to adapt the evolution of their city.</li>
<li>Respect the physical and mental needs of the inhabitants.</li>
<li>Live in harmony with fauna and flora.</li>
<li>Make short or long-term choices.</li>
<li>Play different scenarios to enjoy various experiences.</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>No word on an actual release date yet but it should be coming with Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Roller skates, guns and slick tricks — Rollerdrome is awesome</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rollerdrome is a thoroughly odd blending of mechanics and style found in the likes of Tony Hawk Pro Skater, a little Jet Set Radio and Max Payne. This is easily one of my biggest surprises so far this year. Runs great on Linux with Proton and Steam Deck Playable.</p>
<p>Note: key provided by the publisher Private Division.</p>
<p>A game all about style, with combat thrown in. There's no filler here and no crazy unlock systems. Just you, some skates and some guns. This is a single-player third person shooter that has you skate around, take down enemies and do some pretty cool tricks to get your ammo back up. I've been pretty amazed at how ridiculously fluid the skating is in this game and yet somehow it's also a pretty good shooter too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vwwK7gmxQ-8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/10dd9b70e685d0faa5527ebcd83412f9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vwwK7gmxQ-8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's plenty to love about this game. While it's fast-paced it gives you plenty of wiggle room to be rubbish. Not only does it have an element of auto-aim so you don't need pin-point accuracy but there's also a Max Payne style bullet-time to make it that much easier on you. It will still make your fingers and thumbs ache though but it's a whole lot of fun. The point isn't just the shooting though, it's about looking ridiculously cool while doing it and that's largely the focus of it. Perfecting dodging, shooting while grinding, grinding along a wall, spinning in the air while taking out a sniper — it wants you to look awesome.</p>
<p>It is a sport after all, the whole idea of the setting in Rollerdrome is that this is a blood sport in a world where corporations rule and they keep the masses distracted with ridiculous things like this. Sounds almost like real-life.</p>
<p>Another point to like about it is that each mission has various challenges for completionists and high-score chasers. However, even that was done to a point where it's accessible and not overly difficult. You can re-run levels any time you want and completing a challenge doesn't need you to actually win the level again. You can jump into a level, complete a challenge in thirty seconds and die and it keeps that you've done it. I really like this. Something extra to work towards without being annoying about it. Makes me want to come back for more and not need to put it down and take a frustration break.</p>
<p>That's only briefly touching on the gameplay feel. The rest of it is brilliant too from the musical score to the art style. The soundtrack is suitable dystopian sounding like it's out of a futuristic movie and the art is stylized without looking cheap, it all comes together very nicely.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A third person action shooter like no other – an original hybrid shooter-skater that blends high octane, visceral combat with fluid movement and tricking mechanics into one complementary and challenging whole.</li>
<li>A test of skill – Take on a unique challenge throughout the Rollerdrome tournament. Establish your dominance in the field with online leaderboards and push yourself to the limit with the unlockable "Out For Blood" mode for the most extreme test of skill and agility.</li>
<li>An original identity – An all-new fully original soundtrack that merges iconic era sounds and tones with cutting edge production to provide a heart-thumping backdrop to the carnage, brought to life with a unique comic-book inspired art style.</li>
<li>A dark conspiracy – Discover a mysterious, sinister plot in this distinct retrofuture universe.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Tactical battler Tyrant&#39;s Blessing is out now with Linux support and Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Did you enjoy Into the Breach and other similar small-scale strategy games? Tactical battler Tyrant's Blessing has released along with Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified. Swapping out mechs for fantasy, Tyrant's Blessing has a really sweet style to it that instantly draws your attention.</p>
<p>Tyrant's Blessing is a tactical turn-based game where your ability to plan, adapt, and strategize is more important than min-maxing your units or finding the sharpest sword in the hoard. Select battles every day, make challenging choices, and cleverly use the strengths of these rag-tag insurgents to defeat the undead hordes and maybe - just maybe - bring real life back to Tyberia.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="p0dKsW5BpbI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2902263c629d02b2c5bf8d1542f593c8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/p0dKsW5BpbI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>TURN-BASED TACTICAL PLAY - Satisfying turn-based tactical play on small maps – every decision counts!</li>
<li>DIFFERENT BIOMES - Multiple different biomes –desert, forest, frozen wilderness and more– with their own obstacles and hazards</li>
<li>20 UNLOCKABLE HEROES - Start your journey with any of 20 unlockable heroes.</li>
<li>NOTHING IS LEFT TO CHANCE - In a system inspired by Into the Breach, your enemy’s next move is always displayed in advance.</li>
<li>DARK BLESSING - Any living unit who falls in battle becomes a conscript of the Dead Army, including your own heroes!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Funded thanks to people on Kickstarter, it's nice to see another game hit all the goals.</p>
<p>While it's always going to be hard for a game to reach the heights of something like Into the Breach, which really is amazing, I think that Tyrant's Blessing has done an impressive job. It looks fantastic. Seriously, the pixel-art that went into this is just gorgeous.</p>
<p>Much like Into the Breach, where you position your people is absolutely the most important thing. Not only are you often protecting map items but your heroes all have their own unique attack angle so they need to be in the right place. Not only is your positioning important to take enemies down, but you also need to think about what you do after you take them down, as enemies can be resurrected which adds another layer to the tactical battles.</p>
<p>I've been really enjoying this one and I think you will too.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/tyrants-blessing?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1520760/Tyrants_Blessing/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Roadwarden is going to be a unique text adventure worth your time</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Roadwarden is an illustrated text adventure that I've played the demo of a few times through its development, and it's finally getting a release. The developer has announced it release with Native Linux support on September 8.</p>
<p>I'm not usually much of a fan of text adventures, they're often a bit too retro for my tastes. Roadwarden looks and feels different though. The style, setting and writing of it is great and so is the way you progress through it. Blending together elements of high fantasy and medieval adventure and is punctuated by a distinct isometric pixel art style. Combining mechanics borrowed from RPGs, visual novels, and interactive fiction, Roadwarden tells the tale of an explorer hired by a powerful merchant guild, tasked with journeying to a mysterious peninsula to spread the guild’s influence. With over 40 hours of gameplay, dialogue choices that branch into hundreds of thousands of text lines, and progressively upgradable character abilities, Roadwarden is pretty unique.</p>

      <title>YouTube thought my Steam Deck video was &#39;harmful and dangerous&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here is your daily dose of what the heck? YouTube and the mighty algorithm decided for no apparent reason, that my Steam Deck video was "harmful and dangerous".</p>
<p>Over the last few months the GamingOnLinux YouTube channel has managed to gain around <em>triple</em> the amount of followers it once had. This is mainly due to the Steam Deck, and my decision to cover updates to it both in articles and in short concise videos (and people seem to really like the format).</p>
<p>According to YouTube though, this video was just a step too far:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="tH0fZKI4u5w"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/72c017a83ddcc7a225e6c7f9d2c383ea.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/tH0fZKI4u5w" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>An email lands in my inbox from YouTube, noting it was removed for violations against their "harmful and dangerous policy". That's right, the Steam Deck is a dangerous weapon and we should all need to carry around a license or something? Perhaps having <a href="https://twitter.com/gamingonlinux/status/1555202872765210625" target="_blank">two of them</a> and dual-wielding is just too much for YouTube.</p>
<p>Thankfully, after going through the appeals process, the video was restored.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="G-OBSvipeB8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/103aa4075dd1348a742935ae2871e8ab.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/G-OBSvipeB8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's another reminder that moderation bots are stupid and having all your eggs in one basket is not a great idea either.</p>

      <title>Witchtastic gets Steam Deck Verified after the dev made improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As time goes on, more developers are tweaking their games to improve the Steam Deck experience and Witchtastic looks like a fun co-op game to try out. What is it? Witchtastic is a 2-4 player co-op game about brewing and delivering magic potions as fast as possible. In a number of ways, the franticness and design is a lot like the Overcooked series.</p>
<p>Recently the developer published a patch that they said ensured all elements properly fit on the smaller screen, and they also adjusted the text sizes to be big enough to be clear — an issue far too many other games still haven't sorted. Thanks to their adjustments, it's also now Steam Deck Verified!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="IKRT7LnMV4Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1d2f738e3f8b667420733d57d60fab21.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/IKRT7LnMV4Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>2-4 Player Couch- &amp; Online-Coop! Brewing magical potions all alone can be difficult. Team up with your friends and work as a duo, trio or squad of swift witches. Witchtastic supports couch coop, true online multiplayer and Steam Remote Play Together! Need a break from all the yelling of your friends? You can practice in a single player campaign as well!</li>
<li>Master the art of brewing! Become a better witch by learning and mastering all kinds of potions.</li>
<li>Explore the world of Witchtastic! Travel through villages, forests, swamps, cities and snowy ruins. Experience a mysterious journey filled with challenges and dangers along the way.</li>
<li>Discover a huge variety of ingredients! Deadly nightshade, mandrakes, mushrooms and many more exciting ingredients are waiting for you.</li>
<li>Ride your broom! Use your broom to overcome obstacles, to move faster, or just because you can!</li>
<li>Collect magic gems and earn rewards! Unlock a wide variety of new outfits, headdresses and other cosmetics while progressing through the game!</li>

      <title>Dead Cells price hike in Argentina &amp; Turkey due to cross-region purchases</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Motion Twin / Evil Empire have announced that Dead Cells is increasing in price in Argentina &amp; Turkey, as it seems too many people were taking advantage of the cheaper prices from other countries.</p>
<p>This is an issue that we've seen come up before, with people working around Steam's regional pricing to access lower prices elsewhere.</p>
<p>Writing in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/588650/view/3346757662555863561" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam, the developers noted how these two countries have made up a "significant" amount of their sales over the last year but this has not come with an increase in the amount of players there. Usually, developers can see that the percentage of sales in a country matches up to the player count in that country but in this case for Argentina &amp; Turkey "their % of total sales is 3-4x the amount of the % of their total players".</p>
<p>The developer thinks that "it is extremely likely that people are changing their region to take advantage of a 70-90% reduction in price". Dead Cells is not exactly an expensive game when you look at what's available on Steam, something they touch on in the post, and it is regularly discounted too so they say "this is impacting us so heavily".</p>
<p>A sad day for people buying it legitimately in Argentina &amp; Turkey, and another issue smaller developers have to deal with.</p>
<p>What do you think to this issue? Let us know in the comments.</p>

      <title>Capes is a gritty superpowered turn-based strategy RPG from ex-Hand of Fate devs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love your superhero stuff? Keep an eye on Capes, an upcoming turn-based strategy RPG full of people with superpowers. It's being developed by Spitfire Interactive, who have risen from the ashes of Defiant Development who created the Hand of Fate series.</p>
<p>Capes is set in a world where the villains won, brutally. Two decades later, a new generation of heroes are rising up and that's where you come in. You and your little band of heroes will be going out in tactical turn-base battles rescuing people, and it all seems a little XCOM or perhaps even like the upcoming Marvel's Midnight Suns.</p>
<p>"Combine superpowers to create iconic strategies worthy of their own comic book panel, like slinging a spiky-crystal-covered powerhouse head-first into a villain’s chest. Character diversity is at the forefront of Capes throughout its modern take on classic comic tropes. Not just in powers, but in the heroes themselves to showcase a variety of ethnicities, genders, hopes, and dreams. The future is in the hands of the nascent youth as they work together to fight against the overwhelming odds of the generation before them."</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recruit new heroes, train them up, and save the city.</li>
<li>Fight across scores of different locations in turn based combat scenarios.</li>
<li>Team up with your allies to unlock unique abilities.</li>
<li>Stand against a variety of superpowered enemies.</li>
<li>Uncover the secret histories behind the heroes and villains of the piece.</li>
<li>Take your place amongst the champions in this high octane superhero drama.</li>
</ul>
<p>"I started my career writing on <em>Freedom Force</em> alongside Ken Levine, so this feels like a return to where my journey began," said Morgan Jaffit, Director of Spitfire Interactive. “My team and I want to explore the ‘darker side of every coin’ and we have the best people possible to do it.”</p>
<p>Capes arrives sometime in Q1 2023 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2081080/Capes/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Covert Critter is basically Metal Gear Solid with lizards</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sneaking out at some point, Covert Critter is an upcoming stealth action game that will have Native Linux support. It's also pretty much Metal Gear Solid with animals. No really, it looks exactly like the classic and is obviously something of a homage to it and a demo is available.</p>
<p>"You are special reptile operative Koss. With a unique array of gadgets and stealth-based abilities at your disposal, you must infiltrate the compromised GEKO Facility to disarm a slew of tyrannical terrorists known only as the Red Hawks.</p>
<p>Covert Critter is a top-down sneaking game and retro throwback to stealth titles of the mid to late 90's. As Koss, your goal is to navigate through each of the 10 unique stages, all while remaining silent and out of the enemy's sight. The Red Hawks are vigilant creatures, armed to the beak, and around every corner of the facility."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5394040311660836978gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5394040311660836978gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<ul>
<li>An engaging story of heroism, espionage, and animals. Deriving inspiration from action and spy flicks of a bygone era, Covert Critter will host short but memorable cutscenes to carry a narrative along as you complete each scenario.</li>
<li>An impressive arsenal of bitchin' gadgets. Deployable boomboxes, mystery gift boxes, recon drones, and more are scattered throughout the stages. Each one you find is an invaluable asset for any situation while in the field.</li>
<li>Put your best stealth and evasion skills to the test. Your application of speed, luck, and wits are all graded for a combined rank. Circumvent traps, remain swift, avoid enemy contact, and you may just be rewarded something for future scenarios.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the full version of the game they plan to add in controller support, an expanded story, accessibility options and more. The full game release is planned for next year, with an updated demo appearing at some point.</p>
<p>Just couldn't resist giving this one a quick go. Note that the Linux demo worked fine on my desktop, but on Steam Deck the UI did not render correctly. Could be a problem in Unity or a bug in the AMD GPU driver on Steam Deck so there you have to use the Windows version with Proton. Here's some footage from the demo:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FMWxMAd_NJQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ee01b5d0807aa7bda31439862a7bc992.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FMWxMAd_NJQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can follow it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2111370/Covert_Critter/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and try an older demo on <a href="https://sodaraptor.itch.io/covert-critter" target="_blank">itch.io</a>.</p>

      <title>Embracer Group to swallow up Tripwire, Tuxedo Labs, The Lord of the Rings</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Embracer Group are quite terrifying. The amount of power they have in the gaming industry is simply insane and now they're swallowing up more studios and even the full rights to The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit.</p>
<p>Announced across multiple <a href="https://embracer.com/investors/press-releases/" target="_blank">press releases</a> today they've put out their intention to acquire:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limited Run Games - who make physical releases for collectors. This deal will also include something called "Carbon Engine", which is a tech they developed "that allows legacy content and retro games to be effortlessly put out in highly accurate, emulation-based ports for modern platforms".</li>
<li>Singtrix - an award-winning creator of industry leading vocal processing effects technology for karaoke, gaming, and entertainment.</li>
<li>Middle-earth Enterprises - so they will own the full worldwide rights to The Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Hobbit and other Middle-earth-related works across motion pictures, video games, board games, merchandising, theme parks and stage productions. So they won't own the actual literary works, just the IP rights to do basically anything with them.</li>
<li>Tuxedo Labs - they made the pretty awesome game Teardown.</li>
<li>Tripwire Interactive - developed the Killing Floor and Rising Storm games.</li>
</ul>
<p>How long before Embracer Group buy up the rest of the internet? I'm expecting a knock on the door soon, kidding of course.</p>

      <title>SteamOS 3.4 Beta to update the Arch Linux base, new Steam Deck updates out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has announced three things recently including multiple updates that are out now for the Steam Deck, plus a quick tease of what's to come for a Beta of SteamOS 3.4.</p>
<p>Firstly, a new SteamOS update is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3376031059788513870" target="_blank">out now</a> in the Stable and Beta channels that pulls these changes over from Preview:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Temporarily reverted RDR2 VRAM workaround to pre-3.3 behavior</li>
<li>Fixed an issue causing random 0.2s stutter</li>
<li>Fixed an issue causing performance drops when a UI element appeared on screen if the performance HUD was enabled.</li>
<li>Improved performance for Forza Horizon 5</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's also a Steam Deck Client Beta update <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3376031059787746651" target="_blank">out now</a> for those in the Beta and Preview update channels with these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="bbcodes_Header3_KePJs BB_Header3 eventbbcodeparser_Header3_AX80F"><strong>Steam Input</strong></div>
<ul>
<li>Allow users to remove community layouts that they've created. Users who have this config selected won't lose it, but it will no longer be listed in the community layouts.</li>
<li>Removed a check which would only show your layouts in your personal layouts, even when shared with the community - this was causing users to think their configuration has not been exported.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug on saving configurations where the controller type could attempt to use a cached valued which was incorrect, causing the layout controller type to appear to be incorrect.</li>
<li>Changed the OSK chord to be on button release instead of press to resolve some issues with focus on the desktop window.</li>
<li>Added Shared Layout preview of layouts which shows a layout and allows it to be optionally assigned. If the user clicks on a steam url link to a config (via chat for example) while in Game Mode, this will be shown.</li>
<li>Added support for Nintendo Joy-Cons</li>
<li>Improved FlickStick mode</li>
</ul>
<div class="bbcodes_Header3_KePJs BB_Header3 eventbbcodeparser_Header3_AX80F"><strong>Other</strong></div>
<ul>
<li>Added Discovery Queue to Home screen under the Recommended tab</li>
<li>No longer showing a Steam Cloud sync error notification when installing a game</li>
<li>Fixed issue where a 2.9GB read-only library is displayed when the microSD card is unmounted manually</li>
<li>Added game resolution setting to non-Steam app properties</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>On top of that and perhaps even more exciting, is that a Beta version of SteamOS 3.4 is on the way. Confirmed on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1560015983317696514" target="_blank">Twitter</a> by Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais, who mentioned it's being worked on right now and it will "contain an update to the Arch base". SteamOS basically uses a snapshot of Arch Linux, along with tweaks and changes that Valve do, so with SteamOS 3.4 we're likely to see an updated Linux kernel, updated KDE Plasma for desktop mode and a whole lot more updated software.</p>

      <title>Spellbook Demonslayers is the most insane Vampire Survivors-like yet</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You've put 100+ hours into Vampire Survivors and now what? Spellbook Demonslayers is what and there's a free prologue available for you to try out.</p>
<p>For those confused who haven't played anything like it: it's pretty much a reverse bullet-hell with <em>you</em> firing off tons of abilities automatically against tons of waves of enemies. You pick up gems from fallen enemies to level up and pick new skills and upgrades. Boss enemies also drop chests, which you can pick up for ability upgrades too.</p>
<p>It's been creeping up the popular list on Steam, since it's free and Vampire Survivors and anything like it is the current hot indie trend. Easy to see why they're popular though, since half the time you can turn off your brain and all games like it cost next to nothing. Spellbook Demonslayers mixes things up with some wonderful metal tunes, some really great enemy design that feels a lot more alive than others I've played and plenty of meta-progression too.</p>
<p>Here's my footage:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yz4dZTKcYEY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ee12cbe3e34aa30c9910ee1bed1b13c8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yz4dZTKcYEY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With the full release the developer has plans to have many more characters, maps, difficulty options, enemies, bosses, a bigger permanent upgrade system and the list goes on.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2070390/Spellbook_Demonslayers_Prologue/" target="_blank">free prologue on Steam</a>. Works out of the box on Linux and Steam Deck with Proton.</p>

      <title>Blossom Tales 2: The Minotaur Prince out with Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Blossom Tales 2: The Minotaur Prince is a new Native Linux release from Castle Pixel and Playtonic Friends. It hasn't been Steam Deck Verified yet but works great. This is yet another title that developer <a href="https://twitter.com/flibitijibibo" target="_blank">Ethan Lee</a> helped to bring to Linux (like the recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/axiom-verge-2-lands-on-steam-with-linux-support-and-steam-deck-verified/" target="_blank">Axiom Verge 2</a>), with it powered by <a href="https://fna-xna.github.io/" target="_blank">FNA</a> so you can expect a quality port.</p>
<p>A classic and very colourful action-adventure, following on from the 2017 indie hit. However, you don't need to know anything from the first game as it's fully standalone and set hundreds of years later.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="gCYDZ9FhQUY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2a40819319b468d33dfd37896d927b1d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/gCYDZ9FhQUY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Minotaur King has returned...and it's all your fault! Lily's back for a new "classic" action-adventure set hundreds of years after The Sleeping King!</p>
<p>Grandpa's latest tale takes you on a journey through haunted forests, pirate shores, and other mysterious lands across a vast open-world! Charming towns, terrible enemies, tricky puzzles, and powerful weapons await you.</p>
<p>Enjoy a "story within a story" as Grandpa narrates exciting moments throughout Lily's incredible adventure.<br/>
Will you help Lily defeat the Minotaur King and save her brother?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Compelling main story plus engaging side-quests</li>
<li>Classic top-down action-adventure in a retro 2d environment</li>
<li>Dozens of mini-dungeons, caves, and locations to discover</li>
<li>Choices that influence story and events</li>
<li>A wide array of weapons and abilities</li>
<li>15+ hours of gameplay</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The game works great on Steam Deck and will no doubt get a Verified rating whenever Valve get to it. Here's some footage from my Steam Deck:</p>

      <title>Fun games for Steam Deck that won&#39;t break the bank</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Looking for some games to play on Steam Deck that are good, work well and don't cost too much? Here's a few choice picks from me to you.</p>
<p>While there's a number of game lists and videos from various websites and creators, a lot only seem to focus on the top "best" games. Usually, they're made up of the latest AA / AAA. As always, I like to be different. So going over my Steam library and picking out some absolute gems, here's some suggestions with a nice varied mix. All tested directly by me.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="--VmLCYSD_0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/56c0ce8462fdc2dbd8e70a46cb5bd014.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/--VmLCYSD_0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The games mentioned and shown are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/881100/Noita/" target="_blank">Noita </a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/736260/Baba_Is_You/" target="_blank">Baba Is You</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/548430/Deep_Rock_Galactic/" target="_blank">Deep Rock Galactic</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/656350/UnderMine/" target="_blank">UnderMine </a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/302710/BlazeRush/" target="_blank">Blaze Rush</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/384590/Polychromatic/" target="_blank">Polychromatic </a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/29180/Osmos/" target="_blank">Osmos</a> (no controller support but works fine)</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll be repeatedly going over my own Steam library to pick out various games both new and old for you to check out. What games have you found to be reasonably cheap and perhaps a little unknown that work great?</p>

      <title>Airships: Conquer the Skies gets co-op and direct ship control</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Airships: Conquer the Skies is a wonderful Native Linux indie game about constructing various vehicles and conquering everything you can with them.</p>
<p>This isn't a simplistic game of just snapping blocks together either. There's a big array of different modules, weapons, armour types, equipment and more to build your perfect craft. Plenty of detail in them too with sailors you see running around doing their little tasks. Honestly it's great.</p>
<p>With the new update out you can now play in co-op with any number of players and / or AIs on each side, with custom multiplayer battles as well. The game also is no longer 100% pure destruction, with a diplomacy system in so you can form all sorts of deals with others. Even the civilization side of it is now has more depth to it with city upgrades and new buildings. One feature that also wasn't known about before is a way to now directly control craft, which sounds pretty fun.</p>
<p>Showing off the new direct control feature, the developer put up a little video on it as it was a secret:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="r94P1LZ8fYI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a85b90eb260792d22cd61a863f654f84.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/r94P1LZ8fYI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A bunch of other features were also added in this update including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Eight new music tracks by renowned musician Curtis Schweitzer.</li>
<li>Unrest and supply mechanics.</li>
<li>Revamped espionage system.</li>
<li>Optional combat autoresolve.</li>
<li>Prettier map.</li>
<li>New fleet designs contributed by the community.</li>
<li>Reactive hint system for conquest.</li>
<li>Many more achievements.</li>
<li>Updated user interface appearance.</li>
<li>Ability to request siege assistance from your allies.</li>
<li>New weather and landscape including deserts.</li>
<li>New technologies and modules.</li>
<li>All translations should be up to date, for once.</li>
<li>In-game manual (English only).</li>
<li>Local defense budgets.</li>
<li>New heraldic charges and abilities.</li>
<li>Tooltip values now describe what influences them.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The dev mentioned this update concludes development of the game, as they move over to bug fixes. However, sounds like a DLC expansion is likely to come to expand it.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck gets a Stable Client update with Offline Mode fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Not long after a bunch of changes rolled out to Preview and Beta, Valve has updated the Steam Deck Client software with various improvements. These are all changes I've covered just recently in other articles.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3401926123937490701" target="_blank">changelog</a> is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Offline Mode Fixes</strong><br/>
We're continuing to look at making the user experience of playing games without an Internet connection a better, more intuitive experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue where rebooting while in Steam Offline Mode would cause games to fail to launch</li>
<li>Fixed the Cloud Sync error notification popping up when offline</li>
<li>Disabled Steam Offline Mode button when not connected to the internet, as trying to do this currently gets Steam Deck into a bad state.
	<ul>
<li>This change disables this button but does not in any way affect your ability to play games without an active Internet connection.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Keyboard</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed styling for CJK keyboard glyphs so everything appears centered correctly on keys</li>
<li>Fixed Recommended Layout not always showing up for the author of controller configuration</li>
<li>Fixed CJK font issues in SteamOS updater when running on Steam Deck</li>
<li>Fixed focus issue when tapping the show/hide password button</li>
<li>Removed the gap between keys on the virtual keyboard for improved typing</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Temporarily disabling hot / cold temperature notifications while we address issues with false positives</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As I mentioned <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/valve-improves-steam-deck-offline-mode/" target="_blank">in the last article</a> about the Offline Mode changes: the problem of course is that Steam is an online store, and until now they haven't really needed to do all that much with offline mode since they largely assumed people were always online. With the Steam Deck though, that's not the case, it's a handheld designed to be taken with you so it's another older area of Steam to need some effort.</p>
<p>Even so, it's actually a little bit surprising that Offline Mode wasn't improved a lot before the Steam Deck released, it's a bit of an odd one for Valve not to focus on previously considering it is a handheld but they're starting to make up for it now.</p>

      <title>Valve dev understandably not happy about glibc breaking Easy Anti-Cheat on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/easy-anti-cheat-not-working-on-linux-seems-a-glibc-update-broke-it/" target="_blank">Recently it was noticed</a> that users on more bleeding-edge Linux distributions that updated saw Easy Anti-Cheat no longer working on Linux, the culprit was glibc and now a Valve developer has spoken out about it.</p>
<p>Writing in a small thread on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1559683905904463873" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunate that upstream glibc discussion on DT_HASH isn't coming out strongly in favor of prioritizing compatibility with pre-existing applications. Every such instance contributes to damaging the idea of desktop Linux as a viable target for third-party developers.</p>
<p>Our thoughts on the topic from this prior compatibility issue in BlueZ apply more than ever: <a href="https://github.com/bluez/bluez/commit/35a2c50437cca4d26ac6537ce3a964bb509c9b62#commitcomment-56028543" target="_blank">https://github.com/bluez/bluez/commit/35a2c50437cca4d26ac6537ce3a964bb509c9b62#commitcomment-56028543</a><br/>
It is unfortunately yet another entry in a growing list over the years.</p>
<p>We understand that working with a focus on compatibility requires more resources and more engineering trade-offs, but strongly believe it is nonetheless the way to go. We are very interested in helping with any underlying resource constraints.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This prompted CodeWeavers (who work on Wine and with Valve on Proton) developer Arek Hiler to write a blog post titled "<a href="https://blog.hiler.eu/win32-the-only-stable-abi/" target="_blank">Win32 Is The Only Stable ABI on Linux</a>" and their ending statement is something people should think on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think this whole situation shows why creating native games for Linux is challenging. It’s hard to blame developers for targeting Windows and relying on Wine + friends. It’s just much more stable and much less likely to break and stay broken.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hiler certainly isn't the only one to think like that, with another CodeWeavers developer Andrew Eikum <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22922774" target="_blank">mentioning</a> on Hacker News some time ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a long-time Linux dev (see my profile), I have also found this to be true. Linux userland APIs are unstable and change all the time. Some transitions that come to mind that have affected me personally: ALSA-&gt;pulse; libudev-&gt;libudev2-&gt;systemd; gstreamer 0.10-&gt;1.0. All of those changes required modifications to my software, and the backwards-compat tools that are provided are buggy and insufficient. Meanwhile, you can still write and run winmm[1] applications on Windows 10, and they will work in almost all cases. It's simply the case that the win32 API is more stable than Linux userland APIs, so it's entirely plausible that games will run better in Wine, which shares that stable ABI, than they will on Linux, especially as time goes on and Linux userland shifts yet again.</p>
<p>[1] winmm dates to the Windows 3.x days!</p>

<p>Situations like this can be pretty messy and this is not a case of open source versus secret closed source anti-cheat stuff either, since the glibc issue affected a Native Linux game (Shovel Knight) and Linux software libstrangle. No doubt there are other things yet to be discovered that were broken by the change.</p>
<p>It is of course also a case that Linux distributions need to ensure they do quality assurance testing, especially for gaming which can end up showing up issues quite easily and that bleeding-edge distributions can and clearly do end up breaking things by pulling new software in so quickly.</p>
