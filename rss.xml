      <title>OpenRCT2 the re-implementation of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 upgraded</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>More goodies have arrived for <a href="https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2" target="_blank">OpenRCT2</a> the open source re-implementation of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2. Although it's fully playable already, the developers of this FOSS project continue to improve it a lot. This is another project that helps to keep a real classic game alive on modern systems, while also continually improving various features to make it feel just that little bit more modern.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16287382281657102302gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Some of the new additions in version 0.4.1 released on July 4th include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Alpine Coaster track type.</li>
<li>Option to show ride vehicles as separate entries when selecting a ride to construct.</li>
<li>FLAC and OGG/vorbis as supported audio formats for ride music objects.</li>
<li>Add vehicles for the Hybrid Coaster, Single-Rail Roller Coaster and Classic Mini Roller Coaster.</li>
<li>More natural looking shorelines in map generator.</li>
<li>Parks can now be resized into rectangular shapes from the map and map generation windows.</li>
<li>Tree placement is more natural during map generation.</li>
<li>The maximum price for the park entry has been raised to £999.</li>
<li>Weather no longer resets when converting a save to scenario.</li>
<li>Music Style dropdown is now sorted by name.</li>
<li>Transparency can be enabled directly without needing see-through enabled first.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus around 37 bug fixes were noted to make the game much more stable overall.</p>
<p>You need the data files to play it so buy a copy from <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/rollercoaster_tycoon_2?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/285330/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_2_Triple_Thrill_Pack/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Getting it running on Linux is nice and simple too since they offer an official AppImage and there's also a Flatpak available via <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.openrct2.OpenRCT2" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.</p>

      <title>The Forgotten World free update out for Monster Sanctuary</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The creature battling metroidvania Monster Sanctuary has an expansive new free update out with The Forgotten World which is the largest update to the game yet. Adding in a new area, skills, items, new game modes and much more.</p>
<p>About it: "Delve deep into the Metroidvania inspired world of Monster Sanctuary, explore the expansive lands and call upon your monsters to lend their aid in and out of combat! Use their unique skills to fly, ride and brute force your way through environmental puzzles and precise platforming! The world is yours to traverse as you see fit, are you ready to take on the Sanctuary?"</p>
<p>Instead of The Forgotten World being a DLC, they decided to release it free to avoid any separation of the online PvP mode (optional) between people who have it and don't. Seems like a sane idea and gives everyone a bigger and better game. They've also added a "tip jar" on the <a href="https://monster-sanctuary.com/" target="_blank">official site</a> for anyone to donate if they want to support the developer thanks to the free upgrade.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="H2e_Vw-ru3U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a4354343c787cb397a973a34423efbb6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/H2e_Vw-ru3U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Here's the full highlights of what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A new area, larger than any other area of Monster Sanctuary. Forgotten World is meant to be explored in the late game - either before you step foot in the Abandoned Tower, or after you finished the main story. You can find the entrance in the lower area of Horizon Beach. You will need a certain late-game exploration ability to enter this area.</li>
<li>Ten new Monsters.</li>
<li>Nine of them can be found in the Forgotten World. One of the ten new Monsters is a new secret Champion in Blue Cave - which might help you enter the Forgotten World earlier.</li>
<li>New Monster type: Ancient.</li>
<li>Many of the new Monsters have this type. There are also some older Monsters that have gained this type.</li>
<li>Level cap raised to 42 from 40.</li>
<li>All skill trees in the game have gained some new skill nodes. In some cases, we made extensive changes to older Monsters' skill trees.</li>
<li>A lot of new weapons and accessories.</li>
<li>Two new player costumes.</li>
<li>Some new rooms and treasure chests have been added to older areas of the game as well.</li>
<li>Some new exploration abilities have been added to the game as well. Some of the exploration abilities of older Monsters have been updated.</li>
<li>On top of three new Champion fights, there is a new super-secret Champion fight that can only be found by Keeper Masters. It is the most difficult fight in the game.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to buy Monster Sanctuary you can do so on the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/monster-sanctuary?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/814370/Monster_Sanctuary/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>winesapOS is another way to get something like SteamOS on desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Valve has still yet to produce an official installable image of SteamOS 3 for desktops, as always the community provides and another worth looking into is <a href="https://github.com/LukeShortCloud/winesapOS" target="_blank">winesapOS</a>. Another <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/holoiso-brings-valves-steamos-3-from-the-steam-deck-to-everyone/" target="_blank">I covered is HoloISO</a>, which tries to stick quite closely to SteamOS 3 but winesapOS aims to be a bit more than that.</p>
<p>Originally called the "Mac Linux Gaming Stick", the aim was to give macOS users an easy bootable disk to run Linux to get expanded game compatibility but it rebranded a while ago to expand the scope for many more users.</p>
<p>From what one of the developers told me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our ultimate goal is not to provide the exact SteamOS experience that the Steam Deck provides like HoloISO does. We are focused on the desktop experience and expanding support for SteamOS by making the operating system work on a wide range of hardware.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In keeping with that goal, they have expanded hardware support on desktops / laptops and of course Apple Mac systems too. They also have much more up to date software compared with SteamOS, it supports UEFI and legacy BIOS, encrypted filesystem support, has the Pamac application for installing / updating other software and comes pre-installed with plenty of software like Steam, Heroic Games Launcher, Lutris, and PolyMC while still keeping the look and feel similar to SteamOS 3.</p>
<p>A big new release with version 3.1.0 went up recently with these highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arch Linux packages upgrades</li>
<li>Graphics driver upgrades with support for Intel, NVIDIA and virtual machines</li>
<li>Improved controller support</li>
<li>An improved upgrade procedure</li>
<li>A fork for the PlayStation 4</li>
</ul>
<p>You can check out <a href="https://github.com/LukeShortCloud/winesapOS" target="_blank">winesapOS on GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>Organ swapping FPS &#39;Wrought Flesh&#39; gets a huge free update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wrought Flesh is a game where you run around and pinch the organs of downed enemies to upgrade your body. It's pretty weird and a big content update is out now.</p>
<p>"Rip out enemies organs and equip them in your own body. Fight biopunk monsters and drugged-up space bandits. You are a Gajeshian Cultist: A near-mythological being built from the bodies of long-dead saints. You have arrived on the partially terraformed planet of Chrisembourgh on a temple-ordained mission to find and kill someone. Explore the planet and trace your victims steps to the end."</p>
<p>The 'Purple Sands of Cumulun' update adds in a reworked oasis area, tons of new quests, new guns, new music, a new monster, reworked AI, new achievements and they had "an actual writer" rework the text too. Seems like a lot of work went into this update.</p>

      <title>Don&#39;t Starve Together big Curse of Moon Quay update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Curse of Moon Quay is the latest major update for the Native Linux survival game Don't Starve Together and it sounds like a great one. They also updated it with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/klei-fixes-up-dont-starve-together-for-steam-deck-support/" target="_blank">Steam Deck support</a> recently too!</p>
<p>Easily one of the best survival games you can play on a Linux desktop or Steam Deck, as it's just such a fun game and the style of it is simply magnificent. One of the greatest games Klei has made for sure, but then I like pretty much anything Klei make.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="eligdVVedDU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/813cba69f1fea5e25f29441b43ffe0c2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/eligdVVedDU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>New features includes:</p>
<div class="bbcodes_ExpandSectionBody_2sCNL">
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New Moon Quay Island and inhabitants.</li>
<li>Ocean Privateers.</li>
<li>New upgrades for boating:
	<ul>
<li>Grass Boat</li>
<li>Kelp Bumper</li>
<li>Shell Bumper</li>
<li>Cannon and Cannonballs</li>
<li>Rudder</li>
<li>Trawler</li>
<li>Polly Roger's Hat</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Docks</li>
<li>Nautopilot and Nautopilot Beacon</li>
<li>New perspectives on life.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>On top of the new content, they also tweaked some existing features like making map controls and zooming much more intuitive and just make more sense. Zooming for example now focuses on the cursor for the map and will be smoother, rotating the map will also be done around the current location and not the player and controllers will see a better directional panning experience.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/322330/Dont_Starve_Together/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a> where it's 66% off for the 2022 Summer Sale. Absolutely worth getting.</p>

      <title>Quirky murder mystery adventure Lord Winklebottom Investigates releases July 28th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lord Winklebottom Investigates is an upcoming adventure from UK-based developer Cave Monsters, and they've recently confirmed it will release on July 28th. This game will be coming along with full Native Linux support too.</p>
<p>Taking inspiration from British literature icons such as Agatha Christie and Sherlock Holmes, Lord Winklebottom and his tea-drinking hippo companion Dr. Frumple will enjoy a journey full of intrigue and secrets that will apparently keep mystery fans gripped. The developer said it's a game with plenty of heart, featuring a script and setting full of bizarre characters and humour that wouldn’t be out of place in a Monty Python or Blackadder sketch.</p>

<p>Funded thanks to a Kickstarter campaign it's set in the 1920s where the world’s foremost detective is about to embark on his most challenging case yet. Set on an isolated island where there's a grisly murder, it's a race against time to track down the killer.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Full English voice acting.</li>
<li>An original 1920s inspired soundtrack featuring live instruments.</li>
<li>Play as a gentleman giraffe!</li>
<li>Unique 2D hand painted artwork.</li>
<li>Animals of all shapes and sizes!</li>
<li>Streamlined point and click interface.</li>
<li>Collection of bizarre characters to interrogate!</li>
<li>Dozens of puzzles to solve!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Feartress is a new incremental city-building RPG in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Feartress is a bit of a quirky one. Blending together elements of an idle RPG with some small city-building that sees you go through different dimensions. I'm really not sure on the best way to describe this one, it's just odd but it has a pretty nice idea to play through.</p>
<p>"A new take on the genre of incremental games where you go on a journey to collect all the 21 elemental pearls and restore balance to the universe. You build up a settlement in each world and destroy enemy structures to find loot and unlock new perks. Collect epic and legendary gear to help you venture into new worlds with increasingly powerful enemies."</p>

      <title>Worthy of Better, Stronger Together for Reproductive Rights bundle live on itch.io</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A second bundle (yes there's two) supporting people in the USA following the overturning of Roe v. Wade is live on itch.io with the <a href="https://itch.io/b/1471/worthy-of-better-stronger-together-for-reproductive-rights" target="_blank">Worthy of Better, Stronger Together for Reproductive Rights bundle</a>. The other is the Indie Bundle for Abortion Funds covered <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/itchio-are-hosting-a-big-indie-bundle-for-abortion-funds/" target="_blank">in a previous article</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>June 24th, 2022 was a harrowing day for civil liberties. In the United States, basic human rights are being stripped away. It is a stark reminder that even after 50 years of legal protection, equality can be so easily lost. To say nothing of the dangerous precedent this decision sets for other civil rights protections, we believe that the right for a person to pursue safe and legal abortions is more than enough reason to stand up and take action. This decision does not only effect those capable of becoming pregnant. It is a determination of what rights we as a society choose to hold sacred. It is a question of  who is deemed worthy of protecting. The fabric of our society is woven by every single member, to erode a single thread unravels us all. We must all take a stand and demand that our rights and bodily autonomy are federally recognized</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a charity bundle as well with all proceeds being split between these two charities:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://now.org/" target="_blank">National Organization for Women</a></li>
<li><a href="https://reproductiverights.org/about-us/" target="_blank">Center for Reproductive Rights</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can pay $10 (or more) to support it and gain access to 169 different items spread across games, tools and more including some gems like:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Away Team</li>
<li>Aground</li>
<li>Not Actually A DOS Game</li>
<li>Sally Face</li>
</ul>
<p>The bundle is up for the next 11 days.</p>

      <title>Desktopia is a city-builder that runs along the bottom of your desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Desktopia: A Desktop Village Simulator seems like quite a unique idea for a city-builder, also a fun distraction to have open on your desktop. Instead of giving you a big full-screen window, the game sits along the bottom of your screen allowing you to carry on with whatever you're doing while also keeping an eye on your little people.</p>
<p>"Like any city-builder, you get to make the big decisions, while also being able to take control of your own sword wielding character. You can join in the battles, harvest resources, put out fires, or interact with your villagers. In Desktopia, you can be as active, or as idle, as you want!"</p>
<p>You can see the initial trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cGCWSWy4Jnk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a6b5806ae2efc9f04fc8548642c6cf9a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cGCWSWy4Jnk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Also, as a basic demo of how it would work on your actual desktop, they have a video on that too:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uw7sz1pA9Ys"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/460346435f22a746d343f4fd4924c8c6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uw7sz1pA9Ys" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A completely original approach in PC gaming: designed with functionality in mind, Desktopia allows you to use your PC for multiple purposes on a single monitor.</li>
<li>Clever UI: with resizeable pop-out windows which can be arranged anywhere on your screen.</li>
<li>A playable character which levels with your village, so you can jump into the action whenever you want.</li>
<li>Detailed logs and statistics arrayed in beautiful charts and graphs.</li>
<li>Spy Mode: focus the camera on any villager, any time, and watch as they live their life.</li>
<li>Resizeable game world, with the option to have it 'always on top' of other windows.</li>
<li>From nothing: grow a series of villages along a dangerous and treacherous road: from a single house to a bustling metropolis.</li>
<li>Construct a range of facilities (inns, libraries, post offices, temples, blacksmiths etc) and watch villagers move in independently.</li>
<li>Keep your villagers happy to collect gratitude, and use it to host festivals which bedeck your village in bunting!</li>
<li>Recruit and upgrade soldiers to defend your village from undead, bandits, fairies, and demons. Join them in battle if that's your thing!</li>
<li>Hire heroes to lead the charge against your foes and destroy their strongholds.</li>
<li>Decide on building low-tech villages with few needs, or risk it big by aiming for high-tech villages with needy villagers.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Denuvo announced Denuvo SecureDLC to protect DLC</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Denuvo is not exactly something any gamer I've ever seen be happy about and now it's growing and will likely appear in more games, with the announcement of Denuvo SecureDLC.</p>
<p>Irdeto said in the <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/06/30/2471835/0/en/Denuvo-by-Irdeto-launches-Denuvo-SecureDLC-the-industry-s-first-solution-to-protect-downloadable-content-against-piracy.html" target="_blank">press release</a> it's "the first of its kind in the gaming market and provides opportunities to extend the revenue tail for developers and publishers past the initial launch window".</p>
<p>The main target here appears to be free to play games that offer up DLC and micro-transactions to unlock various features, cosmetics and so on with SecureDLC being positioned to protect against piracy there. So Irdeto are hoping that developers will pick SecureDLC to deal with it apparently becoming "easy to bypass the existing barriers that try to secure DLCs on popular gaming platforms like Steam and Epic" as they found "players can automatically generate and install programs that access downloadable content without paying for it".</p>
<p>According to Reinhard Blaukovitsch, Managing Director at Denuvo by Irdeto, the new technology is already being successfully used with the current Denuvo Anti-Tamper clients: “Denuvo has become a one-stop shop for game developers to ensure the safety of their game against cheating, tampering, and piracy and to protect the gaming experience. Our current clients, big and small, are ecstatic with the results and we are happy to help them maximize revenue and also enable new business models for these games they spent so much effort building.”</p>

      <title>Play as a sarcastic cow in the comedy adventure A Trail of Ooze </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A Trail of Ooze is an upcoming comedy adventure where you take on the role of a sarcastic cow who attempts to find their missing human farmer. It honestly sounds quite hilarious and the story sounds like something that I feel I need to play through.</p>
<p>"Majros, the cow, lives on a small farm in the middle of the Swedish forests oblivious to the struggles of the outside world - until genetically engineered chemicals spread across the farm. All animals and plants mutate and gain human-like consciousness and the farmer, who witnessed it all, is kidnapped by agents from the evil agrochemical corporation. So, Majros sets out on a rescue mission following a trail of the chemical ooze. On her adventure she unravels conspiracies, battles social injustices and comes face to face with environmental disaster. Forced to leave her safe bubble, Majros learns that no cow or story is only black and white and that she cannot make it alone against the insidious corporation."</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the recent overturning of Roe v. Wade in the USA that threatens to remove access to abortions a bunch of indie developers have pulled together to make an <a href="https://itch.io/b/1472/indie-bundle-for-abortion-funds" target="_blank">Indie Bundle for Abortion Funds</a> on itch.io.</p>
<p>Much like itch.io did with previous charity bundles like for Racial Justice and Equality, Palestinian Aid, Ukraine Relief and others all the funds will be going to select charities and you can donate while also grabbing a big bunch of games, game assets, physical games to print and much more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>100% of the proceeds from this bundle will go to the National Network for Abortion Fund's <a href="http://nnaf.org/collectivepowerfund" target="_blank">Collective Power Fund</a>, which moves money <em><strong>directly</strong></em> to abortion funds across 20+ U.S. states, with a particular focus on the South and Midwest (where it is often most difficult to get access to abortions). NNAF’s partnerships with these abortion funds provide direct resources and funds to many of the people most impacted by Roe v. Wade, towards immediate action.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of what's included is pretty great too including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Haque</li>
<li>Pushamo</li>
<li>Hypnospace Outlaw</li>
<li>Bleed</li>
<li>Bleed 2</li>
<li>Buck Up and Drive!</li>
<li>Calico</li>
<li>…and the list goes on</li>
</ul>
<p>It has a minimum payment of $10 but you can donate more and they will be adding more items to the bundle up to July 6th. The bundle runs for another 9 days.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA driver 515.57 and Vulkan Beta 515.49.06 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Multiple driver updates have been released by NVIDIA for Linux recently so here's a look at what's new in each.</p>
<p>First up, for those of you sticking with the "Latest Production Branch" <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/Download/driverResults.aspx/190425/en-uk" target="_blank">version 515.57</a> went up on June 28th which is mainly just fixing up some issues and getting them working nicely. Here's what's new:</p>
<div class="tabcontent" id="tab1_content" style="visibility: visible; display: block;">
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause some graphics applications to crash when they are started while nvidia-drm.ko is not loaded.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where NvFBC could return an incorrect frame if a capture request timed out.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where NvFBC direct capture would wait for multiple queued frames to finish rendering, instead of returning the next rendered frame.</li>
<li>Added support for NvFBC direct capture to composite the mouse cursor onto frames.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Vulkan direct to display could not drive more than 4 displays from a single VkInstance.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented nvidia-settings from accurately reflecting changes to some configuration properties.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, we missed covering that NVIDIA also updated the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" target="_blank">Vulkan Beta Driver</a> during June. Version 515.49.05 on June 17th added support for the new open source kernel modules (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/nvidia-releases-open-source-linux-gpu-kernel-modules-beta-driver-5154304-out/" target="_blank">more on that here</a>) plus these additions:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New:
	<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_image_drm_format_modifier.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_image_drm_format_modifier</a> [Linux]</li>
<li><a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_non_seamless_cube_map.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_non_seamless_cube_map</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixes:
	<ul>
<li>Fix the depth and stencil clear color for dynamic rendering</li>
<li>Fix possible corruption when the shading rate image is changed</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>On July 2nd version 515.49.06 also went up with these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New:
	<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_shader_module_identifier.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_shader_module_identifier</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixes:
	<ul>
<li>Fixed issue with image copy when one of the formats is a single-plane interleaved video format</li>
<li>Fixed issue with vkCmdResetEvent on compute queues</li>
<li>Fixed regression with tessellation mode set be the tessellation control shader</li>
<li>Fixed issue with underestimate conservative rasterization sometimes not working correctly</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want a stable experience, just stick with the mainline drivers as the Vulkan Beta is aimed at developers who need to test out the latest Vulkan extensions.</p>

      <title>Wine 7.12 is out now for improving Windows compatibility on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another two weeks have gone by so the Wine hackers have put out their latest development work with <a href="https://www.winehq.org/announce/7.12" target="_blank">Wine 7.12</a> now available.</p>
<p>This is the Windows compatibility layer that allows you to run various applications and games on Linux (and forms part of Steam Play Proton). Once a year or so, a new stable release is made but the development versions are usually fine to use.</p>
<p>Wine 7.12 highlights include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Theming support for Qt5 applications.</li>
<li>Bundled vkd3d upgraded to version 1.4.</li>
<li>Improved effect support in Direct2D.</li>
<li>QWORD support in registry tools.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of the bug fixes for this release include issues solved for Star Citizen, Shogun Total War 2, Argentum 20, Wireshark and others.</p>
<p>Recently they also had the <a href="https://www.winehq.org/news/2022062201" target="_blank">vkd3d 1.4</a> release of their Direct3D to Vulkan translation library (not to be confused with VKD3D-Proton) which included:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Many improvements to the HLSL compiler.</li>
<li>A new descriptor heap implementation using the VK_EXT_descriptor_indexing extension.</li>
<li>A new fence implementation using the VK_KHR_timeline_semaphore extension.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Linux share on Steam hits highest peak in years thanks to Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey" target="_blank">Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey</a> is out for June 2022, putting the Linux user share at one of its highest ever points and likely thanks to the rise of the Steam Deck and SteamOS. As shown on our dedicated <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">Steam Tracker</a>, it's been trending upwards for quite a while but this latest figure is a pretty good showing.</p>
<p>As of June 2022, Linux is sitting at <u><strong>1.18%</strong></u> of the Steam user share.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19119921521656754277gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19119921521656754277gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Now, that doesn't sound like a lot on paper, but it puts the monthly active Linux user count at around 1,557,600 at least (based on when Valve last gave the monthly active user count).</p>
<p>Here's the breakdown of the most popular Linux systems:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>"Arch Linux" 64 bit 11.42% -1.43%</li>
<li>"Manjaro Linux" 64 bit 10.11% -0.98%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 64 bit 9.90% +1.86%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS 64 bit 9.73% -2.02%</li>
<li>"SteamOS Holo" 64 bit 7.58% +2.35%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 20.3 64 bit 6.45% +0.48%</li>
<li>Description:Freedesktop.org 21.08.14 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 6.05% +6.05%</li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 4.79% +4.79%</li>
<li>Other 33.96% -11.11%</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So you can pretty plainly see that the Steam Deck with SteamOS is already rising up the ranks, as one of the most popular Linux gaming systems on Steam's survey with it already making up well over 7% of Linux players which is a nice increase from the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/steam-deck-already-hits-over-5-of-linux-users-on-steam/" target="_blank">5% from May 2022</a>.</p>

      <title>Crypt of the NecroDancer gets a BIG surprise update with more to come</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Crypt of the NecroDancer from Brace Yourself Games is a truly wonderful mix of dungeon crawling and a rhythm game that released back in 2015. It just got a huge surprise update and more is on the way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Crypt of the NecroDancer is an award winning hardcore roguelike rhythm game. Move on the beat to navigate an ever changing dungeon while battling dancing skeletons, zombies, dragons, and more. Groove to the epic Danny Baranowsky soundtrack, or select songs from your own MP3 collection!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of what's new includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A no beat mode, to make it easier for some players.</li>
<li>Save and Quit anytime.</li>
<li>Reduced loading time.</li>
<li>Improved controller support via Steam Input, with gamepad-specific button symbols and Steam Deck support.</li>
<li>An overhauled custom music system supporting MP3, OGG and FLAC formats.</li>
<li>Linux gets a Native file-picker for custom music.</li>
<li>New and Improved Co-op.</li>
<li>A new level editor.</li>
<li>Added a fully redesigned mod loader and modding menus.</li>
<li>And loads more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Considering that this is only the start, I'm very curious to see what they have cooking up as they said " this is a precursor to something bigger coming your way, and we want to make sure that we address some of the community’s most significant feedback before we get there".</p>
<p>Since I love the game (although I am horrible at it), I wanted to see how it was on the Steam Deck now so here's a little attempt at it today:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="XsnzdN0J6Qo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6d0247f465b2c68af9d257e4be86b093.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/XsnzdN0J6Qo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>Don't judge me, I'm rubbish but it's such a gem.</em></p>
<p>There does seem to be a bug with the Steam Input configuration though. I had to pick a different profile, then back to the new official one for it to actually detect input. Apart from that it seems great on Deck.</p>
<p>Available to buy from <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/crypt_of_the_necrodancer" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/crypt-of-the-necrodancer?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/247080/Crypt_of_the_NecroDancer/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>GOG finally remove the false &#34;in progress&#34; note about GOG Galaxy for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It seems at some point over the last month or two, GOG finally removed the "in progress" notice for GOG Galaxy coming to Linux.</p>
<p>Something that was a bit <em>overdue</em>, since they clearly have no plans to actually bring GOG Galaxy to Linux despite it being the <a href="https://www.gog.com/wishlist/galaxy" target="_blank">most voted-for</a> feature request for many years. GOG and CD Projekt never really took it seriously though, with even the official Cyberpunk 2077 Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1012760227148587009" target="_blank">trolling</a> "We can assure you: it‘s not us. We are the driving force behind 'add Linux support for GOG Galaxy' though" in reply to GOG post about showing 2077 gameplay.</p>
<p>Every time I've spoken to the GOG team over the last few years, they just repeatedly told me it wasn't planned, despite the wishlist entry still listing it as "in progress" and their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2014/06/gogcom-announce-galaxy-their-optional-client-linux-support-to-come/" target="_blank">original announcement</a> mentioning it would come to Linux too and that it was "being done with PC, Mac and Linux in mind" (so much for that huh?).</p>
<p>At least there's applications like the <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> and <a href="https://lutris.net/" target="_blank">Lutris</a> that can help you manage your GOG games on Linux. Still, it would be nice if GOG at some point put some more resources into improving their Linux support. Plus, if you're going to be using a Steam Deck, buying from Steam just makes a lot more sense when it's far easier to access so I imagine that's eventually going to cost GOG a few more sales too and they're <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/gog-to-go-through-some-reorganization-after-suffering-losses/" target="_blank">not exactly doing well</a>.</p>
<p>It is a shame for those that want the Galaxy client, as I actually love what GOG do. The main idea that you can just log in and download a full offline installer is great and their repeated revivals of old games is wonderful too. But without Galaxy, some games end up missing features for Linux or just skipping a Linux build entirely on GOG.</p>

      <title>AK-xolotl mixes the incredibly cute with the deadly in this rogue-lite shooter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AK-xolotl is an upcoming rogue-lite that answers the question of: what happens if you gave an axolotl an AK? Someone must have asked that somewhere.</p>
<p>Currently crowdfunding on Kickstarter with a few days left, it appears to be rather popular and it was initially funded in only 4 hours. The developer is planning full Native Linux support too so I've no idea how I missed this one originally because the idea is nuts and it looks gorgeous too. Mixing together procedurally generated biomes with handcrafted layouts, it seems like it will have a lot of replay value too. You also get to unlock various powers and the game evolves as you progress through it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="oPOn8iu354o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/976c9443785829468ccd8fac47ebafa4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/oPOn8iu354o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Planned Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>The cutest and deadliest roguelite action:</strong> with lots of hours of gameplay and great replayability value!</li>
<li><strong>The ultimate pond inspired experience:</strong> beautiful pixel art graphics filled with pond-like details, rich colors and a variety of sceneries.</li>
<li><strong>Hunt and obliterate your prey with tons of different weapons:</strong> melee, close-range, long-range, etc., you pick your own playstyle!</li>
<li><strong>Multiple power-ups to beef up your Axolotl:</strong> yes, you have guns, but why not some extra powers as well, that not only make you mightier but add variety to the gameplay?!</li>
<li><strong>Tons of different types of enemies:</strong> Axolotl's meal will be buffet style!</li>
<li><strong>Expandable and customizable hub:</strong> build and customize your own pond and craft new items to decorate it! Your axolotl deserves the best place to live in.</li>
<li><strong>You are not just an apex predator, but also a Michelin chef: </strong>cook delicious recipes with all the ingredients you gather throughout your hunting adventures and become stronger!</li>
<li><strong>Cute baby axolotls that become playable:</strong> pet and care for baby axolotls. Feed them, nurture them and watch them grow! Finally, bring them on your hunting adventures.</li>
<li><strong>Fully supported online leaderboards:</strong> because highscores only really matter if you can brag about it!</li>
<li><strong>3 extra game modes for some bite-sized action:</strong> King of the Pond, Horde and Chrono.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Core Keeper hits 1 million sales in only a few months</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pugstorm and Fireshine Games have announced that their game Core Keeper has managed to hit 1 million sales only a few months after entering Early Access. This follows on from the rather large Sunken Sea Update that released in the middle of June.</p>
<p>Nice to see another fully supported Native Linux indie game doing so well. Here's what they said about the impressive milestone:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re delighted to announce that, shortly after the launch of The Sunken Sea Update - our first major content update - Core Keeper hit 1,000,000 sales. This is a momentous occasion for us as developers and for our publisher, Fireshine Games. In fact, Core Keeper previously set the record for being Fireshine Games’ fastest-selling digital game of all time by selling 100,000 copies within its first two days of Early-Access launch.<br/>

We’re truly overwhelmed by the fantastic community response that Core Keeper has had, and we’re thrilled to have hit this milestone so early on in the games’ development. Launching in Early Access has given us a unique opportunity to involve the community in major game decisions and collaborate with them on improvements and optimisations.</p>

<p>Remember all that talk about the indiepocalypse? We seem to be hearing more and more about games doing so well, and a lot of them come from smaller teams like this too. Just like Valheim managed to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/valheim-is-absolutely-smashing-it-with-10-million-copies-sold/" target="_blank">sell over 10 million copies</a>, it just goes to show that some good marketing and an actually good game will clearly sell.</p>

      <title>Free and open source arena shooter Xonotic 0.8.5 now available</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love some fast-paced first-person shooting action? Xonotic (a fork of the original Nexuiz) has a brand new release available with tons of improvements.</p>
<p>This is a pretty big release for the project touching on nearly every part of the gameplay, with some big tech changes behind the scenes too. Thousands of changes for better and more refined gameplay, new and updated maps and player models, new sound effects, much more dangerous bots, a new HUD, more translations and so much more.</p>
<p>For those of you who don't play online, the changes to bots will be most welcome. Not only have they tweaked their difficulty but various bug fixes came in like underwater navigation, they will no longer get stuck in bad spots, they can properly jump and crouch, they have an improved ability to avoid danger while running and bunny hopping and they're better at chasing enemies down too.</p>
<p>It should be a bit easier to pick out players / bots from the maps to actually shoot them too thanks to improved visibility, plus new and improved primary shirt and secondary glow colouring on some models and they fixed primary and secondary colours getting mixed up.</p>
<p>Two new maps made it in too with Bromine by <em>packer</em>, a rusty styled map for large games!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14047883451656668217gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14047883451656668217gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Opium by <em>cityy</em>, a medium sized level with plenty of vertical action!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17338397121656668236gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17338397121656668236gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Various other maps saw updates, there's refreshed weapon and item sound effects to help you better distinguish them during combat and the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>A massive release overall and you can see all the changes in the <a href="https://xonotic.org/posts/2022/xonotic-0-8-5-release/" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two big updates have rolled out for the Steam Deck which includes an opt-in Beta SteamOS 3.3 upgrade, plus there's also a Steam Deck Beta Client update.</p>
<p>First up, the Beta <u><strong>Client</strong></u> <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3323108691056012032" target="_blank">update</a> brings in these fixes:</p>

<div class="bbcodes_Bold_Whyj8"><strong>Steam Input</strong></div>
<ul>
<li>Added missing Deck buttons for Gyro Enable and Button Chord options</li>
<li>Added support for game-bundled Virtual Menu icons in the in-game Deck UI</li>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added support for Simplified Chinese (Pinyin), Traditional Chinese (Pinyin, Zhuyin, and Cangjie), Japanese, and Korean keyboards. We are still refining these keyboards, please provide feedback in the forums.</li>
<li>Re-enabled the Adaptive Backlight feature.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As for SteamOS 3.3 Beta itself <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1675200/discussions/0/3410929607716145819/" target="_blank">here's all</a> that was added:</p>
<blockquote>

<li>Fixed audio out on some capture cards</li>
<li>Fixed some instances of corrupt audio after resuming from sleep</li>
<li>Fixed audio output with some 32-bit games that use ALSA</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like Valve have been hard at work to improve much of the experience overall on the Steam Deck, this makes me very happy since I boot mine up every day without fail, it really is my main gaming machine now outside of times where it doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>In other Steam deck news, here's a few recent big bits you might have missed:</p>

      <title>Anti-cheat work on Warhammer: Vermintide 2 for Steam Deck &amp; Linux &#39;on hold&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While it's supposed to be relatively easy for games with anti-cheat like BattlEye and Easy Anti-Cheat to get working on Linux and Steam Deck, some developers are having issues like Fatshark with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/552500/Warhammer_Vermintide_2/" target="_blank">Warhammer: Vermintide 2</a>.</p>
<p>This particular game uses Easy Anti-Cheat, which is supposed to be a case of ticking a few boxes and making sure things are in the right place to allow EAC to work with Steam Play Proton but it turns out it might not be that simple for every game. A shame, but not a big surprise, as if it was truly that simple for every game more would have done it by now, and considering how big game projects and code are, there's likely plenty of smaller gotchas developers need to deal with.</p>
<p>A rep from Fatshark posted on the Steam forum to give an update on the work to get Warhammer: Vermintide 2 playable and it's not good news. Despite chatting to Epic and Valve, they couldn't figure it out and now their team is working on the upcoming Warhammer 40,000: Darktide.</p>
<p>Here's what <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/552500/discussions/0/2960544187643622408/?ctp=26#c3419936604888208895" target="_blank">they said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So we have performed all the requisite steps to have this work. We've ticked the boxes in the EAC portal, included the files in the appropriate places. Problem is, as you can see, it doesn't work in this scenario. We've been in touch with both third parties (in this case Epic and Valve), but we're at a bit of a roadblock truth be told. Those who would work on really digging in to the weeds on this are indeed digging in to Darktide weeds, so aren't able to spend sufficient time liaising with Valve and Epic to figure out what's causing the 'simple steps' to not be as simple as they sounded.<br/>
<br/>
In short, work on this is on hold for now. We'll bark up this thread should things spin up again.</p>

      <title>Strategy-survival game Dice Tribes: Ambitions gets a Native Linux version</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dice Tribes: Ambitions is a pretty interesting looking strategy survival game mix, where you move dice around to keep your tribe and village going. It might not sound or even look like much but it seems like it might surprise you with the mechanics involved.</p>
<p>It's not a particularly well-known game and so far it only has around 23 Steam user reviews, but they are 100% positive. If you're after something different, perhaps this is one to give a go? The developer also just recently updated the game to provide a Native Linux build too. The developer describes it as a "dice worker placement game".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="VZHV0iOyxHs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/46012b5a36967e70483f21db02319ce0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/VZHV0iOyxHs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Starting with a small number of villagers, you will need to manage them and grow the tribes in order to complete one of the ambitions. Opportunities and Dangers lies ahead and you will need to dispatch your villagers to take care of them. Prepare your villagers as you attempt to complete one of the ambition to win the game.</p>
<p>Key Features</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose from one of 6 tribes, each with their own village building.</li>
<li>Choose from more than 15 different structures and construct them to aid in your Ambition.</li>
<li>Choose from one of many ambitions to complete, including hidden ones.</li>
<li>Draft mode that forces you to adapt to different restrictions and challenges.</li>
</ul>

      <title>73 of the top 100 most popular Steam games are playable on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's been a little while since checking how well the top 100 most played games on Steam work on Linux and the Steam Deck, so here's a fresh run over the list for you.</p>
<p>For those who just want the official numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>28 - Verified</li>
<li>45 - Playable</li>
<li>22 - Unsupported</li>
<li>5 - Unchecked</li>
</ul>
<p>So officially <u>73</u> of the top 100 will work on the Steam Deck currently. Any game that is playable on Steam Deck will be playable on Linux desktops too (minus perhaps some very rare exceptions). However, if you take into account ratings also from <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> and some personal testing, the number will be likely a little higher especially for those Valve has not yet tested.</p>
<p>Here's the full list below, which is a snapshot taken today (June 30th, 2022). Since it's based on player-counts it fluctuates but not massively so, and it's more the bottom few that move in and out the rest just switch positions.</p>

<p>As pretty much expected, the biggest culprit of what's not playable is issues with Anti-Cheat. Despite Easy Anti-Cheat and BattlEye supporting Linux and the Steam Deck, there's still a lot of issues there with developers either not updating or having trouble with the integration so it's an uphill struggle there.</p>
<p>For games that are listed as Playable some of the biggest issues there are a mixture of things like: launchers being a nuisance, on-screen keyboard needing to be pulled up manually, no gamepad support and text that's too small. For developers, it often doesn't take much to bump up from Playable to Verified and lots of them have been putting in the effort, which you can see across many articles in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/Steam_Deck/" target="_blank">the Steam Deck tag</a>.</p>
<p>Some games tagged as Unsupported may also appear to work fine, but there's a few cases where they can end up very unstable later on (like Forza Horizon 4). So even if you might think an Unsupported title is wrong, it might not be.</p>

      <title>AOKZOE are the latest to attempt a Steam Deck rival with the AOKZOE A1</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AOKZOE will be jumping in the handheld ring with their upcoming AOKZOE A1 AMD Ryzen 7 6800U portable that will offer either Windows 11 or SteamOS to perhaps rival the Steam Deck. They're a rather new company, so everything they're talking about and showing off should be taken with a rather large pinch of salt.</p>
<p>To go against the Steam Deck though they're not only going to have to be able to ship a lot of units, but actually have a price-point that isn't ridiculous like some other vendors. Considering Valve are <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/valve-to-ship-more-than-double-the-number-of-steam-decks-each-week/" target="_blank">ramping up shipments now</a>, how is a brand new vendor going to cope?</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lAeZ8ABXx8s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d58a898743dbba90abc99a7ff8f58712.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lAeZ8ABXx8s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The specifications they list:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A combo of AMD Ryzen 7 6800U | Radeon 680M | LPDDR5X (Freq. 6400)</li>
<li>8-inch IPS Screen, sRGB 100％, 1920 x 1200</li>
<li>Windows 11 or Steam OS</li>
<li>RGB Breathing Lighting</li>
<li>PD Charge</li>
<li>Gyroscope</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zMMbfJ_JXos"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9b5e819013ed03e12f0baa888934cdd9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zMMbfJ_JXos" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They said it will go up for pre-order in July and it's scheduled to start shipping in September.</p>
<p>I'm pretty skeptical of this, since they just popped up out of nowhere but perhaps worth keeping an eye on. Price is going to be the biggest question and currently they're not telling. Even so, if it was reasonably priced, trust is perhaps the second biggest question with such a new vendor.</p>

      <title>Some Steam Decks ship with an x2 SSD instead of an x4 SSD</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve made a change to the specifications of the top two versions of the Steam Deck last month, which it seems plenty of people (including me) completely missed. It's not a massive change but still one to be aware of as not all Decks are the same.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck is split across three models either with a 64 GB eMMC, 256 GB NVMe SSD or a 512 GB NVMe SSD (and the top model has the anti-glare etched screen too). Sometime around May 28th though, the SSDs shipping in the Steam Deck changed and now come in <em>two</em> possible editions and you won't know what you have until you get it and check.</p>
<p>On the specifications page, it now lists this:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>64 GB eMMC (PCIe Gen 2 x1)</li>
<li>256 GB NVMe SSD (PCIe Gen 3 x4 or PCIe Gen 3 x2*)</li>
<li>512 GB high-speed NVMe SSD (PCIe Gen 3 x4 or PCIe Gen 3 x2*)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>With Valve noting "*Some 256GB and 512GB models ship with a PCIe Gen 3 x2 SSD. In our testing, we did not see any impact to gaming performance between x2 and x4".</p>
<p><em>You can see the change thanks to the Wayback Machine on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220527060926/https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck#SaleSection_24468" target="_blank">May 27th</a> and then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220528095946/https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck#SaleSection_24468" target="_blank">May 28th</a>.</em></p>
<p>Really, it shouldn't make all that much of a difference, especially considering the Micro SD slot can load and run even some of the highest-end games just fine. This is quite likely one of the ways Valve has been able to ramp up production to ship <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/valve-to-ship-more-than-double-the-number-of-steam-decks-each-week/" target="_blank">more than double each week</a>, along with the two different fan models you might also see.</p>

      <title>Return to Monkey Island gets a first gameplay trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Return to Monkey Island, the continuation of the story from he Secret of Monkey Island and Monkey Island 2: LeChuck’s Revenge now has a first gameplay trailer. With a return of series creator Ron Gilbert and developed in collaboration with Lucasfilm Games, it's certainly an exciting game to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>Today, Devolver Digital released the first trailer you can see below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="p3mxq44HhnU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8beb1ca0f98b70fcfed7ee8998cddbf2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/p3mxq44HhnU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>About it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s been many years since Guybrush Threepwood was last locked in a battle of wits with his nemesis, the zombie pirate LeChuck. His true love, Elaine Marley, has turned her focus away from governing and Guybrush himself is adrift and unfulfilled, having never found the Secret of Monkey Island. Hip, young pirate leaders led by Captain Madison have shuffled the old guard from power, Melee Island has taken a turn for the worse, and famed businessman Stan has been imprisoned for ‘marketing-related crimes’.<br/>
<br/>
Banter with old friends and new faces on familiar islands now under dangerous new leadership. Then, take to the high seas and explore the new and unknown as you work your way out of tough predicaments. Clever puzzles, bizarre situations, and devastating ripostes are all that stand between Guybrush and glory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We don't quite know what platforms it will be on yet as it's all "TBA" (to be announced).</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060130/Return_to_Monkey_Island/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Pocket Wheels looks like a fun toy-car playground that will support Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pocket Wheels looks like what you could imagine in your mind when playing with toy cars as a child and it's on the way to Linux with Native support.</p>
<p>A mixture of a 3D platformer and a racing game, inspired by "90s collectathons". In the game you control a toy car that can jump, glide and there's even a grappling hook. The idea is to give you a big playground to race and fly through, just like you always dreamed of right? You get various vehicles to unlock too and there's a number of different rooms each with their own race tracks, objectives and collectibles.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZFJocKALaQQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2b312d3d04043a78170792670e626c55.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZFJocKALaQQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This looks like pure joy. Reminds me a little of classic Micro Machines games!</p>
<p>Speaking on the Steam forum, the developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1129360/discussions/0/5755024051061146444/#c3419934814486215419" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that while it works with Proton already they are "working on a native Build for the future" and they're testing it on the Steam Deck too.</p>

      <title>Onsen Master blends Overcooked with Spirited Away and releases soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Blending the frantic action from the Overcooked series with inspiration taken from Studio Ghibli film Spirited Away, the upcoming Linux Native game Onsen Master looks like fun.</p>
<p>Onsen Master features arcade-style single and two-player co-op, where players must manage the customers of their hot springs, and prepare and put together the correct ingredients to cure their ailments. Running around the hot springs, wrangling wandering customers, and putting the right concoctions into the right baths can be hectic enough already, but troublesome yokai look to impede players' service as well.</p>
<p>A new trailer was also sent out recently that you can see below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BhyerDH382k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2804f7d21f00dac49b9481ae1e558a0c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BhyerDH382k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Spring Fling:</strong> Experience a short and sweet story for up to two players, and unveil the island of Izajima in a visual novel style narrative with a cute anime aesthetic.</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>The Customer is Always Right: </strong>Skip the story and dive right in with Arcade Mode! Choose one of the six hot spring levels to put your customer service skills to the test.</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>The Heat is On: </strong>Take on others in a competitive couch multiplayer mode where players must each work to manage their customers within the same hot spring.</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Spa Music: </strong>An original soundtrack full of tunes akin to a Feudal fairytale, composed by Dorrell Ettienne.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left">How did the idea come about? The concept for Onsen Master dates back to 2015, when Waking Oni Games founder Derrick Fields was inspired by their regular rewatches of Spirited Away, specifically a section of the film in which the protagonist is working with spirits at a bathhouse. This formed the basis of Onsen Master’s hot spring customer management gameplay, and also the Japanese setting and aesthetic of the game. After five years of development, a successful Kickstarter campaign and beta period, and the partnership with Whitethorn Games, Onsen Master is finally ready to release "this month" they said (although it's now the end of June and a date hasn't actually been given yet).</p>

      <title>Fech The Ferret is an upcoming vibrant parkour rhythm-platformer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love your musical games and want to get into the rhythm? Fech The Ferret looks like a pretty clever blending of ideas.</p>
<p>It's a fast-paced parkour platformer with seriously vibrant and inviting colours. The hook here is that the faster you go, the better the music gets. A mixture of high speed 3D platforming and rhythmic subtones inside of a colorful open world. The developer emailed in about it, making it clear they fully support Linux with a Native build and there's also a demo available to try right now.</p>
<p>"Fech The Ferret especially caters to those who gotta go fast and would rather climb walls than do precise platforming, but you can also enjoy it at your own pace and explore this rich world in search of secrets, or perhaps chat with some Marmocleans."</p>

<p>Sounds like a fun idea, so will be keeping an eye on this one. If you do give it a go, let us know what you think in the comments, it's fun to see more music games come along for sure.</p>
<p>You can try out a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1382980/Fech_The_Ferret/" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a> and also <a href="https://raoulwb.itch.io/fech-the-ferret" target="_blank">follow on itch.io</a> too.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck gets a set of nice bug fixes in a new client update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A fresh Steam Deck Client Update is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3323108691045398493" target="_blank">out now</a> pulling in some rather useful sounding bug fixes. They've actually slowed down a little on the updates now, which is actually good to see so hopefully there's something a little bigger cooking in the Valve oven once again.</p>
<p>Here's what's new from the June 28th update:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where clicking in-game links when offline would get Steam Deck into a bad state</li>
<li>Fixed navigation issues in the game EULA dialog</li>
<li>Fixed crashing issue when deleting a screenshot</li>
<li>Fixed the controller configurator failing to load when Steam Cloud is disabled</li>
<li>Fixed configurator failing to load when encountering corrupted controller layout files</li>
<li>Fixed controller virtual menus being limited to 4 active menus</li>
<li>Fixed a bug causing the touchscreen to occasionally be stuck in mouse-emulation mode when accessing the configurator in-game</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Is there anything specific you're wanting to be added or fixed on the Steam Deck? Let us know in the comments. I'm off to go update mine now…</p>
<p>Also, in case you missed it, from Thursday June 30th Valve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/valve-to-ship-more-than-double-the-number-of-steam-decks-each-week/" target="_blank">will be doubling</a> the number of Steam Decks going out each time as production has ramped up. A designer at Valve also <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/valve-designer-warns-people-not-to-put-2242-m2-drives-in-their-steam-deck/" target="_blank">warned against</a> sticking in SSDs that are too big.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As we say goodbye to Q2 and hello to Q3, Valve has confirmed that production of Steam Deck units has increased to the point where they're going to be sending out a lot more.</p>
<p>Today is one of the usual days for emails to go out (so check your inbox) and Thursday is the other day where it happens. From <em>this</em> Thursday (30th June), things will be just a bit different. Confirming the details on <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1541459263444332544" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, the official OnDeck account said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello! Some great news on the production front. We just sent the last batch of Q2 emails, and we’ll start sending Q3 reservation emails on the 30th. Production has picked up, and after today we'll be shipping more than double the number of Steam Decks every week!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>You can check your reservation status on the official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" target="_blank">Steam Deck page</a>. Also don't worry if you miss your email, you do <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/missed-your-steam-deck-email-valve-confirms-a-grace-period-to-still-get-one/" target="_blank">get another chance</a> to get a Steam Deck.</em></p>
<p>Designer Lawrence Yang, who <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/valve-designer-warns-people-not-to-put-2242-m2-drives-in-their-steam-deck/" target="_blank">recently warned people</a> about certain SSD upgrades, also mentioned on <a href="https://twitter.com/lawrenceyang/status/1541459415361921024" target="_blank">Twitter</a>:</p>

      <title>Kingdoms and Castles gets Steam Deck and gamepad support, VR version coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A little castle building and AI conquering on the go? Kingdoms and Castles already worked great on Linux with the Native version and now it should be great on the Steam Deck too. Only recently they put out a huge update to the game with AI Kingdoms too.</p>
<p>The developer said they "worked hard to implement intuitive gamepad controls that make it easy to build and manage your kingdom and we've tweaked the UI to work well for the Deck's screen size". It won't mess with anyone using a mouse so no worries there but it also means on PC overall you get gamepad support if you want it. You just need to tick Console Controls in the options (default on Deck).</p>
<p>Here's a short demo of it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rDJthIdBdac"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ce09dcce60ad7c41abdc7a671fc527ed.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rDJthIdBdac" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Additionally they've teased these are coming next for the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">Fixing bugs - you may have noticed a few small hotpatches over the past few weeks, more to come soon.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">New stuff for the AI Kingdoms based on your feedback so far (for example, getting that pesky aggressive AI to stop asking for tribute after defeating them in a war, and being able to demand tribute yourself).</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">VR version of the game - this is well underway and feels really cool. We'll have some progress to show here soon.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>CorsixTH the modern game engine for Theme Hospital v0.66 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>CorsixTH is the absolute best way to play the classic Theme Hospital on any modern system and version 0.66 is now out.</p>
<p>While there's the newer Two Point Hospital from some of the original team, you're simply never going to beat Theme Hospital in my heart since not only is nostalgia at play but it remains a highly enjoyable sim thanks to it being such a great game at the time. CorsixTH keeping it a live with plenty of enhancements helps too of course.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10003537161656342269gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10003537161656342269gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of what's new in v0.66-beta1 includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Direct Zoom has been improved and is now enabled by default</li>
<li>Nurses can now leave the ward without disturbing her patients</li>
<li>Patients with Serious Radiation now glow a beautiful shade of green</li>
<li>Patients with Jellyitis now wobble wobble wobble</li>
<li>The Hotkeys menu has been overhauled to make it easier to use</li>
<li>You can now reset your zoom level by pressing '0'</li>
<li>A new fax code cheat has been added!</li>
<li>The replace machine prompt will now tell you the new strength before purchase (can be disabled in configuration settings)</li>
<li>A machine's dynamic info will tell you the strength a machine can be upgraded to if you replaced it (can be disabled in configuration settings)</li>
<li>Improved pee and vomit conditions</li>
<li>Patients will no longer queue for reception until nearby</li>
<li>The Adviser will no longer queue repetitive messages</li>
<li>Dropdown menus will now close when clicked outside of</li>
<li>Non-visual diseases can now be delayed in the level config of a custom game</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus the usual assorted bug fixes. It's mostly the same as the Beta release I covered back in May, plus a few additional fixes that were discovered during testing. Not many changelogs will give you the likes of improved peeing and vomiting but here we are, what a gem.</p>

      <title>Pokete is a Pokemon-like game for your terminal</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fancy catching some creatures? How about directly in your terminal window? Pokete is a free and open source Pokemon-like. Just like the classics it features various creatures across different types like Plant, Water, Fire and they all have their own strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>It's currently in active development but it's already quite playable with a long list of features. In the last month it only just had another major release adding in smarter NPCs, achievements, fights with multiple Poketes, in-game time for day and night Poketes encounters and you now get transported to safety if all your Poketes faint during a battle just like a certain other game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7022901491656337431gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7022901491656337431gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5252310631656337431gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5252310631656337431gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Pretty fun idea for a terminal game really, can't wait to watch it evolve.</p>

      <title>Spaceship building game Reassembly goes 64bit, gets Linux and Steam Deck upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Reassembly is a highly rated game that mixes spaceship building, exploration and intense combat. It's quite a little gem and has a big update out now. One I was somewhat addicted to back when it originally released in 2015.</p>
<p>With a lot of variety on the parts available to build you ships, it's a little like snapping together LEGO. If you love space combat and building, it's one to check out. Quite amazing to see it still continue to be updated this long after release. As on June 24th here's what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Add 64 bit windows binaries. Should improve performance a bit, especially when many mods are installed.</li>
<li>Add 64 bit linux binaries, and update linux compiler to gcc-9. Linux support now requires a 64 bit OS.</li>
<li>Update mac compiler. Now requires OSX 10.12.</li>
<li>Multi-threaded ship loading. Noticeably faster loading when many mods are installed</li>
<li>UI fixes for steam deck. Scrolling credits with bigger fonts, move some "flying" controls into "advanced", open the on-screen keyboard when relevant, etc.</li>
<li>Fix corruption crash when an explosion creates more explosions</li>
<li>Replace libcurl with cpphhtplib. Should be transparent, and fix some linux issues related to out of date libcrypt etc.</li>
<li>Fix AI for rocket turrets</li>
<li>Fix dancing thruster bug</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Valve has currently rated it was "Playable" for the Steam Deck.</em></p>

Another that was crowdfunded on Kickstarter with $95,204 this one definitely needs to be on your wishlist.</p>
<p>"Arcadian Atlas is a unique, narrative-driven isometric tactical RPG set in Arcadia, a nation tearing itself apart via political and familial factions, nefarious plots, treacherous alliances and clandestine intrigues just as ancient evil forces begin to awaken. With a queen willing to do anything to ascend to the throne, no one is safe."</p>
<p>You build up a party from more than 12 custom classes, with each having their own unique skill types and equipment. It's very character-driven, with the developer explaining that every action during battle will count as "just one wrong move could tear your family, its political alliances and the land itself apart for good".</p>
<p>Have a looksie at the new trailer:</p>

      <title>Low-poly 3D rail shooter Ex-Zodiac hits Early Access on July 21st</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A nice little early birthday present for me, Ex-Zodiac is a low-poly 3D rail shooter (think like Star Fox) that now has a release date. It's going to release with Native Linux support on July 21st, following on from the successful Kickstarter campaign back in 2020.</p>
<p>With the initial release it will have 6 main stages and 6 bonus stages, which the publisher said brings "the 80's/90's nostalgia to a new level".</p>
<p>See one of the original trailers below but there's a newer sneak-peak on <a href="https://twitter.com/BenHickling/status/1539275535301353474" target="_blank">Twitter</a>:</p>

<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A retro, colourful, low-poly visual style</li>
<li>12 main levels (plus secret areas and side-paths)</li>
<li>Multiple routes to complete the game</li>

      <title>Valve designer warns people not to put 2242 M.2 drives in their Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently, one <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSmcelrea/status/1539296261613944833" target="_blank">modder</a> decided to stick a bigger 2242 M.2 SSD into their Steam Deck and after many other bigger PC sites picked it up — a Valve designer has warned people not to do it.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck was designed to specifically fit the much smaller 2230 M.2 and while it appears the 2242 can work, this appears to be a case of being so preoccupied with whether they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. <em>To completely pinch a quote from Jurassic Park.</em></p>
<p>Designer Lawrence Yang said on <a href="https://twitter.com/lawrenceyang/status/1540809830000013313" target="_blank">Twitter</a> in reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="css-1dbjc4n">
<div class="css-1dbjc4n r-1s2bzr4">
<div class="css-901oao r-1nao33i r-37j5jr r-1blvdjr r-16dba41 r-vrz42v r-bcqeeo r-bnwqim r-qvutc0" data-testid="tweetText" dir="auto" id="id__nly0s773drk" lang="en">Hi, please don’t do this. The charger IC gets very hot and nearby thermal pads should not be moved. In addition, most 2242 m.2 drives draw more power and get hotter than what Deck is designed for. This mod may appear to work but will significantly shorten the life of your Deck.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The modder <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSmcelrea/status/1541160087900901376" target="_blank">replied</a> to agree too.</em></p>
<p>Remember, Valve did <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/10/get-a-look-inside-the-steam-deck-in-valves-latest-video/" target="_blank">their own</a> teardown of the device but repeatedly told people to leave things to the professionals. However, they also teamed up with iFixit to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/the-official-ifixit-launch-for-steam-deck-parts-and-repair-guides-is-live/" target="_blank">offer spare parts</a> too.</p>
<p>Best to stick to the smaller 2230 series if you really wish to open it up and put a bigger one in, <em>or</em> just put in a good Micro SD that works well and still loads everything quickly. Don't go following every crazy idea you see online, even when big sites report on it.</p>

      <title>Dead Cells gets a huge free accessibility upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dead Cells is a great game. Not only does it look great but the action is awesome. However, it is rather difficult and for some nearly impossible so the developers have put out a huge free upgrade to help more people play it.</p>
<p>A rather admirable update really, as accessibility should never be looked down upon and during their testing the developer said they received "pretty much zero negative feedback on the general options that we're introducing". However their new Assist Mode that gives multiple lives, auto-hitting and adjustable trap damage did receive community "pushback". Addressing that in an update they made it clear the whole point is to "let people to enjoy the game who would otherwise be excluded from doing so" and it's entirely optional.</p>
<p>Highlights include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Loads of new options to improve accessibility, such as adjustable font type &amp; size, input customisation and individual adjustment of sound effect volumes</li>
<li>Assist Mode including customisation of enemy health/damage, trap speed/damage and parry window. Plus options for multiple lives, auto-hit with primary weapon &amp; full map reveal</li>
<li>Big reduction in cell cost of early-game weapons</li>
<li>7 weapon reworks</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Can't wait to dive back in with all this, sounds amazing.</p>

      <title>Grim Horde is chaotic and there&#39;s a good game hiding in there</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Grim Horde is a game that released into Early Access with Native Linux support and it's another fast-paced rogue-lite hell in a slightly similar way to the chaos found in Vampire Survivors only you control a horde of minions.</p>
<p>You float around as a demon lord, lead armies and crush various villages and take on the pesky people in a sort-of auto-battling way. Since you mainly just control your demon lord, your army is running around doing the damage while you're trying to avoid arrows and all sorts.</p>
<p>Once you die you rise again and keep going. It could end up as another fun little game to keep coming back to once it has been further developed but there's a good idea for a game here I'm just not entirely sure on the execution of it just yet.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vZM0bVNjSsI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3f1410a779e92cfcdbe2bbd59624593b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vZM0bVNjSsI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's certainly rough around the edges and needs some work so I'll be keeping an eye on it.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1962560/Grim_Horde/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Gorgeous turn-based tactics game Tyrant&#39;s Blessing releases in August</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Following on from their successful Kickstarter campaign, Tyrant's Blessing now has a release date and a brand new trailer and it's looking rather good. Seems like a fun blending of styles from Final Fantasy Tactics and Into the Breach! It's confirmed to be launching on August 8th with Native Linux support and there's a demo available on Steam.</p>
<p>"Tyrant's Blessing is a tactical turn-based game where your ability to plan, adapt, and strategize is more important than min-maxing your units or finding the sharpest sword in the hoard. Select battles every day, make challenging choices, and cleverly use the strengths of these rag-tag insurgents to defeat the undead hordes and maybe - just maybe - bring real life back to Tyberia."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LaFT1xdd_4s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/eae9b67780c2e015a2fa51c32829d3b9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LaFT1xdd_4s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Decide whether to fight, rescue the living from the Undying, or gather your strength. Every choice matters throughout every day of the Uprising.</li>
<li>As you fight your way across the face of Tyberia, face off against random encounters that force difficult decisions. Do you intervene and fight highwaymen, putting your warriors at risk? Do you try to save a child, risking valuable time and resources? Only your morals and ideals hold the answer.</li>
<li>Pick your heroic roster carefully. Screeg, the elder wizard advising the Uprising, can only teleport three heroes and a pet at once: Do you send your elite warriors in? Or rookies to train and hold the line? Are they up to the task? Can you handle the consequences?</li>
<li>Enlist twenty hallowed heroes, each with a distinct set of abilities that can dramatically alter the course of any battle.</li>
<li>But stay mindful: Not all heroes appear in a playthrough - and not everyone is guaranteed to make it to the finish line of this quest.</li>
<li>Pick the right team for the task. An assassin may thrive in confined spaces, while an archer will suffer in close quarters. Some heroes may even bring their pets along, who might provide just enough leverage to win a battle for the group.</li>
<li>Even if heroes fall, they can still be freed from the Tyrant's grasp. Track them down, defeat them in combat, and restore them back to their stolen life!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Valve continues tweaking Counter-Strike: Global Offensive for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released a fresh update to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and they continue focusing on Steam Input improvements, to make playing it with a controller and the Steam Deck a better experience.</p>
<p>Seems they're trying to help controller players catch up at least a tiny bit with those using a mouse, with plenty of working going into changing how gyros work. Quite a small patch overall though but it sounds like some pretty fun and welcome changes, although Gyros Akimbo does sound somewhat hilarious.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Steam Deck now allows other game controllers to be connected via Steam Input. All connected controllers combine inputs. (You can play with Gyros Akimbo if you are very cool).</li>
<li>“Pitch and Roll Combined” is the new default Gyro conversion on Steam Deck. All other controllers default to “Yaw”</li>
<li>Radial menus (in particular, Quick Buy radials) no longer persist when dying.</li>
<li>Some glyph fixes in Spectator mode.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I did try out CS:GO on Deck myself and was tempted to video it but lets just say it was embarrassing. It's a very tough game to really get into on a controller of any sort. If you have a Deck, have you been playing CS:GO on it? Let us know what your experience has been in the comments.</p>
<p>You can play<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/" target="_blank"> free on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>With a quick script you can run Steam Deck Desktop Mode inside Gaming Mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We're going into ridiculous territory of tweaking now and the possibilities are seemingly endless on what you can do with the Steam Deck. You can even run the Desktop Mode inside of Gaming Mode.</p>
<p>Thanks to a <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/uddyat/desktop_mode_within_gaming_mode/" target="_blank">Reddit user</a>, the script is pretty simple and only needs you to add the commands into a text file, set it as executable and add it to Steam as a Non-Steam game. From there, you can launch and switch between desktop mode and games running in the background and it actually works. It's far from perfect with some issues where the desktop mode may freeze up so you need to quit it with certain games, and sometimes the mouse won't go to the very bottom but hey — this is the kind of awesome stuff you can do with Linux right?</p>
<p>Here's a brief demo:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3uJeqafjwsc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dfa99ec6e4a2899d865f1a40f46e2dcc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3uJeqafjwsc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Love it. If you try it, don't blame me if you break something. Just wanted to highlight something mildly amusing and also somewhat useful too.</p>

      <title>Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop devs detail their support of Proton and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/563560/Alien_Swarm_Reactive_Drop/" target="_blank">Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop</a>, a community updated and expanded version of the free Alien Swarm originally by Valve continues to see lots of improvements. The developers also explained their clear support of Linux with Proton and the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Released by Valve originally in 2010, Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop continues the much lesser-known Valve title with an impressive set of extras. It doesn't have Native Linux support like other Valve titles and the Reactive Drop Team has explained it likely never will due to the specific Source engine build used. However "making the game run well on Proton was and continues to be a priority" <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/563560/discussions/2/4932019356819234637/" target="_blank">they say</a>.</p>
<p>A bunch of improvements also came along for gamepad and Steam Deck users including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improved controller navigation order on several menus.</li>
<li>Made several in-game menus including the briefing menu navigable using ControllerFocus (the red/yellow flashing border).</li>
<li>Added controller button prompts to several places, including the game instructor.</li>
<li>Redesigned some menus entirely, such as the mission selection screen.</li>
<li>Enlarged the main font size on smaller resolutions.</li>
<li>Added a new radial menu system for selecting marines with the d-pad.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They said to let them know if you have problems on Linux / Steam Deck in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/563560/discussions/2/4932019356819234637/" target="_blank">this thread in the forum</a>.</p>
<p>It's nice to see more developers do direct support like this. Here's a short video to show it working well:</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental gets Paladins working on Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a fresh upgrade for Proton Experimental on June 22nd which brings even more game compatibility to Linux desktops and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Listed as now playable as of this update includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Rising of the Shield Hero: Relive The Animation</li>
<li>Paladins</li>
</ul>
<p>Paladins is an interesting one, as it was sort-of playable for a while using a few workarounds and an older version of GE-Proton but now having it in the official Proton is going to make it so much easier.</p>
<p>This update also solves Tekken 7 crashing at launch and more work has been done on video playback, with many games that previous requires special hacks in Proton no longer being required including: The Long Dark, Trailmakers, Surviving the Aftermath, Haven, TOHU, Hardspace: Shipbreaker, V Rising and more.</p>
<p>The changelog can be seen <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">here</a> at any time.</p>
<p>Need to know how to change the Proton version used? See the below video:</p>

<p>Text guide (Steam Deck):</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a game and head to the little COG icon on the right.</li>
<li>Click Properties, then Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select it from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Right click a game, go to Properties.</li>
<li>Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select it from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's also a quick video overview and a short look at Paladins running on the Steam Deck. It's not perfected yet with a few issues remaining but it's starting to get there and performance seems good.</p>

      <title>AMD publishes the source code for FidelityFX Super Resolution 2 (FSR 2)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As they promised they would, AMD has now officially published the <a href="https://github.com/GPUOpen-Effects/FidelityFX-FSR2" target="_blank">source code</a> for FidelityFX Super Resolution 2 (FSR 2) under an open source license. With it under the MIT license, developers can pretty much go nuts with it.</p>
<p>This tech is their newer and more advanced temporal upscaling solution, supporting the Vulkan and DirectX 12 graphics APIs, it's fully supported on Linux and works on different vendor GPUs (not just AMDs). AMD say it "uses cutting-edge temporal algorithms to reconstruct fine geometric and texture detail, producing anti-aliased output from aliased input". Developed from the ground-up, it's quite a big difference from FSR 1 to provide even better performance and clearer images. Developers can even use both since they're so different.</p>
<p>FSR 2 features include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Temporal</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Delivers similar or better than native image quality using temporal data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Anti-aliasing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Includes high-quality anti-aliasing.
	<ul>
<li>FSR 2 replaces any TAA within the game frame.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>High image quality</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Higher image quality than FSR 1 technology at all quality presets/resolutions.
	<ul>
<li>Different quality modes available.</li>
<li>Dynamic Resolution Scaling supported.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>No machine learning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Does not require dedicated Machine Learning (ML) hardware.
	<ul>
<li>More platforms can benefit.</li>
<li>Gives more control to cater to a range of different scenarios.</li>
<li>Better ability to optimize.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cross-platform</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Boosts framerates in supported games.
	<ul>
<li>Wide range of products and platforms, both AMD and select competitors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can see a number of their comparisons on their <a href="https://gpuopen.com/fidelityfx-superresolution-2/" target="_blank">GPUOpen website</a>.</p>

      <title>Cyberpunk point and click adventure Born Punk is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Born Punk is a brand new cyberpunk point and click adventure from developer Insert Disk 22. It just released on Steam on June 18th and now a Native Linux version is also available. Funded thanks to a Kickstarter campaign, it's nice to see a trickle of games still coming from the crowdfunding platform.</p>
<p>"In Born Punk, the player slips into the role of three people (well, two people, depending on your stance on artificial lifeforms) living on the island: Eevi, a corporate combat hacker turned bartender down on her luck; Mariposa, the CEO of Bornholm's biggest corporation; and a malfunctioning android who calls himself Grandmaster Flashdrive.</p>
<p>The three characters have one thing in common: they all, one after another, get possessed by strange entities of unknown origin and even less known intentions. They must work together - and sometimes against each other - to find out of the nature of those beings, what they want, and why they seem to think that their 'mission' is of vital importance for the future of humanity."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cBJ5mo_rDTk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/64100af9ee33066cb1850240479715f9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cBJ5mo_rDTk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features to expect from it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>A classic point-and-click adventure experience:</strong> we're very proud to feature our own distinct style, but we are also definitely influenced by games like Monkey Island or Beneath a Steel Sky and try to please both veteran afficionados of the genre and newcomers alike with a traditional pixel-art appearance and a streamlined, modern approach to game design</li>
<li><strong>Movement everywhere:</strong> you won't feel like you're walking through a still life painting; Born Punk's world is alive and full of animation, soundscapes and small details to discover</li>
<li><strong>Choices and consequences:</strong> often, it's possible to approach dialogues and puzzles from different angles. As a result, interactions and dialogues with other characters, the difficulty to overcome certain obstacles, and the results of many actions will vary greatly depending on what the player chooses to do</li>
<li><strong>Full voice-overs:</strong> every character in Born Punk and every line is voiced by professional voice actors. Yes, that includes the cat.</li>
<li><strong>Bombastic music:</strong> the main theme and various other tracks are composed by Jeff Kurtenacker, composer of Wildstar and choral arranger of World of Warcraft. Jeff is joined by a merry band of synthwave musicians to create a genuine and emotional cyberpunk/sci-fi soundtrack with a Nordic twist</li>
<li><strong>Let's be serious, it's funny:</strong> Born Punk is science-fiction with heavy cyberpunk influences; but we're also boasting a hopeful, often humorous undertone. Point &amp; click adventures without at least a bit of humour are unthinkable to us!</li>
<li><strong>A comprehensive universe:</strong> there's a slew of background info to read and experience, all of which becomes available in your PDA as you interact with the game world. Sometimes, in-game lore will also serve as an optional gameplay mechanic.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/979480/Born_Punk/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Currently both <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/born_punk" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://insertdisk22.itch.io/born-punk" target="_blank">itch.io</a> only have the Windows builds.</p>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 gets a surprise update fixing many problems</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Looks like Valve are getting back into fixing up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/" target="_blank">Team Fortress 2</a>, which has been a long-time coming and after fans have been campaigning to get Valve to do something.</p>
<p>TF2 has had so many problems with bots over the last year or two, that it became largely unplayable most often as bots would just repeatedly ruin games. There were other issues but that was the biggest. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/valve-say-they-will-look-into-fixing-up-the-bot-problems-in-team-fortress-2/" target="_blank">Valve said back in May</a> they were listening and would do something about it.</p>
<p>On June 21st a fresh update was released that fixed quite a few exploits like being able to clear the in-game text chat and players could use cheats on secure servers amongst other annoyances. There's various bug fixes too like projectiles sometimes colliding with teammates too early / late and the Spy using the incorrect weapons when disguised.</p>
<p>Another addition in this patch is an updated voting system that should also help that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both teams can have a kick vote running at the same time</li>
<li>Can have a global vote running at the same time as a kick vote</li>
<li>Fixed sometimes not being able to vote on maps at the end of the round</li>
</ul>
<p>Really great to see Valve giving TF2 some love. It remains as one of the most popular games available on Steam and it appears this patch has bumped the player numbers up once again.</p>

      <title>Inscryption from Daniel Mullins Games now supported on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The mixture of a deckbuilding roguelike with escape-room style puzzles and psychological horror in Inscryption is now officially available for Linux with a Native build. Developed by Daniel Mullins Games and published by Devolver Digital, this very popular and well-reviewed game originally released back in October 2021.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the developer noted that while working on the Linux (and macOS) ports that they "came across some issues that have existed in the Windows version since Kaycee's Mod" so thanks to the porting work the game will be improving for all players.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WDAJ10sjpPI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/856b0175cdbdf8372ac9250eb50eb631.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WDAJ10sjpPI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>About the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the creator of Pony Island and The Hex comes the latest mind melting, self-destructing love letter to video games. Inscryption is an inky black card-based odyssey that blends the deckbuilding roguelike, escape-room style puzzles, and psychological horror into a blood-laced smoothie. Darker still are the secrets inscrybed upon the cards...</p>
<p>In Inscryption you will...</p>
<ul>
<li>Acquire a deck of woodland creature cards by draft, surgery, and self mutilation</li>
<li>Unlock the secrets lurking behind the walls of Leshy's cabin</li>
<li>Embark on an unexpected and deeply disturbing odyssey</li>
</ul>

      <title>Meet me at NooN is a sweet new puzzler with time-loop mechanics</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Meet me at NooN is the first game from the duo at Pandaroo Interactive and quite an impressive entry to the puzzle genre.</p>
<p>In the game you control two spirits that create time loops of their day. So each move you do is recorded and played back, while you're controlling the other. It's pretty fun to see in action and while simple, quite an enjoyable little experience to watch and learn and go through the levels. The good thing is that this is a game with no pressure. There's no way to actually lose and no timers so you go at your own pace. If you go wrong you can just adjust the timeline and go back.</p>

      <title>RTS game TFC: The Fertile Crescent gets a great looking roadmap</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>TFC: The Fertile Crescent is a pixel-art RTS that resembles some of the classics like Age of Empires. It's currently in Early Access with Native Linux support and their new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1674820/view/5967847045493589913" target="_blank">roadmap</a> looks great.</p>
<p>Inspired by real history of the Near East Bronze Age era, TFC utilizes classic RTS elements while offering a unique perspective for the genre. One big change is how Food is not just used for building up your army but also changes how your population grows, and how quickly you can gain Knowledge Points to do research. It's a very interesting system that feels quite different to others like it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Z6qLkWwHx4s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/02477f4d339ac25c54e11aec5b3f3e1c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Z6qLkWwHx4s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Their new roadmap shows that across this year they plan to add in more single-player skirmish options, the ability to play against AI with friends online, an online co-op horde mode, neutral settlements, hotkey customization and unit stances. That's only for this year. Next year they have some other big updates planned too like new civilizations, new technologies, new map types like oceans and rivers, multiplayer matchmaking and more.</p>
<p>All sounding pretty great and it's easily worth playing right now.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1674820/TFC_The_Fertile_Crescent/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Powered by the awesome GZDoom game engine, Hands of Necromancy looks like another solid choice for those of you (like me!) who absolutely love retro shooters. Made in the spirit of the classics like Heretic, Hexen, Doom and Quake it does look pretty good.</p>
<p>"You are a Necromancer: a lone sorcerer who seeks to grow ever more powerful and learn new forms of dark magic. You search for challengers to fight, so you can hone your wicked craft. You destroy many monsters and wild creatures, yet none of them seem truly worth the fight...</p>
<p>However, one day, suddenly more creatures entering your world. You know something bad is happening, but maybe this is an opportunity to prove your might and show the world that you are the truly fearsome mage you always knew yourself to be."</p>

<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore many beautiful environments - a country side, a forest, a cemetery, a castle, an ice cave, a volcano, and more - all teeming with danger to prove yourself against, as their denizens try to destroy you.</li>
<li>Get weapons, use magic spells, and learn transformations to fight your enemies, using their own abilities against them and bending nature to your own will.</li>
<li>Use the Tornado Spell to toss your enemies away with wind, or the Ring of Ice to freeze them solid, or even an Unholy Hand Grenade to blow them to smithereens!</li>
<li>Gain transformations as you grow in power - become the Swamp Serpent who can slither into tight spaces while breathing underwater, or the Stone Breaker Golem that smashes walls into tiny bits, the Hell Burner Demon that safely walks on lava, or even a flying Wyvern!</li>
<li>All of them are your key to defeating the many creatures in this metroidvania, as you explore the 21 maps in 3 giant and exciting hubs!</li>
</ul>

      <title>3,500 games now Steam Deck Verified or Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another great milestone has been hit for the Steam Deck, with Valve's popular Linux-powered handheld now having 3,500 games rated as either Verified or Playable.</p>
<p>Back on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/new-steam-deck-verified-titles-now-over-3200-playable/" target="_blank">June 7th</a> it only just hit 3,200 so the rate continues at a nice steady pace. As a reminder though, Deck Verified is just the formal verification system. Plenty of games that haven't been tested work just fine, and some that are listed as Unsupported also work fine (or can do with one or two tweaks). You also have access to emulation and retro gaming, external launchers and much more. The Steam Deck is incredibly versatile.</p>
<p>The numbers right now at time of writing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div class="flex-image-text-align"><img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified: 1755</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="flex-image-text-align"><img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable: 1803</div>

      <title>Erannorth Chronicles gets fixed up for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Erannorth Chronicles, what the developer says blends together an old-school card game with tabletop RPG-like progression recently had an upgrade to make it work nicely on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>A game all about freedom, with some pretty deep mechanics allowing you to build up your character and your deck of cards while you explore a giant sandbox world with many different locations, challenges, and treasure hunts. There's no big story to follow, so the game is very much what you make of it. The intention from the developer appears to be giving you a big playground to have a run through and see what you can create and conquer.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/828555721655815984gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/828555721655815984gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Currently tagged as Unsupported by Valve on the Steam Deck, a new release went up on June 12th aiming to fix up some issues so hopefully this will bump it up to at least Playable officially.</p>
<p>Here's what they changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added a check if the game is running in Steam Deck to set the resolution to 1280x720 instead of 1280x800. As the game only supports that.</li>
<li>Settings for the Steam Deck will be stored in a separate file. The corresponding settings will load based on whether you are running the game on Steam Deck or your PC.</li>
<li>The split effect wasn't displaying in the non-Damage cards, which could be confusing as to why it appears if a Damage effect was added to them.</li>
<li>Chaotic effect in Split cards didn't have a visual indication that its damage would Split. It will now display both elements.</li>
<li>Updated Unity to v2021.3.4.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Looks like Valve are gearing up for a new &#39;Deckard&#39; VR Headset</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We've sort-of known for a while that Valve were working towards a next-generation VR headset to succeed the Valve Index and we've now seen a lot more supporting evidence that it's getting closer.</p>
<p>Plenty of this is thanks to the tireless work of XR Hardware Analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/SadlyItsBradley" target="_blank">Brad Lynch</a>, who had been keeping an eye out for anything interesting that pops up. The codename of the device appears to be "Deckard", and a lot of the information is actually thanks to SteamDB who constantly track updates to Steam code on their <a href="https://github.com/SteamDatabase/GameTracking-SteamVR" target="_blank">GitHub</a> where you can see a lot of the text strings being added in preparation.</p>
<p>You can see Lynch go over plenty of the leaked info in the below video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ovlbXVwoN8s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a31ac79f35ae73506de165abfa36c975.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ovlbXVwoN8s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As a huge fan of the Valve Index, which I took a look at some time ago, the idea that we might be able to play without wires hooked up to a PC is thoroughly exciting. Even more exciting, is that it's quite likely in any standalone mode that it would use Linux, which is again a good reason for Valve to continue working on Proton outside of the use on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Then there's also the <a href="https://pdfaiw.uspto.gov/.aiw?PageNum=0&amp;docid=20220187609&amp;IDKey=62CCF93BD70F" target="_blank">recent Patent</a>, which shows off a possible new design of Valve's upcoming VR headset. The patent was filed in December 2021, and went public on June 16 2022. The patent is focused more on the fitting with the strap system, rather than going into technical details on how it will function. Still, we do get a little hint as to what it may have with the patent mentioning "the rear housing may house wireless transceivers, a battery, microphones, input/output devices, processors" and it also mentions the front may have "antenna(s)" and a few other references that do indicate wireless play.</p>
<p>Obviously it's not a confirmation that one will actually be released but still fun to see and clearly Valve are working on something big.</p>

      <title>Missed your Steam Deck email? Valve confirms a grace period to still get one</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Given how busy some of us are, it can still be quite easy to miss that Steam Deck email coming in to make your purchase through the reservation system. The good news is, you do actually have a few extra days after the timer is up.</p>
<p>The way the system works is that you put down a reservation (only one per Steam account at a time), and <em>eventually</em> you get the chance to buy a Steam Deck. This has helped against scalpers buying them all up and allow Valve to have time to produce enough. Once you get your final purchase email, you have about 72 hours to actually pay for it otherwise it's supposed to go onto the next person in the queue. The purchase email even clearly says " If you don't complete your purchase by this time, we will automatically cancel your reservation.".</p>
<p>However, Valve has now officially <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1538949772010086400" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that's <em>not</em> quite the case.</p>
<p>If you do <em>miss</em> that window of opportunity to buy your Steam Deck, there "is a grace period of a few days" where you can reach out to Steam Support who will hook you up. All you need to do is go to the <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithSteamDeck" target="_blank">support page</a>, and hit "Contact Steam Support".</p>
<p>Nice to see Valve are giving people more than one opportunity to ensure they get their Deck.</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer - Part 17: The Llama Master</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-16-we-are-all-doomed/" target="_blank">Part 16: We Are All Doomed</a></strong></p>
<p>While first person shooters dominated the Linux gaming scene in the late 1990s and early 2000s, there was still more than a place for the venerable strategy genre; it should be remembered that the first game Loki Software ported over to Linux was the then latest iteration in the <em>Civilization</em> series. From this foundation other strategy titles soon followed, with Ubi Soft entering the fray thanks to the work of Linux friendly Philos Laboratories.</p>
<p><em>Theocracy </em>is a mix of real time and turn based strategy that sees you leading an Aztec tribe in the century leading up to the arrival of Hernán Cortés, with the ultimate goal being an alternate history scenario where the Aztecs are able to fend off the Spanish conquistadors. Beyond this the game is fantastical, inventing tribes, magical sects, fabled heroes, and featuring a whole host of fauna alien to Mesoamerica, including dragons, llamas, chickens, and the most inaccurate, pigs.</p>
<p>The game overall has an admirable depth of well crafted lore only brought down by the Hungarian developer's occasional lapse into broken English; the worst offender being the use of the word "Wary" to mean belligerent in the Diplomacy Panel. The narrator for the tutorial and scenario briefings also has a way with words that can be at best described as memorable, with his use of the phrase "llama masters can be educated in the llama lair" being a particular earworm. </p>
<p>Unlike with games from Loki Software or similar porting houses, Philos Laboratories bundled the Linux version alongside the Windows retail release, making <em>Theocracy</em> that much easier to track down. On the first CD-ROM you can find a directory containing a text based linux.inst installer, which sets the file paths and copies over the relevant data files. From there the game can be ran using the /usr/games/theocracy binary as long as the second disc is mounted.</p>
<p>The Linux version demands the game be launched at 16 bit colour depth and shows at a fixed 800x600 resolution, either in windowed mode or borderless fullscreen. Cutscenes meanwhile are displayed at 640x480 without any kind of scaling. The option for grabbing the mouse inside the game window only applies while in Province View, and I was unable to have the game recognize the keyboard from Blackbox, forcing me to play <em>Theocracy</em> from Gnome instead.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/376340911655670281gol6.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/376340911655670281gol6.jpg"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10974161811655690882gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10974161811655690882gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>Released in March 2000 with a historical theme and similar art style, <em>Theocracy</em> was most often compared to and was largely overshadowed by <em>Age of Empires</em>, even though they are very different games. In terms of my tactics I actually found more in common with Infinity Engine titles such as <em>Baldur's Gate</em> and <em>Icewind Dale</em>, with the emphasis on choke points, crowd control, magical buffing, experience leveling, and war party formation while in combat.</p>
<p>I do not think I ever won a battle by outnumbering the opposing army; instead, most of my success came from causing the enemy troops to trip over themselves, often aided by the game's ropy path finding. The sheer scale of the rival forces and the lack of difficulty modes make <em>Theocracy</em> more intimidating than it needs to be, but with effort I was able to defeat both the Iztahuacans and Teotitlans in 30 years in-game and had a close to clear run to the Spanish.</p>
<p>In the end it was not the game's difficulty that felled me, but an unfortunate bug. Upon exceeding 52 saved games from the same campaign <em>Theocracy</em> will start corrupting your save files, a laughable ceiling given how much trial and error is required to progress through the game. Some have reported being able to get past this point by correcting the number overflows in the save file using a hex editor, but I have not managed this feat myself at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Apart from this though <em>Theocracy</em> only froze for me once, although the performance at times left something to be desired. Despite the boast on the back of the box of "an amazing game engine" that can display "up to 50000 units on the screen without any slowdown", the game would still lag even with my hardware exceeding the recommended specifications. This was even worse under Windows 98, with the Linux version running noticeably smoother.</p>
<p>All of these things can make <em>Theocracy</em> feel as if it has been lost to time, much like the Aztecs themselves. There has been some success in getting the game running in a dedicated X session on later versions of Linux, but few games benefit from having access to retro hardware as much as this. I still have unfinished business with <em>Theocracy</em>, and I am not waving the white flag just yet, but for now I am in the mood for something lighter, and much less time consuming.</p>

      <title>Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved on Steam Deck is absolutely awesome</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved on Steam Deck, a classic from back in the Xbox 360 days has a version on Steam and it works so beautifully on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>This is a true bit of nostalgia hitting for me, as I continue to put hour after hour into various games on Steam Deck, I keep coming back to the classics. Geometry Wars was originally a mini-game in Project Gotham Racing 2 it was later turned into Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved as a standalone title and went onto become one of the most downloaded Xbox Live Arcade games.</p>
<p>Once again thanks to Steam Play Proton, it works out of the box as a Deck Verified title. You only need to go into the settings and put it to the correct resolution — and then dive in for many hours of blasting away various shapes with a good 6 hours easily on the battery life with it at 60FPS. It look simply amazing.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="r9FcR1i5WnQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ba13fc019c9c035343fb23bdec83ae68.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/r9FcR1i5WnQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This to me, really shows how incredibly the Steam Deck is. Not only will it play some of the latest AAA games (although often in lower visuals and 30/40 FPS), you can emulate tons of other systems but also get back into classics like this that you can enjoy wherever you are.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/8400/Geometry_Wars_Retro_Evolved/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Westwood classic RPG &#39;Nox&#39; lives on with the OpenNox game engine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Westwood Studios made quite a lot of games like Dune II and the Command &amp; Conquer series but they also made an RPG called Nox, that now lives on with the <a href="https://github.com/noxworld-dev/opennox" target="_blank">OpenNox</a> game engine. OpenNox just recently had a new release, and the project is now open source too under the GPL!</p>
<p>Released originally in the year 2000, Nox was received very well by the gaming press at the time and lives on in the hearts of many gamers. Thankfully now though, OpenNox gives you a fresh way to play it on modern platforms like Linux and Windows. OpenNox is a fully-featured game engine reimplementation too supporting the original features plus plenty of enhancements including: improving modding support, higher resolutions, much better online play and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12232063751655724692gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12232063751655724692gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Like other open source reimplementations, it does not include copyrighted assets and so you do need to own a copy of the game to play it which you can <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/nox" target="_blank">buy on GOG.com</a>.</p>

      <title>Proton and Wine updater ProtonUp-Qt now shows anti-cheat status</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another update to the free and open source app <a href="https://github.com/DavidoTek/ProtonUp-Qt" target="_blank">ProtonUp-Qt</a> giving you a proper user interface for downloading GE-Proton, Luxtorpeda, Wine-GE and others for Steam Deck and Linux. It works with Steam, Heroic Games Launcher, Bottles and Lutris.</p>
<p>Version 2.6.5 brings the ability to see the anti-cheat status in the game list you can open. A pretty useful little addition, since a previous version also added showing Steam Deck compatibility too so now you can get it together all in one list. Additionally this update will also show what games using Lutris too in the compatibility info.</p>

      <title>Microsoft chucks GNOME $10,000 from their FOSS Fund</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Everyone knows that Microsoft absolutely loves Linux right? Well, that's debatable but hey they did just reach down the back of the sofa and chuck GNOME some cash.</p>
<p>As part of their ongoing <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/foss-fund" target="_blank">Free and Open Source Software Fund</a> (FOSS Fund for short), part of their Microsoft Open Source Programs Office, Microsoft engineers participate in selecting various projects they feel could benefit from a little extra help. No strings attached, no big fancy marketing of Microsoft trying to do something nefarious, just Microsoft workers voting to give out some money to free and open source projects they find interesting.</p>
<p>Just a few days ago it was announced that GNOME was the latest winner of $10,000. Previous winners include systemd, OpenStreetMap, QEMU and various others.</p>
<p>Every month they start a new selection process, which results in a new project getting the $10,000 bonus which is usually paid in 10 monthly installments of $1,000. There's only a few requirements to be considered including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The open source project must be used by Microsoft.</li>
<li>Project is actively prioritizing diversity, equity and inclusion.</li>
<li>The project must have an <a href="https://opensource.org/" target="_blank">OSI-approved open source license</a></li>
<li>Needs to have a way to receive funds that our procurement and legal teams are happy with (<a href="https://github.com/sponsors" target="_blank">GitHub Sponsors</a> is great!)</li>
<li>the project cannot be owned by a Microsoft employee</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As a side-note, it's quite interesting to see that even Microsoft see the OSI as the go-to for proper open source licenses.</p>

      <title>Heroes of Might and Magic II reimplementation gets big audio improvements and AI speedup</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Heroes of Might and Magic II game engine reimplementation, fheroes2, has another great new release out continuing to be the absolute best way to play this classic on modern platforms.</p>
<p>The developer emailed in to let us know about some big changes. Firstly, it's had a huge overhaul to the audio code. Not only will it properly resume audio from where it was stopped (like the original game), it will also now update the surrounding sounds on the map on every step on the hero. Plus fixes to some incorrect sounds and rocks in water with seagulls now have their own sound. On top of that, a 3D Audio feature was added for objects on the map to give it a whole new depth.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11426023961655719942gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11426023961655719942gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>AI is now smarter (yes, again!) and even faster at calculations than before making the whole game feel smoother and play better.</p>
<p>New Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Introduce music resuming while switching tracks for MP3, FLAC and OGG music formats</li>
<li>Add 3D audio option for objects on Adventure Map</li>
<li>Fix all map lose / win conditions and make AI be aware of them</li>
<li>Add Campaign High Scores</li>
<li>Improve German, Polish, Ukrainian, Romanian translations and add Belarusian, Spanish and Swedish translations</li>
<li>Speed up AI by average 10%</li>
<li>Fix rendering of Red Tower of Sorceress castle</li>
<li>Rework "No interface" option</li>
<li>Over <em><strong>40</strong></em> bugs are fixed since 0.9.15 release</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>The Cycle: Frontier works nicely on Steam Deck and Linux desktops</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Initially an Epic Store exclusive, you can now play The Cycle: Frontier free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/868270/The_Cycle_Frontier/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and thanks to Proton — on Steam Deck and Linux desktops.</p>
<p>An interesting point about this game, is that it uses BattlEye but it appears the developer has it fully online for Linux. You only need to ensure you install the "Proton BattlEye Runtime" in your Steam Library and then it will just work with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/proton-70-3-is-out-further-improving-compatibility-on-steam-deck-and-linux/" target="_blank">latest Proton 7.0-3 release</a>.</p>
<p>What is it? A mixture of player versus player first-person combat, with it blending in environmental dangers from various creatures and a big storm too. The idea is that you jump in solo or with a crew, loot away and do missions and attempt extraction whenever you want to keep your goods or die trying and lose a bunch. It's a lot of fun actually and while not perfect, the developer seems to have a clear plan to keep improving it and it's already one of the most popular games on Steam.</p>
<p>Here's a video of it on both Steam Deck and my Fedora 36 desktop:</p>

      <title>Steam Deck back to being the global top seller (by revenue) on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a brief stint at number 2 thanks to the popularity of V Rising, the Steam Deck has moved firmly back into place at number 1 on the top sellers list.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://steamdb.info/topsellers/" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> tracking it, we can see that the Steam Deck has been the top seller by revenue for the last 3 weeks. We don't know how many units that is though, since Valve don't allow anyone to see. This means that overall, the Steam Deck has been at least number 1 or number 2 on the global top sellers for around <u>15</u> weeks now.</p>
<p>While we don't know the number, we know it's going to be quite high. When you take into account that V Rising hit over 1.5 million sales, Elden Ring still sits in the top-ten and has sold multiple million and…you get the idea. While the Steam Deck costs a lot more, it still means it has sold quite a lot. So the Steam Deck is very much a <strong>big</strong> success for Valve overall.</p>
<p><em>ICYMI: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/07/faster-zombies-to-steam-deck-the-history-of-valve-and-linux-gaming/" target="_blank">Faster Zombies to Steam Deck: The History of Valve and Linux Gaming</a></em></p>
<p>It quickly became my own number 1 way to play games. The convenience of it is just simply amazing. I fully expect it to continue flicking between number 1 and 2 for another year yet, which will depend on what big releases appear on Steam to push it down momentarily.</p>

      <title>Arthurian legend merged with sci-fi horror, The Hand of Merlin is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for another turn-based RPG with some rogue-lite mechanics, with the addition of a pretty strange storyline? The Hand of Merlin is out now with Native Linux support.</p>
<p>The Hand of Merlin is a turn-based rogue-lite RPG in which Arthurian legend clashes with dark and foreboding sci-fi horror. This unusual merging of genres introduces a wholly unique sci-fi element to its storytelling. Utilizing both squad-based and turn-based combat, players can employ tactical cunning to use cover, set up ambushes and coordinate attacks with ranged, melee and spell-casting combat to conquer both human and unworldly abhorrent creatures and other enemy characters they encounter on their quest.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="az8yilwPtiI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ffe249544660e9b93d7c193c1a3207b2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/az8yilwPtiI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“Throughout Early Access we’ve committed a lot of time and energy into community feedback with a series of updates that have really embellished the games features and replayability based upon what the community was telling us, we’re extremely pleased with the results and the work the team has done to make The Hand of Merlin a truly competitive rogue-lite RPG.“ Said Robert Sajko Creative Director at Room C Games.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/the-hand-of-merlin?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/600610/The_Hand_of_Merlin/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.

      <title>FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE arrives on Steam — plus it&#39;s Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE has officially landed on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1462040/FINAL_FANTASY_VII_REMAKE_INTERGRADE/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, and the good news is that it works on Linux plus it's Steam Deck Verified. Seems Valve were well aware to get it Deck Verified status right away, looks like we know why <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/proton-70-3-is-out-further-improving-compatibility-on-steam-deck-and-linux/" target="_blank">Proton 7.0-3 released recently then</a>!</p>
<p>You know the Steam Deck is getting noticed, and clearly <em>important</em> to the gaming industry, when the Final Fantasy VII series Executive Produce at Square Enix mentions it directly in the 25th Anniversary Celebration video that you can see below. I think the importance of moments like that cannot be overstated. The Steam Deck mention is at about 3:40.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wohQiEysqIA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9184c75108971fa4977a83531f04ede1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wohQiEysqIA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Since it's a big one, and one I was hoping to eventually play personally, I decided to dive in and take a quick look. Since it's Steam Deck Verified, every part of it <em>should</em> work well but that does depend on how thorough the verification system is, for such an expansive game.</p>
<p>Here's a fresh video for you (personal purchase from <a href="http://www.humblebundle.com/store/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>):</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="okmu4ra0f1I"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8de22a1d2522cd3e38d869c7101eb133.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/okmu4ra0f1I" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>According to the Steam page this is what's included:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE contains the following content:<br/>
- FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE full game<br/>
- DLC "FF7R EPISODE INTERmission" (New episode featuring Yuffie Kisaragi)<br/>
- Weapon: Cacstar<br/>
- Armor: Midgar Bangle<br/>
- Armor: Shinra Bangle<br/>
- Armor: Corneo Armlet<br/>
- Accessory: Superstar Belt<br/>
- Accessory: Mako Crystal<br/>
- Accessory: Seraphic Earrings<br/>
- Summon materia: Carbuncle<br/>
- Summon materia: Chocobo Chick<br/>
- Summon materia: Cactuar</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1462040/FINAL_FANTASY_VII_REMAKE_INTERGRADE/" target="_blank">Steam</a> now. <em>You save a little extra if you're a Humble Choice sub too.</em></p>
<p>The next game in the series, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, is confirmed for 2024 but will be exclusive to the PS5. Well, for now anyway, eventually it's likely to come to Steam just like other PlayStation games have been. Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII Reunion, a remake of Crisis Core: Final Fantasy 7 for PSP, is also confirmed to be coming to Steam "this Winter".</p>
<p>Oh and if you missed it, we're even getting Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1817070/Marvels_SpiderMan_Remastered/" target="_blank">Steam</a> in August. So hopefully Proton will be ready for that too.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>An absolute gem of a game this and now perhaps a good time to go back and spend some proper time with it, as the rather large The Sunken Sea update is out now.</p>
<p>Blending elements and a feel of the likes of Minecraft, Terraria and more it's a great underground exploration and crafting game that's currently in Early Access. It continues to do well after selling 500K in two weeks.</p>
<p>The new biome can be accessed once you've defeated the first three bosses, which brings down the wall that separates the sections of the game. There's also the sub-biome Forlorn Metropolis, a new boss, a new side-boss, 5 new enemies, a fishing merchant, boats, a new workbench type, portals you can craft for teleporting around, 10 new weapons including a bow, new food and fish types and lots more. Trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7wrQNpT6QNQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/22c933b365cc37743f1ced94584f366d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7wrQNpT6QNQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Looking forward to digging more into this one. Works great on desktop Linux and Steam Deck with the Native Linux build that's Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Available to buy from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/core-keeper?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1621690/Core_Keeper/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Epic Online Services gets free cross-play tooling that will support Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Epic Games just announced a <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-online-services-release-free-pc-crossplay-tools?sessionInvalidated=true" target="_blank">big upgrade</a> to Epic Online Services, which will now include a full toolkit to enable developers to do cross-play.</p>
<p>Currently, the initial release of the new tools in the EOS SDK supports "PC" (they mean Windows), but they fully plan to support Linux and macOS as well. They already support Epic and Steam directly with more stores coming and consoles / mobile support coming later. EOS includes a special overlay (like the Steam Overlay) that brings together Steam and Epic friends and all the integration into a single list.</p>
<p>For game developers, this sounds thoroughly useful.</p>
<p>What it includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>All friends, one place.</strong> Steam and Epic Games Store friends merge into one overlay allowing players to see all friends in a single list.</li>
<li>Integrated game invites. In-game, players can search and send invites to friends across Steam and the Epic Games Store, making connecting and playing together easy.</li>
<li><strong>Account linking.</strong> Onboarding without emails or password prompts. With just a few clicks, Steam players can jump into a game while an Epic Games account is created under the hood for their Steam account.</li>
<li><strong>Update-free improvements.</strong> When games are installed, the crossplay features are distributed via a self-updating in-game overlay. Players can enjoy new features and improvements without needing to update anything themselves.</li>
<li><strong>Plug-and-play SDK.</strong> Each Epic Online Services toolset is self-contained, so developers can mix and match the services they want to implement, incorporate the things they want, and leave the rest. Crossplay tools are no different.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully people will use this over Vivox, which still doesn't support Linux and can be quite problematic with Proton too. Even if you don't particularly like the Epic Games Store, what they offer with Epic Online Services seems pretty great.</p>

      <title>Starship Troopers: Terran Command on Steam Deck and Linux — a quick guide</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Starship Troopers: Terran Command [<a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/starship-troopers-terran-command?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> / <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1202130/Starship_Troopers_Terran_Command/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>] just released from The Artistocrats and Slitherine Ltd. but getting it on running on Linux desktop or Steam Deck requires a few steps. Video steps at the bottom if you prefer that.</p>
<p>Technically, on a Linux desktop it works out of the box with Proton but the videos don't play. For both Steam Deck and Linux you will need the community made GE-Proton. To grab GE-Proton you can use <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/net.davidotek.pupgui2" target="_blank">ProtonUp-Qt</a>, which I did <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/protonup-qt-got-upgraded-heres-how-to-use-it-on-steam-deck-and-linux/" target="_blank">a previous tutorial on</a>. No doubt an official Proton update will come to help but this will get you going right now.</p>
<p>Once you have ProtonUp-Qt and then use it to download GE-Proton, set the game to use GE-Proton in the Compatibility menu in the Properties (restart Steam for it to show up). On Desktop:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9570155051655404500gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9570155051655404500gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>And on Steam Deck:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16786283601655404553gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16786283601655404553gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Once done you will need to add this as a launch option otherwise while the videos play they don't look right at all:</p>
<p><code>WINE_DO_NOT_CREATE_DXGI_DEVICE_MANAGER=1 %command%</code></p>
<p>To do the launch option, it's in the Properties menu of your game on Steam. On Desktop simply right click -&gt; Properties and then enter it in:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11181144691655404269gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11181144691655404269gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>And on Steam Deck. Pick the game in your Library, go to the Cog icon on the right and go to Properties and enter it in:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4403364001655404353gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4403364001655404353gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>An extra fix needed for the <u>Steam Deck</u> specifically, is to have the launcher close when you hit play. Otherwise you just get a black screen! Find the "Launcher.exe.config" file in your installed folder, open it with a text editor and line 76 will have this:</p>
<p><code>add key="CloseAfterStart" value="false"</code></p>
<p>Change it to:</p>
<p><code>add key="CloseAfterStart" value="true"</code></p>
<p>Now it will work properly on Steam Deck too. Another case of a random launcher being a nuisance.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>An immersive storyline campaign featuring unique missions, characters and a lot of Starship Troopers flavor.</li>
<li>Dozens of unique unit types, each with their own special abilities.</li>
<li>Terrain elevation, True Line of Sight &amp; True Line of Fire provide deep tactical gameplay.</li>
<li>Capture and hold vital radio stations, construct base defenses to repel Arachnid attacks and deploy technology buildings to unlock new weaponry.</li>
<li>Heroics, explosions, gore, and Bugs. Lots of Bugs.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the game, so far it seems reasonably good. I love the attempt to capture to cheesiness from the original movie. We don't talk about the two sequels.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/starship-troopers-terran-command?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1202130/Starship_Troopers_Terran_Command/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready to get punched with nostalgia and eat some pizza? Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge is officially out now along with Native Linux support and it's looking good on desktop and a Steam Deck too. Note: personal purchase.</p>
<p>"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge features groundbreaking gameplay rooted in timeless classic brawling mechanics, brought to you by the beat ’em up experts at Dotemu (Streets of Rage 4) and Tribute Games. Bash your way through gorgeous pixel art environments and slay tons of hellacious enemies with your favorite Turtle, each with his own skills and moves - making each run unique! Choose a fighter, use radical combos to defeat your opponents and experience intense combats loaded with breathtaking action and outrageous ninja abilities. Stay sharp as you face off against Shredder and his faithful Foot Clan alone, or grab your best buds and play with up to 6 players simultaneously!"</p>
<p>This is basically a massive homage to classic beat 'em ups, TMNT, old cartoons and retro gaming all in one and I firmly welcome it. It's absolutely gorgeous but wow it will make your thumbs ache. That intro video as well, wow, what memories from my childhood! Launch trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ozKsDzumb0c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6d95df53e619596267131012c5405d57.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ozKsDzumb0c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features Include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Iconic 80s inspired retro Turtles brawling action on modern platforms </li>
<li>Six player local &amp; online co-op, featuring April O’Neil and Casey Jones’ playable debut in a TMNT beat-em-up</li>
<li>Attributes, moves and animations tailored to each fighter, channeling their personality and granting a unique edge in battle</li>
<li>Gorgeous pixel renders of signature locales like Dimension X, Coney Island and more</li>
<li>Absolutely bangin’ OST composed by Tee Lopes featuring cultural icons Ghostface Killah and Raekwon</li>
<li>Expertly crafted platform brawler gameplay from the teams who brought you <em>Streets of Rage 4</em> and <em>Panzer Paladin</em></li>
<li>Bodacious replayability from the challenge to master all seven characters with gameplay that makes each run feel totally radical</li>
</ul>
<p>Since it's a beat 'em up, there's quite a lot of moves to learn. As you first get into the game, there's 21 animated in-game slides of various moves to learn. Naturally you can't be expected to learn them all right away but a good bit of button-bashing is often all your need to make your way through and enjoy these types of games. Thankfully, you can access to move list from the pause menu at any point.</p>

      <title>The Frogs will take you through a humorous renaissance artwork adventure</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Making use of public domain renaissance artwork, The Frogs is an upcoming comedy point and click adventure. A demo is available and now they're on Kickstarter. Very similar in style to what was done with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/04/the-procession-to-calvary-is-a-brilliantly-funny-adventure-of-renaissance-paintings-stitched-together" target="_blank">The Procession to Calvary</a> (different developer), and actually inspired by it. More of this sounds great because it's such a unique way to make a game.</p>
<p>"Join Dionysus, the Greek god of wine, ecstasy, and (most importantly) theater on a journey to Athens and subsequently the underworld in a comedic romp that pays homage to Aristophanes and his brilliant work, The Frogs! Over 15 hours of snark, satire and absurdity await as Dionysus must solve puzzles, convince people that he is a fun drunk and not just annoying, and find a replacement for the horrible poets and playwrights that are plaguing his festivals."</p>

<p>Just recently it went live on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1792467505/the-frogs" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, where they have 58 days to hit $8,500 in funding.</p>
<p>What the developer says it will feature includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Innovative Point-and-Click Interface</li>
<li>Ancient Humor Circa 405 BCE</li>
<li>Choices That Matter</li>
<li>Multiple Solutions to Puzzles</li>
<li>Renaissance Artwork</li>
<li>Classical Music</li>
<li>Hidden Optional Content</li>
<li>Tons Of Interactive Elements and NPCs</li>
<li>References So Niche You'll Wonder Why I Bothered</li>
<li>Multiple Endings Whether Aristophanes Likes It Or Not</li>
<li>What's He Gonna Do? Come Back From the Dead and Get Me?</li>
</ul>

      <title>Total War: WARHAMMER III released for Linux with a port from Feral</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Total War: WARHAMMER III is the latest Native Linux game to officially land, with Feral Interactive once again delivering. The Linux version has the latest 1.2 update along with the hotfix from late in May.</p>
<p>WARHAMMER III plunges players into a cataclysmic power struggle between mortals and daemons with each aiming to save or exploit the power of a dying god. Featuring seven diverse playable races - including the video-game debuts of Grand Cathay and Kislev - alongside ground-breaking new features such as the Realm of Chaos campaign, eight-player multiplayer, and the customisable RPG-like Daemon Prince Legendary Lord.</p>
<p>Currently though, it seems to be the lowest rated in the series, with even Total War: WARHAMMER II regularly seeing double the amount of players.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="senV4ZCKm4Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5c79920b934e7a6ad20ce08a66bc631e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/senV4ZCKm4Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Sadly, it's <em>another</em> port from Feral that has multiplayer locked per operating system. We repeatedly asked them to clarify it before release but they wouldn't say. Today at release they confirmed via <a href="https://twitter.com/feralgames/status/1537443725478985728" target="_blank">Twitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our version of the game allows online multiplayer between players on the same Operating System only.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you play the Linux port from Feral, you can <em>only</em> play other Linux port players. So if you want to play friends on Windows, you will still need to use the Proton compatibility layer to run the Windows version. A pretty big sore spot for a Linux port in 2022.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/total-war-warhammer-iii?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142710/Total_War_WARHAMMER_III/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Their new Linux and macOS trailer is below:</p>

      <title>The last ever game from Zachtronics releases July 5th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>No doubt plenty of puzzle fans will be sad, as Zachtronics will be hanging up their development hat and moving on after the release of Last Call BBS. Entering Early Access on July 5th, it's technically multiple games in one.</p>
<p>"Boot up your Z5 Powerlance and dial into Last Call BBS, the last game from Zachtronics!</p>
<p>The Barkeep’s loaded up his retro computer with a full set of puzzle games for you to download and play. No need to worry about copy protection, they’re all fully cracked and ready to enjoy!"</p>
<p>This isn't some marketing gimmick either, Zach has taken up a teaching job and really is moving on.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EdU-ABucIjk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/97a32015fdc3e15f50d716593b04f14b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EdU-ABucIjk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The games included:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>20th Century Food Court</strong>: Design factories to produce food just like they did over 700 years ago in the 20th century. Keep your costs low and your machines running fast!</li>
<li><strong>STEED FORCE Hobby Studio</strong>: Assemble robot models based on the anime smash hit Steed Force right on your computer. No sandpaper required!</li>
<li><strong>X’BPGH: The Forbidden Path</strong>: Enter a cursed world and create bizarre flesh sculptures in exchange for eternal life. The master is pleased… but can you trust him?</li>
<li><strong>Sawayama Solitaire</strong>: It wouldn’t be a Zachtronics release without a brand-new solitaire game. This time it’s a fresh take on Klondike, the “classic” solitaire variant.</li>
<li><strong>Dungeons &amp; Diagrams</strong>: Try your hand at these beguiling tile-based logic puzzles. Can you map out the dungeons and steal all the treasure?</li>
<li><strong>ChipWizard™ Professional</strong>: Build integrated circuits using wires, transistors, and capacitors. Wait a second, is this a game or a CAD program?</li>
<li><strong>HACK*MATCH</strong>: The tile-matching minigame from EXAPUNKS, completely remastered with a single player campaign and local head-to-head multiplayer (with Steam Remote Play support).</li>
<li><strong>Kabufuda Solitaire</strong>: Create matching sets of Japanese kabufuda cards in this retro-demake of the challenging original solitaire game that debuted in Eliza.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1511780/Last_Call_BBS/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>. Early Access will only last a couple of month to get any issues ironed-out and perhaps another mini-game before it's finally time to move on.</p>

      <title>LightSpeed Studios (Tencent) joins the Open 3D Foundation</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>LightSpeed Studios, owned by Tencent, has joined up with the Open 3D Foundation who oversee the <a href="https://www.o3de.org/" target="_blank">Open 3D Engine (O3DE)</a>. They've joined as a Premier Member joining the likes of Adobe, Epic Games, Microsoft, Intel and others. This means they will be giving resources to the Open 3D Foundation to further development of the Open 3D Engine.</p>
<p>On top of that though and I'm sure this will raise some eyebrows, Tencent Senior Project Manager, Lanye Wang, will join the Open 3D Foundation's Governing Board.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“We are very excited to join the Open 3D Foundation, especially for the opportunity to leverage the connection with all of the other members to dive deep into the graphic technologies and build a top-level open source 3D engine community,” said Lanye Wang, representing LightSpeed Studios. “We look forward to working with you.”</p>
<p>“It has been amazing to see the rapid growth of the O3D ecosystem, and we’re elated to welcome LightSpeed Studios to our community,” said Royal O’Brien, Executive Director of Open 3D Foundation and General Manager of Games and Digital Media at the Linux Foundation. “LightSpeed Studios has achieved a strong reputation as a leading global game developer, offering high-quality gaming experiences to hundreds of millions of users worldwide, and we are excited to collaborate with them as we enhance O3DE’s capabilities for global 3D developers.”</p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher has a bug fix release AND a huge new overhaul Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two goodies for fans of the open source Heroic Games Launcher today. Those sticking with the stable release get some fixes, and those who want some fun can try out a huge new Beta.</p>
<p>For the <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/tag/v2.3.9" target="_blank">v2.3.9</a> stable release the developers added in some fixes for GOG games that use DOSBox and ScummVM, further increasing the compatibility as Heroic will properly handle the configuration files for them now. Always great to see!</p>
<p>Heroic <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/tag/v2.4.0-beta" target="_blank">v2.4.0</a> Beta is where the fun begins. This is a huge change to how the app looks and works. The biggest changes include a new collapsible sidebar that stays open so you get access to many quick-functions like accessing your library, store pages, settings, the wine manager, download list and download status and more. It's actually really useful and makes Heroic feel a lot better.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5126101381655312855gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5126101381655312855gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3740439701655312851gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3740439701655312851gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>You will also notice that the library is now unified into one list, although you can filter it per-store. Game cards will also now always show the game title and buttons for play, settings and updating.</p>
<p>Plenty of other changes like an option to change the game language if supported, a fix for GOG games using DOSBox and ScummVM (just like the stable release) and much more.</p>
<p>You can still swap it to a list if you prefer it:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6425215761655313080gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6425215761655313080gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>What do you think to the changes?</p>

      <title>Build cities on the back of a giant animal in The Wandering Village — coming to Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Wandering Village, a city-builder set on the back of a giant animal is now confirmed to be having Native Linux support at the Early Access release. Created by Stray Fawn Studio, the same team behind Nimbatus - The Space Drone Constructor, Retimed and Niche - a genetics survival game.</p>
<p>"In a world where mysterious plants are spreading all over the earth, emitting toxic spores as they grow, a small group of survivors seeks shelter on the back of a giant, wandering creature they call 'Onbu'. Become their leader, build their settlement and form a symbiotic relationship with the creature to survive together in this hostile, yet beautiful post-apocalyptic world that now surrounds you."</p>
<p>They don't have a really up to date trailer, with their Xbox reveal being their newest:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5Cgs-WWqadM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a5f915e05e99d7e3cee7fed82e27713f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5Cgs-WWqadM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I spoke to the developer some time ago and they weren't sure if they were doing Linux support or not. Their plans have changed, with confirmation to me via email that it will have full Linux support including at Early Access. A Linux build is already their for their Closed Beta and they continue improving it.</p>
<p>For players interested on Steam Deck, they do have plans for gamepad / controller support on PC / Linux but that will come later in Early Access.</p>

      <title>Wilderness survival sandbox Vintage Story has a massive upgrade out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A game I really haven't spent enough time with because it's great, Vintage Story is a blocky survival game that's thoroughly challenging and a huge upgrade is out now. Inspired by lovecraftian horror themes, it's definitely one of the more unique open-world survival games around.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vintagestory.at/blog.html/news/de-jank-and-game-juice-update-1170-pre1-r322/" target="_blank">Version 1.17.0</a> is now in testing, so it's not fully released, and comes with absolutely tons that's new. A big tech overhaul too that should improve RAM use, starting a world should be twice as fast, multiple improvements to overall performance and improvements to creature AI too. Heck, there's even a fancy new water system that allows water to flow through most blocks that aren't solid.</p>
<p>New trailer is below and it's seriously impressive:</p>

<p>Other new additions include lightning strikes, 200+ new blocks, big visual upgrades to the temporal storms that happen, armour can now be repaired, 300 types of shield (a 30-fold increase), more and prettier flora, new and improved fauna like the addition of brown bears, black bears, sun bears, pandas and a gazelle, deserts storms are in, bamboo and straw hats and the list goes on.</p>
<p>Vintage Story doesn't get enough credit for being such a thoroughly interesting and massive game.</p>
<p>You can buy it from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/vintage-story?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://tyronx.itch.io/vintage-story" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and the <a href="http://www.vintagestory.at/" target="_blank">official site</a>.</p>

      <title>Mixing action-adventure and tower defense, Dwerve is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dwerve is a bit of an odd one, blending together elements of a dungeon-crawling action adventure with tower defense and it's out now. Created by Half Human Games, they previously made the space shooter Blacksea Odyssey. Note: key provided by the developer.</p>
<p>"Dwerve is a tower defense dungeon crawler RPG where you play as a young dwarf tinkerer who adventures into a ruined kingdom and unearths the lost technologies of the ancient warsmiths: turrets and traps. These are the only weapons that can protect the dwarves from Witch-Queen Vandra and her army of bloodthirsty trolls and monstrous creatures hellbent on conquering the surface."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="02WPEagu_Yc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/17b4e8e9dcd2fd51c8919fb1beb6dfc1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/02WPEagu_Yc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A concept that isn't original (what is now?), with other games doing this mix too like Sanctum. However this is not a 3D shooter mix, instead giving you some pretty wonderful pixel-art. It blends together story-based adventuring, with real-time battles where you place down various towers wherever you want and watch as the action happens. Since you're a living character in this, you will be constantly running around.</p>
<p>Unlike more traditional tower defense games, towers and traps have a limit amount of health, so you will be repeatedly running back and forth between towers to pull them down when they're about done (or destroyed) to put them back up and continue your defence.</p>
<p>Annoyingly, plenty of it was a bit <em>too</em> slow when I initially played it and the developer has received a lot of feedback on this, to the point that they've released some patches to make it feel a little faster. Simple things like movement speed being too slow, which has been buffed up and the result is a slightly smoother feeling game now that I feel is easily worth a go if you want a slightly different take on tower defense.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15420166791655296667gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15420166791655296667gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Once it really gets going, it can be surprisingly challenging too. Not only are you watching your tower health closely, but you also need to take into account the different enemy types too (some towers can't hit certain enemies) and once your towers are down — they will come for you. So it can be a little frantic to reposition your towers and get to safety. In a way, the battles feel a little like a 2D version of Orcs Must Die! somewhat.</p>
<p>I love the way it uses the area you're adventuring through in the story for the battling too. No special stages, no changing levels, you just keep exploring and place down towers whenever needed. Overall it's a pretty fun take on a mix of genres.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Tower defense combat!</strong> Build turrets and traps to fend off swarms of monsters!</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Dungeon crawling!</strong> Explore a ruined kingdom brimming with hidden secrets and puzzles!</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Upgrade your turrets and traps!</strong> Each has its own upgrade tree with 100+ upgrades in all!</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Fight epic boss battles!</strong> Use strategy, wit, and fast reflexes to out maneuver massive monsters!</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Discover powerful artifacts!</strong> Dragonfire Boots, Lionheart Shield, Gurrakk's Hammer, and more!</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Embark on an adventure!</strong> Meet friends, travel throughout the mountain, stop the Witch-Queen!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In my playthrough, the Native Linux version worked great, no obvious issues and controller support worked fine too with my current-gen Xbox pad.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/dwerve?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1132760/Dwerve/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>BeamNG.drive gets experimental Native Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the new 0.25 release of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/284160/BeamNGdrive/" target="_blank">BeamNG.drive</a>, the developers have now put up an experimental Native Linux version for you to try and give feedback.</p>
<p>What is it? BeamNG.drive is a driving sim based on realism. They have spent a long time on their sim, along with their soft-body physics engine simulating all parts of their vehicles in real-time that they say results in "true-to-life behavior". It's a huge game on Steam, with an Overwhelmingly Positive review score from over 100,000 users.</p>
<p>From the release <a href="https://www.beamng.com/game/news/announce/experimental-linux-support/" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the release of 0.25 we are including <strong>EXPERIMENTAL</strong> support for BeamNG Linux. We know that this is something a number of you have wanted for some time, and it seems the time has come to give our players the chance to experiment with this.</p>
<p>Since this is an experimental work in progress product, we do not offer customer support for BeamNG on Linux. This product may be buggy, crashy, unstable or all of the above, but if you are a Linux enthusiast we encourage you to try it out.</p>
<p>Your feedback will be invaluable in helping us get a properly supported version of BeamNG for Linux. In case of questions, <a href="https://www.beamng.com/threads/86422/" target="_blank">please make use of this thread</a>, but make sure to read the guidelines first.</p>

      <title>Check out Striving for Light if you love endless character-building skill trees</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Striving for Light is a new Native Linux release from Igniting Spark Games, one to check out for ARPG fans who love building up crazy characters.</p>
<p>One of the unique selling points on this one is that the skill tree is ever-expanding, allowing you to just keep on going and they say it's actually "infinite". Not just that, the visuals are certainly on the different side for such an action-RPG with them all being hand-drawn and it doesn't really look like any other I've played.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="T39yA5Bwhxc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/49f0b5c825c00f12ff13043d63a64c23.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/T39yA5Bwhxc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Seems to work quite well on the Steam Deck too, although the dialog text size when chatting to NPCs is a little on the small side. Apart from that it seems to run just fine and great on desktop Linux too. With it being in Early Access it's not quite finished yet, with a good few months still go for the initial year they suggested it would be there.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Dive into a dark, mysterious world full of dangers</li>
<li>Everything is hand drawn</li>
<li>Explore a big variety of random generated maps</li>
<li>Unique soundtracks for each environment</li>
<li>Level up and utilise a unique random generated and infinite expanding skill tree</li>
<li>Unlock new skills and weapons</li>
<li>Endless progression system</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1646790/Striving_for_Light/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a> with a demo.</p>

      <title>Wine manager Bottles gets a bit of a makeover</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://usebottles.com/" target="_blank">Bottles</a>, the fantastic and fast-moving free and open source application for managing the Wine compatibility layer has a new release out with a new code-name and a refreshed look. It's such a big release internally, they're now calling the releases by Brescia instead of Trento. So, what's new? A lot, as usual.</p>
<p>The backend has been bumped up to GTK4 + libadwaita, which has resulted in some tweaks to the styling along with overall performance improvements with it using more modern toolkits. Along with this, the onboarding experience was changed to look a bit fancier:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14971699381655291575gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14971699381655291575gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Some other tweaks include changes to the Bottle screen with a reorganised utilities list, with the most-used items easier to access. A few others have been put under a Legacy menu together, which contains various Wine tools they haven't implemented directly into Bottles just yet. Some performance upgrades have been done for the way the Programs, Dependencies, Versioning and Installers screens are populated to reduce loading time too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19419184121655291777gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19419184121655291777gol1.png"/></a>Image Credit - Bottles team</em></p>
<p>Launch options were improved too, which now allow you to override some preferences from the Bottle. Which in some cases may allow you to avoid creating a whole new Bottle when one app inside needs a specific option (useful!).</p>
<p>A new notification system has been added, to alert you to what the application is doing to keep you informed. Loads more like high-resolution application icons, listing games installed via launchers like Steam in Wine and eventually other launchers too like Origin and Battle.net, an option to disable mouse acceleration, they added 14 new Windows dependencies plus various fixes.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma 5.25 is out now, here&#39;s some of what&#39;s new</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready to get the latest and greatest from the KDE team? The awesome <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.25.0/" target="_blank">Plasma 5.25</a> release is officially out now. This is the desktop environment used on the Steam Deck when in Desktop Mode! Hopefully Valve will update it at some point.</p>
<p>One of the big new additions is the extension of what you can customize. Accent colours for example, can be automatically picked based on your background making everything fit nicely together. It's optional of course, you can set the colouring however you like. You can also now have floating panels, that will gracefully stop floating when you maximise a window and it looks pretty slick.</p>
<p>Switching between windows and workspaces is now a breeze, thanks to the new Overview affect that's shipped. This gives you a good look at everything you have open, allowing you to also search through apps, documents, and browser tabs with KRunner and the Application Launcher.</p>
<p>There's also masses of upgrades and new additions to touchscreen input and gestures on a touchpad. Oh, and the Discover Software app had the application pages redesigned to give you access to more and better info on what you're downloading and plenty of upgrades to their Flatpak handling.</p>
<p>See their flashy release trailer below:</p>

<p>There's also absolutely loads (hundreds!) of improvements and fixes for Wayland support too.</p>

      <title>Turbo Golf Racing could be the next multiplayer hit</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a demo currently available in Steam Next Fest, the racer game Turbo Golf Racing is one to watch. Tested on Fedora Linux and Steam Deck, it works out of the box with Proton 7.</p>
<p>You can be in a match with up to eight players and you can go solo, or create a party. The idea is simple, from go you power as fast as you can into your personal ball and keep smashing your car into it until you get it into the hole at the end of the course. While racing, there's various power-ups you can collect and areas of the track that can give you a boost too.</p>
<p>Here's some footage of it on Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AOdzgBXq4rM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b42cb46f7b42e9cdc948b0896b7eb294.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AOdzgBXq4rM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>One bit does concern me though with Power Cores, special additions to your vehicle that can enable you to have an abilities boost that could create some messy balancing.</p>
<p>I'm absolutely hooked on this already though and I think if they do it right, this could easily be the next big multiplayer experience. Nice to see it working so well with Proton even before release too! It will not be free to play though, so it will be interesting to see how it does.</p>
<p>The developers say it will have free regular upgrades with new courses, cosmetics and more.</p>
<p>Try it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1324350/Turbo_Golf_Racing/" target="_blank">out on Steam</a>. It enters Early Access on August 4th.</p>

      <title>Monster collecting game Cassette Beasts shows off the powerful fusion system</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cassette Beasts is an incredibly exciting looking upcoming monster collecting game, one that will offer a rather unique take on the genre and a new trailer is up showcasing the fusion system.</p>
<p>It's on the unique side, since you're not collecting these creatures or using them in a traditional way. Instead of throwing them out of some kind of ball, you turn into them. The fusion system is where it gets real interesting though, allowing you to combine two forms into something unique. The developers say it will be able to generate "over fourteen thousand unique fusions that will allow you as a player to fully customize your team to fit your unique style".</p>
<p>During the Guerrilla Collective digital games showcase a new trailer was shown below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="H_TebiMOPvw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a416fe4f64476fded9c0358cd918d393.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/H_TebiMOPvw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Developed with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, it will have a Native Linux build at release.</p>
<p>You can wishlist / <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1321440/Cassette_Beasts/" target="_blank">follow on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>20 Minutes Till Dawn is like Vampire Survivors with guns — goodbye free time</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>20 Minutes Till Dawn is what you get when you take the basic action-survival idea that Vampire Survivors made popular again, makes it really dark and puts a gun in your hand. Note: personal purchase.</p>
<p>I am thoroughly loving this return to simple, cheap and engrossing experiences that we've had recently. It's only £2.09 on Steam and you can get a ridiculous amount of time out of it and it's only going to get bigger since it's in Early Access right now. 20 Minutes Till Dawn is a rogue-lite survival action game, where you run around defeating an increasing number of weird creatures and collect little pips that drop when they die to level up. When you level up, you get to pick from a random list of upgrades to create a ridiculous character.</p>
<p>Thanks to Proton, it works out of the box perfectly on Linux desktops, and with a Steam Input adjustment it can feel great on the Steam Deck too. Here's a look at it on the Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ogCLZ9MfF-E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/42892aae2a84dbd24a31965df092fb8f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ogCLZ9MfF-E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's not just guns though, there's a few different characters to unlock and they each have different weapons to unlock too as there's plenty of persistent progression to keep you going.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Over 50 different upgrades too choose from for a unique experience every run!</li>
<li>Wide cast of characters, with more to come post-launch.</li>
<li>Casual quick 10-20 minute play sessions, for busy gamers.</li>
<li>Rune System helps you become stronger</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I do think and hope they add some visual aids for people with poor eyesight though, because I can imagine it being a little difficult to see. That's part of the fun for me though, and certainly makes it on the tougher side to play through and keeps me coming back for more.</p>
<p>Right now, I think it's instantly become my new favourite game to blast through when taking a break.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1966900/20_Minutes_Till_Dawn/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You're an android who awakens in a ruined future, this is Kandria. A new upcoming 2D hack and slash open world action RPG.

<p>I spoke with the developer today who confirmed that not only will it have Native Linux support, they also mentioned that they "develop primarily on Linux, so it'll stay supported". Another fun point, is that they plan to open source their code for their in-house game engine.</p>
<p>Features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Explore over 2'100x1'200m of gameplay area</li>
<li>Beat 250 individual, hand-crafted rooms</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can try out a demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1261430/Kandria/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a> right now for Next Fest and support it on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shinmera/kandria" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>. The crowdfunding campaign has 29 days to hit at least 10,000CHF (Swiss franc), so it's about £8,246.</p>

      <title>Arctic Awakening is an upcoming cold narrative-adventure mystery</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With an initial setting that seems a little like The Long Dark, the upcoming Arctic Awakening seems like a thoroughly interesting story-focused exploration adventure. Shown off during the Future Games Show summer showcase, the developer confirmed to me today their plans to have it release with a Native Linux build.</p>
<p>"You are Kai, a pilot without a plane lost in the wilderness of the far north. You’ll need your wits about you to brave the elements, find your co-pilot and get the hell out of Dodge. Along the way, you might just discover what it was that cut your plane clean in two... and what it is making those noises after dark.</p>
<p>Arctic Awakening is a first-person narrative adventure set in the mysterious Arctic North where you and your robotic companion, Alfie, must search for your co-pilot... and a way home."</p>

      <title>AMD announce Radeon Memory Visualizer support for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AMD <a href="https://gpuopen.com/radeon-memory-visualizer-on-linux/" target="_blank">announced</a> yesterday that they're now supporting the Radeon Memory Visualizer on Linux, as a result of "the rising popularity of gaming on the Linux OS".</p>
<p>This is a tool to help game developers solve some complex issues and analyze video memory usage on AMD Radeon GPUs. A good step, as it's not just enough to have games working well on Linux, we also need to pull in more game developers so we can eventually have great direct-support.</p>
<p>Starting with the June 2022 release of their <a href="https://gpuopen.com/tools/" target="_blank">Radeon Developer Tool Suite</a>, developers can analyze Vulkan applications on Linux. Officially, they're supporting Ubuntu 20.04 but other distributions will likely also work but may need some different dependencies installed. AMD say the experience is largely the same as the Windows version too.</p>

<p>Not only do you get to try some games, Valve has also added special badges you can earn during the event for playing various demos. So if you love collecting things on Steam for your profile, it's a nice bit of added fluff to get you to play more.</p>
<p>Since I've been excited for this one, here's some Linux gameplay from the FPS game Selaco:</p>

      <title>Initial thoughts on the HP Dev One laptop with Pop!_OS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>HP and System76 teamed up for the <a href="https://hpdevone.com/" target="_blank">HP Dev One</a>, and for a little while now I’ve been using it as my main machine for everything possible for GamingOnLinux related and otherwise. Here's my initial thoughts, with more to come when I've had more time.</p>
<p><u>Note</u>: this was a review unit sent directly by HP. I’ll preface this with a clear note, that initially I was offered a payment to review it. I denied the offer, since I <em>never</em> take payments for reviews and was later told it was a mistake by the PR firm involved. System76 has since said I can <em>keep</em> the device but that does not affect my thoughts on it.</p>
<p>Available for $1,099, you can have it with the System76 Launch Configurable Keyboard (which I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/07/the-system76-launch-configurable-keyboard-is-tiny-sturdy-and-very-slick/" target="_blank">reviewed previously</a>) and a HP 935 Creator Wireless Mouse as optional <em>extras</em>. Not only is the hardware a thing of beauty but the operating system is pretty slick too, as it comes with <a href="https://pop.system76.com/" target="_blank">Pop!_OS</a> from System76. This was also my first <em>real</em> test of Pop!_OS for more than just messing around for an hour and it’s really easy to get along with.</p>
<p>Built for "developers", which is a pretty ambiguous way to describe who it’s really for, it’s actually a pretty solid all-rounder that just glides through most of what you can throw at it. Except playing the latest games at 1080p, although it does quite well at lower resolutions. It’s a powerhouse when it comes to the CPU but not the GPU.</p>
<p><strong>Main Specifications</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4924067471655137414gol1.jpg"/></p>

<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20619634371655460609gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20619634371655460609gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18599703941655460610gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18599703941655460610gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Since this is an AMD unit, which is still quite rare with Linux vendors, it does mean you get open source drivers with it too so that's a nice bonus for Linux and FOSS enthusiasts. This is also not a case of a rebrand for Linux, this was a Linux-first endeavour and you can feel it and see it all the way through.</p>
<p>Is it really a Linux hardware review if you don’t Neofetch it?</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3175648691655130029gol1.png"/></p>
<p>It ships with a pretty standard proprietary firmware / BIOS. Coreboot was being evaluated but they simply didn't have time to get it onto it ready for production. The good news though is that it fully supports the <a href="https://fwupd.org/" target="_blank">Linux Vendor Firmware Service</a>, so you can easily get updates directly on the machine without ever needing Windows.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2316521241655134138gol1.png"/></p>
<p><strong>System76 and HP together?</strong></p>
<p>This is probably the most surprising part of the laptop and quite an important one to think on. Since System76 are a hardware vendor with their own laptops (and lots more), on top of making the Pop!_OS distribution, it's a great way for both System76 and HP to expand who is using Linux to the benefit of them both in the long run. Fantastic for us consumers too, as more choice for Linux is never a bad thing.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the experience here with Pop!_OS is great too, especially as they haven't filled it full of fluff. It's largely a generic standard Pop install because it has such a wide target for Linux enthusiasts. A few of the tweaks include a different wallpaper by default and their own special selection to pick from, an EULA to accept on install and opt-in analytics for HP to get info to improve it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/846734461655131342gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Access to software out of the box is great, with the Pop!_Shop software centre having both the standard repositories and <a href="https://flathub.org" target="_blank">Flathub</a> enabled together so the amount of extras you have access to should enable you to find anything you could possibly need and Flathub is growing all the time.</p>
<p>There are some things that makes it "special" according to HP like an integrated support panel within the OS, HP have specially trained their support teams for the device and HP also do a full QA certification for every kernel and firmware update for it. Safe to say they're making sure people who buy it are well supported. They even collaborated with AMD on suspend/resume support.</p>
<p><strong>The Dev One experience</strong></p>
<p>The screen, wow, where do I start? It’s glossy, so it has a few reflections in certain lighting conditions but apart from that, it’s absolutely <em>gorgeous</em>. The brightness is actually seriously impressive, somewhat blinding at max setting even. I’ve spent almost my entire time with it at 50% brightness but could easily go lower, it’s just that clear. Pretty great viewing angles from each edge too, I don’t think anyone is going to have any issues with the screen for sure.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest surprise initially was the audio from the speakers. Not only is it crystal clear, it’s also incredibly loud. At 50% audio level, I could hear it pretty clearly in another room across my house so that’s pretty great. Putting it up to 100% audio level was really where the audio truly impressed me though, it still remained impeccably clear which is kind of ridiculous for its size.</p>
<p>How is the fan? When really pushing the device, I was amazed at how quiet the fan remained. It’s not silent by any measure but it is quiet, you only really hear a gentle muted blow out of it that puts to shame some other devices I have (including my own personal laptop). Fan noise can be stupidly distracting but here it was easy to tune it out completely. I fully expected to hear it start ramping-up when I pushed it to the limit but it remained quiet which I was genuinely astonished by.</p>
<p>A great keyboard too, and it even includes a trackpoint (otherwise known as a nipple) for those of you who loved that on the ThinkPads.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19009311121655132659gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I'm glad they chose a muted colour for the nipple though, so it doesn't overly stick-out against the the unit. Fits in quite well as a fun extra for those who like using one.</p>
<p>The keyboard as a whole feels great to use. It's quiet, which seems to be a nice theme with this unit so you won't have distracting clicks while you're working away, same goes for the built-in mouse buttons which are very quiet although the touchpad can be clicked in too but that's quite a nice muted sound. From what they say it's spill-resistant, although I don't dare to test that. The keyboard is backlit too, which has a few levels of brightness as well as having the backlight off so you can work under different lighting conditions.</p>
<p>A nice privacy feature they have, which took me a while to even notice, is that you can slide a privacy screen over the webcam. I absolutely love that and I honestly think every laptop should have this. Directly above the webcam is a tiny slider that you just pull across.</p>
<p>This is probably the nicest laptop I’ve ever used. Not something I say lightly either, practically everything about it feels <em>just right</em>. I would have vastly preferred a matt screen but that is about the only issue I’ve personally had with it. Due to the screen, working outside with it is not really possible. Shot below is in the shade on max brightness:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20111906061655309893gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20111906061655309893gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>And then sat in the sun on max brightness:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17934988981655309844gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17934988981655309844gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Yeah, you're not going to be working outside with this at all. Again though, that is about my only complaint with it and I never work outside anyway. However, think an anti-glare matt screen will do much better anyway? It won't do a whole lot of good outside that's for sure but does look better inside — as long as it's not pointing at a light. For comparison here's it up against the Asus VivoBook S510U inside and then outside:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18827625551655310911gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18827625551655310911gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6722301141655310958gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6722301141655310958gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>I have to hand it to HP and System76 here, together they’ve managed to craft a truly great machine to work with. An impressive device overall when thinking about every angle of it.</p>
<p>No problems encountered with anything either. WiFi worked exceptionally well even when pushing it hard with downloads and streaming together, with it maxing out at 167 Mbps download and 26 Mbps upload with my Google Mesh WiFi which is actually great — more than enough for the vast majority of uses.</p>
<p>Also, another small but very welcome tweak is that the Power button has is tougher to push down so there’s less of a chance of hitting it accidentally. I hope more hardware vendors do this.</p>
<p>When it comes to battery life, it's pretty great actually. When you really push it, you're not looking at more than 2-3 hours but this is a developer-focused machine so coding with music playing, you're looking at nearly a full day of battery life but of course that also depends on things light screen brightness, audio levels, bluetooth on and more. Battery testing is always a tough one because people use such devices very differently. I'm impressed with it though and it's been more than enough to get lots done without needing a charge. Charging is pretty quick too, with it able to get up to at least 50% in around 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Currently it’s U.S. only but it sounds like they might have plans for expanding shipping in future, which was mentioned during a Q&amp;A session but no ETA.</p>
<p>While doing the review I also used the <a href="https://hpdevone.com/products/hp-935-creator-wireless-mouse" target="_blank">HP 935 Creator Wireless Mouse</a> they supplied as my main mouse too, and found that to be a truly comfortable experience as well. It’s really light, and has a perfect shape to nicely fit my hand. Seems HP keeps impressing me. The battery life on that has a claim of 12 weeks and so far it hasn't needed charging. As a great extra, they also built a Mouse Configurator (that's <a href="https://github.com/pop-os/mouse-configurator" target="_blank">open source</a>) just for using it with the Dev One.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13962661691655134588gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Some good attention to <em>all</em> the details here.</p>
<p>Right now, I can see absolutely no reason not to recommend it if you're in the market for a laptop around the $1,099 price-point as not many will be able to match the quality for that.</p>
<p>If you’re after a really wonderful laptop that comes with Linux, the <a href="https://hpdevone.com/" target="_blank">HP Dev One</a> is an absolutely brilliant unit that shines and I'll have more to say after spending a while longer with it. If I'm not at my desk, this is my go-to laptop now.</p>
<p>To readers: what would you love to see tested on it? Do let me know in the comments.</p>

      <title>Techland ends support for Dying Light, 7 years after release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Techland are moving on from the original Dying Light, after giving it 7 years of free updates and expansions. Not many developers support their games for that long, if they're not some sort of live-service thing. Techland certainly did well overall with it.</p>
<p>While it won't see any major updates now, they will still be trickling in a steady "reroll" of previous events into the game for people to play but their main focus is now shifting over to Dying Light 2.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UrneVfMZt30"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6cea514b760eec6a7462aa8e2cdf4031.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UrneVfMZt30" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Dying Light also now only has two editions, to make it less confusing. There's Dying Light Enhanced Edition and the new Dying Light Definitive Edition, both of them on a heavy discount on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/239140/Dying_Light/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>To go along with it, the Harran Tactical Unit Bundle DLC has been made free to claim for two weeks. People who owned the Platinum Edition were also upgraded to the Definitive Edition free. This is after they also gave away The Following expansion to all previous owners.</p>

      <title>System Shock remake gets a brand new flashy trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The upcoming System Shock from Nightdive Studios is still coming, and a brand new trailer was recently shown off during the PC Gaming Show 2022. We don't know when it will release though.</p>
<p>Originally released in 1994, this remake was crowdfunded on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1598858095/system-shock" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> and it hasn't been without trouble with development at one point being <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2018/02/development-on-the-new-system-shock-has-been-paused/" target="_blank">paused</a> but it seems they're close to the finishing line now. Linux support for it was a stretch-goal at $1.1 million USD that was hit, so hopefully they will come through with a good version of it.</p>
<p>You can see the new trailer below:</p>

      <title>Microphone noise suppression app NoiseTorch returns with a new release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/noisetorch/NoiseTorch" target="_blank">NoiseTorch</a>, a popular real-time microphone noise suppression app recently had a possible <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/developer-of-popular-noise-suppression-tool-noisetorch-has-dev-machine-compromised/" target="_blank">security issue</a> but it's been reviewed thoroughly and it's back.</p>
<p>"NoiseTorch is an easy to use open source application for Linux with PulseAudio or PipeWire. It creates a virtual microphone that suppresses noise, in any application. Use whichever conferencing or VOIP application you like and simply select the NoiseTorch Virtual Microphone as input to torch the sound of your mechanical keyboard, computer fans, trains and the likes."</p>
<p>In the new version 0.12.0 they completed a review of the code, and no issue was found. To help against any future issues, they're no longer using a separate update server and instead they will be using GitHub releases so it's all more transparent. For added security, they're also now using more GitHub features to validate the code too.</p>
<p>On top of that the new release also has some code cleanups, and the actual filtering status will be clearer now so it should give a better user experience.</p>

<p>Usagi Shima, from developer pank0 (aka Jess Yu), is an upcoming idle bunny collecting game I've been following for quite some time and the first-ever short gameplay trailer just went up. Shown off as part of the recent Wholesome Direct 2022, it's nice to finally see more than screenshots and tiny gifs on their popular <a href="https://twitter.com/_pank0" target="_blank">Twitter</a> account.</p>
<p>"You’ve been tasked as caretaker of an abandoned island — as you decorate it over time, curious (but adorable!) bunny visitors start to appear! Buy toys, plants, and build structures on an abandoned island to entice curious bun tourists to pay your island a visit. Discover, take photos, and make friends with a variety of bunnies that visit based on how you’ve decorated and arranged the island."</p>

<p>Some of what it will feature:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Discover and record 30+ rabbits with unique looks and features!</li>
<li>Over 100 items to decorate with, some even interactive!</li>
<li>Hand-drawn and traditionally animated art style</li>
<li>Pet and engage with a variety of activities with the bunnies to build friendship</li>
<li>Receive keepsakes from bunnies you’ve become best friends with, and even invite them to stay on your island.</li>
<li>Synced with real time, experience the island ambience matching your time of day</li>
<li>Relaxing idle gameplay – no time limits, no stress, enjoy the ambience and play at your own pace!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Playing OXOGO could land you a big real-life prize that increases with its sales</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developers of OXOGO are hoping to entice some people to play their retro-styled adventure, with the added excitement of the possibility to earn a real-life prize.</p>
<p>OXOGO is an adventure styled like games from early 90s handheld consoles, so it would fit right in on the Game Boy. In OXOGO your dog has been kidnapped, and you end up in some sort of prison. An adventure about finding your dog but also a real treasure hunt at the same time. The developer is putting a small amount of each sale into a pot, to give away to whoever can put together all the clues to find a password.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bu-9cORkWHs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b9acd1b7b45343aa73d6addb0a75a95f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bu-9cORkWHs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>If no one claims the prize by December 2025, any of the <em>extra</em> (not the whole thing) they added to the initial pot will be donated to free software development projects.</p>
<p>The pot started at €5,000 and they said they will update their <a href="http://oxogo.info/" target="_blank">website</a> once a month for how it's doing.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://oxogo.itch.io/oxogo" target="_blank">buy on itch.io</a> as pay-what-you-want and get treasure hunting.</p>

      <title>Phasmophobia gets new Voice Recognition to work on Steam Deck and Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have you been itching to play Phasmophobia? Well, you no longer have to wait for Wine and Proton to be upgraded as the developers have ripped out the Windows-specific stuff.</p>
<p>In their latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/739630/view/3339995286952592740" target="_blank">update notes</a>, they mentioned how they "are no longer relying on Windows' speech systems, meaning it supports many more languages and platforms, such as ‘GeForce Now’ and Steam Deck, with no setup required (and fixes that pesky tab-out bug)."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Phasmophobia is a 4 player online co-op psychological horror where you and your team members of paranormal investigators will enter haunted locations filled with paranormal activity and gather as much evidence of the paranormal as you can. You will use your ghost hunting equipment to search for and record evidence of whatever ghost is haunting the location to sell onto a ghost removal team.<br/>
<br/>
You can choose to support your team by monitoring the location with CCTV cameras and motion sensors from the safety of the truck or head inside and get your hands dirty with the ghostly activity that will get increasingly hostile as time goes on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This should hopefully bump the game up on Steam Deck from Unsupported to Verified.</p>

      <title>AMD tease roadmap for Zen 4, Zen 5, RDNA 3 and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>At the recent Financial Analyst Day, AMD revealed a little bit more about their upcoming roadmap and there's plenty to be excited about for their next-gen CPUs and GPUs.</p>
<p>Some of the points that were mentioned for desktop and laptop users, those were interested in here include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zen 4 CPUs later this year as the "world's first" 5nm x86 CPUs. AMD say it will give an IPC uplift of 8-10% and more than a 25% increase in performance-per-watt and a 35% overall performance increase compared to Zen 3 when running desktop applications. We can also expect Zen 4 with V-Cache, and a Zen 4c revision and some will be on a 4nm process.</li>
<li>Zen 5 "Granite Ridge" CPUs planned for 2024, which is being built from the ground-up. Zen 5 will have both 4nm and 3nm designs.</li>
<li>AMD RDNA 3 "Navi 3x" will bring a chiplet design, which will also have their Infinity Cache tech with a 5nm process which they claim a 50% boost in performance-per-watt compared with the previous generation. AMD said to expect Navi 3x GPUs later this year.</li>
<li>A new "Phoenix Point" mobile processor coming in 2023, which will have Zen 4 along with RDNA graphics followed up by the "Strix Point" processor in 2024.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even the Steam Deck got a passing mention, with AMD patting themselves on the back for their position amongst the main consoles since they power the Steam Deck, Xbox and PlayStation.</p>

      <title>Hearts of Iron IV: By Blood Alone expansion announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox have plenty more coming with the Hearts of Iron IV: By Blood Alone expansion announced, although there's no date yet they've teased it.</p>
<p>In By Blood Alone you chart the course of Mussolini's regime in Italy <em>or</em> subvert Italy's historical path in one of many new alt-historical paths in the new Italian focus tree, driven by the constant involvement in war from the beginning to the end of the game. This includes a new expansive focus tree for Ethiopia and one for Switzerland too. Plus you get to design your own planes which sounds thoroughly interesting.</p>
<p>As always, it will also release alongside a fresh free upgrade for all players.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="owqpUZy6Gbo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/91c4f87ece0b50c61bc918513a009572.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/owqpUZy6Gbo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What it will offer:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New Italian Focus Tree: Follow the historical path of Mussolini’s Italy or rewrite history by restoring power to the monarchy, leading a Communist revolution or promoting democracy.</li>
<li>New Ethiopian Focus Tree: Defy the odds to defeat the Italian invader or resist the conqueror from abroad using unique Government in Exile abilities.</li>
<li>New Swiss Focus Tree: Surrounded by France, Germany and Italy, the mountain nation of Switzerland finds strength in its neutrality, balancing competing factions and overtures from the great powers.</li>
<li>New Peace Conference Options: Demilitarize zones of the map or entire nations, bid on the capital ships of defeated powers, or claim control of enemy resources or factories as reparations.</li>
<li>Aircraft Designer: Design and build your own planes, from nimble interceptors that prioritize speed to durable bombers crafted to unload tons of destruction from high above.</li>
<li>Unit Medals: A log of each division’s accomplishments lets you track their performance, and even allow you to award medals to those that have performed well.</li>
<li>Embargo Interaction: Embargo your enemies with a new diplomatic interaction, preventing them from trading with you if they have generated enough world tension.</li>
<li>New Unit Models: More than 20 new pieces of unit art for Italian, Ethiopian and Swiss armies.</li>
<li>New Plane Models: 67 new plane models.</li>
<li>12 New Music Tracks</li>
</ul>

      <title>Here&#39;s how to get Steam Deck and Gamepad controls in Minecraft</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to get a better Minecraft experience on Steam Deck or with Gamepads as a whole? Thanks to a new mod, it's easily possibly with the latest versions of Minecraft.</p>
<p>The new mod is named <a href="https://github.com/TeamMidnightDust/MidnightControls" target="_blank">MidnightControls</a>, a fork of the old and unmaintained LambdaControls and it's open source. The developer who has taken it on has made sure it's cleaned up and working again, along with adding in support for the Steam Deck and in my own testing it works rather nicely. For this, I used the <a href="https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC" target="_blank">PolyMC</a> launcher available easily for Linux and Steam Deck. You can see a previous guide on PolyMC <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/getting-minecraft-and-mods-on-steam-deck-is-nice-and-simple/" target="_blank">in this article</a>.</p>
<p>First up is the video example on how to do it followed by the text guide:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zvj-6iUwdQI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/429eb50e87933d2dee689b40c6a1cb2c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zvj-6iUwdQI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>How to do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>First with PolyMC, set Steam Input into Gamepad with Mouse, and set the right trackpad to Left Mouse Click.</li>
<li>Open PolyMC, add a new instance and set the mod loader to Fabric and click Okay.</li>
<li>Now hit the View Mods button and then Download Mods.</li>
<li>Pick the Fabric API, MidnightLib and MidnightControls.</li>
<li>Once downloaded, load up your new Minecraft instance.</li>
<li>Go into the Options -&gt; Controls -&gt; Controller.</li>
<li>Set the Mode to Controller and under Appearance set Controller Type to Steam Deck.</li>
<li>Now you're all set and it will just work.</li>

      <title>How to play The Elder Scrolls Online on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Elder Scrolls Online is currently noted as Unsupported on Steam Deck but don't let that stop you. Getting it running is actually pretty simple.</p>
<p>I'm not surprised it's noted as Unsupported though, considering how quirky the initial install actually is. You're not just downloading from Steam, you're also using their launcher to install an update and that is the main cause of the problems. A launcher being a nuisance — where have we all heard that before?</p>
<p>First up a video example, below that is the text guide:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="B3ahI0_czYk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/26e29603491e6da845f63bb2258225e8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/B3ahI0_czYk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>How to do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find the game in your Steam Library, hit the little Cog icon on the right and go to Properties</li>
<li>In the launch options text field, add this: <code class="inline-code">PROTON_SET_GAME_DRIVE=1 %command%</code><br/>
<em>This basically sets up a fake drive in Proton for the game in your Steam Library that the launcher can read correctly</em></li>
<li>Now set Steam Input to Mouse and Keyboard to make it easier for now with the updater and launcher</li>
<li>Load it up, and when you get a black screen, simply press the A button. Proton currently doesn't render it properly, but it's just an accept button to continue on the installer<br/>
<em>You may find it dumps you back to the Steam Library, just reload and it eventually works. Mine only took one extra attempt</em></li>
<li>Load the game</li>
<li>Create / load into your character using the right trackpad as the mouse. Once in-game head to the Options menu in Settings &gt; Gameplay &gt; Gamepad &gt; Enable Gamepad</li>
<li>Open Steam Input again, set to Gamepad but edit the right trackpad to be a mouse with a left mouse click. This enables you to properly interact with the main menu and get proper gamepad controls in-game</li>
<li>Enjoy.</li>
</ol>

      <title>You can now try Resident Evil Village directly in your browser using Stadia tech</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Capcom has released a cloud gaming browser demo of the popular Resident Evil Village, so you can try it out in only a click and a few seconds waiting on pretty much any platform. As long as you're using a Chromium-based browser, that is.</p>
<p>It uses "Immersive Stream for Games" from Google, which is their rebrand of the technology used for Stadia that they give out to publishers and developers for direct use. So while the actual Stadia store continues limping on, the tech behind it at least should live on for years as more developers offer up quick cloud demos like this.</p>
<p>Google noted in their <a href="https://blog.google/products/stadia/discovery-and-trial-immersive-stream-for-games/" target="_blank">blog post</a> about it that they've continued to expand Stadia's own cloud game trials, with 15 games now available to try out at no cost without even having a Stadia account too and they plan to increase that number over the next year.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18572171041654852288gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18572171041654852288gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - a shot taken from testing it today.</em></p>
<p>For Resident Evil Village, it certainly helped that the developer already had a version for sale on Stadia, so they didn't need to do a port to Linux (since Stadia uses Linux) or wait for Google's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/google-talk-about-their-windows-emulator-for-stadia-and-they-use-dxvk-already/" target="_blank">upcoming Windows compatibility layer</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://play.cid.capcom.com/top.html" target="_blank">Head over here</a> to try it.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck update improves Home Screen performance</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released another small update to the Steam Deck, this time focusing on some bugs and UI performance.</p>
<p>Really, this is just Valve continuing to clean up after the last major <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/steamos-32-out-for-steam-deck-m-better-fan-curves-refresh-rate-switching/" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.2 update</a> that came with better fan curves, refresh rate switching and a lot more.</p>
<p>Here's what's new:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved performance for the Home screen Recent Games carousel</li>
<li>Fixed boot glitching and crashes experienced by some customers</li>
<li>Fixed Quick Access volume sliders not working after suspend/resume</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in the controller reorder screen where moving to a controller slot higher than the current number of connected controllers would show as '!' until the Quick Access Menu screen is re-opened</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're not following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Gamingonlinux" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux on YouTube</a> you're missing plenty of hands-on videos not covered in articles. Here's a couple recent videos:</p>

      <title>Dota 2 gets a nice performance improvement with the Vulkan renderer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Battle Report Update is out now for Dota 2, with the majority of it being for Dota Plus but there's also some of the usual balancing changes and a nice improvement for people using the Vulkan renderer.</p>
<p>Valve say it has a "significant performance improvement aimed at removing hitching when playing with the Vulkan renderer". They're making use of the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/blog/reducing-draw-time-hitching-with-vk-ext-graphics-pipeline-library" target="_blank">VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_library</a> extension, which is currently only supported by the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" target="_blank">NVIDIA Vulkan Beta driver</a> but it will be coming to the stable drivers for all vendors eventually. So if you're on NVIDIA, perhaps give it a try and see what you think.</p>
<p>For Dota Plus there's loads new!

      <title>Arietta of Spirits gets fixed up for 30FPS mode on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Arietta of Spirits, a story-driven action-adventure game with easy to approach game mechanics, has a new update out that makes it run better on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>"Arietta of Spirits is a charming adventure game with emotion-filled narrative, no-filler gameplay, and fast paced combat. The game tells the story of Arietta and her family, visiting their Grandmother's cabin for the first time after her passing away a year prior. However, the family trip takes an unexpected turn when Arietta meets a mysterious new friend and gains the ability to see strange spirits that inhabit the island."</p>
<p>It's currently Steam Deck Verified, but it appears that verification didn't test putting it down to 30FPS. At least now it's accurate properly. Some games just don't work well below 60FPS due to the way they are programmed, and it seems this is one of them. Thankfully, the developer noticed some reports on it and released a patch to improve it. Now it will work properly at 30FPS which saves battery life.</p>
<p>The developer also fixed up pixel perfect scaling at aspect ratios other than 16:9, added speedrunning features and fixed some other issues.</p>

      <title>Back 4 Blood gets a small update for the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/back-4-blood-adds-experimental-support-for-linux-and-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Back in April</a> the Zombie shooter Back 4 Blood added experimental support for the Steam Deck, and they're continuing the support along with a new patch.</p>
<p>Along with lots of tweaks to weapon balancing and some new features, they've now added some dedicated default graphical options for the Steam Deck and there's multiple to pick from. This is great, and something I hope more developers add in so Steam Deck players can get the best possible experience. It already worked <em>very</em> nicely out of the box, but hey more tweaks that the developer has directly tested is always welcome.</p>
<p>You can see my previous look at the performance in the below video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="x7CHdPuOXxw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/94da3ce1d3778cd2821c727dac295b96.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/x7CHdPuOXxw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of the new features in this update include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Full Deck Draw
	<ul>
<li>Play all 15 cards from your deck at the start of a Campaign for all difficulties.</li>
<li><em>Developer Note: We felt like the 15 card draw in No Hope went over well with the community, and wanted to roll out this option to all difficulties. In the future we are considering adding multiple deck styles like ordered draw and full random decks. Some difficulties have been rebalanced to work better with this feature.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Player Kicking
	<ul>
<li>The new Player Kicking system identifies and allows kicking from a Mission when a Cleaner is idle for too long or deals too much friendly fire damage.</li>
<li><em>Developer Note: We discussed this feature at length to try and do what's best for the community, so we want to try this conditional kick feature that will only trigger if someone is playing outside the bounds of the game. We also feel that the traditional Vote to Kick can be exploitable and toxic. This feature is not final and we will be monitoring it closely.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New banners, sprays, and emblems</li>
<li>12 New Burn Cards</li>
<li>New Warped Chest Corruption Cards</li>
<li>New Cleaner skins</li>
<li>Legendary Accessories</li>
<li>A more detailed breakdown of Supply Points, Copper, and Skull Totems is now present on the post-round screen.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/back-4-blood?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/924970/Back_4_Blood/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>One of the highest rated games on Steam, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition from Larian Studios recently became Steam Deck Verified. Plus, we have a longer talk from Swen Vincke, the Founder and Creative Director of Larian Studios.</p>
<p>It gained official Steam Deck Verified status last week, which I somehow completely missed. Looking over the <a href="https://steam250.com/top250" target="_blank">top 250</a> on Steam, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is number 68 of the most highly rated games so it clearly has a lot of fans and is arguably one of the best RPGs available on Steam too.</p>
<p>Back when the Steam Deck released, we <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6UXZH_FONg" target="_blank">had a few clips</a> of developers talking about the Steam Deck and their games, as it turns out Larian had kept back more of their footage that they just released that you can see below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kzfEkSGa45k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8b13c3fdf69d8c682b443c651ece3454.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kzfEkSGa45k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In short: they're going to ensure all their games and future games work well on it. Really nice to hear!</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/435150/Divinity_Original_Sin_2__Definitive_Edition/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a> or <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/divinity_original_sin_2" target="_blank">on GOG</a> if you wish to try with Wine.</p>

      <title>Linux hardware vendor System76 is coming to Europe</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Are you wanting to get some hardware from Linux vendor System76 but they don't currently ship to you, or it's expensive to do so? Well, you're in luck! They're coming to Europe. System76 make a lot of hardware including desktops, laptops, servers and a keyboard now too (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/07/the-system76-launch-configurable-keyboard-is-tiny-sturdy-and-very-slick/" target="_blank">which I reviewed</a>).</p>
<p>In an interview over on Tweakers (<a href="https://netherlands.postsen.com/technology/18352/System76-gets-distribution-center-in-Europe-and-is-working-on-a-new-keyboard-%E2%80%93-Computer-%E2%80%93-News.html" target="_blank">translated</a>), they spoke to System76 principal engineer Jeremy Soller, who confirmed "Laptops and desktops have a lot of restrictions and the costs are higher, so we will start with our Launch keyboard and sell it from a European distribution center, so that the shipping costs and taxes for that market are lower".</p>
<p>This is quite exciting, as their products are generally quite highly rated too, and I know plenty of people in the Linux space personally who use them too. Being able to get my own hands on one of their laptops would be excellent, and I've been lusting over their Thelio desktop case since it was first announced — so looks like I have some saving to do.</p>
<p>When can we expect this to happen? Sometime "in the coming months" Soller said. System76 are working on adjusting their Launch keyboard for ISO versions, and they're looking for storage space to set up their distribution location. They're also working on a smaller version of the keyboard with a Lite version with a 65% layout and no integrated USB 3.2 hub.</p>
<p>Thankfully their laptops are already conforming to the CE marking needed for Europe and they're working on the keyboard layout there. For desktops, they're working towards certification but of course it's far more complicated than a keyboard.</p>

<p>Minecraft 1.19 - The Wild Update is out now. Not only that, all owners now get both Java &amp; Bedrock together as they've been merged into a single purchase.</p>

<p>Some of what's new includes the Mangrove Swamp biome, Mangrove Trees, Mangrove Blocks, Mud and Mud Brick Blocks, Clay renewability, Frogs and Tadpoles, the Deep Dark biome, Ancient Cities, Darkness mob effect, Sculk, Sculk Veins, Sculk Shrieker, and Sculk Catalyst Blocks, Warden mob, Allay mob, Boat with Chest, new music, 3D Directional Audio simulation and much more has been added in.</p>

      <title>Some new interesting Steam Deck Verified titles, there&#39;s now over 3,200 confirmed Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Interested in picking up some more games that will work nicely on Steam Deck or a Linux desktop? Here's a quick run over some recent notable titles that are fully Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>The amount is always increasing, as a bunch go through Deck Verified every day. There's a lot that are Playable and Unsupported but if you just want a click and play experience, this is a nice little reminder for you on what's around. Going by the numbers it's now on 3,245 in total as Verified or Playable. As a reminder though: there are games listed as Unsupported that actually do work, and those that aren't tested doesn't mean they don't work — a lot more do.</p>
<ul>

      <title>Dome Keeper is going to be my next craving, demo is great on Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dome Keeper, previously known as Dome Romantik, has a brand new demo available and after testing it, I fear it's yet another simple but addictive game I'm going to wake up craving to play more. Built with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, it has perfect Linux support so far as I can tell and it feels like perfection on the Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>It's a rogue-lite game about defending and upgrading a Dome on a hostile planet, while you dig down below for riches. Quite simple overall but it has that repeatable hook that suckers you into it as the hours fade away. I love the differences between the two sections of the game. The drilling and mining is quite peaceful and fun exploration, while the combat parts feel absolutely nuts at times and really can make you sweat.</p>

      <title>Linux Panfrost driver for Mali GPUs now supports the new Valhall architecture</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news for fan of Arm devices, as developer Alyssa Rosenzweig has <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/conformant-open-source-support-for-mali-g57.html" target="_blank">announced</a> that the Panfrost driver for Mali GPUs now supports the new Valhall architecture.</p>
<p>This open source graphics driver now has <a href="https://www.khronos.org/conformance/adopters/conformant-products/opengles#submission_980" target="_blank">fully-conformant</a> OpenGL ES 3.1 on Mali-G57, a Valhall GPU, with the final Mesa patches landing and the kernel patches are <a href="https://cgit.freedesktop.org/drm/drm-misc/commit/?id=5ba99fca1de0272ce05b65f19bcc184b5cb43285" target="_blank">queued for merge upstream</a>.</p>
<p>When it comes to hardware, it means the MediaTek Chromebooks with the MT8192 and MT8195 system-on-chips like the ASUS Chromebook Flip CM3 will work out of the box with accelerated graphics providing you have Mesa 22.2 and an appropriate kernel.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5171063671654603455gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5171063671654603455gol1.png"/></a>Pictured - ASUS Chromebook Flip CM3</em></p>
<p>Seems it's a nice improvement over the previous generation chip too, with better Vulkan performance and hardware changes to improve other problems they had with the previous generation.</p>

      <title>RimWorld has another upgrade out for Steam Deck players</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>RimWorld on Steam Deck gets even better with the latest <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/294100/announcements/detail/3325358588164752807" target="_blank">update</a>, as the developer continues tweaking to give the best experience possible. While it is thoroughly playable thanks to the last major update, a few lingering issues remained that hopefully this patch will solve.</p>
<p>Specifically for Steam Deck here's what changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed multiple cases where on Steam Deck some keyboard shortcuts were mentioned</li>
<li>Commands now show "button A" glyph instead of "A" label on Steam Deck.</li>
<li>When architect search bar is focused on a Steam Deck and the on-screen keyboard is visible, move gizmos up so that they're still visible.</li>
<li>Added "Keyboard mode" option on Steam Deck in case someone connects a keyboard to the SteamDeck.</li>
<li>Fix: Dismissing on-screen keyboard on SteamDeck doesn't unfocus the text field.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can see a previous quick-look I did below:</p>

      <title>iFixit have the Steam Deck Battery prices up but already sold out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently we had the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/the-official-ifixit-launch-for-steam-deck-parts-and-repair-guides-is-live/" target="_blank">official iFixit launch</a> for Steam Deck replacement parts but one major bit was missing — the Battery. Now though, it seems the store pages for it are properly live and they're already out of stock.</p>
<p>As I was writing this the EU and UK <em>had</em> some stock, I refreshed and they were <em>gone</em> so obviously a few people were waiting ready. Originally, when the initial launch happened there were only placeholder pages for the Battery replacements and no prices. iFixit told various outlets that they didn't currently have a solution to it but it seems that's being solved.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18030585181654597571gol1.jpg"/>Pictured - the full Battery Kit</em></p>
<p>So while you again can't buy it yet, we at least now have the full price required now:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.ifixit.co.uk/products/steam-deck-battery?pk_vid=cca664783d4d44f61654597360dbcbf1" target="_blank">UK</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Part only:  £84.99</li>
<li>Kit:  £89.99</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Miscellanous/Steam-Deck-Battery/IF260-001?o=2" target="_blank">US</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Part only:  $89.99</li>
<li>Kit:  $94.99</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://eustore.ifixit.com/products/steam-deck-battery?pk_vid=cca664783d4d44f61654597323dbcbf1&amp;variant=39920887169105" target="_blank">EU</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Part only: €89,95</li>
<li>Kit: €94,95</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently they're still missing the replacements for various main buttons. While they have the triggers, they do not have the D-pad, Action buttons, Steam button, Quick Access button and others missing too.</p>

      <title>Gamers Nexus have a fascinating look at the Steam Deck fan situation</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For all the hype around the Steam Deck there is one major controversy with the fan. There's two fans being used, with one having a noticeably louder pitch than the other and now Gamers Nexus are attempting to find out why and how bad it is.</p>
<p>Since I've been through both fan types, I can safely say they are very different in the type of noise they give out and it's good to see people with the right equipment attempt to dive into the <em>why</em>. The original fan that was used in the review units is still used, Valve just switch to whatever they have available at production time it seems. The original "Huaying" model sounds more like a nice blower, but the "Delta" fan gives this annoying high-pitch <em>whine</em>. Although, recent fan curve updates from Valve has dramatically helped with that.</p>
<p>In the Gamers Nexus video they do a tear-down of each fan, and you can see there are some pretty big differences. Notable bits being the blade design with the Delta fan blades being much more curved, how close the Delta fan is to the inside casing and the Delta fan outer casing also has bigger cut-outs for airflow too.</p>
<p>Anyway, check out the Gamers Nexus video below because it's a good one.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="G2EEtzhsr2s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b615b1138b32bd7b7319c5048413f22f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/G2EEtzhsr2s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The good news is that if it bothers you, it's clearly real easy to swap the fan for a different one as it's really accessible. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/the-official-ifixit-launch-for-steam-deck-parts-and-repair-guides-is-live/" target="_blank">iFixit are also stocking</a> the original less-noisy fan, although they're out of stock as expected.</p>

      <title>Diablo Immortal works on Steam Deck, plus a fix for Battle.net being slow</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Since Diablo Immortal is the hot new thing, I decided to attempt to give it a go on Steam Deck. Turns out the Battle.net launcher really hates some connections, here's a fix and a Diablo Immortal video.</p>
<p>Currently, Diablo Immortal does work on Steam Deck (and so Linux desktops too) but it seems gamepad support is not working yet. So you will need to use Steam Input to adjust your configuration of any gamepad or Steam Deck to act like a keyboard and mouse. For the most part, that works reasonably well, not that I would recommend it considering the ridiculous micro-transactions involved in the game.</p>
<p>Firstly, here's the video of it running:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="E4J2-nlTzHw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/99f08895d96545ef532ad0cb18f23e4a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/E4J2-nlTzHw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You might find the Battle.net launcher which you can install easily with Lutris (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/lutris-now-has-a-flatpak-beta-available-and-updated-for-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Steam Deck Lutris Guide</a>) can take <em>forever</em> to actually load or do anything. Now, this might be specific to whatever WiFi hardware you have, in my case it's the Google Mesh WiFi system and Blizzard don't seem to like it. An easy fix though is to manually set your DNS to <a href="https://1.1.1.1/dns/" target="_blank">1.1.1.1</a> (or any other free DNS service). On Steam Deck, simply right click on the WiFi icon in Desktop Mode and hit Configure Network Connections:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15697545591654511382gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15697545591654511382gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>From there in the IPv4 (and IPv6 tab if you use it), switch it to "Automatic (Only addresses)" in the Method dropdown box and then set DNS Servers to 1.1.1.1. After that, disconnect and reconnect via the WiFi icon on your Plasma taskbar at the bottom and then reload Battle.net and it will work properly. It's incredibly weird but it works.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8474013301654511169gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8474013301654511169gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Once done you can properly use the Battle.net launcher on Steam Deck, if you also had this weird problem.</p>
<p>You can also add Lutris to Steam as a Non-Steam game, which allows you to launch Lutris and Diablo Immortal in Gaming Mode (so you're not stuck in Desktop Mode). I can confirm that also works just fine.</p>

      <title>GOG Summer Sale now live with new releases from SEGA</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For readers who prefer to shop over on GOG, their <a href="https://www.gog.com/summer-sale-2022" target="_blank">Summer Sale</a> has just started along with some new releases.</p>
<p>To go along with it, more SEGA titles are joining GOG with the first being <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/alien_isolation_collection" target="_blank">Alien: Isolation Collection</a>. Plus <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/two_point_hospital" target="_blank">Two Point Hospital</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/warhammer_40000_space_marine" target="_blank">Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine</a> are coming soon. All for Windows though but you can try with Wine if you wish.</p>
<p>GOG has a few fun collections up to browser through including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/2022_summer_sale_80s" target="_blank">80's Games</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/2022_summer_sale_90s" target="_blank">90's Games</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/2022_summer_sale_00s" target="_blank">2000's Games</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/2022_summer_sale_10s" target="_blank">2010's Games</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/2022_summer_sale_20s" target="_blank">2020's Games</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Their <a href="https://www.gog.com/summer-sale-2022" target="_blank">full sale page is here</a>.</p>
<p>Personally, I'm tempted by <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/metal_gear_solid" target="_blank">Metal Gear Solid</a>. An absolute classic I remember fondly blasting through on the original PlayStation and would love to sit in bed with that on the Steam Deck. It's only 29% off though so not a big discount but should be easy to get going with the Heroic Games Launcher.</p>
<p>Additionally, GOG are giving away Sanitarium for 48 hours. Scroll down the <a href="https://www.gog.com/" target="_blank">homepage</a> to find the banner to click.</p>
<p>Let everyone know in the comments if there's a particularly good deal you're going for.</p>
<p>Their sale runs until June 27th, 2022.</p>

      <title>Free to play shooter Rogue Company verified &#39;Playable&#39; on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rogue Company, a free to play shooter from First Watch Games and Hi-Rez Studios recently had an update of Easy Anti-Cheat and now it's confirmed as "Playable" (not fully Verified) on Steam Deck. The situation is a little odd for the Linux desktop though.</p>
<p>On the Steam Deck, it works out of the box. It's noted as <em>Playable</em>, as it has some text sizing issues and you may need to bring up the on-screen keyboard manually. In my own testing though, it was great. Not only does it perform well but it looks really good and feels like a great fit for the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Here's a look at it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="a39F7N-Upzs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ba69e2cb65fbf1589d0a46d313d9a1b6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/a39F7N-Upzs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On Linux desktop though, there's currently some issues preventing it working properly. If you install Steam as a Flatpak, it seems to work. With a normal Steam install though, a lot of distributions don't have it working. Thankfully, developers RichardYao and "GloriousEggroll" (GE-Proton dev), discovered <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/v4xezh/figured_out_reverts_needed_to_run_rogue_company/" target="_blank">the issue</a> is with glibc 2.35/34. Now the issue is known, hopefully it can be solved so more Linux gamers can play it too.</p>
<p>Free to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/872200/Rogue_Company/" target="_blank">play on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Endlanders is a glitchy RPG with real-time deck-building grid-based combat</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Endlanders and the prologue demo Endlanders : First Encounter have a graphics style that reminds me of Hyper Light Drifter and Resolutiion while offering rather different gameplay. A game that offers up a single-player RPG experience, along with a blending of deck-building and real-time grid-based combat wrapped up in a glitchy world.</p>
<p>"Delve into foreign worlds, translate languages, combat enemies and understand the universe."</p>
<p>One fun feature that sets it apart from other grid fighters, is that the grids aren't special stages. You can create a combat grid nearly anywhere, as long as there's enough space, so you're fighting on the map you're exploring.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UN7PcWnqeSk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3899c386c11a781dc27892c8b239f0ac.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UN7PcWnqeSk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Now live on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/endlanders/endlanders" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, this game is developed with the free and open source Godot Engine and plans for a release in 2024 but you can play the Endlanders : First Encounter now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2010450/Endlanders__First_Encounter/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Action Quake 2 (AQtion), considered the &#39;precursor&#39; to Counter-Strike now on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Action Quake 2 (AQtion), a free and open source first-person shooter that the developers say "spawned one of the most popular and influential games of all time, Counter-Strike" is now available on Steam. Originally developed in 1998 to recreate the look and feel of an action movie, having a fast pace and a semi-realistic damage system.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="iLc8OnzFpmQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/66ed620b1be33d564201e92fc1f8729b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/iLc8OnzFpmQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developers say the new release has been upgraded, with plenty of polish to make it worth playing.</p>
<p>Various modes available:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Deathmatch - Spawn points are distributed over most of the map, and by default players battle out with only pistol, and a combat knife in a free-for-all fashion in an attempt to get the most kills possible. The map changes when one of two conditions is met: either the time or frag limit is reached. Additional "unique" equipment can be picked up throughout, meaning that only one exists on that map at any time.</li>
<li>Capture the Flag - You will have to team up with other players and manage your offense and defense in pursuit of bringing the enemy's flag to your base in order to score. The team that captures the enemy flag the most wins!</li>
<li>Teamplay - Players are split into two teams and play is round based. Players select one primary weapon and one item to use, in addition to the default pistol and knife. The teams spawn on opposite sides of the map and are then let loose to kill each other. If one team eliminates the other, they win the round.</li>
<li>Team Deathmatch - Like Deathmatch but with teams, spawn points are distributed over most of the map, and by default players battle out with only pistol, and a combat knife in a free-for-all fashion in an attempt to get the most kills possible. The map changes when one of two conditions is met: either the time or frag limit is reached.</li>
<li>Play Offline - Engage in battle against bots that will challenge your skills both with and without using your network connection. You can adjust their capability as well as select from several game modes.</li>
<li>Espionage - Similar to teamplay mode, with the exception that the team points are awarded based on successful completion of a scenario. Players also respawn periodically, a fixed amount of time, if a certain amount of members of the team are dead, or instantly. Scenario types CNH, CTB and OFC are continuous play, as in there's no 'end' to a round until the roundlimit or timelimit is reached. The others types rounds end when an objective is met.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Gravitar: Recharged released from Atari revamping another classic</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another remake of a classic has landed, with Atari's Gravitar from the 80s now being available on Steam with Gravitar: Recharged. This was was in collaboration with developers Adamvision Studios and SneakyBox, along with artist and composer Megan McDuffee.</p>
<p>Blending the action of Asteroids and Space Duel, along with the physics fun of Lunar Lander, Gravitar was pretty popular back in the day and remembered quite fondly for the challenge but it was not a commercial hit at release. Perhaps now it might do a little better?</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zAeimDfxYWY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3fdc9aa1edb2cf7b3b1158048c3191df.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zAeimDfxYWY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Gravitar: Recharged Key Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Far from Home: Travel across the galaxy in arcade mode, visiting planets to progress through ever-more-challenging solar systems in a quest to get home     </li>
<li>Explore, Triumph, Repeat: Take on 24 distinct missions, aiming to climb global leaderboards and assert yourself as the ultimate space adventurer     </li>
<li>Powerful Power-Ups: Utilizing the tech at your disposal, make use of your tractor beam to grab power-ups including homing missiles and electrifying EMP disruptors     </li>
<li>Not so Lonely Anymore: No longer doomed to wander the universe alone, play with a partner in each game mode. Connect to your player two via a tether and work together to accomplish each goal and make your way home.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1905430/Gravitar_Recharged" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Since Atari seem to be going back through their classics to bring out updated version, is there a particular game you want them to do next?</p>

      <title>Craftomation 101 merges survival, crafting and automation programming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From the developer of while True: learn() and Learning Factory comes yet another game with programming. Craftomation 101 brings together elements of a survival game, crafting and automation.</p>
<p>The idea is to help teach visual programming in a fun way, letting you tell robots what to do while helping them to survive on a frozen planet. Your mission is to make the planet habitable so you need to build up resources, make tools, melt ice, plant trees and produce oxygen. You could do it yourself, but with an army of programmable robots, why not get them to do it?</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rdaPcULSnCc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ab76881a2aed9cd0562427c08805f9f4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rdaPcULSnCc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Writing in an email, the developer explained how the idea came about:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Technically, it all started when one of us (not me) tried to create a piece of javascript to try all the craft combinations in one really nice web game. But it’s too silly to be the reason for creating a whole game (okay it was me and I was kinda close to succeeding with this javascript).</p>
<p>The other piece of this puzzle was in a huge spreadsheet with feedback from players of our previous game <strong>while True: learn()</strong>. A lot of players asked us to add more “real programming” in our next games.</p>
<p>Another thing we were inspired by was an amazing article <em>Artificial Living Plants</em> by Edward F. Moore (1956). It was dedicated to using self-replicating machines for resource mining and production (not just on Earth, but on other planets as well). Additionally I was shocked by the idea of Freeman Dyson who proposed using self-replicating machines to deliver ice from Enceladus to Mars to help with terraforming.</p>
<p>It all lead us to brainstorming: what kind of game could encompass all those amazing concepts, while showcasing programming as a really useful tool for automating various systems, small or huge?</p>
<p>To be honest, “self-replicating programmable robots used for terraforming” sounds really charming, inspiring, and awesome to us. We simply had to try and make this concept into something playable!</p>
<p>The work began in early 2021, as our artist Alex started making sketches, while Dima and Ivan were getting familiar with the Defold game engine (read below) and how it works with Spine animations.</p>
<p>But the real push for us was Ludum Dare 48, which happened in April '21. This online event suggests participants to develop their games in 48 or 72 hours sprints, and we at Luden.io have a long lasting tradition of participating in it.</p>
<p>After a short brainstorm, we decided to make a game about mining resources and investing them into something - something cool, like building a rocket! So we’ve piled up some premade art assets, ideas that could be implemented in a short period of time, and a lot of coffee - and made it into a prototype.</p>
<p>That was a glitchy, but fun little game. After reading 30+ cheerful comments with tons of kind words and meaningful feedback, we thought that the concept was worth working on.</p>

      <title>There&#39;s another big Queer Games Bundle live on itch.io for 2022</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to support queer creators? Now is a good chance for you, while also grabbing a whole chunk of games too in the Queer Games Bundle 2022.</p>
<p>This is another example of how great the game store itch.io is, with it previously hosting multiple mega charity bundles. This one is a bit different though, since you will be <em>directly</em> supporting various developers. Much like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/06/itchio-hosting-a-huge-queer-games-bundle-2021-with-hundreds-included/" target="_blank">last year</a>, it comes in two editions with a <a href="https://itch.io/b/1404/queer-games-bundle-2022" target="_blank">main bundle</a> and a <a href="https://itch.io/b/1405/queer-games-bundle-2022-pay-what-you-can-edition" target="_blank">pay what you can</a> edition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we had the budget of an AAA game, we could give every solo developer a livable wage multiple times over for a year and every single team a massive funding boost. Imagine what the developers and artists in this bundle could create a year from now if they weren’t worried about starving or how to pay their rent this month. </p>
<p>Purchasing the Queer Games Bundle is a direct action that you can take right now to support queer people in a life changing way and in exchange you get over 500 amazing, heartfelt, fun, and radical games. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Buying it helps support over 400 different creators and gain access to over 500 incredible varied experiences, no doubt a bit of something for everyone to enjoy.</p>
<p>The main bundle has already raised over $20,000 at time of writing and it runs for another month so there's plenty of time to look through it.</p>

      <title>Proton 7.0-3 in testing, will bring more game compatibility to Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve and their partner CodeWeavers are working towards the next major upgrade of Proton, the compatibility layer for running Windows games on Linux and the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Proton 7.0-3 just had a first public <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/5881" target="_blank">Release Candidate build</a>, while they ask for some help testing to see if there's any major problems before rolling it out to everyone. A lot of the improvements here are coming over directly from Proton Experimental, so all the advancements there will end up being the default version of Proton used for lots of games.</p>
<p>If you wish to try it out, here's what to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search for "Proton 7.0" in your Steam Library.</li>
<li>Go into the Properties on it.</li>
<li>Select Betas from the left panel.</li>
<li>Find release-candidate in the drop-down and then let it update.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You can also see a previous video <a href="https://youtu.be/c1SiIp8KJm0" target="_blank">example guide</a> I did for the Proton Experimental Beta on Steam Deck, it's the same method but for Proton 7.</em></p>
<p>While it may change before the final release, these are listed as newly playable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Age of Chivalry</li>
<li>Beneath a Steel Sky</li>
<li>Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamer Edition</li>
<li>Cities XXL</li>
<li>Cladun X2</li>
<li>Cursed Armor</li>
<li>Disney•Pixar Cars Mater-National Championship</li>
<li>Gary Grigsby's War in the East</li>
<li>Gary Grigsby's War in the West</li>
<li>Iragon: Prologue</li>
<li>MechWarrior Online</li>
<li>Saviors of Sapphire Wings</li>
<li>Small Radios Big Televisions</li>
<li>Split/Second</li>
<li>Star Wars Episode I Racer</li>
<li>Stranger of Sword City Revisited</li>
<li>Succubus x Saint</li>
<li>V Rising</li>
<li>Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide</li>
<li>We Were Here Forever</li>
<li>Planetary Annihilation: TITANS</li>
</ul>
<p>There's a lot of other improvements too including video playback fixed for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disintegration</li>
<li>Dread X Collection: The Hunt</li>
<li>EZ2ON REBOOT : R</li>
<li>El Hijo - A Wild West Tale</li>
<li>Ember Knights</li>

<li>Solasta: Crown of the Magister</li>
<li>Street Fighter V</li>
<li>The Room 4: Old Sins</li>

</ul>
<p>Plus these other assorted fixes:</p>

      <title>Hands of Necromancy is an upcoming GZDoom powered dark fantasy shooter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love retro shooters? How about those with a little magical flair to them and dark fantasy? The GZDoom engine powered Hands of Necromancy is coming to Steam with a teaser demo up now.</p>
<p>The developer explains that it's a metroidvania styled game, in the spirit of the classics like Heretic. Looks pretty great too, and also awesome to see more developer use the thoroughly versatile cross-platform GZDoom instead of reinventing the wheel again for a game engine that's well suited for the classic FPS style and mechanics. Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Ga11coGneIA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9c96e7b75364f5aac2b3eb59d3abc031.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Ga11coGneIA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore many beautiful environments - a country side, a forest, a cemetery, a castle, an ice cave, a volcano, and more - all teeming with danger to prove yourself against, as their denizens try to destroy you.</li>
<li>Get weapons, use magic spells, and learn transformations to fight your enemies, using their own abilities against them and bending nature to your own will.</li>
<li>Use the Tornado Spell to toss your enemies away with wind, or the Ring of Ice to freeze them solid, or even an Unholy Hand Grenade to blow them to smithereens!</li>
<li>Gain transformations as you grow in power - become the Swamp Serpent who can slither into tight spaces while breathing underwater, or the Stone Breaker Golem that smashes walls into tiny bits, the Hell Burner Demon that safely walks on lava, or even a flying Wyvern!</li>
<li>All of them are your key to defeating the many creatures in this metroidvania, as you explore the 21 maps in 3 giant and exciting hubs!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Old Skies is an upcoming time travel adventure from Wadjet Eye Games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another great looking point and click adventure is on the way from Wadjet Eye Games! They just recently teased their latest called Old Skies. They also confirmed on <a href="https://twitter.com/WadjetEyeGames/status/1532053665137274880" target="_blank">Twitter</a> it will support Linux too and there will be a demo available during Steam Next Fest which happens next week.</p>
<p>"Time Travel is real and history is up for grabs! In this point-and-click, you play Fia Quinn, a time agent for the ChronoZen agency. Your job is to keep close watch on seven travelers who have the desire (and the bank accounts) to sightsee in the past. Some are simply curious. Others have unfinished business to resolve. And they’ve all put down a lot of money for the trip, so it’s vital that you keep them happy while ensuring they follow the rules. But what could go wrong? It's only time travel, after all."</p>

<p>This is looking really great! Some wonderful work on the visuals for this one.</p>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Seven eras of history to visit! From the speakeasies of Prohibition to the gangs of the Gilded Age to the morning of September 11th.</li>
<li>High resolution 1920 x 1080 graphics! That's 3x higher than Unavowed.</li>
<li>Lots of puzzles that require temporal thinking to solve.</li>
<li>Death! You CAN die in this adventure game, but time travel means you can try again. And again. And again.</li>
<li>Musical score by Thomas Regin (composer for Unavowed and the Blackwell series)</li>
<li>Full voice acting! Our largest cast yet.</li>

      <title>Steam Deck now lets you override display resolution for games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have some games on Steam Deck that won't get the right resolution? Now you can force them into what you want. This will be useful for quite a lot of retro games especially, and some that just won't behave.</p>
<p>Announced as part of a recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3328736287861418016" target="_blank">update</a>, you can now go into the Properties menu of any app on Steam Deck and select to force the resolution:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10808615751654247666gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10808615751654247666gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/564345141654247666gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/564345141654247666gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here's the full update notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added Game Resolution setting to App Properties, allowing players to override the max display resolution for games, on a a per-game basis</li>
<li>Added mouse cursor (using right trackpad) for built-in web browser interactions when connected to an external display</li>
<li>Improved default aspect ratio behavior for external monitors - games will now default to 1280x800 for 16:10 external displays and 1280x720 for all other external displays</li>
<li>Improved UI performance in game carousels</li>
<li>Improved UI performance when connected to an external display</li>
<li>Improved controller order when using external gamepads to assign the controller slots by the order of input. This should help with compatibility in games which locked onto the Steam Deck controller.</li>
<li>Fixed 'Enable updated fan control' toggle not remembering its state across reboots</li>
<li>Fixed Bluetooth controllers not working on the lockscreen</li>
<li>Fixed some formatting issues on the Steam Deck Chord Summary page</li>
<li>Fixed issue preventing deletion of some controller layouts</li>
<li>Temporarily disabled adaptive brightness toggle, as it was causing performance and stability issues. Big thanks to the community for catching this weird bug - we're working on a fix for it now.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Valve reveals the top 10 most played Steam Deck titles and they&#39;re all fully Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve just put up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675180/view/3332113352306852873" target="_blank">another</a> of their round-up posts going over all the recent work on the Steam Deck, and they also revealed the current most popular titles.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>For regular readers this won't be news since I go over the changes often but it's still a good catch-up for those who have fallen a bit behind on the news. Some of what's new includes the lock screen, multiple window support, keyboard improvements, external display upgrades, per-application performance profiles, improved fan behaviour and more. Check out their video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZtkISSyZYSg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d5ae9bff9f932f2823d5c3bce1d4cdb6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZtkISSyZYSg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As for what's popular based on user play-time (<a href="https://twitter.com/gregcoomer/status/1532876301014421506" target="_blank">source</a>), over the last month these were the most popular on Steam Deck</p>
<ul>
<li>Elden Ring </li>
<li>Vampire Survivors </li>
<li>Rogue Legacy 2 </li>
<li>Stardew Valley </li>
<li>No Man's Sky </li>
<li>Slay the Spire </li>
<li>Hades </li>
<li>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt </li>
<li>The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth </li>
<li>Aperture Desk Job</li>
</ul>
<p>Valve was keen to point out that it's not just because of Steam Deck upgrades or Proton, but effort directly from developers too and four of those titles were previously listed as Unsupported or Playable until they got updated to be Verified. They're making a clear and obvious point: if developers get their games supported, players are more likely to buy them and spend time in them — not exactly a big surprise. Plenty of us just want to play games and not have to tinker so hopefully more will get cracking on updating their games.</p>

      <title>Splitgate the free online FPS with portals has Season 2 live now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mixing together some fast-paced shooter with a bit of a Halo feel and portals like out of Valve's Portal series, Splitgate has a big new update out now.</p>
<p>While there's plenty of new content additions, one of the biggest changes is to the matchmaking system. Matchmaker 2.0 brings with it faster and smarter matchmaking with human players (less bot matches), players can now be added into an in-progress unranked match if it began less than a minute prior, players are more likely to hop directly into a match than having to be in a waiting area and much more.</p>
<p>There's also three new game modes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Juggernaut </strong>(Free For All): Every player against one (hard to kill) Juggernaut selected at random. Score points by surviving as the Juggernaut.</li>
<li><strong>Hotzone </strong>(Team): Capture and control the neutral zone for 30 seconds to score a point. </li>
<li><strong>Lockdown </strong>(Team): Score a point by controlling all three hills at the same time. After each point, the hills move.</li>
</ul>
<p>A new progression system is also in, they revamped the interface, big additions to the map editor and the <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/blogs/splitgate-beta-season-2-patch-notes" target="_blank">list goes on</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bLbqB6DmEfA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fce69ca6884054105f59dcbf336ea928.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bLbqB6DmEfA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The game definitely feels a lot better than when I tried it previously. While it was fun before, it did have a few minor tech troubles (especially in the Linux build there were some quirks) but it seems to be thoroughly smooth now, seems like they improved it a lot overall. It's also Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Splitgate is free to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/677620/Splitgate/" target="_blank">play on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>System76 and HP bring the HP Dev One with Pop!_OS Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/hp-teamed-up-with-system76-for-the-hp-dev-one-laptop-with-pop-os-linux/" target="_blank">we reported previously</a>, The HP Dev One is a new laptop collaboration from System76 and HP that brings Pop!_OS Linux to even more people. It's now available to order.</p>
<p>Quite an exciting one, as it's always good to see more vendors dip their toes into selling and supporting Linux machines directly. Not only that, it's interesting because it's one hardware vendor teaming up with another. Hopefully this is the shape of things to come with more collaboration. Right now it's only available in the USA and priced at $1,099.</p>
<p>Some key specifications:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Processor</strong> - AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 5850U</li>
<li><strong>Memory</strong> - 16 GB (2x8 GB) DDR4 3200 MT/s (2 SODIMM)</li>
<li><strong>Storage</strong> - 1 TB PCIe 3x4 NVMe M.2 2280 SSD</li>
<li><strong>Graphics</strong> - AMD Radeon Graphics</li>
<li><strong>Display</strong> - 14” diagonal FHD LED UWWA for HD Webcam (1920x1080) (1000 Nits)</li>
<li><strong>Audio</strong> - Dual stereo speakers, 2 multi-array microphone</li>
<li><strong>Wireless</strong> - Realtek RTL8822CE 802.11a/b/g/n/ac (2x2) Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5 combo</li>
<li><strong>Power</strong> - HP Smart 65 W External AC power adapter</li>
<li><strong>Ports</strong> - 2 SuperSpeed USB Type-C 10Gbps signaling rate (USB Power Delivery, DisplayPortTM 1.4); 2 SuperSpeed USB Type- A 5Gbps signaling rate (1 charging); 1 headphone/ microphone combo; 1 HDMI 2.0; 1 AC power</li>
<li><strong>Battery</strong> - HP Long Life 3-cell, 53 Wh Li-ion</li>
<li><strong>Size</strong> - 12.73 x 8.44 x 0.75 in; 32.34 x 21.46 x 1.91 cm</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“System76 is thrilled to work with HP to advance open source and bring the Linux desktop to a much wider audience,” said Carl Richell, CEO, System76. “By bringing together our engineering, marketing, and customer support, System76 with HP are introducing HP Dev One to combine powerful hardware with optimized Pop!_OS for the app dev community.”</p>
<p>“Pop!_OS development and innovation has always been a top priority for System76,” said Jeremy Soller, principal engineer, System76. “We are working to develop new features and optimize current ones into Pop!_OS at a much faster pace than previously possible.”</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8600261501654195858gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8600261501654195858gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>“Software developers are looking for a device that is customized and optimized for the way they code,” said Tylitha Stewart, Vice President and Global Head of Consumer Services and Subscriptions, HP Inc. “By working with System76, we are meeting this need and providing a premium experience with Linux Pop!_OS preinstalled to deliver the new HP Dev One. The device has features important to developers including an optional Linux keyboard tuned with a super key and designed to be more efficient at the core.”</p>
<p>I'm hoping to see a review unit, so keep an eye out for what I think in the coming weeks. I might also be having a chat with System76 CEO Carl Richell about it soon too.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck already hits over 5% of Linux users on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey" target="_blank">Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey</a> is out for May 2022, and while it sees a tiny drop in the overall Linux user share, we can see the Steam Deck rising up. As usual, our dedicated <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">Steam Tracker</a> has been updated for the latest figures, with a screenshot of the current status below for all to see:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12386350071654155336gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12386350071654155336gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Currently the overall Linux share is <u>1.12%</u>. Still a pretty clear upwards trend, and drops in a couple months are to be expected as that's just how things go. No doubt it will bounce up again within a couple months. The interesting thing to see now though, is how the Steam Deck will affect it since Valve actually hooked up the survey in a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/steam-deck-gets-per-app-performance-profiles-hardware-survey-and-loads-more/" target="_blank">recent Steam Deck update</a>.</p>
<p>When filtering to <em>just</em> Linux, here's the current top:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>"Arch Linux" 64 bit 12.85% +0.53%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS 64 bit 11.75% -2.53%</li>
<li>"Manjaro Linux" 64 bit 11.09% -0.46%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 64 bit 8.04% +8.04%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 20.3 64 bit 5.97% -0.39%</li>
<li>"SteamOS Holo" 64 bit 5.23% +5.23%</li>
<li>Other 45.07% +6.46%</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So it might look like Arch Linux is on top at a quick glance, but not quite, since you need to take into account the various versions of Ubuntu as people tend to stick to LTS releases for years. The real interesting thing to see though is <strong>SteamOS Holo</strong>, which is the Arch-based Steam Deck operating system already hitting well over 5% of Linux users on Steam. Not only that, the Steam Deck GPU "AMD AMD Custom GPU 0405" is shown as the second most popular already for just Linux systems on Steam.</p>
<p>Using May's 1.12% share, that puts Linux users at around ~1,478,400 estimated "monthly active users" based on the last time Valve gave out their user data. You could say that to be around ~77,320 Steam Deck users, although keep in mind it’s an additional device for a lot of people, it depends where the survey is taken. The actual number is likely higher.</p>

      <title>Valve delay the Steam Deck Docking Station</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In a move that's not exactly unexpected, Valve has now delayed the launch of the official Steam Deck Docking Station.</p>
<p>Written in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3328736287857025157" target="_blank">official update</a>, the Valve team said it was due to both a shortage of parts and closures at their manufacturing facility due to COVID. No further date has been given and they said they will share more info when they have it. The good news though is that the schedule for shipping the actual Steam Deck is not affected as it's different parts and a different factory responsible for it.</p>
<p>Valve ended the post by mentioning how they continue to improve the "docked experience for Steam Deck with all USB-C hubs and external displays".</p>
<p>Right now, the docked experience isn't the best. For all the pros the Steam Deck has, the docked experience is something of a sore spot. It's a mixture of things between issues in the KDE Plasma desktop when connecting up external monitors, to resolution issues in Gaming Mode when docked. The problems are all solvable and for the most part it works but there's a lot of quirks left to solve. Valve may not have said so, but it's likely also a big factor in the decision not to release it yet.</p>
<p>If you are after a USB Hub that works well, I've used <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B099F6R6TC/" target="_blank">this</a> for months now and it has been working nicely for me.</p>

      <title>Prison Architect - Gangs DLC and free Kite update announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox and Double Eleven have announced the Prison Architect: Gangs expansion, along with the free Kite update. Here's what to expect from it.</p>
<p>I don't think this exactly needs much of an explanation does it? I think we all know what a gang is huh? Inmates will now form up, with different groups having their own personality and reputation inside your prison. As gangs grow and flex their power, things might get a little bit heated. Thankfully, you get a few new tricks to deal with them too.</p>
<p>Gangs DLC Features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meet the gang: </strong>Gangs form and grow by gang members arriving by in-take or by recruitment. Each gang has its own personality and traits, and will naturally be drawn to recruiting prisoners with the same specific attributes.</li>
<li><strong>Boiling Point:</strong> Now you can measure your inmates and your prison’s “temperature”. As gangs grow and begin to flex their strength, the 'danger temperature' of your prison will rise. Thanks to the 'Boiling point' UI, you get a detailed overview of what's affecting the life of your inmates, allowing you to act swiftly, keeping them happy, and preventing irrepressible riots.</li>
<li><strong>Reform and release:</strong> Gang members are now allowed to leave their crew, help them come clean by removing their tattoos and enrolling them in the Gang Rehabilitation Program.</li>
<li><strong>New rooms: </strong>Use the Tattoo Removal Room to remove gangs' tattoos, or have gang members train in the Fight Club Room, turning their destructive energy into fighting in a controlled environment.</li>
<li><strong>Crooked guards: </strong>Gangs may coerce guards into smuggling contraband or accepting bribes. You can vet guards during the hiring process (Bureaucracy) as well as recruit C.I.s to identify guards that have turned.</li>
</ul>
<p>Their brief and not very useful announcement trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="54LgqxKijmo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8b490b6fae8bed6e323f5a59996e748c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/54LgqxKijmo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release: "Gangs introduces a whole slew of creative challenges for Wardens to overcome. While it sounds intimidating, the Gangs expansion keeps things fun and light-hearted for our players," says Gaz Wright, Game Director on Prison Architect at Double Eleven. “We designed the reformation features to feel authentic while giving wardens clever options to handle gangs and increase their population's happiness. Gangs expands Prison Architect's management gameplay and adds enjoyable new mechanics, offering players a fuller and more fun gaming experience."</p>
<p>Due to release "soon" but no actual date given yet.</p>
<p>The free Kite expansion releasing at the same time will add in more wardens, guard dogs, room sizes, prison capacity options, improvements to the game menus and tweaks to other mechanics.</p>
<p>You can buy Prison Architect from <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/prison_architect?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/prison-architect?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/233450/Prison_Architect/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Golfie mixes together minigolf with a deck-builder</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We've seen a few attempts to spice-up Golf like Golf with Your Friends which is great but how about blending it together with a deck-building card game? Golfie is the answer to that. Note: key provided for me. It works out of the box on Linux desktop and the Steam Deck, thanks to Steam Play Proton.</p>
<p>"Deckbuilding meets minigolf in Golfie – the only game in which you can power-up and modify realtime golf shots by collecting and crafting a deck of cards."</p>
<p>It's the game you know (and love?) but with the main quirk being your shots can be changed and warped with cards. You will need to use them too, as the courses are quite varied and need you to hop over obstacles or shoot around corners. It mostly works too and there's a lot of replay value here.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="i8cjYU9nbPo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e6298f6a1d4ea8f52e56f7782406ccfb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/i8cjYU9nbPo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's a pretty great idea actually, and with it being in Early Access it has plenty of room to grow and tweak the cards and the maps available to expand on the initial set. The developer expects to keep it in Early Access for around 9 months with plans to add in new cards, power-ups, course options and modes.</p>
<p>Like any good deck-builder, you get an initial set of cards and it does take a good few runs to really get into it but thanks to the unlocks system you can really do some ridiculous stuff with the cards. Hovering your ball in the air with a jetpack, to smash it across the course is always hilarious.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Four distinct biomes such as Cherry Garden and the Dungeon to pitch and putt your way through</li>
<li>Procedurally generated nature of each hole, meaning no two courses are the same</li>
<li>Cards, coins and perks to collect on your way to golfing glory</li>
<li>Incredible shot synergies which can result in extraordinarily powerful ways to play – can you get a hole in *none*?</li>
<li>Entirely randomised courses or compete against the world in Daily Runs, which offer one chance to play the same course as the rest of the world</li>
<li>Free play mode offers mini golf without the pressure</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/golfie?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1579020/Golfie/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom gets a Steam Deck update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom from Game Atelier and DG Entertainment recently gained a small but sweet update to improve gameplay on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>While it's currently tagged as "Unsupported" by Valve, this should hopefully bump it up to fully Verified. It previously had an issue where all the button mapping icons where broken. This latest update adds full support for the Steam Deck controls, and additionally adds in native 16:10 aspect ratio support too. Thanks to that update, Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom should now be a great experience on Steam Deck.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ufE6mOdZ2U0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5fe705f96f83214eeef3b82cbcc93cda.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ufE6mOdZ2U0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Six awesome forms</strong> with unique combat and platforming abilities to make your adventure exciting from start to finish.</li>
<li><strong>Unlock new paths and secrets with special equipment:</strong> look for magic weapons and items that gradually open up the world.</li>
<li><strong>Over 15 hours of epic adventure:</strong> explore the new Monster World in a vast interconnected environment.</li>
<li><strong>Hand Drawn animations:</strong> characters and enemies come to life with detailed animations and fun facial expressions.</li>
<li><strong>Soundtrack from iconic Japanese composers:</strong> Yuzo Koshiro, Motoi Sakuraba, Michiru Yamane, Keiki Kobayashi and Takeshi Yanagawa.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/449610/Monster_Boy_and_the_Cursed_Kingdom/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Or you can buy it on <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/monster_boy_and_the_cursed_kingdom" target="_blank">GOG</a> if you want to try it with Wine.</p>
<p>Here's a short look at it running on a Steam Deck:</p>

      <title>Steam Client Update released with Remote Play improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released a small <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/oldnews/139004" target="_blank">update</a> to the stable version of the Steam Client, with it mostly being about fixing up Remote Play. It's not a big surprise to see the focus on Remote Play right now with the Steam Deck, especially with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/steamos-32-out-for-steam-deck-m-better-fan-curves-refresh-rate-switching/" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.2 update</a> bringing full Remote Play Together compatibility for the Deck too.</p>
<p>Here's what's new in the update:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Remote Play</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Greatly improved desktop capture quality on Windows, now supporting variable framerates</li>
<li>Fixed crash on Windows when the stream resolution is changed</li>
<li>Fixed streaming connections failing after Steam has been restarted</li>
<li>Fixed Remote Play Together dialogs occasionally not resizing correctly</li>
<li>Fixed color quality when streaming from Linux to Steam Deck</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>macOS/Linux</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed game install/update failing for Steam libraries installed on a filesystem that does not support preallocation (e.g. ExFAT, FAT32)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see the Linux fixes there too, another reason to love the Steam Deck as it means other parts of Steam / Linux keep getting fixed up.</p>

      <title>Try out the demo for Ragtag Crew, a turn-based tactical rogue-lite</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a demo arriving as part of the DreamHack Beyond event, Ragtag Crew seems like a promising upcoming turn-based tactical rogue-lite to sink your teeth into.</p>
<p>Plenty of options to build up a full squad of scavengers, that you will send across a wasteland in pursuit of profit, food and lots of battles too of course. The developer mentions that each class not only has the usual differing abilities but also a little personality thrown into the mix that will provide an "unrepeatable adventure", as the combat is broken up by little events and each choice you make changes the history of your squad with a big pool of events to pull from.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NyB_RIHGG18"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c3b960ef5ed7bf64f22df3329d28393e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NyB_RIHGG18" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Each run, choose 3 characters out of 8 classes (some unlockable). Experiment with synergies and party compositions to slay everyone in your way!</li>
<li>Every character can choose a personality from the 7 available (some unlockable). These influence their dialogue, battle capabilities, relationships, morale, stats, and overall style — but most importantly, they can drastically change the course of events.</li>
<li>The heart of the game lies in the tough tactical fights. The enemies are strong, but often have flaws to exploit. Adapt, improve, overcome!</li>
<li>Slay bosses… or sneak past. These large and unique enemies come with their own mechanics and storylines. The rewards may be game-changing — but are you in a good enough condition to take them on? Sometimes it’s smarter to walk past a fight.</li>
<li>As you progress through the game, more options become available.</li>
<li>Every node on the map offers a text event. A smart choice can grant you loot, help two characters form a bond, or hint at the deeper truth behind the events. An unsuccessful one might end in a disaster.</li>
<li>Over the course of an adventure the party members will grow to become friends… or bitter enemies. Nudge their stories to receive unique events and outcomes!</li>
<li>From cute baby lizards to passionate fighter-pilgrims, all kinds of characters may aid you on your journey.</li>
<li>A mixture of post-apoc, Westerns, and sci-fi creates a relatable yet original world. "Firefly meets Douglas Adams."</li>
<li>Try again. Most bands of misfits fail — this is a roguelite, after all. But even failed runs bring progress in the form of unlockable classes, personalities, and items. You’ll be better equipped next time — and the game’s high variance offers high replayability.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Demo available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/882590/Ragtag_Crew/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It's due for release later this year with Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Crusader Kings III: Fate of Iberia is out along with a free update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the best strategy games around has grown with the Crusader Kings III: Fate of Iberia DLC now available, along with the usual Paradox free update for all players. Paradox call it a "flavor pack", so it's not quite a full expansion but has enough new content that looks like it may be worth picking up.</p>
<p>"A centuries long Struggle will force you to rethink how to achieve your goals, as a variety of interested and competing parties fight to impose their will on the Iberian Peninsula."</p>
<p>Features in the DLC include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Struggle system: Entirely new system for historic conflict, available to modders and other content creators.</li>
<li>Decide the Fate of Iberia: Choose the path of conciliation or the path of conquest as you unite Spain or, alternately, agree to a peaceful division of spoils.</li>
<li>New content: Two new Legacy tracks (Metropolitan and Coterie), new cultural traits emphasizing special historical characteristics of the Iberian peninsula, new friendship interactions and duels over the chessboard.</li>
<li>New Events: Dynamic historical events related to the struggle for Iberia.</li>
<li>New Art: New character art reflecting Iberian cultures of the medieval era, new unit designs, new 3D models of holdings and artifacts  and a host of new art for backgrounds, events and loading.</li>
<li>New Music: Additions to the Crusader Kings III soundtrack.</li>
</ul>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="w0Av16wx6Y8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/de7aa75d314a377afd86f01fa3c9f3ae.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/w0Av16wx6Y8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As for the free update, this is what's new there for everyone:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can now convert to Era Zaharrak when you're an established Basque-cultured sinner in your current faith</li>
<li>Several faiths can now have the same Head of Faith:
	<ul>
<li>Several Islamic faiths now share a Head of Faith at game start, temporal Islamic faiths need to decide on creation which existing caliph they'll submit to (optional for Muhakkima &amp; Zandaqa)</li>
<li>Conversos, Mozarabic, Insular and Catholic all have the Pope as their Head of Faith</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added Rite tenet, allowing theocratic faiths to retain their old Head of Faith on creation if they don't differ too heavily from their mother faith</li>
<li>Added Mozarabic Christianity as a Rite-faith, sharing their Head of Faith with Catholicism</li>
<li>Reworked the Found Aragon decision to create Aragonese culture, be more frequent, and allow for slight varieties in Aragonese</li>
<li>Reworked the Avenge the Battle of Tours decision: it now shifts Aquitaine under the De Jure of Hispania when taken as it’s hard to accomplish.</li>
<li>Reworked the Form Portugal Decision: it can now be taken during the opportunity phase of the Struggle without being independent.</li>
<li>Added new special contracts for Clans: Marriage Favor, Jizya, Iqta, and Ghazi</li>
<li>Added a new faction type: the Dissolution faction will destroy the primary titles of their target, removing a Realm from the map</li>
<li>Added a new 867 Bookmark for Iberia: play one of the influential vassals and forge the destiny of your dynasty!</li>
<li>Added a dozen of new emblems for Coat of Arms and new patterns for Iberian cultures</li>
<li>Added a new field “Face item” for the Barbershop to, well, customize the character’s face</li>
</ul>
<p>You can buy Crusader Kings III from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/crusader-kings-iii?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158310/Crusader_Kings_III/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>, the DLC is priced around $6.99 / £5.19 / €6.99.</p>

<li>Published the source code to a variant of the NVIDIA Linux kernel modules dual-licensed as MIT/GPLv2. The source is available here:<br/>
	https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules<br/>
	and will be updated each driver release. Please see the "Open Linux Kernel Modules" chapter in the README for details.</li>
<li>Added support for the VK_EXT_external_memory_dma_buf and VK_EXT_image_drm_format_modifier Vulkan extensions. To use this functionality, the nvidia-drm kernel module must be loaded with DRM KMS mode setting enabled. See the DRM KMS section of the README for guidance on enabling mode setting.</li>
<li>Changed nvidia-suspend.service, nvidia-resume.service, and nvidia-hibernate.service to use WantedBy= rather than RequiredBy= dependencies for systemd-suspend.service and systemd-hibernate.service. This avoids a problem where suspend or hibernate fails if the NVIDIA driver is uninstalled without disabling these services first.<br/>
	See https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/21991<br/>
	If these services were manually enabled, it may be necessary to update their dependencies by running<br/>
	sudo systemctl reenable nvidia-suspend.service nvidia-resume.service nvidia-hibernate.service</li>
<li>Interlaced modes are now disabled when active stereo is enabled.</li>
<li>NVIDIA X Server Settings will now display the quit confirmation dialog automatically if only there are pending changes that need to be manually saved. The corresponding configuration option to control the appearance of the quit dialog was thus also removed.</li>
<li>Removed the warning message about mismatches between the compiler used to build the Linux kernel and the compiler used to build the NVIDIA kernel modules from nvidia-installer. Modern compilers are less likely to cause problems when this type of mismatch occurs, and it has become common in many distributions to build the Linux kernel with a different compiler than the default system compiler.</li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to skip test-loading the kernel modules on systems where no supported NVIDIA GPUs are detected.</li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to avoid a race condition which could cause the kernel module test load to fail due to udev automatically loading kernel modules left over from an existing NVIDIA driver installation. This failure resulted in an installation error message "Kernel module load error: File exists".</li>
<li>Updated the RTD3 Video Memory Utilization Threshold (NVreg_DynamicPowerManagementVideoMemoryThreshold) maximum value from 200 MB to 1024 MB.</li>
<li>Improved performance of GLX and Vulkan applications running in gamescope.</li>
<li>Added a "kernelopen" feature tag to the supported-gpus.json file, to indicate which GPUs are compatible with open-gpu-kernel-modules.</li>
<li>Improved Vulkan swapchain creation failure reporting. Applications can use the VK_EXT_debug_utils extension to receive additional information when an error was encountered in vkCreateSwapchainKHR().</li>
<li>Added a new configuration option for NVIDIA NGX to allow disabling the DSO signature check. See the "NGX" chapter of the README for more information.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where HDMI audio output was not working in some cases, especially with high display refresh rates (120Hz, 100Hz, etc.) using Fixed Rate Link (FRL) transmission mode.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be fantastic once <a href="https://github.com/Plagman/gamescope" target="_blank">Gamescope</a> works fully with NVIDIA, as it's one of the absolutely most useful projects around. Used by the Steam Deck, it fully controls the window for games so they don't mess with your system at all. Great for multi-monitor uses too, as lots of games like to misbehave. It also provides some added extras to allow you to control scaling, add in FSR and more. This driver is another step towards it.</p>

      <title>In the relaxing sim Sprout Valley you&#39;re a cute cat farming a tiny island</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sprout Valley looks quite sweet. A game where you play as Nico, a cute cat that has stepped away from their busy life to clean up a tiny island and create a nice farm. One I missed that had a successful <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zefrost/sprout-valley-chill-and-relaxing-experience" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> that finished earlier this month.</p>
<p>It's like a mini accessible animal-based Stardew Valley. You plant and water your crops, collect resources and sell them to keep progressing. There's a dynamic weather system, which the developer said will add-in some additional mechanics to the game too. What really makes it interesting is that each island is procedurally generated with a seed system, so you can play through the game an endless amount of times and share world seeds with others.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ecUjzb5D4T0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0d6a0253213e77f05ea30e1560e74f06.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ecUjzb5D4T0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer said it will also feature an events system, a full storyline, foraging, fishing, multiple islands, a quest system, an upgrades system and the list goes on.</p>
<p>Looks like one we're going to need to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>You can try out the experimental builds from <a href="https://zefrost.itch.io/sprout-valley" target="_blank">itch.io</a> right now and wishlist on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1964820/Sprout_Valley/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Made with Godot Engine, it offers Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Crystal Project is a wonderful new RPG you need to pick up</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you love classic JRPGs? Final Fantasy? Or anything like it? Well, Crystal Project released recently from developer Andrew Willman and it's quite wonderful.</p>
<p>It arrived on Steam back at the end of March, which somehow I missed actually covering even though I have been playing it and enjoying it thoroughly. Bringing back fond memories of playing through some classics on Game Boy Advance it really does scratch the itch for some adventuring and exploration. Seems most players on Steam agree too, with it seeing a Very Positive rating and the developer has a Native Linux build too that seems to work to perfection.</p>
<p>There's two things that really pull you in with Crystal Project. The first being the graphics with it mixing in flat-looking pixel characters in a 3D world that resembles Minecraft / Minecraft Dungeons in the presentation. Then there's the non-linear nature to it, as you're free to explore at your own pace and do what you want.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Rr3T1Kdhtiw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6d9d754ea4ab9e3b28de7638183aa7ba.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Rr3T1Kdhtiw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>No random encounters!</li>
<li>Manage Threat to control which party member a monster will attack.</li>
<li>No hidden information. Preview turn order, damage, and probabilities like in TRPGs.</li>
<li>Discover and unlock new classes.</li>
<li>Assign sub-classes, pick passive abilities, and equip all kinds of special items.</li>
<li>Invent unique team compositions, or stick to the MMORPG Holy Trinity.</li>
<li>No permanent missables!</li>
<li>Seamless transitions between zones with no loading screens anywhere.</li>
<li>Uncover the mysteries of the world all on your own.</li>
<li>Metroidvania-style progression.</li>
<li>No invisible walls! Try to jump and climb anywhere you want.</li>
<li>Overcome platforming challenges to discover neat loot... and other stuff.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's also Steam Deck Verified with the Native Linux version of the game. Absolutely delightful.</p>
<p>You can buy Crystal Project on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1637730/Crystal_Project/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>ROTA is a cute and colourful gravity-bending puzzle-platformer worth a look</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It might look colourful and inviting but don't let that fool you, ROTA is going to test your brain with its gravity-defying puzzle mechanics.</p>
<p>As you walk over the edge of each section, you begin to rotate gravity and then use pushing, pulling and rotating mechanics with blocks to get through each stage and solve the puzzles. Gravity affects the blocks you use too, and you need to position them in the right place to get over various obstacles.</p>
<p>It's simple and effective but the developer was pretty creative with the setting to the point that it will keep you interested, while also make you scratch your head a few times with the added challenging of collecting all the gems. If you love puzzle-platformers, it's definitely one you need to take a look at.</p>

      <title>SCS put the Heart of Russia DLC for Euro Truck Simulator 2 on hold for now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SCS Software have put out a statement about the Heart of Russia upcoming DLC for Euro Truck Simulator 2 and they've decided not to release it. With the ongoing barbaric invasion of Ukraine from Russia, it's not exactly surprising that releasing a DLC expansion for a game that's focused on Russia might cause problems.</p>
<p>In their <a href="https://blog.scssoft.com/2022/05/heart-of-russia-dlc-statement.html" target="_blank">statement</a>, SCS mentioned how they "try to be as apolitical as possible" but in this case, they simply could not stay silent on it "with so many people suffering, we decided to refrain from releasing the DLC so that it is not perceived in any way as being in support of or tolerance of the aggression".</p>
<p>Sounds like it's not completely cancelled though, as they will hold onto it until Ukraine can "rebuild and heal" so they will then "endeavour to find a way for our Heart of Russia DLC to play whatever part it can in that healing process, for everyone".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20980082261653929649gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>A tough situation for SCS to navigate through, considering all the effort they put into their work and their DLC are usually quite well received too due to the work they put in to capture the essence of the areas they add in.</p>
<p>You can buy ETS2 from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/euro-truck-simulator-2?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/227300/Euro_Truck_Simulator_2/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Indie classic Super Hexagon gets a big free Neo update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Super Hexagon, a true indie gem classic from Terry Cavanagh has a big update out now and it has also become Steam Deck Verified with it. Previously available in Beta, it's now in the Stable branch for all players.</p>
<p>While the gameplay is the same, a lot of the tech behind the game was rewritten to perform better, along with much improved gamepad / controller support. This is only the start too, with a Part 2 coming at some point that has also been teased. Developer Ethan Lee wrote some comments about the work involved on <a href="https://twitter.com/flibitijibibo/status/1531298835368005632" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, and you can see the <a href="https://superhexagon.com/neo/" target="_blank">Neo update page</a> for the full details.</p>

<p>This should keep the game running smoothly on all platforms for a long time to come.</p>
<p>You can buy it in many places like <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/super-hexagon?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/221640/Super_Hexagon/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://terrycavanagh.itch.io/super-hexagon" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/super_hexagon?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>

      <title>The QuickLaunch plugin for the Steam Deck is a great time-saver</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the Steam Deck you can install various third-party games and applications in desktop mode. However, it's a bit annoying adding them all to Steam and so the QuickLaunch plugin can save you some time.</p>
<p>Making great use of the <a href="https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/PluginLoader" target="_blank">Plugin Loader</a>, this <a href="https://github.com/Fisch03/SDH-QuickLaunch" target="_blank">QuickLaunch</a> plugin gives you a list in the Quick Launch menu of all your installed Flatpak applications on the Steam Deck (those you install via the Discover software store). Simple brilliance. No need to add each individually to Steam, no need for another app to keep adding them when you install something new, just an always up to date list via a plugin.</p>
<p>Here's a quick demo:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="B3pqt6ANcDA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9955c271a58d4ed71e36bdb3e702a76c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/B3pqt6ANcDA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's various other plugins <a href="https://plugins.deckbrew.xyz/" target="_blank">available</a> including:</p>
<ul>
<li>PowerTools - for even more performance tweaks.</li>
<li>SDH-Bluetooth - quickly connect to an already paired bluetooth device.</li>
<li>Mopidy-Controller - controller for the Mopidy music server, with tile view, tracklist view and playlist picker.</li>
<li>spdck - spotify controls</li>
<li>+ plenty more appearing</li>

      <title>Survival game Rust might be playable properly on Linux and Steam Deck soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rust, the massively popular and quite brutal survival game from Facepunch Studios is working towards Easy Anti-Cheat support for Linux and Steam Deck with Proton.</p>
<p>This has been a long-time coming, as they previously removed support for their Native Linux build but confirmed <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/07/garry-newman-of-facepunch-mentions-working-with-eac-for-rust-on-linux-with-proton/" target="_blank">back in July of 2021</a> that they were working on getting it running properly for the Steam Deck. In a fresh update reply to a user on Twitter asking about Easy Anti-Cheat, Facepunch head Garry Newman <a href="https://twitter.com/garrynewman/status/1531235676653510657" target="_blank">mentioned</a> how "They're working on it, maybe next month if it turns out to be stable enough".</p>
<p>Good news for fans of Rust and Linux / Steam Deck, considering it is still one of the most popular games on Steam and has remained so for years.</p>

Defeat rivals, conquer tournaments, build relationships, and uncover a strange arcade conspiracy as your team walks the road to victory!"</p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher gets more Steam Deck and Flatpak improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> for Epic Games and GOG on Linux and Steam Deck has a new update out, mostly focused on cleaning up some problems but also sprinkles in some new features like a command-line interface.</p>
<p>This free and open source app has quickly become the go-to for running any games on Linux from Epic and GOG. especially as neither of them offer an official Linux client.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6369059551653908359gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6369059551653908359gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Version 2.3.4 Main Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added a CLI parameter <code class="inline-code">--no-gui</code> that opens Heroic with no user interface. Might get in handy to create some scripts or add a Heroic game on other launchers. Basically, you just need to call <code class="inline-code">heroic --no-gui heroic://launch/{appName}</code>.</li>
<li>Added more feedback on errors and fixed some error messages that were not exactly clear.</li>
<li>Now it's possible to pass any wrappers on the Environmental Variable sections. Might be good to some advanced users.</li>
<li>[Linux] Heroic now will search for Proton versions and Runtimes outside the main library, so in any other drive or partition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Main Fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>[Linux/SteamDeck] Several fixes related to the Steam runtime and Proton.</li>
<li>[General] Fixes Force Download and Force Upload of Cloud saves not working properly.</li>
<li>[Linux/SteamDeck] Fix Winetricks on Flatpak/SteamDeck for good now.</li>
<li>[General] Fix GOG games not running the setup correctly;</li>
<li>[Linux/Mac] Fix the Windows version of a native GOG game not working properly</li>
<li>[macOS] Heroic will check if the crossover bottle exists before launching now.</li>
<li>[macOS] Fix Installing games on the folder with spaces.</li>
<li>[General] Library Refresh now will refresh only that specific library, making it more responsive.</li>
<li>[General] Fixes some styling issues across the settings.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Shortly after version 2.3.5 landed with these adjustments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disable most verbosity since several dialogs with false positives were being shown.</li>
<li>Fix corrupted config message on Windows.</li>
<li>Fix Library is not showing after log in with epic games.</li>
<li>Disabled auto-update on macOS</li>
</ul>

      <title>Crazy rogue-lite &#39;Wally and the FANTASTIC PREDATORS&#39; adds Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Up for trying out a new rogue-lite that looks completely bizarre? Wally and the FANTASTIC PREDATORS looks pretty hilarious and now it has Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Not only does it look completely insane, the developer's description of the game is equally ridiculous that doesn't really tell you too much about the game. The developer says "What sets Wally the game apart is it's attitude. Wally is the weird kid in middle school who Naruto runs in between classes. It's weird, wholesome and confident in itself. It's that confidence that is omni-present in pretty much every part of the game. It's also not afraid of going to extremes in order to make a point or to make a good joke!" — okay then.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="s1C92vDVUwI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7432359d329a1337cf3293feac3ec570.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/s1C92vDVUwI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><strong>Game Features:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Daily Twists</strong>, These Daily/Weekly runs we introduce crazy twists every day! Start one daily run with maximum movement speed or start a run over encumbered with bombs. Compete with 600+ members of our discord community!</li>
<li>Local <strong>COOP </strong>which means you only need one copy of Wally to enjoy with a friend!</li>
<li>10 <strong>Dungeons</strong></li>
<li><strong>150+</strong> different Upgrades/Curses/Weapons/Quests/Daily Twists. With so many stack able passives interacting with each other it'll take years to see every combination.</li>
<li>5 Single Player Run types</li>
<li>5 Boss fights that will make you say, WHAT THE HECK IS THAT</li>
<li>Branching paths, get as greedy as much as you want, do you want to trade all your max health and become a glass cannon? Why the heck not!</li>
<li>True Ending, (It's a mystery to everyone what it is)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Have to admit though, it does look and sound <u>really</u> good. Seems it also went quite unnoticed with the original release in 2019, with only 129 Steam user reviews.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1077450/view/3308469454281066650" target="_blank">announcement</a> about the Linux version the developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wally and the FANTASTIC PREDATORS now has native Linux and Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>Oh, also Steam Auto Cloud saves (set up to be cross-platform) and even Steam Input.</p>
<p>These changes should allow for a smooth Steam Deck experience right out of the box, such as savedata syncing between your main machine and your Deck and also easy control rebinding.</p>
<p>As for now, we don't have a "Steam Deck Verified" rating, but the Linux build has been tested to work on Ubuntu 64-Bit LTS releases.</p>
<p>If anything, tell your Deck to run the default Linux build.</p>
<p>To prevent any odd-looking behavior, the Linux version will always start in fullscreen if it's in Big Picture or Deck mode by default, even if you've synced savedata with your main machine.</p>

      <title>Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Mega Mix+ comes to PC, works on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SEGA decide to drop out of nowhere Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Mega Mix+ on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1761390/Hatsune_Miku_Project_DIVA_Mega_Mix/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. The good news is that thanks to Proton, it works out of the box on Linux and Steam Deck. A very popular rhythm game series, so to see it arrive on PC is awesome. Not that I'm any good at it mind you, or that I've ever personally played one in the series before but I tried it for science.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li><u><strong>Over 170 Songs</strong></u> - Project DIVA debuts on PC with over 170 playable songs, each accompanied by a unique music video. Get into classics like “Melt” and “Cendrillon” plus new favorites like “Catch The Wave”!</li>
<li><u><strong>Endless Customization</strong></u> - Dress Miku and friends from head to toe in over 500 dazzling hairstyles, costumes, and accessories. Costumes can be tailored to every music video, making for endless possibilities.</li>
<li><strong><u>Swap Visual Styles in One Click</u></strong> - Switch between two visual styles for different experiences. Enjoy the pop of the “Mega Mix” style or the gloss of the high-fidelity “Future Tone” style, and change it up anytime.</li>
<li><u><strong>Custom T-Shirt Editor</strong></u> - Let Miku kickstart your fashion designer career on the big stage! Draw your own T-shirt from front to back, then debut it in a performance.</li>
<li><u><strong>Custom Playlists</strong></u> - You’re the director of this concert! Curate a playlist to perfection, hit play, and let the customized music videos roll in this cinematic experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's a little look at it running directly on a Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1rrtWUKo36A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f61d96ea4c81dad2e5b8c7cbe43a7a48.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1rrtWUKo36A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>I might be terrible at it but hey it works well and looks great.</em></p>
<p>Also tested it running just fine on my Fedora 36 desktop, both tested with Proton 7 and no issues encountered. Overall it seems like the Windows port running through Proton is looking really good, so clearly the developer did well and hopefully more will come to PC in future.</p>

      <title>Modern twin-stick cave-flyer &#39;Gravity Ace&#39; is out now and it&#39;s great</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Remember the days when games were a lot simpler, and you had various attempts at cave-flying? Well, I do and the new release Gravity Ace brings back some fun memories while making a modern spin.</p>
<p>A love letter to the likes of  Thrust and Gravitar, Gravity Ace has you pilot a ship through tight corridoors and avoid various obstacles and enemies. It's slick and it looks pretty great too with it's sort-of messy pixel-art style with lots of vibrant colours and effects going on. This isn't just a standard gravity-fighting 2D game though, as it's also a twin-stick shooter and a pretty good one.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="89GQepJgNUA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6d16d24610a52c30d85dccf8ac94c97d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/89GQepJgNUA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Quite challenging actually, since it makes heavy use of physics simulation. Everything that can move uses the physics engine, so you really have to watch out. Boost too fast at the wrong moment and you're done for. There's also a built-in level editor so you can make your own levels and full campaigns, along with being able to share them with others.</p>
<p>While the type of gameplay it offers is very much a small niche now since games have moved onto so many different genres and styles, Gravity Ace should be top of your list if this is the type of game you want to play. Not just for nostalgia but because it's a good arcade-like experience.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1003860/Gravity_Ace/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://jotson.itch.io/gravity" target="_blank">itch.io</a>.</p>

      <title>Get some classics working better on Steam Deck with Luxtorpeda upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/luxtorpeda-dev/luxtorpeda" target="_blank">Luxtorpeda</a> is a Steam Play tool (like Proton) but for running various Native Linux games engines. A fresh update is out, further improving Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>If you want to play some classics like Morrowind with OpenMW, X-COM: UFO Defense with openXcom, RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 with OpenRCT2 (and <a href="https://luxtorpeda-dev.github.io/" target="_blank">many more</a>) — Luxtorpeda is your friend. You would set Luxtorpeda as the Steam Play compatibility tool for those example games, and it then does the magic for you of downloading the Native Linux game engines for them, useful if those game engines are more up to date for modern systems and enhancements (which they usually are).</p>
<p>For the latest update here's what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Upgrade dependencies and code cleanup</li>
<li>Add logging to file if <code class="inline-code">LUX_WRITE_LOGGING=1</code> is set. The log will be written to <code class="inline-code">~/.local/state/luxtorpeda/luxtorpeda.log</code></li>
<li>Remove Steam Controller direct connection logic, relying on steam input instead. Steam Controller will still work in keyboard/mouse simulation mode. This makes it easier to maintain along with the steam deck support</li>
<li>Added support for Steam Deck gamepad controls. Gamepad support relies on the steam input settings. If steam input for the game is set as a gamepad, then will show controller icons and work as a controller. Otherwise, can use the touchscreen as a mouse</li>
<li>Detect if running on steam deck and set <code class="inline-code">LUX_STEAM_DECK=1</code> environment variable</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So now, if you have a game in Steam Input set to gamepad, it will actually detect that properly and allow you to use the gamepad prompts for the Luxtorpeda downloading and configuration UI in Gaming Mode on the Steam Deck thanks to this.</p>
<p>On top of that, the developer has been going through what games and game engines are supported, to give them some default configurations (like screen resolution) for the Steam Deck too.</p>

      <title>Valve say they will look into fixing up the bot problems in Team Fortress 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Finally, after multiple years of problems, Valve seem to be getting back on the horse for Team Fortress 2 development to deal with the big bot problem.</p>
<p>All across Twitter recently there's been a big storm from TF2 fans about the issue, as Valve has seemingly ignored it for quite some time now. It was getting hard to come across posts about anything to do with Steam and Valve that didn't have players complaining about it. Rightly so, it's a huge problem, bots have been ruining the game.</p>
<p>Valve took to Twitter to the official TF2 account to say <a href="https://twitter.com/TeamFortress/status/1529970640224018433" target="_blank">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="css-1dbjc4n">
<div class="css-1dbjc4n r-1s2bzr4">
<div class="css-901oao r-1nao33i r-37j5jr r-1blvdjr r-16dba41 r-vrz42v r-bcqeeo r-bnwqim r-qvutc0" data-testid="tweetText" dir="auto" id="id__e7agx3km9ot" lang="en">TF2 community, we hear you! We love this game and know you do, too. We see how large this issue has become and are working to improve things.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>That's the first Twitter post from the TF2 team in years, and the official TF2 website hasn't said anything about the issues.</p>
<p>Considering TF2 is one of the games that helped to push Steam's popularity, and continues to this day being one of the most popular games on Steam, hopefully Valve really will actually solve it this time. They tried a few times across 2020 and 2021 to deal with it, but all they did is slow the bots down for a while and they all came back in force.</p>

      <title>SteamOS 3.2 out for Steam Deck — better fan curves, refresh rate switching</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released a huge Stable update for SteamOS with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3297210455204145216" target="_blank">version 3.2</a> now available for updating on your Steam Deck. Here's what's new. A lot of this isn't exactly new-news, since it's pushing out most of the changes from the Beta you could opt into at any point. </p>
<p>SteamOS 3.2 includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added an OS-controlled fan curve to improve the experience in low usage scenarios, and adjusting how the fan responds to different scenarios and temperatures.
	<ul>
<li>The old version of the fan curve is still available, and can be turned on in Settings &gt; System</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added support for changing the in-game screen refresh rate. The refresh rate will automatically be adjusted to the desired option when going in and out of game.
	<ul>
<li>There is a new slider in the Quick Access Menu &gt; Performance tab that allows you to choose a screen refresh rate between 40-60Hz</li>
<li>The framerate limit slider values will update accordingly, and will include 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, or uncapped framerate options.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with typing the € key using the Steam keyboard</li>
<li>Performance HUD now shows a more accurate reading of VRAM used (previously would cap out at 1G used)</li>
<li>Added more internal screen resolution options for games to choose from</li>
<li>Fixed gain staging, resulting in higher max speaker volume, and removes white noise coming through 3.5mm jack with some headphones.</li>
<li>Fixed PipeWire and Steam failing to elevate their thread priorities</li>
<li>Fixed the language dropdown in the Warframe launcher</li>
<li>microSD card formatting process now performs a quick format</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally though, there's also the Steam Deck Client update that came along with it. This includes now full and proper support for Remote Play Together. So you will be able to host and join games using that feature. As a reminder, it allows one person who owns a game to let others join, who get it streamed from the host.</p>
<p>On top of that there's a notification if the Steam Deck SSD hits below 2GB space, you can name controller layout commands, you can connect to hidden wireless networks, there's icons for gamepad and mouse commands shown on in-game virtual menus and even the ability to close a window if the game / app you're running has more than one visible (an update to the window-switcher).</p>
<p>The fan changes really are the biggest thing here though. One of the fans the Steam Deck ships with is far louder than the other, with a high-pitch that comes with it. This new fan curve is massively quieter and just makes the experience so much nicer overall.</p>
<p>Second being the refresh rate switching, not to be confused with dynamic refresh rate, as this allows you to switch to a specific-set refresh rate like 40Hz. As Valve explained on that part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So 30hz = 33.33 ms/frame, and 60hz = 16.66ms/frame. Meanwhile, 40hz is 25 ms/frame. So while it might seem a bit counter intuitive, 40fps is exactly half-way between 30 fps and 60 fps in terms of update speed, and as such looks and feels far more responsive than 30fps. Generally speaking you always want a very stable frame pacing. So having a rock solid 40hz is better than oscillating between 42 and 48 hz, especially if your screen refresh is 60hz. This is because you're only actually getting a new frame each 1/60th of a second, so every time you miss, you get a double frame, leading to judder.</p>
<p>So a rock solid 40fps in game, with a 40hz updating screen, means every frame is a new frame and as a result it can feel smoother than an inconsistent framerate with a higher screen refresh. In addition, locking framerate lower puts less demand on the system and thus saves battery. While 40hz will use more battery than 30hz, it will use less than a game capped at a higher refresh, while still giving a subjectively far higher quality of an experience comparitively.</p>

      <title>Beautiful musical puzzle-adventure Sonority is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Musical puzzle-adventure game Sonority is out now from Hanging Gardens Interactive and Application Systems Heidelberg. I took a look so you know what to expect. Note: key provided by the publisher.</p>
<p>Set in a world where music is magic, you set off on a journey to help heal a friend and use the power of music to overcome many obstacles in your way. Here's the thing — I'm completely terrible at having any kind of rhythm, and musically I don't have the tiniest bit of talent, so I had no idea what to expect from such a musical adventure. The developers said that "no previous musical knowledge necessary", so I really put it to the test and thankfully it wasn't overly confusing, relatively simple but still beautiful in the presentation.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="efu8HLs9-fo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9299f29b9f8246c83ace8423afe15890.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/efu8HLs9-fo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As you go through the game you explore different areas, each having a few different sets of puzzles. A lot of it is about moving blocks around to access other areas, or to bring down barriers. You do this by collecting and then playing various notes on a pan flute while you're next to various stones that capture the note — then you run the puzzle sequence and see what happens. You can do each puzzle as many times as you like, until you get it right.</p>
<p>The notes are simple to play too, as it's just one-note per-key and you can pick between using letters or numbers on keyboard and they're spread across various buttons on a gamepad. Although the notes at the bottom of the screen don't show gamepad prompts, which was a little troublesome.</p>
<p>While a puzzle sequence is playing, you need to keep an eye on what moves with each note. It's all logical and well thought-out.  Just a little concentration and listening is all that's needed, so there's no real frustration involved, it's all thoroughly peaceful and enjoyable although there's a few tricky puzzles that stumped me for a while on getting the notes in the right order when multiple things were moving.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13744843101653597783gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13744843101653597783gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>A bit quirky with the story, that sees you follow a Racoon that's friends with a weird stone head that can't quite believe you can understand them. Touching though, all about helping out a friend.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Interesting new puzzle mechanic based on melodies. (Simple note sequences develop into small melodies and then into complex pieces of music.)</li>
<li>A touching story about Esther and an old, oddball raccoon and his singing stone friends.</li>
<li>A lovingly designed, cohesive 3D game world with varied locations.</li>
<li>Atmospheric, extensive soundtrack with English and German versions of original songs.</li>
<li>Play with keyboard or controller.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You also get full voice-over in both English and German, with text available for: English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, Korean, Japanese and Chinese.</p>
<p>It's also Steam Deck <em>Playable</em>, mainly due to some text being a little too small. Hopefully the developer can tweak that to make it properly Verified. Overall, a great puzzle game with a lovely atmosphere that works great on Linux.</p>
<p>Available to buy from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/sonority?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1432390/Sonority/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.

      <title>CRSED: F.O.A.D. is like PUBG with powers, now on Linux and Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We may not have PUBG supported on Linux / Steam Deck yet but we do now have CRSED: F.O.A.D. (previously called Cuisine Royale), a Battle Royale game that looks quite a bit like PUBG but sprinkles in some powers.</p>
<p>At some point, the developer put up a Native Linux version and it has also now been Steam Deck Verified with the <a href="https://crsed.net/en/news/show/449-crsed-is-now-officially-supported-by-steam-deck/#!/" target="_blank">announcement</a> being official earlier this month. So if you've been after another BR game, perhaps this might be it? Although it doesn't have a big playerbase, it's active enough that finding a game so far hasn't been a problem. Seems mildly amusing too.</p>
<p>Here's how it runs on my Fedora Linux desktop followed by Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kPSoYc-23nI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/228a8aa5ff6cf4236c5e0ee801c46685.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kPSoYc-23nI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's close to perfection. Once they fix up some of the lighting issues, it would be quite great.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Massive and dense PvP battles: dozens of players begin their trip in one of the four picturesque and detailed locations, fighting their way to the centre of the battlefield. All the while, the battlefield itself shrinks constantly, surrounded by the deadly Dark Zone.</li>
<li>Different champions to select - each one with a unique superpower.</li>
<li>A constantly growing collection of realistically modelled weapons and armor, including anti-materiel guns, sniper rifles, assault rifles, rocket launchers, flamethrowers and mortars. There are few compromises in the game regarding physics or ballistics rules. Different vehicles, military amphibians and speed boats will help to cover distances.</li>
<li>Use mystical powers! Draw seals with your blood or conduct ancient rituals, throw hex bags at enemies and use your own special power. You can flood the whole map or cause the sun to eclipse, set up traps, summon zombies or teleport yourself or others the hell out of here. But first, one needs to collect sinner souls for killing enemies - to be able to pay for most of that luxury.</li>
<li>Stand out from the crowd with different costumes, masks, talismans, hats, gestures, graffiti and even underwear! Unlock new spirit-guardians to get additional tactical abilities in the battles.</li>
<li>Regular special events with new rules and setups of battles and a system of daily tasks and secret missions rewarding players with unique items and powers.</li>
<li>Fair play TPV: you can play in first or third person view. In order to mitigate any advantage of the latter, every player has a familiar with a camera that can uncover the position of a player who is peeking around a corner. So if you see a butterfly or a drone - you should know that you are being watched.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>On my desktop with two monitors, one annoying quirk it had when first loading was the resolution stretching across both. A quick change in the settings and now it's looking pretty good, and it performs well too. The game is even using the Vulkan API on Linux.</p>

      <title>Morrowind gets shiny in OpenMW with post-processing shaders coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>OpenMW, the free and open source game engine reimplementation of Morrowind is about to get a lot better looking, with post-processing shaders coming in the next release.</p>
<p>This is a huge advancement for OpenMW, and will continue making it the absolute best way to play Morrowind on modern systems. Unlike modern games, Morrowind doesn't have lots of fancy graphical effects with shaders and OpenMW is fixing that for the upcoming 0.48.0 release.</p>
<p>Not in their recent <a href="https://openmw.org/2022/shiny-new-things-are-coming/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, they mentioned "Cody Glassman aka wazabear finally added <a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/merge_requests/1124" target="_blank">post-processing shaders</a> to OpenMW. This is probably the biggest graphical enhancement for OpenMW since the implementation of real-time shadows. Modded OpenMW setups will now be able to take a huge step forward in time when it comes to graphic effects." and that sounds <em>very</em> exciting.</p>

      <title>Serious Sam 4 gets Steam Deck support with a small but &#39;notable&#39; update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Serious Sam 4 gained a Steam Deck Verified rating recently, which is in part thanks to the developer pushing out a small but significant patch for the game. It was listed in the recent post on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/steam-deck-hits-over-3000-games-either-verified-or-playable/" target="_blank">Steam Deck hitting 3,000 titles</a> either Playable or Verified.</p>
<p>While it's not a Native Linux version like their previous titles, seeing another developer actively support their game in Proton to give a good experience on Linux and Steam Deck is great.</p>
<p>In the recent patch notes the developer stated: "Hey everyone! As you have noticed we released a small, but notable update for Serious Sam 4. The update is focused on performance and game stability, new GPU support and most importantly the game now has a Steam Deck support".</p>
<p>How does it run on Steam Deck though? Let's take a quick look:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="KkuTlVzvzQU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a59d866609fb331da45277c8bb1a030c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/KkuTlVzvzQU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In short: not great. Playable but frequent hard-drops down, even below 30FPS at times and the frame timing is messy. Seems they still have plenty of work to do on optimizing Serious Sam 4.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/serious-sam-4?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/257420/Serious_Sam_4/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
