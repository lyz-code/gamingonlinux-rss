      <title>Linux share on Steam back to nearly 2% thanks to Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a couple of months of the Linux user share on Steam dropping, the November 2023 Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey shows it shooting back up again. With Steam Deck continuing to push Linux gaming. <em>See the data over time on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">the GOL Steam Tracker</a>.</em></p>
<p>As mentioned in the last article for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/october-23-steam-survey-simplified-chinese-rises-linux-and-macos-decline/" target="_blank">October 2023's numbers</a>, the issue was something we've seen quite a few times now. A sudden surge of Simplified Chinese as a language on Steam, which pretty much always brings down the Linux and macOS share. Things look back to normal again now though.</p>
<p>The current numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Windows </strong>96.56%</li>
<li><strong>Linux</strong> 1.91%</li>
<li><strong>macOS</strong> 1.53%</li>
</ul>
<p>When filtering just to the Linux numbers we can see that SteamOS Holo (Steam Deck) continues to be what's pushing the numbers up overall:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 42.99% +0.68%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 7.81% +0.27%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS 64 bit 6.67% -0.06%</li>
<li>Freedesktop.org SDK 23.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 5.33% -0.40%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 21.2 64 bit 4.25% +0.32%</li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 3.79% -0.16%</li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 2.68% +2.68%</li>
<li>Other 26.48% -3.33%</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam Deck - SteamOS 3.5.8 now in Preview</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a fresh SteamOS update into Preview for Steam Deck, with SteamOS 3.5.8 out now fixing up various problems since the big 3.5 update.</p>
<p>One issue that concerned players, that was reported a lot, was the performance overlay GPU speed flipping between a low and high number which this should solve, on top of improving performance in some areas and general bug fixing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where modifying settings in the desktop partition manager could prevent the SD card from being mounted and visible in Steam</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in desktop mode where dropping a folder on the desktop would erroneously create a shortcut for every item within the folder.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Graphics and Performance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the performance overlay displaying GPU clock speed as an instantaneous measurement rather than an average, resulting in misleading numbers.
<ul>
<li>This matches behavior of SteamOS 3.4.11</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed a problem with elevated noise levels for trackpad pressure sensors. Affects only certain configurations.</li>
<li>Fixed incorrect colors (gamma) when using Steam In-Home Streaming.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare system crash on game exit</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in certain HDR titles wherein wiggling the cursor on the same frame as closing the game would cause incorrect colors in subsequent game launches</li>
<li>Improved a situation where a game's frame presentation could block because of buffers submitted by Steam or other windows, removing a potential source of game stutters.</li>
<li>When the frame limiter or vsync is enabled, the performance overlay now shows frame timings based on when they are flipped to the display, rather than when the GPU rendering was completed. The GPU-based timings are still visible on level four setting.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue causing stutter in certain games that buffer multiple frames in advance.</li>
<li>Miscellaneous compositor performance improvements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Roots of Pacha 1.1 adds new content and a fix for Steam Deck external controllers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The single-player and co-op life sim / farming game Roots of Pacha has a big update out now, with it there's plenty of new content and a nice fix for Steam Deck players docking to the big screen.</p>
<p>For Steam Deck players and Linux Desktop, the game has been a bit problematic with controllers. That should be a little bit better with this update as they noted "Steam Deck now recognizes external controller and can work in docked mode". However, it's not fully fixed, as "there's still a known issue in the library we use that will prevent reconnection from a disconnected controller" but it's certainly better than it was.</p>

      <title>Story Mode for Them&#39;s Fightin&#39; Herds cancelled and active development to cease</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some sad news for fans of the fighting game Them's Fightin' Herds, as the developer Mane6 has cancelled the Story Mode and will be ceasing active development on the game.</p>
<p>This was announced on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/574980/view/3882727783056476087" target="_blank">Steam</a> in an update post going over the 5.1.0 version release that pulls in a new Armor Break game mechanic, along with various bug fixes. It also goes over a few details up an upcoming DLC character named Nidra, and teases the final DLC character Baihe. Below all that though, is a short note about the future of the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As we look forward to the release of Nidra and Baihe, let's talk about what comes next.<br/>
After the Season 1 Pass is complete, we will be ceasing active development on TFH. We will still be able to release small patches to address game-breaking bugs, but no new content will be produced. Unfortunately, that includes Story Mode.<br/>
<br/>
Story Mode has always been an ambitious feature and one we truly desired to implement. We know how much our fans have been looking forward to Story Mode chapters, and we hope you understand how much we looked forward to working on and releasing them.<br/>
<br/>
We are looking for opportunities to release content that has already been produced for Chapter 2, starting with a new stage, "Restricted Section". This stage will be a part of the version 6.0 update alongside Nidra and Baihe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Always a shame when long-promised features for a game don't happen, and it seems players really aren't pleased with this. Since the announcement went up on November 22nd, the recent user reviews on Steam are now Mostly Negative</p>
<p>You can buy it from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/thems-fightin-herds?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/574980/Thems_Fightin_Herds/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Check out the new trailer for Demonschool, an upcoming light horror tactics RPG</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Demonschool looks like one of the most unique tactics RPG I've seen for a while, and the new trailer that just went up really has me excited for it. Unique because of the movement and combat system, allowing for plenty of planning and experimentation — not to mention it's stylish as heck.</p>

      <title>Huge update to Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 adds an Epilogue, new game modes and willy physics</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well that's quite an upgrade Baldur's Gate 3 just got, and one of my absolute favourite games of this year. Might be time to jump back in again!</p>
<p>The main headline features are all <em>great</em> like the new Epilogue, Honour Mode and Custom mode, improved inventory access and more but — there's one other little feature that they didn't seem to talk about, that plenty have been discovering to great surprise. I am of course talking about willy physics. Yes, all those people upset at release that there wasn't any wobbly bits can now rejoice. I don't think you <em>really</em> need to see it but <a href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/bg3willyphysics.mp4" target="_blank">video proof</a> (NSFW, obviously). Glorious.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17658034131701440859gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17658034131701440859gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The main highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Epilogue: An entirely new section at the end of the game that aims to provide a well-deserved sense of closure with your allies.</li>
<li>Two new play modes: Honour Mode and Custom Mode.</li>
<li>Many performance improvements, particularly in Act III.</li>
<li>Players playing on machines with low VRAM/RAM should see improved performance.</li>
<li>The game is now available in Korean!</li>
<li>While at camp, you can now access and manage the inventories of companions who aren't in your active party.</li>
<li>Added a brand new fight in Ramazith’s Tower.</li>
<li>Orin’s outfit now drops as loot and is wearable by anyone. We also gave it a suitably disgusting description and name.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Those performance improvements as well will be quite welcome, especially on top of AMD FSR 2.2 that was added <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/baldurs-gate-3-patch-4-brings-amd-fsr-22-looking-better-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">in a previous update</a>.</p>
<p>For Linux Desktop and Steam Deck just make sure you're either on Proton Hotfix or the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/proton-experimental-fixes-baldurs-gate-3-improves-nickelodeon-all-star-brawl-2/" target="_blank">latest Proton Experimental</a>, as they have the needed updates to ensure the game will actually launch.</p>
<p>You can buy Baldur's Gate 3 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/baldurs_gate_iii?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma 6 - Beta 1 released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The KDE team continue sprinting towards to finish line of the Plasma 6 release next year, with a Beta release now available for the popular Linux desktop environment which is also used on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>"Plasma 6 is the upcoming version of Plasma that integrates the latest version of Qt, Qt 6, the framework upon which Plasma is built.

<p>If you held off testing with the previous Alpha release, perhaps the Beta might be a good time to jump in. You can test it with a Plasma 6-powered distribution like <a href="https://neon.kde.org/download" target="_blank">Neon Unstable</a>.</p>

      <title>Battle.net broke in Wine / Proton - here&#39;s how to fix for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ah launchers, don't you just love them? A reoccuring nuisance for Steam Deck and Desktop Linux gaming is that they can and will break and the latest to break (again) is Battle.net. Here's how you can fix it for now.</p>
<p>Firstly, for people just using Proton on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux direct through Steam you can use the bleeding-edge Beta of Proton Experimental. As <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1730445392058462509" target="_blank">posted on X</a> (Twitter) by Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="css-175oi2r">
<div class="css-175oi2r r-1s2bzr4">
<div class="css-1rynq56 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0 r-37j5jr r-1inkyih r-16dba41 r-bnwqim r-135wba7" data-testid="tweetText" dir="auto" id="id__kzdjjv7895r" lang="en" style="color: rgb(247, 249, 249); text-overflow: unset;">Initial Battle.net fix has been pushed to the [bleeding-edge] beta branch of Proton Experimental. Timing of mainline Proton Experimental availability is TBD.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>How to do that? Find Proton Experimental in your Steam Library and go into its Properties -&gt; Betas -&gt; and select bleeding-edge from the dropdown box.</p>
<p>Another solution that you can try is to use this as a launch option on any Proton version in Steam:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">WINE_SIMULATE_WRITECOPY=1 %command%</code></p>
<p>For people using some form of Wine / Proton in Lutris you can add WINE_SIMULATE_WRITECOPY with a value of 1 as an environment variable in the system options inside a Wine runner you're using.</p>
<p>It can be frustrating when this happens, and it's certainly far from the first time Battle.net has broken along with EA, Ubisoft and other extra launchers. Thankfully this time it's an easy enough sort until it's fixed properly inside Wine and Proton directly.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong> - 17:17 UTC: If you use Wine-GE, the latest <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/wine-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton8-25" target="_blank">Wine-GE-Proton8-25</a> release has a fix for it.</p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher 2.11 released with custom library categories</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Heroic Games Launcher 2.11 is out now and brings with it an easier way to sort your game library by adding custom categories. This allows you to put your games into whatever category you want, just like you can do with the Collections feature on Steam.</p>
<p>So you would go to a game page, to the three dot menu, down to categories and then add it to an existing one or create a new one like below:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11135809511701351069gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11135809511701351069gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19287417041701351068gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19287417041701351068gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em>Click pictures to enlarge</em></p>
<p>They developers also said "We also revamped all our filters to make it more seamless and to clean the library UI. Visual issues related to logs, dialogs, and RTL layout have been addressed, and anti-cheat runtimes are now enabled by default. We've also made several UI/UX enhancements and fixed some issues specific to macOS. Thanks to our amazing community for their contributions!".</p>

      <title>So what the heck is an &#39;indie game&#39; nowadays anyway?</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You'll have to forgive me, dear readers, because I am a little confused on what's going on at the moment. What the heck actually is an indie or independent game nowadays? Someone like <em>me</em> is probably supposed to tell <em>you</em> what it is, but honestly I'm just as confused as you are now.</p>
<p>The problem is, there doesn't really seem to actually be a good answer to this now. Game developers and publishers alike don't agree on it, and other prominent people in the industry all seem to have different opinions on it now too.</p>
<p>To add to the confusion, The Game Awards decided to put DAVE THE DIVER into the "Best Independent Game" category. A great game for sure but the problem is that while it may perhaps have the look of what a lot of people think is an indie game, in my book it's firmly <em>not</em>. You see it was developed by Mintrocket, a sub-brand of Nexon, who are a pretty big South Korean publisher that have <em>billions</em> in income. How, in any possible meaning of the term, is that indie?</p>
<p>Arguments on this have been ongoing since the nominees were announced a couple of weeks ago, and adding fuel to the fire now TGA's Geoff Keighley has given some thoughts on it during a recent <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1988267110" target="_blank">Twitch</a> (about 27:00) livestream and Keighley's response to a question on it was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look it's a great question. Independent can mean different things to different people, it's sort of a broad term right. You can argue does independent mean the budget of the game, does independent mean where the source of financing was, is it based on the team size, is it the independent spirit of a game meaning the kind of smaller game that's different. Everyone has their own opinion about this. We really defer to our jury, 120 global media outlets that vote on these awards to kind of make that determination of is something independent or not.</p>
<p>In other industries sometimes there are things like the film industry the budget can't be above this amount of dollars, some people said Larian with Baldur's Gate 3 that's an independent game, Kojima Productions with Death Stranding some people say that's an independent game and even though it's an independent studio of course it's funded by PlayStation. It's question like if you have a publisher, is that still independent or not. We also have Best Debut Indie Game, which is something I'm really proud of too, that's for teams doing it's first ever game this year, that's often really really independent studios just starting out and I love that we can recognise them that way.</p>
<p>So yeah Dave the Diver, that game is made by a group named Mintrocket, it's a smaller game from a smaller group  but it's part of Nexon which is a very large publisher so I think it's a fair debate and discussion is that game truly independent or is it not. You can kind of argue either way it's independent in spirit, it's a small game, I don't know what the budget it is but i think it's a probably a relatively small budget game but it's from a larger entity, whereas there's other games on that list that are from much smaller studios. Like Dredge, published by team17, so is that independent or not, 'coze you have a publisher. It's a really complicated thing to figure out and come up with strict rules around it, so we kinda let people use their best judgement and you can agree or disagree with the choices, but the fact that Dave the Diver was on that list meant that out of all the independent games that the jury looked at or what they thought were independent games that was one of the top 5 that they looked at this year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keighley goes on to mention past game awards and games that won and how people debated this in the past, but basically sums it all up with the exact criteria being an "open debate for discussion". Seems to me that Keighley had no real answer on this. Just a lot of dancing around it, asking more questions of the category and just further adding to the confusion.</p>
<p>I get what Keighley was trying to say though, when mentioning how "it's a different set of games, and I like that we get to recognise different games in our show and not have the same 5-10 games nominated in every category". As otherwise, you likely would just get the huge publisher games filling up every year but the category itself is just not named particularly well it seems, or they need to actually properly settle on what indie actually is.</p>
<p>Certainly is an interesting debate.</p>
<p>So — over to you in the comments: what is an indie or independent game now? How would you define it exactly?</p>

      <title>Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP gets a 2023 refresh and Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP, originally released back in 2012, just got a fresh upgrade bringing with it some compatibility fixes and it's now also Steam Deck Verified too!</p>
<p>Not heard of it before? Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP is an exploratory action adventure with an emphasis on audiovisual style. Traverse a mythic little realm, use a sword to do battle &amp; evoke sworcery to solve mystical musical mysteries. Experience a videogame world that is affected by moon phases &amp; help a wandering warrior monk complete her woeful errand.</p>
<p>Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP features an album's worth of original music by noted composer Jim Guthrie as well as artwork &amp; designs by Superbrothers Inc, crafted &amp; engineered by videogame wizards at Capy in Toronto, Canada.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15858397061701347570gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15858397061701347570gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>From the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/204060/discussions/0/6027566653454582072/" target="_blank">patch notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We had a lot of changes in the latest Sworcery update! Most of them are focused on bringing the game up to date for the latest operating systems and devices. This should help the game stay stable in the years to come! The biggest fix by far is the game can run on Steam Deck! After that, it's having the game run on MacOS again. Followed by better support for Linux and finally, better High DPI resolution support for Windows. We also fixed a whole bunch of little gameplay bugs, some kind of serious, some just janky, but all of them we think were pretty rare. Here's a breakdown:<br/>
 </p>
<div class="bb_h3">Upgraded:</div>
SDL 1.2 -&gt; SDL 2.26.0<br/>
FmodEx -&gt; Fmod Studio 2.2.16<br/>
Steamworks SDK -&gt; 1.57<br/>
Various Compilers -&gt; Latest/near latest Compilers<br/>
New minimum of Windows 10<br/>
New minimum of Ubuntu 18.04<br/>
New minimum of MacOS<br/>
 
<div class="bb_h3">Added:</div>
64bit support<br/>
Steam Deck Playable (We failed the Green checkmark due to showing some mouse icons)<br/>
 
<div class="bb_h3">Removed:</div>
Twitter/X support (libcurl)<br/>
Windows XP/Vista/7/8 support, Steam itself is set to remove support soon <a class="bb_link" href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/4784-4F2B-1321-800A" target="_blank">https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/4784-4F2B-1321-800A</a><br/>
 
<div class="bb_h3">Fixed:</div>
<p>Game running super slow on Steam Deck<br/>
Game runs on MacOS again<br/>
Fixed libcurl issues on Linux that prevented launching the game<br/>
Windows High DPI issues, game running at a resolution bigger than monitor, etc.<br/>
Plus soooo many little things, I honestly lost track!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Native Linux version was initially missing some files so it wouldn't run, so I held off on covering this until it was solved, which it now is so I can confirm it launches properly on Kubuntu 23.10 and Steam Deck now!</p>

      <title>Steam Deck global top seller again thanks to cheaper LCDs and the Steam Deck OLED</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Not exactly a surprise but still great to see for Steam Deck fans for the ongoing support from Valve, as the Steam Deck is now firmly the global top seller on Steam once again.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/after-over-80-weeks-the-steam-deck-leaves-the-top-10-global-sellers-on-steam/" target="_blank">I reported on previously</a>, until around the end of September 2023, the Steam Deck was consistently in the top 10 on Steam for revenue since the release back in February 2022. Revenue being the <em>key</em> word here, because Valve's lists are based on revenue as they don't give out units sold publicly. Then it dropped globally down to 11th in the week for September 26, 2023 - October 3, 2023 and hovered around 11th - 15th place.</p>
<p>Now that Valve have discounted the LCD models and released the Steam Deck OLED though, this has caused a nice spike in sales for Valve with the Steam Deck jumping up to 4th place for the week November 7, 2023 - November 14, 2023 and now the global <em>top</em> seller once again as of the week for November 14, 2023 - November 21, 2023 and it's still the top seller for the last week as well so it's firmly back.</p>
<p>Valve will of course be happy with this, as they plan to continue supporting all models, and they clearly have <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1722675542875402311" target="_blank">plans</a> for a Steam Deck 2 once the hardware becomes available that's a big enough of a performance boost. We don't know how many Steam Decks have been sold but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/9/23954205/valve-steam-deck-multiple-millions" target="_blank">it is now</a> in the "multiple millions" number.</p>
<p>When you look at <a href="https://steamdeck.komodo.jp/?lang=en" target="_blank">Komodo</a> who sell the Steam Deck across Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong they're currently listing the Steam Deck OLED models as out of stock right now too - so clearly there's healthy demand there as well.</p>
<p>Depending on availability, you may still be able to pick up a Steam Deck LCD model in 64GB or 512GB until they run out of stock as those models have been discontinued. Or you can go for the 256GB LCD model which is now cheaper, or just grab the excellent Steam Deck OLED in either 512GB or 1TB.</p>
<p>You can buy a Steam Deck <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" target="_blank">directly from Valve</a>.</p>

      <title>An Amazing Wizard is a bland name for a game but it looks like great chaos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Jakub Dąbrowski may need to work on their game naming, but at least the gameplay looks like it's a lot of fun in An Amazing Wizard.</p>
<p>Currently in development with a demo available on Steam (Native Linux support), it's a 2D fast-paced, metroidvania inspired rogue-lite featuring a procedurally generated world, over 250 upgrades, 7 different characters, over 100 spells to wield and going by the trailer it looks actually great with some pretty chaotic action going on. I'm getting a Dead Cells meets Skul: The Hero Slayer vibe with this one.</p>
<p>Have a look below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yMUFVrNXhvU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ce059a88e323ac0e95b72df458568acb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yMUFVrNXhvU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Planned Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>PROCEDURALLY GENERATED WORLD</strong> - Explore a unique world every time you play.</li>
<li><strong>ACTION ROGUEVANIA</strong> - This means permanent deaths where you lose everything you have found, but there are lots of permanent upgrades available.</li>
<li><strong>250+ PERMANENT UPGRADES</strong> - Upgrade your starting items or statistics, add more elements to the world, increase your chances of finding better items and many more!</li>
<li><strong>7 PLAYABLE CHARACTERS</strong> - Unlock and play as one of the 7 Elemental Wizards!</li>
<li><strong>ENCHANT YOUR SPELLS</strong> - Search for Astral Forges to add enchantments to all your Spells and Magic Weapons to add some special effects to them!</li>
<li><strong>250+ UNIQUE ARTIFACTS</strong> - Every artifact has it's own special use. A lot of them change your Basic Spell behavior or add special abilities. Literally countless combinations.</li>
<li><strong>100+ POWERFUL SPELLS</strong> - Cast Fire Balls or Tornados, Summon Creatures, Slow Time, Create Gravity Zones and many, many more...</li>
<li><strong>DOZENS OF MAGIC WEAPONS</strong> - Use one of many Magic Weapons to help you survive!</li>
<li><strong>5 NONLINEAR LEVELS</strong> - Only 5 levels? Yes, but each time you die you will respawn in one of the four nature-inspired worlds and face other enemies based on the current biome. Levels order is never the same!</li>
<li><strong>FEW DIFFICULTY LEVELS</strong> - Every time you kill the end boss, you will gain the possibility to change the difficulty level and face stronger foes.</li>
<li><strong>MANY BOSSES</strong> - After every level you will have to face a merciless boss.</li>
<li><strong>LEVEL UP YOUR CHARACTER</strong> - Gain Experience Points for killing enemies. Select one of dozens of perks after leveling up to make you even stronger!</li>
<li><strong>A LOT OF SECRETS AND MYSTERIES TO DISCOVER</strong> - No spoilers!</li>
<li><strong>HOURS OF FUN</strong> - This one depends on your skill. Something about 50 - 80 hours or even more!</li>
<li><strong>MULTIPLE SAVE SLOTS</strong></li>
</ul>

      <title>Aether combines Risk of Rain 2 with Wizard of Legend</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What do you get when you combine the elemental combat system from Wizard of Legend, with the gameplay progression from Risk of Rain 2? The result is Aether.</p>
<p>Now available in Early Access on Steam, developer ORYgames has created a rather entertaining cocktail of gameplay elements here. They sent me a key to take a look, and I have to say my initial impression is rather positive on this one, because it's a really good blending.</p>
<p>The basic gameplay loop is very much Risk of Rain 2 where you drop into a map and fight through enemies, collect relics to power up and then beat the boss to continue onto the next map. You'll do this using your elemental powers like Fire, Water, Ice and so on with one initially picked during the brief intro and the rest you can purchase as you progress through to swap between them. As you go through taking down enemies, you can then level up that element for you run to gain access to more powerful abilities.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BHkyO7bMdPg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6dd9b5ddea7065ba0f3e9f7b22bb0548.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BHkyO7bMdPg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Since it's a new release, and Early Access, it's a little rough around the edges (especially the UI), but it shows an enormous amount of promise and it's already really fun to blast through with the different elements. If you love action rogue-lites, this is definitely one to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support built with Godot Engine.</p>
<p>Available in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2462790/Aether/" target="_blank">Early Access on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Xorg is dead, long live Wayland - Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) dropping Xorg</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some interesting Linux industry news for you here, as the long road towards Wayland by default everywhere is taking another big step with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) removing the Xorg server and other X servers (except Xwayland) from RHEL 10 and the following releases.</p>
<p>From their <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/rhel-10-plans-wayland-and-xorg-server" target="_blank">announcement</a> by developer Carlos Soriano Sanchez posted November 27th:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We want to recognize the significant effort all these organizations and individuals have made, especially the rest of the upstream community, without whom this project would never be so mature. This effort gave us the confidence to first make Wayland default for most use cases in RHEL 8, followed up with the <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/9.0_release_notes/deprecated_functionality#deprecated-functionality_graphics-infrastructures" target="_blank">deprecating</a> of Xorg server in RHEL 9, with the intention of its removal in a future release. Earlier this year (2023), as part of our RHEL 10 planning, we made a study to understand Wayland’s status, not only from an infrastructure perspective, but also from an ecosystem perspective. The result of this evaluation is that, while there are still some gaps and applications that need some level of adaptation, we believe the Wayland infrastructure and ecosystem are in good shape, and that we’re on a good path for the identified blockers to be resolved by the time RHEL 10 is out, planned to be released on the first half of 2025.</p>
<p>With this, we’ve decided to remove Xorg server and other X servers (except Xwayland) from RHEL 10 and the following releases. Xwayland should be able to handle most X11 clients that won’t immediately be ported to Wayland, and if needed, our customers will be able to stay on RHEL 9 for its <a href="https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata#RHEL8_and_9_Life_Cycle" target="_blank">full life cycle</a> while resolving the specifics needed for transitioning to a Wayland ecosystem. It’s important to note that “Xorg Server” and “X11” are not synonymous, X11 is a protocol that will continue to be supported through Xwayland, while the Xorg Server is one of the implementations of the X11 protocol.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Red Hat and their engineers have their fingers in many pies across the Linux space, so this is a pretty big move, and one they say will enable them to "tackle problems such as HDR, increased security, setups with mixed low and high density displays or very high density displays, better GPU/Display hot-plugging, better gestures and scrolling, and so on" — which of course will end up benefiting everyone because that's how open source works.</p>
<p>Have you fully switched over to Wayland yet?</p>

      <title>Post-apocalyptic real-time strategy game Retro Commander is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Up for some more classic RTS action? Retro Commander from Noble Master is now officially released after 6+ years in development. Some of you might know Noble Master from their previous games like Age of Conquest IV and Demise of Nations.</p>
<p>You definitely get some early Westwood RTS game vibes from this like Command &amp; Conquer. The developer mentioned over email that "Retro Commander tries to emulate the classic RTS look and feel, albeit with modern day controls and elements. The game focuses on both single and multiplayer matches. A comic-based story campaign follows the footsteps of Agent Johnson, who wakes up in a futuristic wasteland. In over 25+ missions, you need to make new friends and fight against their enemies. The single player AI comes with several difficulty levels. In multiplayer games you fight co-op style with the AI and other players for ultimate victory. Players are given an ELO-like rating. The game supports cross-platform multiplayer matches against players on PC, Mac, Linux, Android and iOS.".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1zW6AUVAXlE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2c9e8508f522524c9d5c3a8632452c74.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1zW6AUVAXlE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Post-Apocalyptic: Real-time strategy (RTS) played in a post-apocalyptic timeline on Mother Earth. The environment includes day-night cycles, rain, snow, wind and solar flare activity.</li>
<li>Story Campaign: Deep campaign and story line of humanity after a cataclysmic event. Factions come with their own specialized technologies such as stealth, robots, drones or shields.</li>
<li>Single &amp; Multiplayer: A challenging AI for both single and multiplayer matches with co-op play. Cross-platform multiplayer including LAN/internet. ONLINE play comes with an award and rating system.</li>
<li>Play Modes: In addition to regular skirmish matches, the game supports missions such as elimination, survival, capture the flag, defense and battle royale. Available in both single and multiplayer also are escort and rescue missions.</li>
<li>Structures &amp; Troops: Common troops for land, sea and air warfare is available to all factions. Specialized elements such as stealth, shields, EMP weapons, nukes, portals, orbital weapons, assimilator and other troops and structures provide for additional variety.</li>
<li>Research: A tech tree and research options enable to build specialized structures and troops. A Tech Snatcher can be used to steal enemy technology.</li>
<li>Modding: A map editor is included allowing for player-modded maps including player-modded campaigns. All elements including troops, structures, as well as graphics and sound effects, can be modded if desired.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Just like their previous games you get a couple little tutorial levels free to play plus some multiplayer maps, and then you have to buy the rest of the game. It's a curious way to try to pull people in that not many games on Steam do. The actual full complete game can be picked up as a DLC on Steam or in-game for £16.75 / $19.99.</p>

      <title>GUNHEAD from Alientrap gets Steam Deck improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GUNHEAD is the latest release from Alientrap who also made CRYPTARK, Capsized and Wytchwood. It's also just been updated to improve it on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>What is GUNHEAD? It's technically a sequel to CRYPTARK but with a new perspective as a fast paced strategic roguelike FPS where you take the role of a pirate mech with a gun for a head, looting derelict spaceships filled with monstrous drones made out of bone and steel.</p>
<p>In a recent patch they <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/704000/view/3889483182511062265" target="_blank">announced</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've updated to 1.44 - focused on better Steam Deck support.<br/>
<br/>
- Will default to 130% UI scale for Steam Deck<br/>
- Better scaling of the UI for different UI scales<br/>
- Larger fonts (inventory, license station)</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Seems like a good time for me to jump in and take a look! Check out the launch trailer below:</p>

      <title>TUXEDO Sirius 16 launches full AMD gaming notebook with Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for your next hardware purchase? How about a new Linux notebook that's all-in with AMD? The TUXEDO Sirius 16 looks delicious.</p>
<p>"Sirius is the brightest star in the night sky and a binary star system. With the new Sirius 16 - Gen1, TUXEDO is breaking new ground and launching the first and long-awaited full AMD Linux gaming notebook named after the celestial body, especially since the TUXEDO Sirius 16 is also powered by a particularly exciting binary star, consisting of the AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS and the AMD Radeon RX 7600M XT." — TUXEDO Computers</p>
<p>What you get here is quite the powerhouse with a 16.1 inch 2560x1440 display, with a 165Hz refresh rate. Backed up by the 8 cores and 16 threads from the AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS, a large 80 Wh battery, 2x 8 GB DDR5-5600 RAM and 1x 500 GB Samsung 980 SSD.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13466143511701093094gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13466143511701093094gol1.png"/></a><br/>
Pictured - TUXEDO Sirius 16</em></p>
<p>As you might be able to tell from the image above it has a colour-adjustable light bar on the front edge as well as a per-key RGB-backlit keyboard for those of you who like things a little less plain.</p>
<p>Plenty of room for upgrades during configuration or <em>after</em> purchase with the ability to up it to 96GB RAM, and they say it has two easily accessible M.2 slots when you remove the base tray, which is covered by their warranty, so you can configure it up to 2 x 4TB SSDs with a fast PCIe 4.0 connection.</p>
<p>As for connectivity you get 2 x USB-C (1x USB 4.0 Gen3x2, 1x USB 3.2 Gen2 (40 Gbps each)), 2 x USB-A 3.2 Gen2 (10 Gbps each), HDMI 2.1 and RJ45 LAN (1 Gbps). It also has a webcam shutter and a fingerprint sensor (although that only apparently works on Windows).</p>
<p>You can choose to have it with their own Tuxedo OS (based on Ubuntu) or with Ubuntu 22.04, Kubuntu 22.04 or Ubuntu Budgie 22.04. Pricing starts at 1,699 EUR for the base model. They said the expect the first deliveries around mid-December 2023.</p>

      <title>Plasma 6 full steam ahead with only one showstopper left for Wayland by default</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As the KDE team continue working full steam ahead towards Plasma 6, they're now down to a single showstopping bug for having Wayland by default. Written up in a <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2023/11/24/this-week-in-kde-the-plasma-6-feature-freeze-approaches/" target="_blank">blog post</a> as usual by developer Nate Graham, recent work for readying Plasma 6 sounds great.</p>
<p>The last bug considered a showstopper is "<a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=444335" target="_blank">Full sticky keys functionality does not work under Wayland</a>", so once that's solved they will consider it ready to be default. There's various other bugs of course, with lots of users now testing and reporting from the recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/kde-plasma-6-gets-a-first-alpha-release/" target="_blank">huge Plasma 6 Alpha release</a> but mostly minor issues.</p>
<p>Another important issue that has now been solved is that Plasma on Wayland will now actually prompt you about unsaved changes in apps, instead of just rebooting or shutting down and allowing you to lose your work. Thankfully no Wayland protocol changes were needed for this.</p>
<p>Found an app behaving badly? The "Kill unresponsive window?" is now fully online on Plasma Wayland and got a modern UI face-lift.</p>
<p>Something else that's been changed that sounds useful is that when you upgrade to Plasma 6 from Plasma 5, if there's Widgets you were using that aren't API compatible it will be shown in a "user-friendly way" so you don't think it's all just broken.</p>
<p>A reminder on the roadmap for Plasma 6:</p>
<ul>
<li>8 November 2023: Alpha</li>
<li>29 November 2023: Beta 1</li>
<li>20 December 2023: Beta 2</li>
<li>10 January 2024: Release Candidate 1</li>
<li>31 January 2024: Release Candidate 2</li>
<li>21 February 2024: Private Tarball Release</li>
<li>28 February 2024: Public Release</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm very much looking forward to seeing everything Plasma 6 has to offer up at release next year for my desktop. And eventually on Steam Deck when Valve pull it into a future SteamOS upgrade for the desktop mode.</p>
<p>Is there anything in particular you're looking forward to in Plasma 6?</p>

      <title>Over 5% of The Pale Beyond players were on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's an interesting little data point for you, as the developers behind the polar exploration and survival game The Pale Beyond have given an update on Steam Deck engagement with their game.</p>
<p>In a recent video from Bellular Studios, who run the Bellular News YouTube channel, they showed off that 5.28% of players overall were on Steam Deck. The video went up on Nov 24th, 2023 and it's mentioned they're recent stats and Michael mentions in the video how they were "absolutely god damn shocked just how many people were playing on Steam Deck".</p>
<p>The Steam Deck bit starts around 4:37 which is where the video embed below should start:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aghkxdkzX_c?rel=0&amp;start=277"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/54c4badac7eae11792f25a981dd79d9c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aghkxdkzX_c?rel=0&amp;start=277" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What's interesting though is this is not the first time I've covered it. Looking back on it, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/the-pale-beyond-sold-10-of-copies-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">they also said back in March</a> this year how Steam Deck sales were at 10% but that was quite early on after release and the game has now been out for around 9 months. Seeing over 5% of players actually being on Steam Deck though seems like a pretty good number, and far above macOS.</p>
<p>You can buy a copy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/the-pale-beyond?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1266030/The_Pale_Beyond/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It's rated <img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"> Steam Deck Verified and it's also Platinum on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1266030" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a>.</img></p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I adore creature collecting games and Portal Fantasy looks and sounds like it could be quite an interesting spin on the genre, with you creating worlds for people to explore.

      <title>VKD3D-Proton 2.11 released with DirectX Raytracing enabled by default</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>An exciting release of VKD3D-Proton has arrived! VKD3D-Proton 2.11 brings with it some big improvements for the Direct3D 12 to Vulkan translation layer used in Valve's Proton for Linux PC and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>First big change is that DXR is now enabled by default, no more needing to set "VKD3D_CONFIG=dxr" as that is the default. However they note a few special cases where it is not. Sampler feedback is also now supported through emulation, and thanks to this DX Ultimate (FL 12.2) is also now exposed by default on RDNA2+ and Turing+.</p>
<p>There's also various performance fixes, new workarounds for game issues and a few general bug fixes. All the rest available below in the full changelog:</p>
<details class="spoiler_container"><summary class="spoiler_header">Changelog, click me</summary>
<div class="spoiler-content">
<h3>Features</h3>
<h5>DXR enabled by default</h5>
<p><code class="inline-code">VKD3D_CONFIG=dxr</code> is default now, and no longer needed.<br/>
There are some special cases where DXR is not enabled by default. The only such current example is<br/>
"Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice" on Deck which force-enables DXR if it is supported, even on Deck.<br/>
New semantics are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">dxr</code>: Force-enable DXR, even when it is considered unsafe</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">nodxr</code>: Disable DXR</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">dxr11</code>: Removed. <code class="inline-code">dxr</code> already implied DXR 1.1 anyway</li>
</ul>
<h5>Sampler feedback</h5>
<p>This feature was the last feature required for FL 12.2 and is implemented through emulation.<br/>
As demonstrated in the <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/blob/master/docs/sampler_feedback.md" target="_blank">implementation docs</a>, all<br/>
native implementations of this feature are fundamentally broken in some way.<br/>
There's also no known game that ships requiring this feature, so we just consider this a checkbox feature.</p>
<h5>DX Ultimate (FL 12.2) now exposed by default</h5>
<p>On RDNA2+ and Turing+ we can finally expose the DX Ultimate feature set!</p>
<h5>Misc</h5>
<ul>
<li>Implement a bunch of missing "Vulkan-on-D3D12" features

<ul>
<li>Currently unused by games</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Performance</h5>
<ul>

reordering and batching command preprocessing
<ul>
<li>We have observed 15% FPS gains in Halo Infinite on RADV</li>
<li>1-2% in Starfield in some test locations</li>
<li>Needs pending Mesa work to land to take advantage of this improvement</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tune memory allocation patterns for DGC preprocess buffers
<ul>
<li>Avoids a lot of allocation churn</li>
<li>Greatly reduces CPU overhead on NV</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Workarounds</h5>
<ul>

</ul>
</li>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need more bullet hell goodness for your Linux PC or Steam Deck? Good news, Cosmic Carnage looks pretty wild and it will have Native Linux support.</p>
<p>No, I'm not talking about the fighting game Cosmic Carnage from 1994 but a space shooter filled with action and glorious upgrades from developer LionSword Studios. Looks like they've learned a lot from their 2016 game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/366010/Generic_Space_Shooter/" target="_blank">Generic Space Shooter</a> because this looks far more interesting. Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="abfbWyCVlzM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f44d7c48a6f62f3136875790a4e36c1c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/abfbWyCVlzM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Battle endless waves of alien spaceships. Fight against a variety of enemies with different behaviours and attack patterns</li>
<li>Collect EXP to level up and upgrade your ship to help you survive the onslaught. 80+ upgrades available making each run unique and interesting</li>
<li>With a roguelite progression system, no run is ever a fail. Gather more points and unlock new upgrades and weapons to add to the pool to create overpowered builds!</li>
<li>Upgrade your build by unlocking new astronauts and ships. Each astronaut has unique abilities and stats. Each ship has a unique weapon and stats. Synchronize astronauts and ships to unlock hidden synergies.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It has a demo <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2440650/Cosmic_Carnage/" target="_blank">available on Steam</a> and with Native Linux support the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2440650/discussions/0/7342618062800321868/" target="_blank">developer said</a> it's "100% compatible with the steam deck". No current set release date while they're still working on it but they have been regularly updating the demo so be sure to check it out. Looks like they may also have a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2704660/Cosmic_Carnage_Prologue/" target="_blank">Prologue</a> coming as well.</p>

      <title>Explore secrets in a sacred operating system in Crossroad OS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's something wrong with this operating system. Crossroad OS is a single-player adventure where you solve puzzles, meet strange creatures and explore a sacred operating system created as a junction between the human and spirit world.</p>
<p>According to the developer it's a bit of a weird mixture between a puzzle and a horror game and that "Crossʀoad OS was created with noble intentions, however approaching the spirits without a stable mind is a risky undertaking. What secrets are hiding in the system's partitions?". Don't go expecting any jump-scares though it's more about the spooky and unsettling atmosphere. Looks like a rather odd one but it has me curious to see more from it.</p>
<p>Check out the initial teaser below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_NAwAIi5l9A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6884bbcf5dd851439f7986b7abd99551.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_NAwAIi5l9A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's a demo available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1783800/Crossroad_OS/" target="_blank">Steam </a>and it releases December 8th.</p>

      <title>Please save me I have discovered Leaf Blower Revolution</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's cold and blowy outside, there's leaves everywhere and so the obvious solution to keep warm is to stay inside and play a game about blowing away leaves. Apparently that's what I'm doing with my life now, playing a free to play Steam game where I throw my mouse around the screen like a maniac to get all these damn leaves off my lawn.</p>
<p>Leaf Blower Revolution is a peculiar game. Released back in 2020 it's gone onto be rather popular too, with over 20,000 user reviews and an Overwhelmingly Positive rating. Clearly they're onto something, and I can see why. I want to keep going and I don't exactly know why.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1421276971700834197gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1421276971700834197gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's very much a game of watching numbers go up, or not, just leaf it alone and come back later and see what's happened. Since it's an idle game, you can just leave it on a second monitor or in the background, to dive in for a few minutes to take an active role whenever you want.</p>
<p>The game trickles in little treats for you too. There's many different types of leaves to blow away you'll find drop onto your lawn, and as you blow them away you'll get a leaf currency to go and buy some special tools. I must admit, the game gave me a chuckle the first time I closed and opened it, <a href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2674673571700831763gol1.jpg" target="_blank">noting how</a> I shouldn't be rewarded for doing nothing but it did so anyway and gave me a ton of basic leaves to go and buy stuff with. Okay Leaf Blower Revolution, I see what you're doing, you're trying to get me to play more.</p>
<p>When you start playing more, and buying more (with the in-game currency), it only gets bigger and funnier too. Starting off with nothing but your hands, moving onto rakes and leaf blowers, automatic leaf blowers that travel around the screen like little robots and more. You can even buy nuclear fuel to power-up your devices, what could possibly go wrong there?</p>
<p>After you accrue enough leaves you can buy the ability to get different leaves, which then opens up other types of shops to buy more different quirky tools and abilities. Each shop gives you the ability to buy the next level leaf too and — repeat. Glorious number-go-up repetition while leaves fly around the screen. It's weirdly therapeutic. There's over 30 different leaves, over 38 different shops, over 40 areas, there's even some pets you can get.</p>
<p>The Steam reviews make me laugh too, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Sockman21/recommended/1468260/" target="_blank">someone</a> with over 1,000 hours in it wrote "Still need just another hour or two to see if I really like it....", and yeah — that about sums this game up I think. Apparently at some point my Tea went cold, I'll warm it up later, gotta blow away some more leaves.</p>
<p>Unless you want it to take over your life don't download Leaf Blower Revolution.</p>
<p>Works great on desktop Linux with Proton 8, and Valve rated it Steam Deck Playable. Worked fine on Steam Deck with my testing but the font can be a little small. You can turn up the font size, but the font itself is not very clear but thankfully you can choose an alternative font too which is much clearer.</p>
<p>Check it out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1468260/Leaf_Blower_Revolution__Idle_Game/" target="_blank">free to play on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Hell Let Loose now works on Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a fun one I managed to somehow miss recently, but it seems that Hell Let Loose has hooked up Easy Anti-Cheat to work on Linux / Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Not a big surprise though, considering they clearly stated <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/hell-let-loose-planning-steam-deck-support/" target="_blank">it was in their roadmap</a>, but it appears the addition came without any proper announcement I can find. Seems it was added around a 1-2 months ago. You just need to ensure you have the "Proton EasyAntiCheat Runtime" installed in your Steam Library, and then it should work with Proton 8.</p>

      <title>Deckmate, my favourite Steam Deck accessory is discounted for Black Friday</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Your Steam Deck deserves a Deckmate. It's easily one of my most used and favourite accessories to pair up with a Steam Deck and now it's discounted so go grab it. They've actually done a bit of a rebrand recently, since they now offer up similar accessories for the ROG Ally too, so they're now known as <a href="https://getmechanism.com/" target="_blank">Mechanism</a>.</p>
<p>For those who haven't seen it before: it's an attachment system giving you a mounting system to basically mount…well, anything to it. Valve even used it for their video of the Steam Deck OLED orb in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vTsZMvjJ-A" target="_blank">official trailer</a>, all those OLED's were mounted with the Deckmate.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11197497451700828392gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11197497451700828392gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>It simply hooked over the top and bottom, and the mount itself is thin enough that it really doesn't get in the way of anything. Then you just hook whatever you want into the back of it. That could be a battery pack, a stand, a USB-C hub, attach it to a wall (because why not?) or whatever else you can think of that might need to be attached to it.</p>
<p>For Black Friday there's discount on the <a href="https://getmechanism.com/products/deck-mate-entire-system" target="_blank">full system</a>, the <a href="https://getmechanism.com/products/the-essentials-bundle" target="_blank">essentials bundle</a>, just as a <a href="https://getmechanism.com/products/kickstand-bundle" target="_blank">kickstand</a> and <a href="https://getmechanism.com/" target="_blank">more</a>. The discounts last until Tuesday 28th November.</p>
<p>You can see my quick-take year-old video on it below:</p>

      <title>Check out Doom Infinite, a Doom-based FPS roguelike mod for GZDoom</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tired of GZDoom mods for DOOM II just adding some maps or some gore? Be sure to take a look at Doom Infinite, which turns it into a FPS roguelike. I've been testing it out myself since it was emailed in (thanks Tate), and love the idea of it! Currently not finished and what you get is only a demo of things to come, as they continue working on it but it's really promising if you love your retro shooters with a bit of extra spice.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4379728911700747267gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4379728911700747267gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>More about it: "Encounter demons empowered with various traits and curses that make them stronger, faster or much more tricky to send back to hell. Collect, mix and match multiple permanent power-ups for a unique approach on each runs. Find unique weapons variations or mod them yourself to your liking. Explore more to unlock new places or discover hidden secrets, but beware of the traps and challenges lingering about. All that while the dynamic weather or map-wide curses provide additional challenges. Even the maps themselves can warp and distort, presenting a slightly different path each time you visit them. But more importantly than that - survive the longest you can, while shooting anything moving that crosses your path!</p>
<p>Greatly expanding upon the originals' mechanics, Infinite allows for a fun, dynamic and unique experience along with perma-death and unlockable achievements. From dynamic spawners, balanced game director, visual and audio updates, three brand new weapons, music shuffler to even a simple but expressive emote system - those are only some of the extra components built into this mod, all to enhance ripping and tearing through hordes of demons hunting you down."</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/doom-infinite" target="_blank">find it on Mod DB</a>.</p>
<p>To play it on Linux you need a copy of <a href="https://zdoom.org/" target="_blank">GZDoom</a> installed, along with the wad file from DOOM II (<a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/doom_ii" target="_blank">GOG</a> / <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300/DOOM_II/" target="_blank">Steam</a>). You'll need to make sure your DOOM II wad file is in the correct location which for standard installs will be:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">~/.config/gzdoom/</code></p>
<p>And for Flathub installs it will be:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">~/.var/app/org.zdoom.GZDoom/.config/gzdoom/</code></p>
<p>And then place the Doom Infinite pk3 file into the same folder.</p>
<p>Then to run you via terminal with a standard install:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">gzdoom -file ~/.config/gzdoom/DOOM_Infinite_DEMO_0978_6.pk3</code></p>
<p>And again for Flatpak / Flathub:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">flatpak run org.zdoom.GZDoom -file ~/.var/app/org.zdoom.GZDoom/.config/gzdoom/DOOM_Infinite_DEMO_0978_6.pk3</code></p>

      <title>Dominatrix is a fresh updated port of Ritual Entertainment&#39;s SiN</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Remember SiN? The classic shooter from Ritual Entertainment released in 1998? Well there's a new updated port of it for modern systems. Developer Rohit emailed about it to mention the release on <a href="https://rohit.itch.io/dominatrix" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and their <a href="https://cohost.org/rohit/post/3207148-release-dominatrix" target="_blank">CoHost blog</a> about the work involved that's worth a read.</p>
<p>The thing is, Night Dive Studios did put out SiN: Gold, and they're working on SiN Reloaded but there's no hint at a release date for that yet. Rohit mentions that "While SiN Gold is a pretty decent way to play the game, it still has a few pain points that could really use some smoothing over" and so they put on their coding socks and made Dominatrix.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16811670421700743302gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16811670421700743302gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the new features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new Linux port.</li>
<li>Better resolution support.</li>
<li>Controller Support.</li>
<li>Weapon radial menu.</li>
<li>Gamepad-friendly virtual keyboard.</li>
<li>Better menu/interface scaling.</li>

<p>It's also been added to the Luxtorpeda, to enable you to easily run it from Steam. See <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/steam-deck-using-luxtorpeda-for-morrowind-warzone-2100-and-x-com/" target="_blank">more on Luxtorpeda here</a>.</p>
<p>You do need the original data files to play it which you can grab from <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/sin_gold" target="_blank">GOG</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1313/SiN_Gold/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Hunt: Showdown anti-cheat now fixed for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After being left broken for about a week, Crytek have now fixed up their Easy Anti-Cheat for Hunt: Showdown to work on Steam Deck / Linux again.</p>
<p>Reported on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/hunt-showdown-is-broken-on-steam-deck-linux-due-to-easy-anti-cheat/" target="_blank">here a few days ago</a>, Hunt: Showdown would boot you out of games showing a warning that Easy Anti-Cheat authorization failed. Crytek did respond and noted in the article that they were working on it, which is good and great to see it fixed. You shouldn't need to do anything, as the issue was on their end, just make sure the game is up to date in your Steam Downloads.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9823097551700740270gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9823097551700740270gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's a shame this sort of anti-cheat issue is still happening though, as we're only a few months away from two years since the Steam Deck released. At least they enabled the support though, plenty of developers still <em>haven't</em> enabled support for Steam Deck / Linux at all like Rust, Destiny 2, PUBG, Rainbow Six Siege and many others.</p>

      <title>Diablo IV free to play on Steam until Tuesday</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a chance for you to see if you actually want to buy Diablo IV. Not only is it 40% off on Steam and works great on Steam Deck and desktop Linux with Proton but it's also <em>temporarily</em> free to play.</p>
<p>Blizzard has made it free until Tuesday, 6PM UTC — so you've got quite a while to jump in and see what to expect from it. Once the free time is over though, you will lose access if you don't purchase it. And thanks to it being on Steam, for Steam Deck / Linux there's no special configuration needed and no messing around with manually installing Battle Net.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2944295031700739740gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2944295031700739740gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Something to note though, which Blizzard don't state on Steam, is that this free to play time only lasts until you hit level 20 in the game. Still a good few hours of gameplay though to give it a run.</p>
<p>With it being 40% off you can pick it up for £35.99 / $41.99 / €41.99.</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2344520/Diablo_IV/" target="_blank">out on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Have you been playing it? What's your current thoughts on it?</p>
<p>You can see a previous Steam Deck video I did for Diablo IV below, although this was through Battle Net the performance is generally the same:</p>

      <title>SteamOS 3.5.7 released, plus Steam Deck Client update and Power LED changes coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Three bits of Steam Deck news for you this morning with multiple updates coming in including a SteamOS update, a Steam Deck Client update and info about some LED changes coming.</p>
<p>Firstly, SteamOS 3.5.7 has been promoted to Stable with these <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3870342884095376976" target="_blank">changes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed internal microphone not working in certain cases like desktop applications.</li>
<li>Deployed a temporary workaround for a performance problem with "Allow Tearing".</li>
<li>Fixed some USB connectivity issues.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>On top of that a Stable Steam Deck Client Update was also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3870342884094741095" target="_blank">released</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed SteamDeck being recognized as previously authorized device for Family Sharing.</li>
<li>Fixed the new controller support panel showing on tools/applications.</li>
<li>Fixed several layout regressions in the quick access menu, eula dialogs, and game achievements page.</li>
</ul>
<p>Big Picture Mode</p>
<ul>
<li>Add the buttons back to the game launch interstitials rather than relying on the footer buttons.</li>
</ul>
<p>Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix the desktop configuration page being blank when opted-out of Steam Input</li>
<li>Fix for Steam Controller gyro turn rate, and sped up gravity correction. Both were affecting the feel of Gyro to Deflection Mode.</li>
<li>Fixed some controllers not being able to pass the Stationary Tolerances manual calibration phase.</li>
<li>Fixed occasional "jerks" in "Gyro To..." conversion modes that used the gravity axis (i.e. Player Space, World Space, Laser Pointer modes)</li>
<li>Improved Gyro to Joystick Deflection mode's low level noise.</li>
<li>Reinstated horizontal haptics for all new "Gyro To..." modes.</li>
<li>Fixed UI: order of Steam Deck Gyro's Calibration readings.</li>
<li>Attempt to fix legacy Gyro "Joystick" mode - use the gravity orientation found upon app switch and subtract it from the live feed.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>When it comes to the Power LED, Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1727479354840822067" target="_blank">mentioned</a> on X (Twitter): "We're working on an update to let users control the intensity of their power LED, which should be interesting to *LE users." — so it will be interesting to see what they have cooking there. Would be quite nice on the OLED, since it turns bright green when charged which was a bit bright in my bedroom. <em>*By LE, Griffais most likely means the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamdeck_2023LE" target="_blank">Limited Edition</a>, as it has a translucent shell.</em></p>
<p>Great to see Valve continuing the quick improvements and listening to all feedback there.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 8-25 released, should fix a bunch of early 2000s games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A small hotfix release of GE-Proton went up with GE-Proton 8-25 containing two changes, but for players of classic games it might be a good release to try.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton8-25" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>

<li>Add mpegvideo codec to ffmpeg, should complete Crimson Skies, Azumanga Fighter and possibly a lot of other early 2000s games. (thanks loathingKernel)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<hr/>
<p>Here's a text guide on how to install GE-Proton.</p>
<p><strong>Download ProtonUp-Qt</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><u>Steam Deck</u> / <u>KDE Plasma</u> - Open the Discover store, in the search box (top left) type in "ProtonUp-Qt", click it and hit Install (top right).

<li><u>Manual install</u> / <u>GNOME</u> - head to the <a href="https://davidotek.github.io/protonup-qt/" target="_blank">official website</a>, scroll down and pick your favourite download option either AppImage or <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/net.davidotek.pupgui2" target="_blank">Flathub</a>. On GNOME desktops, you can also download via GNOME Software.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Using ProtonUp-Qt:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Launch ProtonUp-Qt.</li>
<li>Make sure it's set to Steam at the top and select to install GE-Proton.</li>

      <title>Rock &#39;n&#39; Roll Will Never Die! point and click adventure gets Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rock 'n' Roll Will Never Die!, a musical comedy point and click adventure game recently added full Native Linux support. Looks like quite a fun one too if you like your rock music and classic adventure games like this.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="--rKONUxDuM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/21dc329096a06d78770cde2455f86dc5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/--rKONUxDuM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>About it: "Rock 'n' Roll Will Never Die! is a parodic adventure inspired by classic point-and-click games, heavy metal, and underground comics. You'll jump into the beer-soaked denim vest of a middle-aged teddy bear to orchestrate the comeback of your old glam metal band, not caring that glam metal has been the laughing stock of everyone in the music industry since the 1980s. A true heavy metal heart never stops beating!</p>
<p>Almost four years in development, Rock 'n' Roll Will Never Die! offers about ten hours of wild adventures all over the rockosphere with hand-drawn graphics and a bunch of original music."</p>
<p>You can find it on <a href="https://bestgames.itch.io/rock-n-roll-will-never-die" target="_blank">itch.io</a>. Hopefully eventually the Linux version will also come to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1644080/Rock_n_Roll_Will_Never_Die/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has a Positive rating on Steam but not many reviews overall.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA 545.29.06 Linux driver released with Source 2 game fix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA has today released the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/download/driverResults.aspx/216530/en-uk/" target="_blank">545.29.06</a> Linux stable driver. A small one with only a few useful sounding fixes.</p>
<p>Here's the changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a regression that prevented setting backlight brightness levels.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could lead to UI corruption in nvidia-installer on systems with more than one initramfs file per kernel.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused games built on the Source 2 engine to hang when running under Xwayland.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also a good time for a reminder, especially as it seems other sites did not report on this, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/nvidia-driver-5452902-out-for-linux-plus-other-releases-due-to-security-issues/" target="_blank">NVIDIA did a security bulletin back in late October</a> and so you'll want to ensure you are up to date to prevent any issues. At a minimum you'll want to ensure you're on one of these drivers:</p>
<ul>
<li>545.29.02</li>
<li>535.129.03</li>
<li>525.147.05</li>
<li>470.223.02</li>

      <title>GameMaker now free for non-commercial use, one-time fee for indie devs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems like GameMaker are trying to eat some of Unity's lunch here after the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-attempt-to-clarify-new-install-fees-as-developers-revolt/" target="_blank">mess</a> that was Unity's install fee plan, GameMaker have made it much easier for developers to use it (and cheaper).</p>
<p>Firstly, for non-commercial use, GameMaker is now free to use. So for game devs just starting out, this could be an interesting choice again. And then when you plan to sell your games, the Professional license (doesn't include console) is now a one-time fee instead of a subscription. Much, <em>much</em> better. Simpler and clearer and will no doubt pull in some more developers.</p>
<p>All three of their licenses (Free, Professional, Enterprise) also note this very clearly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Revenue Share</strong>: there is no revenue share that you will be required to pay as part of this license.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Cost per Install</strong>: there is no cost associated with the number of instals that your content can have.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Additional Costs</strong>: there are no additional costs associated with this license.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Professional license also notes it's perpetual, so no worries on them dumping new terms onto you like Unity attempted to do.</p>
<p>On top of that they've also made all their <a href="https://gamemaker.io/en/bundles" target="_blank">asset bundles</a> free.</p>
<p>See their <a href="https://gamemaker.io/en/blog/gamemaker-free-platforms" target="_blank">announcement here</a>.</p>

      <title>Beat Hazard 3 gets updates towards Steam Deck verification</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

      <title>Riders Republic should now run on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some good news for fans of crazy sporty games like Riders Republic, as Ubisoft actually worked to get it working on Steam Deck / Linux.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2290180/announcements/detail/3810669011448242938" target="_blank">announcement post</a> on Steam they said: "As some of you may have noticed, some work has been going on behind the scenes to get Riders Republic running on Steam Deck. And we're happy to announce that you can now play the game on this platform!".</p>
<p>The game uses BattlEye, as it's a big multiplayer playground, and since BattlEye does work on Linux they've now gotten it enabled. You just need to ensure you have the BattlEye Runtime installed in your Steam Library. They also said they will continue to work on improving the "flow and playability of Riders Republic, but we're happy that you can now enjoy the game on the go".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2yzzA_nZHtk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bca408aff17d9fe6702501688dbd4c53.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2yzzA_nZHtk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's still labelled as Unsupported by Valve for Steam Deck but that's an old rating, so Valve will need to re-check it.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2290180/Riders_Republic/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>The Invincible gets updated to fix it with the latest Steam Deck updates</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Invincible is a story-driven adventure set in a hard sci-fi world by Stanisław Lem. Quite popular and it broke recently with the latest Steam Deck / SteamOS upgrade.</p>
<p>In this case, thankfully, the developer was quick to provide support and they actually patched the game directly to get it working. Now this is what I love to see - proper direct support. The developer mentioned in an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/731040/announcements/detail/5872192466327821927" target="_blank">announcement</a> the fix came thanks to people sending over save files so they could identify the problem.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uvNGTLPAIPI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/80688cf3043c110ba75e04f302851a81.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uvNGTLPAIPI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Invincible is a first-person game based on the motifs of The Invincible - an iconic novel of the world-known, hard science-fiction author and Polish futurologist Stanisław Lem.<br/>
<br/>
There are places like Regis III, not prepared for us and for which we are not prepared for. Still, our spacecraft inevitably comes closer to the destination - for our stories and fates to cross in a dead spot.</p>
<p>You are a highly qualified, sharp-witted astrobiologist named Yasna. Being entangled in a space race, you and your crew end up on the unexplored planet Regis III. The scientific journey quickly turns into a search mission for lost crewmates. Follow its trail, but be fully aware that every decision you make can bring you closer to danger.</p>

      <title>Valve gives Steam a nice upgrade for controller-friendly games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After recently tweaking Steam Input and the Steam Client, Valve has now <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/3823053915988527062" target="_blank">upgraded</a> the main Steam Store to show off controller support for games.</p>
<p>They've updated the main <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/controller/" target="_blank">Controller-Friendly Game Hub</a>, allowing you to filter specifically by controller type between Xbox and PlayStation DualShock and DualSense. Making it easier than ever to ensure you're finding games that support your main controller. Example below:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15192256231700569569gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15192256231700569569gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Store pages for individual games also had their controller support status expanded. Down the right-side of pages were features are listed, you'll now see bits like this to indicate what controllers they work with:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15494809321700569896gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15494809321700569896gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's more too including new search filtering options for specific controller models, Steam Library updates to show controller support more clearly and new filtering for your Steam Library (including for Big Picture Mode).</p>
<p>Speaking about why they're now expanding all this they said there were "over 3 Billion game sessions that included a controller in the past year" and of that 60% were with an Xbox controller, 27% PlayStation and the rest a mixture of Steam Deck, Switch Pro, and hundreds of other controller models. Four years ago that controller gaming session count was only 990 million, so it's a huge increase in people gaming with controllers and back then only 19% were using PlayStation controllers so their popularity has increased a lot too.</p>
<p>What do you prefer to game with?</p>

Available under the GPL license, TR1X was made by reverse engineering the TombATI / GLRage variant of the original game and replacing proprietary audio/video libraries with open source variants.</p>
<p>The 3.0 release went up a few weeks ago, followed by two bug fix releases over the last 2 weeks which included the renaming from Tomb1Main to TR1X, adds a developer console, adds Linux builds and toolchain, an option to allow Lara to roll underwater, an option to turn off Eidos logo entirely through config, the bonus level type for custom levels that unlocks if all main game secrets are found, detection for animation commands to play SFX on land, water or both and more features and plenty of bug fixes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2752794051700567727gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2752794051700567727gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>TR1X includes masses of improvements over the original game like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proper UI and bar scaling.</li>
<li>Enemy health bars.</li>
<li>PS1 style UI.</li>
<li>Fade effects to displayed images.</li>
<li>Improved support for windowed mode.</li>
<li>Ability to set user-defined FOV.</li>
<li>Ability to look up and down while hanging.</li>
<li>Ability to forward and backward jump while looking.</li>
<li>Ability to look around while running.</li>
<li>A pause screen.</li>
<li>+ the list goes on and on, making it much more modern feeling.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the project on <a href="https://github.com/LostArtefacts/TR1X" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>You do need assets from the original game which you can grab from <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/tomb_raider_123" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/224960/Tomb_Raider_I_1996/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Intel Vulkan drivers on Linux should run more games with Mesa 24.0</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While work is ongoing to provide brand new Intel Xe Vulkan drivers on Linux with their newer driver, work is still happening to improve the current driver.</p>
<p>Merged recently is support for <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/25512" target="_blank">Sparse Binding</a> on the i915 driver, which is required by <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton" target="_blank">vkd3d-proton</a> to support Direct3D 12 features to run plenty of modern games including (according to <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/5003" target="_blank">this feature request</a>) the likes of DEATHLOOP, DIRT 5, Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, Assassin's Creed: Valhalla, Forza Horizon 4 and 5 and no doubt plenty more.</p>
<p>So when Mesa 24.0 releases, users of Intel GPUs should hopefully get a much better gaming experience with the i915 driver able to run many more games with Proton. Mesa 24.0 isn't due until early 2024, with Mesa 23.3 due this month.</p>
<p>Eventually too when the newer Xe driver (more on that <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/gpu/rfc/xe.html" target="_blank">here</a>) is fully upstreamed, Intel GPU gaming on Linux might be even better with a properly modern system.</p>

      <title>Open source NVIDIA Vulkan driver NVK hits Vulkan 1.0 conformance</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A big step for the in-development open source NVIDIA Vulkan driver NVK, as Collabora have announced how it's hit Vulkan 1.0 conformance. <em>Side-note: This is not coming from NVIDIA directly but people working on Mesa drivers.</em></p>
<p>What does this mean? As explained by developer Faith Ekstrand on the Collabora <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/nvk-reaches-vulkan-conformance.html" target="_blank">blog</a>: "Practically, it means that we can pass the entire Vulkan conformance test suite. From the Khronos perspective, it means that NVK now meets the bar required to claim to support the Vulkan API officially. (There are some legal implications to this which matter to the Mesa project, but most users don't care about them.) From the perspective of users, it means the driver should pretty much work on Turing and later GPUs. There will still be bugs, of course, but those bugs are likely to be app-specific. Most stuff should just work."</p>
<p>This is after <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/24998" target="_blank">merging</a> in their new back-end compiler which was required but there's still a lot of work ahead. As Ekstrand goes on to explain heading into 2024 they're actually not far off being able to advertise Vulkan 1.3 but they need to do plenty of compiler work to get there. Plus there's others working on getting Maxwell GPUs supported and once the compiler is a little more "feature-complete" they can then start "taking deep dives into apps, working on app-specific bug fixing as well as performance improvements".</p>
<p>Still experimental but it seems like open source NVIDIA drivers will get quite exciting through next year.</p>

      <title>Portal: Revolution is an upcoming fully-featured Portal 2 prequel mod</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this is exciting! Modders sure do some amazing stuff with Valve games. Portal: Revolution releasing 5th January, 2024 is a new story with original characters, acting as a full gameplay prequel to Portal 2.</p>
<p>You play as a test subject who is awoken by a personality sphere called Stirling and join his mission to find a powerful device capable of restoring Aperture to its former glory.</p>
<p>Set in the dead and decaying Aperture facility the developers say it will present you with over 40 new puzzles, and they will use mechanics "not seen in Portal 2". How difficult will it be? They say "Portal: Revolutions puzzle difficulty starts where Portal 2 stops" but the new mechanics will be taught as you go along like any good puzzle game does. You can expect somewhere around 5-7 hours playtime.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cXczxIIvXJ0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dc22ee41837af784c9560db29b9d810f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cXczxIIvXJ0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>How was it made? They said it's using a "modified version of Portal 2: Community Edition's engine, which is a custom version of the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Source Engine branch using licensed source code provided by Valve Software" which has allowed them to expand it and provide mechanics and various game engine improvements that weren't possible in the original Portal 2.</p>

      <title>Point and click adventure Zarathustra uses AI Art and AI Voices </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this is sure to be an interesting one and will no doubt spark up some comments - Zarathustra is an in-development point and click adventure that looks intriguing but the way it's made will raise some eyebrows.</p>
<p>I have to admit…it <em>does</em> look pretty good <em>but</em> it's made with AI tools. Which in many ways, opens a big can of worms. Not just AI giving a <em>bit</em> of a hand, but a <em>lot</em> of it was done thanks to AI. The developer, Tim Rachor, doesn't hide it either and states it clearly on the itch.io page that "Most of the Art was created with Dall E 3 and the voice over comes from <a href="https://elevenlabs.io/" target="_blank">https://elevenlabs.io/</a>".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="emRBKiafJyw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d01dc1a555bbd47b2c9b643235913364.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/emRBKiafJyw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer said only the first day in-game is available, and they will continue it if people show interest for them to carry it on. They say it's a "rather casual experience with no dead-ends or overly difficult puzzles".</p>
<p>Find it on <a href="https://tim-rachor.itch.io/zarathustra" target="_blank">the itch.io page</a>.</p>
<p>What do you think to this one?</p>

      <title>Hunt: Showdown is broken on Steam Deck / Linux due to Easy Anti-Cheat</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 20/11/23 14:33 UTC</strong> — Crytek responded to note: "This is a known issue and we are working on it to fix it and apply the fix for the resolution as soon as possible."</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article text below:</em></p>
<p>Hunt: Showdown, a popular multiplayer game has been broken on Steam Deck / desktop Linux due to Easy Anti-Cheat.</p>
<p>It seems an update released on November 16th just causes players to get kicked from the game. A similar issue to what happened <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/over-a-week-later-apex-legends-is-still-broken-on-linux-steam-deck/" target="_blank">with Apex Legends recently</a>. I've yet to see Crytek comment on this, so I have reached out today see if they're aware and if it will be fixed. The game is currently rated Steam Deck Playable so either they need to fix it, or Valve will need to change the rating over to Unsupported.</p>
<p>Trying it myself today and it's clearly broken (screenshot from Steam Deck):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18365912251700484668gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18365912251700484668gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Hopefully given the popularity of the Steam Deck, and with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/steam-deck-oled-is-just-pure-joy-the-definitive-steam-deck/" target="_blank">new Steam Deck OLED</a> release, more developers will actually test instead of just pushing out updates like this that break it.</p>

      <title>Heroes of Might and Magic II game engine fheroes2 v1.0.10 released</title>
      <author>fheroes2</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dear supporters of the fheroes2 project and Heroes of Might and Magic 2 players! After a month of tedious work, we are presenting a new version of the fheroes2 engine - <a href="https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2/releases/tag/1.0.10" target="_blank"><strong>1.0.10</strong></a>. As always today's release is full of compelling features and code changes.<br/>
<br/>
The editor being the highest priority at the moment is evolving. Our team added an <strong>enhanced erase tool</strong>, the ability to put artifacts and treasures on the adventure map and also did important groundwork towards expanding the game with new future heroes. The current state of the editor is still not ready to be open to the public, but this is planned to be changed in the very near future.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4793549741700481834gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4793549741700481834gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>We made a lot of changes in relation to rendering and the overall UI of the engine in this release. A lot of small rendering issues were fixed, several dialogs were reworked and we were able to speed up graphics-related code as well. Speaking of UI, the team added a <strong>new hero action icon</strong> to separate situations, when a hero stands on an action object and when he needs to travel to another place.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12668965191700481849gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12668965191700481849gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Additionally, we updated the town portal dialog to make it resizable in relation to game resolution and the number of available towns.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7213133431700481866gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7213133431700481866gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>The AI in this release received a huge boost in its logic: now it <strong>can use marketplace</strong> to speed up the castle’s development. Important to note, that the AI does not cheat and uses the same exchange rate as human players. The team improved the AI decision-making logic during battles regarding pathfinding and spell evaluation. This makes AI more competitive on higher difficulties.<br/>
<br/>
As in every release before the team updated multiple language translations and fixed dozens of small UI and logic issues, totaling<strong> </strong>more than 30 issues being closed.<br/>
<br/>
An important update: save files that are created by the engine older than 1.0.5 are not supported anymore. This is done to proceed with the Editor development by removing a lot of "hacks" for old saves. If you have save files older than 1.0.5 and want to play them, use 1.0.9 version to open and save these files. The engine will resave files in 1.0.9 format.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md" target="_blank">Installation guide</a>.</p>
<p>You do also need to grab the data from <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_2_gold_edition" target="_blank">GOG.com</a> which it requires to run.</p>

      <title>Half-Life 25th Anniversary Update brings Half-Life: Uplink, Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Something many guessed was coming, Valve has released the Half-Life 25th Anniversary Update and it's pretty exciting with lots of goodies.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/3843320743741606906" target="_blank">announcement</a> it mentions updated graphics settings including lighting fixes and an actual widescreen field of view, Controller and Steam Networking support and Steam Deck support with it now officially Steam Deck Verified!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7586694111700245939gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7586694111700245939gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Half-Life: Uplink on Linux</em></p>
<p>Not just that though they've added in content from Half-Life: Uplink, four new multiplayer maps, and there's restored content for "the true nostalgia-seekers, including original main menu artwork and some early prototype player models from the alpha builds of the game".</p>
<p>On top of that there's in a documentary to mark the occasion from folks at <a href="https://www.secrettape.video/" target="_blank">Secret Tape</a> (known for their work as NoClip Media):</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="TbZ3HzvFEto"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3ec9367da68d1023a0da84c235fa7e3e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/TbZ3HzvFEto" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The older version of Half-Life is now in a Beta branch named "steam_legacy", and they're now considering this the definitive version of Half-Life and the one they will "continue to support going forward". So Half-Life: Source is getting reduced visibility (store page will be hidden) but it will remain available for the Source engine community.</p>
<p>Grab it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/70/HalfLife/" target="_blank">free until November 25th on Steam</a> and see the <a href="https://half-life.com/en/halflife25/" target="_blank">special page here</a>.</p>

      <title>Inventory Tetris with roguelike exploration and combat Backpack Hero is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just released out of Early Access is Backpack Hero, an intoxicating mixture of backpack sorting that feels like a Tetris shapes sorting-puzzle game with roguelike turn-based combat and exploration that's a thoroughly odd but terribly fun blend.</p>
<p>A game that became pretty popular thanks to the web-based demo on itch.io. The full release is much expanded with a lot more content and features like the addition of rebuilding a town. Really clever idea too, although not the first to do it, but the setting and the way it handles the items and your growing backpack size is thoroughly charming.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4sOIlao40W8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/95496321fac2f216972cc7ca996d0ea8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4sOIlao40W8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experiment with your strategy and create game-breaking solutions.</li>
<li>Collect 800+ distinct items, with ingenious powers and synergies to harness.</li>
<li>Battle with over 100+ enemies. Learn their attack patterns and vanquish your foes.</li>
<li>Dive into the endless dungeons! Start every run with randomly generated levels and discover unpredictable items, unique layouts, events, and challenges.</li>
<li>Explore 5 unique play styles by selecting different heroes.</li>
<li>Play standalone runs or experience the full adventure and meta progression in Story Mode.</li>
<li>Rebuild Haversack Hill and help its inhabitants.</li>
<li>Turn the village into an appealing and efficient hamlet to attract new residents. Buy and sell items, conduct research, and unlock heroes, challenges, and quests.</li>
</ul>
<p>It has Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified. I've been playing it on the Steam Deck and it's an absolute joy. Needing to constantly swap around items with others, and re-position them to get the best placement to have all the items effects stack-up on other items in your backpack — it's a game that mixes puzzling and constant strategy. Really, really great stuff and a total joy to play.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/backpack_hero" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://thejaspel.itch.io/backpack-hero" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1970580/Backpack_Hero/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

Plus, Governors and some Envoy functions have been merged into Officials, the Administrative leader class. On top of that all leaders can now govern planets which opens up new ways to play. Plus various other improvements across the game like new planet modifiers, new planetary decisions and lots of balancing improvements and bug fixes.</p>
<p>As for Astral Planes the release trailer is below:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>On the surface it sounds awesome and looks really interesting. Then you go look at the Steam page, and see it's "Mostly Negative". The main complaint seems to be the pricing at €19.99 / $19.99 / £16.45 not matching up to what players feel the content is worth.</p>
<p>Stellaris is available from <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/stellaris?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/stellaris?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/281990/Stellaris/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Shake up an AI-controlled robotic world in Soul Tolerance releasing in December</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Chaosmonger Studio developer of ENCODYA and of the recently released Three Minutes To Eight, has announced the release date of Soul Tolerance as December 11th, 2023. Although, this is only Part 1.</p>
<p>The game, entirely created in voxel-art, is set in a society composed exclusively of robots, and controlled by the Divine Mother, a super AI-deity that rules the planet. The protagonist is Unit-12, a simple robo-detective coming hot off the assembly line, who will manage to twist his code and discover a mystery that will shake the roots of the A.I. controlled world.</p>
<p>They've decided to split it up into parts. From the developer: " We’ve been pretty busy here at Chaosmonger Studio. Just a few weeks ago we released Three Minutes To Eight and now we are announcing a new release! The truth is: Soul Tolerance has been ready for a while now, or, at least, its first chapter. We were thinking of releasing the full story we had in mind all together, but that would have required a few years. So, we decided to split the release into five chapters, each at a very fair price, also because we really feel the urge right now to start telling our story about A.I. and its philosophical implications, in perfect line with the times."</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In the mood for something a bit smaller and more bite-sized this weekend? Zipp's Café just released and looks nice and chilled. From developer The Wild Gentlemen who also made Chicken Police - Paint it RED!, and the upcoming Chicken Police: Into the HIVE! that takes place in the same world.</p>
<p>"Zipp H. Murphy is one raccoon that does not eat trash - on the contrary, his palate is one of excellent taste, and it shows since he is the owner, chef, and manager of Zipp’s Cafe, the most popular joint in Clawville. The cafe offers an oasis of peace in the midst of the chaos that is Clawville. It doesn’t matter if you are a cop, a criminal, or as is usually the case in Clawville, both; Zipp will always have a hot cup of coffee and a delicious plate of food waiting for you… as long as you have the money to pay for it.

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another big day for Steam Deck owners, as SteamOS 3.5 is finally here with lots of big additions. Plus, Valve also released a fresh Steam Client update.</p>
<p>SteamOS 3.5 is the update that brings official support for the new Steam Deck OLED, along with adjusting the default colour rendering for the Steam Deck LCD to emulate the sRGB color gamut giving warmer and more vibrant colours. Although you can change this any time in the new display settings:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18875014431700216826gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18875014431700216826gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You will also now have:</p>
<ul>
<li>HDR settings for external displays.</li>
<li>VRR can be enabled for external displays.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where certain workloads would exhibit severe CPU performance issues unless SMT was manually disabled.</li>
<li>Auto-mounting of external drives.</li>
<li>Improved Bluetooth connection stability, especially with multiple controllers.</li>
<li>Upgraded graphics drivers with lots of performance and compatibility improvements.</li>
<li>An updated Arch Linux package base.</li>
<li>Upgraded KDE Plasma desktop to 5.27.</li>
<li>+ lots and lots and lots more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Full SteamOS 3.5.5 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/5484882897552407488" target="_blank">changelog here</a>.</p>
<p>As for the Steam Client update that pulls in some recent additions from various Beta versions for both Desktop and Steam Deck. This <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/5484882897551382405" target="_blank">includes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This update has been re-released with the following fix:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed video freeze when streaming games with launchers when using NVIDIA hardware encoding.</li>
</ul>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow local game content transfers from a plugged-in Steam Deck to other Steam clients on the same LAN.</li>
<li>Fixed setting the correct AppID in Source SDK mod manager.</li>
<li>Visual tweaks to Steam Deck, Big Picture Mode and SteamVR: Many small changes throughout to make the user interface a more visually-rich experience in Home, Library and other areas.</li>
<li>Nicer layout for Soundtracks pages. These pages are now easier to navigate in Big Picture Mode and feature larger artwork on Desktop.</li>
<li>Fixed some layout and interaction bugs in the Media viewer.</li>
<li>Move the controller support information in the desktop client from the play bar to a widget in the right column</li>
<li>Add HDR badge to app details for games that are marked as having HDR output.</li>
<li>Fix bug preventing you from launching a game that had temporarily disabled auto-updates if new workshop content was available.</li>
<li>Additional information about controller support has been added to the client:
<ul>
<li>Game details pages in the library will now show information about specific controller and VR support in the right-hand column when devices are connected.</li>
<li>PlayStation controllers have a new default mode in Steam Input where Steam will route controllers to the game's built-in support if available and to Steam Input when they would be unsupported. These controllers can still be globally opted-in or out of Steam Input in the controller tab of the Steam settings page.</li>
<li>The landing page of the controller configurator now has controller support information, and it has been made easier to quickly opt in or out of Steam Input for a particular game.</li>
<li>In the Big Picture library there is now Xbox/DualShock/DualSense support tabs similar to the "Great on Deck" tab that are populated based on your connected devices.</li>
<li>DualShock, DualSense, and Steam Input API support have been added to the available filters in the library.</li>
<li>Games that require controllers (no mouse/keyboard support), require a VR Headset, or support both VR and standard game modes will now show that information in the client, similar to how it displayed in the store.</li>
<li>Footer icons for DualSense controllers in Big Picture have been updated to use the black and white style on the device.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Remote Play</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed hidden mouse cursor when streaming to Android TV.</li>
<li>Fixed stream lockup when using Intel iGPU hardware encoding.</li>
</ul>
<p>Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve look of configurator when there are no controllers connected.</li>
<li>In games that support SteamInput API Actions we no longer hide the Flick Stick as Mouse option if a FlickStick action is defined - this is so that Gyro To Mouse can be properly complemented if you wish.</li>
<li>Fixed the ROG Pugio II mouse showing up as a controller.</li>
<li>Fix: Gyro Joystick mode: Core gyro quaternion is updated even when the app requesting it is not focused.</li>
<li>Fixes to both Gyro as Joystick Modes: Min/Max remapping was not allowing values to become zero when gyro values were less than minimum required joystick output values.</li>
<li>Gyro to Joystick (Deflection) mode uses sensor fusion controller accelerometer rather than quaternion for more consistent behavior. This should address issues where the X output would become canted in the legacy modes. Note: it may feel subtly different. Feedback welcome.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam Deck OLED is just pure joy - the definitive Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Steam Deck OLED releases officially from Valve today, bringing with it numerous improvements to my favourite Linux-powered gaming handheld and here's my initial thoughts on spending some time with it. I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/steam-deck-initial-review/" target="_blank">originally reviewed the LCD Steam Deck back at release</a> since Valve sent over a review unit and they did the same for the Steam Deck OLED.</p>

</table>
<p>Plus there's a Limited Edition Steam Deck OLED with different exclusive colours for the 1TB model but that is only available in the USA / Canada and it's in limited quantities. For the release Valve said they are limiting the Steam Deck OLED purchases to one per customer per week, but this will be relaxed when they are confident they can meet the demand.</p>
<p>While it's refresh of the existing Steam Deck, it really is quite a <em>different</em> beast. Looks wise though, it's pretty much the same at first glance with the same shell size apart from the new <em>slightly</em> bigger thumbstick design, and a new coloured power button that's a little higher. The new thumbsticks are <em>much</em> nicer though and more concave than the older design, so they're easier to keep your thumbs actually on them. Funny how even the smallest of tweaks makes the Steam Deck OLED so much nicer to actually play games on directly as it really does make a big difference. Even without using HDR, the Steam Deck OLED screen is just far superior in standard games.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/869697361700157296gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/869697361700157296gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Steam Deck 1TB OLED top, 512GB LCD bottom. Look at the colours and the power / battery time. Click to enlarge.</em></p>
<p>Looks are very much deceiving overall here though, because once you turn it on and start using it — clearly this is <em>not</em> the Steam Deck I've come to know and love. It's just better. That display is just…gosh, the difference between it and the LCD is completely ridiculous. It's brighter, it's clearer, the colours are better and it's slightly bigger too and with it going up to 90Hz it's pure joy to play with. HDR support is working well, although there's not a whole lot to test with and finding them isn't actually that easy but Valve did just recently add HDR Support notices into the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/steamos-353-preview-fixes-lcd-issues-plus-steam-deck-desktop-beta-adds-hdr-info/" target="_blank">previous Steam Beta update</a> and hopefully soon a proper category on the Steam Store to make finding them easier again. From the picture above showing Ori and the Will of the Wisps, with both on max brightness and the OLED with HDR it should be clear enough how much richer the colours are. Not just that, but so much more battery time!</p>
<p>Since it's the same shell, the vast majority of existing accessories will still fit as well, which I did <a href="https://youtu.be/v-tFH1kO-BM" target="_blank">a short demo on in a recent video</a> showing the Deckmate, dbrand Killswitch and the JSAUX Modcase. So you won't have to go out and buy a whole bunch of new kit to go with it, which is really great. Not <em>everything</em> though. Some screen protectors won't fit if they didn't cover the entire screen area including the bezels, and with the thumbsticks tweaked design that's just slightly bigger so most thumbstick covers likely won't fit either (my dbrand thumbstick covers didn't fit properly and easily pop-off).</p>
<p>There's improvements to some of the buttons as well too which is good to see. The Steam and Quick Access Menu buttons that were notoriously spongy and kind-of awful feeling on both my LCD models have been adjusted to give a nice muted click feeling. The Select and Menu buttons at the top of the unit also feel a bit more clicky too. Not an audible click though, just the click-feel.</p>
<p>Cooling is massively improved too. While I don't have thermal equipment and have to rely on touch, it's noticeably cooler where it counts. The biggest improvement is the fan though, something that was an issue on the original LCD model that was split between two different fans. Here, the fan is bigger and quieter than both of my LCD models (one of which has that annoying high-pitch noise). It's more like a gentle blowing sound that you would expect from something pumping out a lot of heat and with the Steam Deck audio turned up even to 50% - I simply can't hear the fan. Absolutely wonderful.</p>
<p>Charging speed was something I was keen to test as Valve said they "improved battery chemistry for faster charging, from 20% to 80% in as little as 45 minutes" — so that was put to the test in my own way. Bringing both an OLED and LCD down to 10% charge (where you get the on-screen warning) and then leaving them plugged in while turned on but completely idle, at 50% screen brightness on I saw:</p>
<ul>
<li>512GB LCD to 90%: 2 hours, 11 minutes.</li>
<li>1TB OLED to 90%: 1 hour, 28 minutes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most people of course will likely charge while the unit is asleep though, so of course I tested that too. Running the Steam Deck down until it gave the yellow on-screen 10% warning again up to the LED showing full charge:</p>
<ul>
<li>512GB LCD: 2 hours 31 minutes</li>
<li>1TB OLED: 1 hour 33 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p>So that's nearly a full hour faster to charge in sleep mode to a full charge. So yes, the OLED really will charge faster despite the bigger battery too thanks to their improvements. This is great news for people in a rush, or for people who keep leaving it on sleep and forgetting to charge it because that is surprisingly quick and I’m really happy with those results, Valve did a great job on the new battery for the Steam Deck OLED.</p>
<p>Actually in-game time though, how’s the battery life there (see my <a href="https://youtu.be/aWa8xNBPuro" target="_blank">latest OLED Q&amp;A video Part 2</a>!)? Testing with 50% brightness, 50% volume I picked Cyberpunk 2077 and DiRT Rally. DiRT Rally actually has a benchmark mode you can infinitely loop, making this a good test. For DiRT Rally on Medium settings at 60FPS the Steam Deck OLED model gave a good 2 hours extra battery life around 5 hours compared to 3 hours on the older Steam Deck LCD. The OLED was also <em>consistently</em> using <em>less</em> power at all the same settings.</p>
<p>How does this translate to other titles though? Testing Cyberpunk 2077, matching up all settings at 30FPS locked using the same save I saw similar results to DiRT Rally with less power being used. Using the Steam Deck graphics preset, it was giving a good solid extra hour battery life. So it went from around 1 hour 30 on the Steam Deck LCD up to 2 hours 30 on the Steam Deck OLED.</p>
<p>From other games I've tested like Elden Ring and various others including plenty of smaller indie games, the battery life is just clearly better. But not just that, there are some differences in the performance I've seen too. Every game so far has been at least a little bit noticeably smoother. Not overly surprising though, given the RAM speed bump from 5500 MT/s to 6400 MT/s, and since I've seen it run cooler and use less power while gaming as well, it's probably not hitting the limits the LCD is allowing the OLED performance to stay up top. It's not drastic though, we're talking a couple FPS and a little bit smoother frame-timing. I'll have more on that in future articles / videos.</p>
<p>For people who enjoy docking their Steam Deck, the Steam Deck OLED's ability to wake from Bluetooth with controllers is another really nice addition. With the release firmware update, I've tested this working with a latest-gen Xbox controller, and with a PlayStation 4 controller. A bit quirky though, as the Deck OLED blips back to life for a second or so on Sleep at times and then fully sleeps. So as always, a few little niggling issues for Valve still to sort but it does work. Now when I want to play docked on my sofa with my 4K TV, I can just flop onto my sofa, gab my controller and jump back into whatever game I told it to go to sleep with.</p>
<p>Since we've seen that Valve constantly upgrade all the software from the Steam Client to SteamOS itself (that they sometimes decide to call Steam Deck OS), we know it's only going to keep getting better for both the LCD and OLED and I can't wait to see what else they have cooking. Plus, with it being more repairable than before due to the internal redesign and new case screws, it's going to have a long healthy life. While I aimed to talk about various bits here, there's plenty of things I've missed and this should <em>not</em> be considered a final review by any means since Valve do change things quite often (and I've had a lot less time with the OLED to review compared with the LCD at release). So be sure to follow the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/Steam_Deck/" target="_blank">Steam Deck tag</a> for all the incoming news.</p>
<p>If you were previously considering buying a Steam Deck - I can't see a reason not to just finally go for it. For people who already have a Steam Deck, it's still a very impressive upgrade when taking the sum of all the improvements together from the <em>massively</em> improved screen to the healthy battery life boost.</p>
<p>Overall and simply put: I cannot imagine going back to the LCD model after toying with the Steam Deck OLED. It's better in pretty much every way aside from a big performance bump that we can expect from an eventual Steam Deck 2. It's a thing of beauty and my new constant companion. It may not be a next-generation thing but at this point it's close enough.</p>

      <title>Turn-based animal action-RPG &#39;Of Blades &amp; Tails&#39; is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Become Reik, a clever member of the fox tribe in Of Blades &amp; Tails from Felix Laukel and Pineapple Works that has now left Early Access.</p>

Players can follow the main story or hunt for treasures in ancient ruins and mysterious dungeons. Character development and gaining powerful equipment plays a major role on the journey.</p>
<p>Check out the launch trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lP1VSi4npuE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/65f9a4969e2611bd3a58a4364a7d7c44.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lP1VSi4npuE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It has Native Linux support but there's currently no Steam Deck rating for it. The developer mentioned it works great but needs custom Steam Input configuration due to it lacking full controller support. Players on Steam have given it a Very Positive rating so looks like another quality indie release worth your time!</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/of_blades_and_tails" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1768780/Of_Blades__Tails/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Next on my list to complete once my current run through co-op Terraria is done with, Core Keeper is another wonderful mining sandbox adventure and the 1.0 release has now been set with a new content roadmap to Summer 2024.</p>

<p>Currently on their roadmap they have a Year-End Update coming in December as a minor update, a Lunar Update is February 2024 that will have seasonal content and other minor additions, a Language Update in Spring 2024 as another minor update and then the Summer Update in (you guessed it) Summer 2024 as another minor update before the full 1.0 release but they also teased there's "more to come".</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental fixes controls in Starfield and supports Assassin&#39;s Creed Mirage</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released a fresh Proton Experimental release for November 15th so here's your run over what's new and improved.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Noted as newly playable are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assassin's Creed Mirage.</li>
<li>Tenioha! feat. Mami.</li>
<li>Killsquad.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interesting that Valve notes Assassin's Creed Mirage as now playable, since it's not currently available on Steam. That hasn't stopped gamers though of course. People have been playing it on Steam Deck and desktop Linux with other methods like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/heroic-games-launcher-2-10-0-released-with-plenty-of-essential-fixes/" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/nonsteamlaunchers-adds-support-for-the-minecraft-launcher-and-lots-of-bug-fixes/" target="_blank">NonSteamLaunchers</a>.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed swapped start / select buttons on controllers in Starfield and other games using Windows.Gaming.Input.</li>
<li>Fixed triple monitor handling in Project Cars 3 and Project Cars 2.</li>
<li>Fixed load / save dialogs not working in Idle Spiral on Steam Deck.</li>
<li>Proton 8 regression fix: games should be able to switch monitors in fullscreen mode on Cinnamon DE again.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changelog can be <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">seen here</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>It will just show up in your Steam Downloads as an update for Proton Experimental, as Proton updates just like games do, so keep an eye out for it. Want more info about Steam Play and Proton?

<p><strong>How to change your Proton version:</strong></p>
<p>Steam Deck:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a game in your Library and head to the little cog icon on the right.</li>
<li>Click Properties, then Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>On a Linux desktop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right click a game, go to Properties.</li>
<li>Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Anima Flux is an upcoming co-op metroidvania with slick cut-scenes and a demo up</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to check out another upcoming game? Anima Flux (previously called Lost in Sky: Violent Seed) looks rather awesome if you love action-platformer metroidvania styled games and it has local co-op too.</p>
<p>Currently in development for release late 2024, you take control of two genetically enhanced soldiers. You'll fight your way through swarms of mutants through a desolate, dystopian space city and save humanity's last stronghold.</p>
<p>From what the developers say: "The unusual spin of the genre, turns the classic metroidvania into a fun, couch co-op adventure. Both characters develop differently as the game goes on. Explore the grim locations of the space ark, rescue an ambushed or seriously injured partner. Get challenged by dangerous mutants and build your own boss-fight strategies together with a friend. And the best part is that you can always switch to single player mode if your pal is not around."</p>

<p>Really like the style of this one and with Native Linux support, it should hopefully be a great one at release. Especially like their slick animated cut-scenes that really add to the atmosphere.</p>
<p>You can follow and try the demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/763180/Anima_Flux/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and it will also be on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/anima_flux" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>

      <title>Sci-fi 4x strategy game ZEPHON has a fresh Steam demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're in the mood to try out an upcoming sci-fi 4x strategy game, look no further than the latest demo for ZEPHON. Arriving next year with Native Linux support, the latest from Proxy Studios (Pandora: First Contact, Warhammer 40,000: Gladius - Relics of War) is looking pretty great.</p>
<p>The demo was updated late last month, and it's live until November 22nd. Expect bugs and issues since it's an in-development alpha version that is limited to single player against two opponents on a small map. The full version though will have "co-op and pvp multiplayer, larger maps, advanced world generation parameters, 8 leaders, 3 NPC factions, over 50 units spread across 10 tiers of research, more terrain features and quests, an end-game grand finale, unlockable game modifiers, achievements, multiple languages as well as full workshop support".</p>
<p>The biggest changes in this demo are the additions of the ZEPHON NPC faction, 2 new neutral units and 3 new quests.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10495559591700056200gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10495559591700056200gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>No specific release date yet other than sometime in 2024.</p>

      <title>Saelig Review - an engaging and unique experience</title>
      <author>Ricky Black</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> This review is based on the state of the game in version 42.4. Saelig is early access and still in active development.</em></p>
<p>Have you ever tried looking for an oddly specific game? Or played a game that’s <em>almost</em> the perfect game, but not quite? I’m sure it has happened to many people over the years. In my case, I’d been looking for something like a mix of Banished, The Sims, Medieval Dynasty, and The Guild. I hadn’t had a lot of luck finding it until I ran across Saelig. I would probably describe it as a business management game with a generous dusting of role playing and sandbox elements, all set in the medieval era. To my knowledge this a somewhat niche mix of genres. It most likely isn't for everyone, but if the description sounds intriguing it is definitely worth trying out.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19789035841700023761gol15864.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19789035841700023761gol15864.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Saelig, also stylized SÆLIG, drops you into the shoes of a person in late 9th century England and lets you create your own story. You can spend your days chopping wood in the forest, mining gold or silver, growing various fruits and vegetables, baking bread, fishing, hunting, and much more. If work isn’t something you want to do, feel free to stand outside of the alehouse and beg for coins. You won’t get rich that way, but you’ll stay alive. If the criminal life is calling you, it is possible to pickpocket villagers in the market or even start your own gang to pillage and burn the surrounding countryside. Just make sure you don’t get caught and thrown into the pit to rot! You can join the church and become an abbot, or rise to a powerful position in your community government. Look for a wife or husband, have children to leave your goods to, and pretty much just live your own life. Be warned though, there have been rumors of small groups of raiders known as Vikings landing in the surrounding area. You’ll want to choose where you live carefully, or be prepared to defend yourself.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1400405271700023759gol15864.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1400405271700023759gol15864.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em>It looks quite cold! Best head to the market to buy a coat.</em></p>
<p>There are several different ways to start. Your character can start as anything from a beggar with nothing but a handful of coins to a fairly rich person with a randomly selected business and a house right from the beginning. In the long run you’ll almost always end up wealthy if you try, but the fun is in the journey. I would definitely recommend playing through the tutorial before you begin, it can help a bit with the initial learning curve. Also, don't be afraid to start over after a few hours on your first save. You can view your first character as a trial run, and you should have a fairly good idea of how the game works and what you enjoy doing by that point.</p>
<p>My first character, Sherlyn Traynor, moved into the town of Ashbury (population 49) in the year 880AD. He had just purchased a small house in the center of town, right next to the alehouse. During a tour of the town he decided to purchase the fishing dock at the edge of town. After a few days of fishing and gathering pearls, Sherlyn had decided to hire someone to help out. The next day, Sherlyn noticed someone fishing from the beach a little way from the dock. He learned that the fisherman’s name was Leowahl, and offered him a job. Leowahl accepted and immediately started working. The money began flowing in more quickly, making some improvements possible.</p>
<p>A year or so layer, Sherlyn was standing outside his house as one of the town guard was heading home from work. Her name was Edith, and she and Sherlyn chatted for a few minutes before he went to work. The town had grown since he had moved in, but it was still small enough that you met people on a regular basis. They ran into each other while buying produce at the market and again at church. They began talking regularly, and Sherlyn was soon spending all of his profits on fixing up his house. Not long afterward they were married, and in the coming years they would go on to have four children. Two of them would go to work at a mine that Sherlyn had purchased, and the other two would go on to be woodcutters. Sherlyn still fished quite a bit, but he also began doing a bit of hunting and farming on the side. He and Edith both lived to their elder years before passing on, and Leowahl continued working for them until then.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11895836291700023750gol15864.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11895836291700023750gol15864.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em>Skills are improved by using them, so practice is important.</em></p>
<p>It is possible to continue playing as your heir, but that was the point that I decided to start a new character with what I had learned so far. I’ve gone on to play many characters and all of the maps since then. To this point one of my favorite gameplay loops is starting as a farmer, eventually acquiring a flour mill and then a bakehouse. I also enjoy working as a trader, traveling between towns and finding cheap products to hopefully sell at a profit. Hunting can be enjoyable once you get enough archery practice, and can also be fairly profitable. I find that the game is most enjoyable when you’re more focused on the role play rather than profit though, so I enjoy trying new things.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15492070591700023755gol15864.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15492070591700023755gol15864.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em>The game animals available to hunt.</em></p>
<p>In my opinion the developer has done a very good job of creating a living world. People are born and die, have children, get jobs, move to other towns, build buildings, and run businesses all without any player interaction. Buildings require wood to be built, and the in game woodcutters are the only means of producing it. Every person needs a set amount of food to live each day, which they will need to either forage or buy. They will even adopt pets which then follow them around wherever they go! It really sells the fact that your character is just one more person trying to live in the world. Another good example of this is employment. If you don’t want to own a business, you can get a job at most of the establishments in the game. You’ll need to be quick though. The job openings are limited by the number of businesses that have been built, and all of your unemployed neighbors also need jobs!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10330284331700023756gol15864.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10330284331700023756gol15864.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em>The pets I've found so far. Needs more cats!</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left">There are currently 13 unique businesses that you can purchase or build in the game, and most can be upgraded to provide more services or hire more workers. Some of them, like the farm or mine, only need a few laborers to create a salable product. Others, like the bakehouse and workshop, need to have a steady supply of raw materials flowing in from markets and other businesses to produce a profit. By owning all of the buildings in the supply chain you can be sure to have a steady flow of raw materials moving in, as well as a higher profit margin!</p>
<p style="text-align:left">The graphics and detail seem pretty good for a game like this. If you spend a lot of time in first person you’ll start noticing some things, like the limited number of face and clothing options available. There are also good things to notice as well! My character will often ride to other towns on a horse cart, and if you ride along in first person you’ll often see nice little touches like empty bottles and various things lying along the roads. Littering has always been a problem!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13499286991700023754gol15864.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13499286991700023754gol15864.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em>One of the many nice scenes you'll find while playing Saelig.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left">To somewhat summarize and also add to my ramblings, I've created a list of some of my favorite features:</p>
<p style="text-align:left">- A Native Linux build! It's always great when a developer creates a game with a native port in mind.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">- Large amount of player freedom. If you want to pick apples and forage produce for a living, it's completely possible. Maybe you prefer travelling between towns as a trader? Also an option!</p>
<p style="text-align:left">- NPCs have the same capabilities as your character. Your character doesn't have any extra privileges or advantages other than being controlled by you. If you make your neighbors angry enough, they will most likely toss torches onto the roof of your house or steal items from your businesses.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">- The living economy. It's always been immersion breaking for me when I walk into a secluded market and find limitless amounts of certain goods. Here you have to hurry to market as soon as someone brings in wood, because your neighbor also needs wood to build a barn!</p>
<p style="text-align:left">- Enjoyable maps. I like the nice variety of towns and villages to live in, as well as some plots in the woods to build houses if you’d rather be a hermit.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/462051481700023752gol15864.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/462051481700023752gol15864.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em>A shed that caught fire late one evening. Notice the guy to the right? Pretty sure he did it.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left">So far I've mentioned mostly the good things, but there are a few things that I feel could be improved. As mentioned previously, the developer continues to add new features and fixes, so I expect that some of the things mentioned are designed as placeholders, and updates may be planned for future iterations.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">- Social interactions. There are just a few options for chatting, asking questions, flirting, and angry dialog right now. You can also invite someone to go with you to the alehouse. Even though I know how difficult it is to make a complex dialog tree, I’m hoping we’ll have a few more options once the rest of the game is nailed down.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">- Character customization. While I'm not normally very focused on the appearance of my characters in games, I do like doing a bit of basic customizing to start. So far there aren’t a lot of options as there are a total of 8 human models in the game. There are 4 male and 4 female, and each one has two preset options for hair color, hair style, and clothing. By extension, more npc faces and clothing options would be nice.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">- Wiki access on the Linux version. Currently the wiki is only usable on the Windows version. I got around this by pulling the wiki up on a separate monitor, but it's nice to have it in game. If you run the Windows version through Proton it works fine.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">- Endgame content. Right now profit starts to snowball once you reach a certain point, so it would be nice to have more options to slow your progress. This is listed on the development roadmap, so it is being worked on.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">- Some improvements in the UI. While the user interface isn't bad, there were a few things that I ran into with some regularity. It would be a helpful at times to just right click on a building in your owned list and have a go to option for your character or, in the case of your house, a sleep option. Another thing that I bumped up against various times was the amount of time it takes to pan across the map. You can press the tab key to pull back and see the whole map, but you're unable to pick another area to zoom in and view. Both of those things have workarounds, but it's not quite as smooth.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1497819161700023767gol15864.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1497819161700023767gol15864.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em>A sample of the user interface.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left">This section is my personal wishlist of ideas that I would love to see added, but don’t really affect the current playability of the game.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">- Very large maps or map switching. I'm sure this would cause performance issues, but very large maps would be great. It would give the ability to have individual regions for mining, farming, etc. This would then create a greater need for traders, which then increases the amount of bandits, then mercenaries and guards.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">- Mod support. This is something that has been asked about before, and the developer has mentioned it as a possible addition once the game is complete. I could see modders jumping on a game like this and giving it almost infinite replayability.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">- More playability in first person. I've spent a lot of time walking around in first person mode, unfortunately you can't really do much that way. For instance, you can walk to your favorite foraging patch in first person but need to switch back when interacting with it. I know the game isn't really designed to work that way, but I enjoy spending time in that mode!</p>
<p style="text-align:left">- Option to lock camera to a character in the birdseye view. It is possible to follow a character right now, but it moves to an over the shoulder view that doesn't allow you to see much else. I sometimes enjoy following characters around and watching what they like to do in games like the Sims, and this would make it easier.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Although Saelig is still considered early access on Steam, the developer has explained they kept the tag so people realize there are still major components that are being added. They have recently mentioned plans to exit early access within the next few updates, so some of those features may be coming <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/612720/discussions/0/3872591600385745702/" target="_blank">soon</a>. I don't remember running into many bugs while playing the latest version, it’s been an extremely stable experience to this point. The developer seems very open to feedback, and has implemented many features and changes that have been suggested over the years. On the Steam Early Access page they mention involving players as much as they can, and that appears to be happening.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3416323641700023763gol15864.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3416323641700023763gol15864.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em>It's a very picturesque game.</em></p>
<p>I did run into some minor performance issues while playing, mostly on the Steam Deck. It’s not unplayable by any stretch of the imagination, but worth mentioning.</p>
<p>On my primary computer I limited my FPS to 60 and it stays stable at that except for very minor stutters while zoomed out and panning around. I’m assuming at this point that it’s an optimization issue or a Unity engine issue as none of my components were being pushed. At times the framerate will drop down a few when in first person mode or down at ground level looking around. Other than that it ran well. For reference, the game was reviewed on a Ryzen 9 5900x, 32gb RAM, and a Radeon RX 6800 XT at 3440x1440.</p>
<p>The game runs reasonably well on the Steam Deck overall, even though it doesn't have controller support. It doesn't have a rating from Steam at this point, but I would consider it playable. During normal gameplay there are some noticeable stutters when panning quickly around the map, but otherwise it runs at a fairly stable 40 fps using the very good preset. However, the frame rate drops to 30-35 fps anytime you go into first person mode or look up at the sky or trees. Lowering the graphics preset didn't seem to do a lot to improve it, but it was still playable. It could be a limit of the Unity engine, as my main computer was also getting a lower framerate in the same situation. Battery life was around 1hr 45m on very good. There are no Deck control layouts for the game yet, but I used the keyboard and mouse preset as a base and have been gradually adjusting it to my liking. I also increased the UI size to make things easier as well.</p>
<p>Overall I think this is a great game as it is, and the high likelihood of getting a good bit more content added for free in the future is an added bonus. The dev has been releasing fairly regular updates since 2017, and seems to be willing to keep going. I paid full price for it when I got it, and going by the somewhat flawed $1 per hour value metric I've gotten my money's worth several times over.</p>

      <title>Valve detail their plans to combat Steam Deck OLED scalpers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the release of the Steam Deck OLED and the Steam Deck OLED Limited Edition tomorrow, Valve has given out a little bit more info on how they plan to combat scalpers.</p>
<p>Firstly, there <em>is</em> a Limited Edition model with a smoky translucent shell that's only available for the USA / Canada but the <em>rest</em> of the line of Steam Deck OLED are <em>not</em> limited. The normal 512GB and 1TB Steam Deck OLED models will be available globally where the existing LCD Steam Deck is. I've seen a surprising amount of people confused on this across the net thinking the Steam Deck OLED as a whole is limited but it's not.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">For the special Limited Edition version Valve has said:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to be in the United States or Canada.</li>
<li>Your account needs to be in good standing.</li>
<li>Your account needs to have made a purchase on Steam before November 2023.</li>
<li>Only one unit may be purchased per account.</li>
</ul>
<p>If their experiment with this extra Limited Edition model goes well, we may see others come in future.</p>
<p>Additionally, their FAQ also notes for the <em>normal</em> 512GB and 1TB Steam Deck OLED models you will only be able to purchase "1 model of Steam Deck OLED per customer per week" but they plan to relax that when they're confident they can meet demand.</p>
<p>They <em>will</em> switch to the reservation queue if needed and email people when it's ready but Valve also said "we will be refreshing inventory of Steam Deck regularly, and do not foresee long queue times like we saw with the Steam Deck LCD launch".</p>
<p>All models go live at the same time at 10AM PST / 6PM UTC on November 16th on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" target="_blank">Steam Deck store</a>.</p>

<p>Three pieces of Steam news for you today covering the Steam Deck and desktop Steam as there's been various updates and improvements.</p>
<p>Firstly the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3820802745609827707" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.5.3 Preview</a> update went out to fix Steam Deck LCD issues from the 3.5.2 update:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a regression with color management sliders.</li>
<li>Fixed a fan control regression.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus there's now a HDR Support notice on games in your Steam Library, although you do need to expand the details view to see it (the circled i on desktop / Game Info on Steam Deck and Big Picture). This applies to both the Steam Deck and Desktop Steam clients available in the Beta update channel. HDR is <em>also</em> now available as a filtering option in your Steam Library too for Collections and for generally filtering the Steam Library on Steam Deck / Big Picture Mode.</p>
<p>Desktop:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21352869041700047489gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21352869041700047489gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Steam Deck:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18881286741700047633gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18881286741700047633gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>This does depend on developers accurately tagging their games as having HDR Support though of course. There is not currently a HDR category on the Steam store directly so hopefully Valve will add it to make it easier for Steam Deck OLED uses and desktop HDR screen owners.</p>
<p>Steam Deck Beta <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3800535912303901889" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Add HDR badge to app details for games that are marked as having HDR output.</li>
</ul>
<p>Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve look of configurator when there are no controllers connected</li>
<li>Fixes to both Gyro as Joystick Modes: Min/Max remapping was not allowing values to become zero when gyro values were less than minimum required joystick output values.</li>
<li>Gyro to Joystick (Deflection) mode uses sensor fusion controller accelerometer rather than quaternion for more consistent behavior. This should address issues where the X output would become canted in the legacy modes. Note: it may feel subtly different. Feedback welcome.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Desktop Steam Beta <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3780269713976536546" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Move the controller support information in the desktop client from the play bar to a widget in the right column</li>
<li>Add HDR badge to app details for games that are marked as having HDR output.</li>
<li>Fix bug preventing you from launching a game that had temporarily disabled auto-updates if new workshop content was available</li>
</ul>
<p>Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve look of configurator when there are no controllers connected</li>
<li>Fixes to both Gyro as Joystick Modes: Min/Max remapping was not allowing values to become zero when gyro values were less than minimum required joystick output values.</li>

      <title>Goober Dash is a chaotic 32-player Race Royale</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From the creators of the rather great <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/rocket-bot-royale-is-like-a-worms-styled-battle-royale-with-jumping-tanks/" target="_blank">Rocket Bot Royale</a>, Winterpixel Games Inc. just announced Goober Dash, a racing royale game of pure chaos. Made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> again too with a "Custom C++ Backend" and it will release with Native Linux support.</p>
<p>It sounds just a <em>little</em> bit like Fall Guys except in 2D and just as ridiculous. The developers say that Goobers have the ability to DASH, which can be used as a speed burst, to smash through obstacles, and even send your opponents <em>flying</em>. There's even a full course creator to build and upload levels.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="KV4GNwqVRGo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fa33d12f3d01ba82db87898df8275153.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/KV4GNwqVRGo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast-paced multiplayer platforming.</li>
<li>Up to 32 real players in each race.</li>
<li>Cross-platform play.</li>
<li>Custom Races with friends.</li>
<li>Daily global timed challenges.</li>
<li>Unlockable Customization for your Goober.</li>
<li>Full Course Creator/Editor.</li>
<li>Share your Courses and get them in the game.</li>
</ul>
<p>"With Goober Dash, we wanted to continue our tradition of creating fun, competitive, multiplayer games that you can enjoy with friends for years," said Tyron Haugen, Creative Director at Winterpixel Games. "For this game, we knew we wanted to give our community the tools to make this world their own, and with the Course Creator, we've allowed players to create whatever they can imagine, and then experience it with their friends. Honestly, we've been blown away by what the community has come up with so far."</p>
<p>Sounds like it's going to be a lot of fun</p>
<p>Follow it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2661160/Goober_Dash/" target="_blank">on Steam</a> or play via the <a href="https://gooberdash.winterpixel.io/" target="_blank">browser</a>.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma 6 goes Wayland by default, initial HDR gaming support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In another update on the progress of the upcoming KDE Plasma 6 desktop environment release, there's some fun details from Nate Graham. <em>FYI: KDE Plasma is used on the Steam Deck for the Desktop Mode!</em></p>
<p>From Graham's usual weekly progress <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2023/11/10/this-week-in-kde-wayland-by-default-de-framed-breeze-hdr-games-rectangle-screen-recording/" target="_blank">blog post</a> it's noted that Plasma 6 has now set Wayland as the default. As developer Neal Gompa noted in the accepted <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-workspace/-/merge_requests/2188" target="_blank">merge request</a>, "The KDE Plasma experience with Wayland has reached a level of maturity where it makes sense to switch it to the default session."</p>
<p>Another big one is the <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin/-/merge_requests/4589" target="_blank">merging</a> of initial HDR support for gaming (which I previously reported on), that has also now been accepted, using a cut-down version of the upstream protocol that isn't yet finished so that the Plasma team can let people test and play with the HDR implementation for gaming.</p>
<p>One change I'm happy to see is the removal of the need to approve or deny "background activity" of Flatpak apps, it was a bit of a nuisance as Graham said "the whole concept of this has been removed as it was kinda sus and not useful at all".</p>
<p>Plenty of theme improvements for Breeze too as they gave it a bit of an overhaul to have "no more frames within frames" so that instead "Breeze-themed apps adopt the clean design of modern Kirigami apps, with views separated from one another with single-pixel lines".</p>
<p>Plasma start-up time was also improved by multiple seconds.</p>
<p>This is the current roadmap as a reminder as the first big <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/kde-plasma-6-gets-a-first-alpha-release/" target="_blank">Plasma 6 Alpha is out now</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>8 November 2023: Alpha</li>
<li>29 November 2023: Beta 1</li>
<li>20 December 2023: Beta 2</li>
<li>10 January 2024: Release Candidate 1</li>
<li>31 January 2024: Release Candidate 2</li>
<li>21 February 2024: Private Tarball Release</li>
<li>28 February 2024: Public Release</li>

      <title>METAL GEAR SOLID - Master Collection Version now shouldn&#39;t lose your saves</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the big nuisances of the METAL GEAR SOLID - Master Collection Version release on Steam, was that you may have found your saved games vanished. The latest version should fix that happening going forward.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol1-is-quite-broken-on-steam-deck-linux/" target="_blank">Noted in my initial article and video</a> about the release on Steam, if you saved and then just quit the game without first using the L1+R1 (gamepad shoulder buttons) overlay menu, it seemed like the save you made would just…vanish. A pretty <em>incredible</em> bug to release with and numerous gamers noted their lost progress due to this. Thankfully, it should be solved now.</p>
<p>The latest patch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2131630/view/3817424410883454487" target="_blank">version 1.3.0</a> notes these improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added save functionality improvements.</li>
<li>Updated the Online Manual.</li>
<li>Fixed some other minor issues.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus they're currently investigating this:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>An issue which sometimes causes certain cutscenes to stop playing.  </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Valve has given it a Steam Deck Playable rating, mainly due to some small text. It's also rated Gold on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/2131630?device=pc" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> for desktop gamers.</p>
<hr/>
<p>METAL GEAR SOLID 3: Snake Eater - Master Collection Version was also updated to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2131650/view/3826431610132960581" target="_blank">version 1.3.0</a> with these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where some buttons were assigned multiple functions (Details on the updated controls are available in the Online Manual).</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the audio was out of sync with certain videos.</li>
<li>Updated the Online Manual.</li>
<li>Removed the "Download" section from the game launcher (Check <a class="Link eventbbcodeparser_Link_3I3zk" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2131650/view/3736358345125342519?snr=1_2108_9__2107" target="_blank">here</a> for our guide on how to install/uninstall the DLCs).</li>
<li>Fixed some other minor issues.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And they're investigating this:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>An issue where some face paints are displayed in a lower resolution.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>KeeperFX open-source remake and expansion of Dungeon Keeper 1.0 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While it (sadly) doesn't yet have proper Native Linux support, it's still great to see more open source remakes like this and Dungeon Keeper is a true classic. KeeperFX has hit the big 1.0!</p>
<p>Originally released in 1997 from Bullfrog Productions and released by Electronic Arts. The developers on KeeperFX say the main goal is to preserve and expand upon the original Dungeon Keeper experience, offering many new features, improvements, and much more while staying true to the original feeling of the game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16281669691699962057gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16281669691699962057gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You should hopefully be able to run it with Wine, but perhaps with more eyes on it people can work towards getting it running properly on Linux?</p>
<p>Current features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 7/10/11 support.</li>
<li>Higher screen resolutions.</li>
<li>Modernized controls.</li>
<li>Many bugfixes.</li>
<li>Additional campaigns and maps.</li>
<li>New level script commands.</li>
<li>New creatures, textures and sprites.</li>
<li>Multiplayer.</li>
<li>And much more!</li>
</ul>
<p>See more on the <a href="https://keeperfx.net/" target="_blank">official site</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dkfans/keeperfx" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Much like other remakes it needs the original data files which you can <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/dungeon_keeper" target="_blank">grab on GOG.com</a>.</p>

      <title>Mega Crit (Slay the Spire) and Null Games now funding Godot Engine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>More good news for the free and open source Godot Engine, as they've announced two more fun names have joined in to help fund further development.</p>
<p>The first is <a href="https://null.com/" target="_blank">Null Games</a> who say they are "part of a new wave of indie publishers that put developers first" and their "publishing agreement has some of the most developer-friendly terms there are". They've joined Godot as a Silver Sponsor.</p>
<p>Next up is <a href="https://www.megacrit.com/" target="_blank">Mega Crit</a>, developer of the popular Slay the Spire, who have joined Godot as a Gold Sponsor. Recently Mega Crit released <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/slay-the-spire-devs-release-dancing-duelists-after-abandoning-unity-for-godot/" target="_blank">Dancing Duelists after abandoning Unity for Godot</a> as their first test game released using Godot and it's quite fun.</p>
<p>We also recently had <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/robot-gentleman-dev-of-60-seconds-blasts-unity-switches-to-godot-and-increases-funding/" target="_blank">Robot Gentleman dev of 60 Seconds!</a> join up with Godot, and Terraria developer <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/terraria-developer-re-logic-donates-100k-to-godot-engine-and-fna/" target="_blank">Re-Logic donated a big sum too</a> along with ongoing support.</p>
<p>Going by the current <a href="https://fund.godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Development Fund</a> they've dipped just below €50K a month now from 1,331 members and 15 sponsors. So it's still going strong, which is good news as Godot 4.2 is fast approaching with Godot 4.2 beta 6 released only <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-2-beta-6/" target="_blank">yesterday</a> and they say the "4.2 stable release is drawing near".</p>

      <author>Pengling</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Still need more Vampire Survivors in your life? A line of official merchandise is out now.</p>
<p>The Arizona-based online gaming merchandise store <a href="https://www.fangamer.com/" target="_blank">Fangamer</a> is currently running their annual week-long Black Friday event, combining a sale, discounted international shipping, and new items based on various games. This year's event has kicked off with the launch of a selection of items based on poncle's breakout hit, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/" target="_blank">Vampire Survivors</a> - which, as we all know, happens to be Linux native and Steam Deck Verified.</p>

<a href="https://www.fangamer.com/collections/vampire-survivors" target="_blank">Catalogued here</a>, the first wave consists of a t-shirt bearing a "Swarm" design, a spinning pin of Queen Sigma, and pin-sets featuring Giovanna Grana, Krochi Freetto, and O'Sole Meeo.</p>
<p>Other games due to be covered over the course of the week are <a href="https://www.fangamer.com/collections/dwarf-fortress" target="_blank">Dwarf Fortress</a> (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/" target="_blank">Native Linux, Steam Deck Playable</a>), <a href="https://www.fangamer.com/collections/pizza-tower" target="_blank">Pizza Tower</a> (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2231450/Pizza_Tower/" target="_blank">Proton, Steam Deck Verified</a>), <a href="https://www.fangamer.com/collections/tunic" target="_blank">Tunic</a> (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553420/TUNIC/" target="_blank">Proton, Steam Deck Verified</a>), and <a href="https://www.fangamer.com/collections/rollercoaster-tycoon" target="_blank">RollerCoaster Tycoon</a> (whose <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1368820/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_3_Complete_Edition/" target="_blank">most recent entry</a> is Steam Deck Playable via Proton).</p>

      <title>SteamOS 3.5.2 Preview adds Steam Deck OLED support, Steam Deck back in Top 10 Sellers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a Preview update for SteamOS to ensure the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/valve-reveals-steam-deck-oled-for-november-16th/" target="_blank">Steam Deck OLED</a> is fully supported. Plus, thanks to the recent price changes, the Steam Deck is back to being in the top sellers.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3800535912301292659" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.5.2</a> you need to be in Preview via Settings &gt; System &gt; System Update Channel. It's a small one though in terms of the specific list of changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added support for Steam Deck OLED</li>
<li>Removed spurious splash screen during reboot and shutdown</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That's not to say what's inside is small though, as all the additions needed in SteamOS itself are important to make sure it fully supports the Steam Deck OLED. Which <em>should</em> also ensure smoother transitions for people moving an SSD over from an LCD Steam Deck to the OLED Steam Deck which Valve said to me via email that it should work without issue around November 16th with a software update.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Steam Deck is back up high in the Weekly Top Sellers with it being number 1 in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topsellers/GB/2023-11-7" target="_blank">UK</a> for the last week, and number 4 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topsellers/global/2023-11-7" target="_blank">globally</a> (in supported regions). This is thanks to the 256GB LCD model now being cheaper, while the 64GB and 512GB LCD models have a big price-drop until they sell out since they're being phased-out.</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer Part 35: The New Stories</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-34-abusing-the-system/" target="_blank">Part 34: Abusing the System</a></strong></p>
<p>Just like with the original <em>Quake</em>, it did not take long for established publishers to seek out new and aspiring game development talent to create third party expansion content for <em>Quake II</em>. The first out the gate was <em>Juggernaut: The New Story For Quake II</em> released by HeadGames Publishing in early 1998, soon to be followed by a number of other packs including <em>Zaero</em> developed by Team Evolve and published by our old friends at Macmillan Digital Publishing.</p>
<p>Like with the unofficial <em>Quake</em> expansions you need to copy the data directories over to your <em>Quake II</em> install, which <em>Juggernaut</em> complicates by hiding this behind an InstallShield installer. On Linux you can use the Unshield utility to extract the contents of the data1.cab file, but the file cases will be all over the place; not an issue under Windows, but a headache for case sensitive Linux systems. To save myself a migraine, I assembled a shell script that outputs the proper file name cases.</p>
<p>From there you can launch <em>Quake II</em> with the "+set game JUGFULL" parameter, although under Windows the STORY.AVI movie file will play in a separate window at launch, something that can be bettered on Linux by using MPlayer. Most expansion packs for <em>Quake II</em> rely on a separate library file to inject new game code, but <em>Juggernaut</em> instead functions as a base total conversion, with only the art and level assets being modified. The result is even more amateurish, but at least it is portable.</p>
<p>While not as awful as some bad faith reviewers have claimed, <em>Juggernaut</em> is a victim of its two month development time, with it suffering from the desire to be the first expansion to hit store shelves. The prevalence of unmodified <em>Quake II</em> assets in spite of the original setting betrays this, as well as in the rushed nature of some of the additions, with the new levels being linear with no marked secrets. This incongruity stops <em>Juggernaut</em> from reaching its full potential, but fun can still be had with it.</p>
<p>The opening Ice Caves make a poor introduction with the decision to start you with a Chaingun, inviting you to burn through all your bullets and be stuck with just the Blaster. <em>Juggernaut</em> does find its feet later on in the campaign after the Callistans invade Europa proper, even with the enemy counts rising to the levels seen in some slaughter maps. Neither expansion pack features original music, but both will play the <em>Quake II</em> CD-ROM tracks apart from on the "Living Quarters" map of <em>Juggernaut</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15368593141699904050gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15368593141699904050gol6.png"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10810174011699904051gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10810174011699904051gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p><em>Zaero</em>, on the other hand, hews far closer to the official mission packs, with you taking the role of an elite pilot whose squadron gets stranded on Stroggos. Installing <em>Zaero</em> is much simpler, with the data folder being right there on the root of the CD-ROM, and formal Linux support even being offered through a library file included as part of the official zaero-1.1-2.zip patch archive; after that I just had to make the pak0.PAK file lowercase.</p>
<p>After launching with the "+set game zaero" parameter you would think it would be all plain sailing from here, but <em>Zaero</em> proved to be faultier than <em>Juggernaut</em> even was. Attempting to use the new Plasma Shield Generator causes the game to abort with a segmentation fault, which is not a huge problem as you never have to equip it, but it does make one of the recorded demo files segfault too. All of the other new additions seemed to function properly; that is, until I reached the final boss.</p>
<p>Something that the boss will sometimes fire will also trigger a segmentation fault, turning <em>Zaero</em> into a horror game where if you stare at the boss for too long the game will break. Cheese tactics can mitigate this, but <em>Zaero</em> also steals all of your equipment at the start of the boss level, and he can let loose an EMP Nuke when injured to disable your weapons for a spell. By exploiting the overhead pipes and crouching on stairs, not to mention a lot of save scumming, I did manage to scrape a win.</p>
<p>A lot of the new additions seem inspired by <em>Duke Nukem 3D</em>, with the introduction of laser tripwires and security camera feeds. There are also now turrets, which are at least less irksome than those in <em>Ground Zero</em>, and can often be disabled. All of the new enemies veer towards the obnoxious, with the Sentinels being powerful bullet sponges who seem to exist to compel you to use the IRED Devices and EMP Nukes to save on ammo; <em>Zaero</em> proves stingy with its arsenal for most of the campaign.</p>
<p>As expected both <em>Juggernaut</em> and <em>Zaero</em> produced the same sporadic lock ups I experienced with the rest of <em>Quake II</em>, although I did notice that they became far worse here when I cranked up the difficulty in <em>Juggernaut</em> and had more enemies spawning in. Say what you will about these expansions packs, they at least took more effort on the part of the publisher than just grabbing a bunch of freely distributed packages off the internet and burning them to a disc. Time to get out my shovel again.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck OLED initial quick-look and Q&amp;A Part 1</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/valve-reveals-steam-deck-oled-for-november-16th/" target="_blank">Steam Deck OLED was recently revealed by Valve</a> for release on November 16th, so I've spent as much time as I possibly can tinkering with it, testing it, playing games and more since Valve sent over a review unit.</p>
<p>My early impression with it is one of big surprise, because it really is a genuinely huge upgrade over the original.</p>
<p>See my quick initial video on it arriving:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_c0UaWgVGZ0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dba59f4cb79221598fdfa0df1c83f6c5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_c0UaWgVGZ0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p></p>
<p>Lots and lots of questions have been asked about it too, so I bundled up some of the early questions to do a first Q&amp;A video as well with some demos:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="v-tFH1kO-BM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d47a950e7ac17b8dc70b29f9e235e71c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/v-tFH1kO-BM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p></p>
<p>Now is the time to ask away: what do you want to know? What do you want / need tested? I'll be gathering many more questions on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux YouTube</a> and on here to answer in future.</p>
<p>Just like with the original model — you can expect ongoing reports on how it's doing and regular game testing.</p>

      <title>WHAT THE GOLF? gets an &#39;Among Golf Update&#39; out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's something a little suspicious about the latest WHAT THE GOLF? update, with the Among Golf Update adding a bit of Among Us flavour. Still one of the funniest games I've played in the last few years, and well worth picking up.</p>
<p>What exactly is it? For the uninitiated: it's a silly physics-based golf parody where every golf course is a new surprising type of golf, some brilliant or hilarious, others so absurd you will ask yourself: WHAT THE GOLF? It's a really silly game that will make you laugh.</p>
<p>In the new update the developers said to "Expect betrayal, vending machines, surprises, space rockets, UFOs, vents, cats and other vaguely related items that are great for golfing!" and that you can expect "more regular new levels to play in the next few months" now this is done.</p>

<p>Full Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified! Great fun on the go! See <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/01/what-the-golf-is-a-good-question-and-a-highly-amusing-game/" target="_blank">my original thoughts on it here</a>. I'm genuinely really looking forward to playing through these new levels.</p>

      <title>OBS Studio 30.0 released with full-height docks plus Intel QSV H264, HEVC, AV1 on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another big release of the video recording software OBS Studio 30.0 now available, bringing with it some new features and fixes. One of my favourite bits of open source software, as OBS Studio is something I use regularly for pretty much all of the videos on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux YouTub</a>e for gameplay capture.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12055608551699891218gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12055608551699891218gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>The main additions are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added WHIP/WebRTC output [Sean-Der / kc5nra / DDRBoxman / tt2468]
<ul>
<li>With the introduction of WHIP, FTL is slated for removal in a release after May 2024</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Redesigned the status bar [cg2121 / GeorgesStavracas / Warchamp7]
<ul>
<li>The redesigned status bar now provides the same information in a more organized and well structured way, with more representative and recognizable icons.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added option for Full-Height docks to the "Docks" menu [ujifgc]
<ul>
<li>When enabled, a dock such as chat can take up the entire height of the OBS window</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Added a shader cache to improve OBS startup time on Windows [notr1ch]</li>
<li>Added application audio capture on macOS [jcm93]</li>
<li>Added a "Safe Mode" that runs OBS without third-party plugins, scripting, and websockets [derrod]
<ul>
<li>When OBS detects that it was not shut down properly it will offer the user the option to launch in Safe Mode for troubleshooting purposes. It can also be manually activated via the "Help" menu.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reworked the virtual camera on macOS to work with all applications (on macOS 13 and newer) [gxalpha/PatTheMav]</li>
<li>Added a YouTube Live Control Room Panel when streaming to YouTube [yuriy-chunak]</li>
<li>Added 10-bit capture support for Decklink devices [jpark37]</li>
<li>Added HDR playback support for Decklink output [jpark37]</li>
<li>Added an option to hide OBS windows from macOS Screen Capture's "Display Capture" [PatTheMav]</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That's all the main features added but there's been plenty of other changes across the app like the ability to arrange filters via drag &amp; drop, the ability to set FFmpeg Options for VAAPI, a minimum output resolution to 32x32 to prevent certain encoder failure scenarios, various assorted crash-bugs have been solved and much more.</p>
<p>There's also a specific fix for Linux noted in the changelog:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a possible issue with logging high frame rate video capture devices on Linux [kkartaltepe]</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
