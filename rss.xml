      <title>Atari set to acquire 82% of Thunderful Group AB, as Thunderful announce they&#39;re &#34;restructuring&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Even more game industry consolidation going on. Atari has entered into an agreement with Thunderful Group AB to acquire most of it. As per the press release Atari will pay around €4.5 million (~$5.1M USD) to own approximately 82% of the outstanding shares and votes of Thunderful becoming the major shareholder.</p>
<p>Wade Rosen, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Atari, SA said about the deal: "This Transaction marks another important milestone in Atari's development with the expansion of its publishing and development capabilities in the European region. Thunderful is recognized for publishing and developing critically acclaimed games, and with the announced transformation plan, as well as the quality and commitment of Thunderful's teams, we are confident that Thunderful will be returning to a profitable growth path while helping to further develop Atari operations in Europe."</p>
<p><em>Via <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/07/29/3122984/0/en/Atari-enters-into-an-agreement-to-invest-in-Thunderful-Group-AB.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">globenewswire</a>.</em></p>
<p>On the same day, Thunderful <a href="https://thunderfulgroup.com/news-room/press-releases/2025-07-29-thunderful-group-initiates-restructuring-and-provides-business-update" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> they're "restructuring" to "promptly reduce the cost base with the aim of improving operating cash flow" as they continue to "generate negative cash flow" while building up a net debt of around SEK 85 million (~$8.8M USD). And yes, this does include job losses as they confirmed "workforce reductions within game development studios and the publishing business to adapt operations to the release pipeline, as well as workforce reductions within other group-wide services".</p>
<p>Thunderful are likely best known for the SteamWorld series originally from Image &amp; Form Games, which was folded into Thunderful Development.</p>

      <title>Sony sues Tencent over Light of Motiram calling it a &#34;slavish clone&#34; of the Horizon Zero Dawn series</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It was only a matter of time really on this one. Sony have now formally begun legal action against Tencent for Light of Motiram.</p>
<p>Filed on July 25th, the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.453426/gov.uscourts.cand.453426.1.0.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">lawsuit</a> certainly doesn't pull any punches jumping right into calling it "a slavish clone of SIE’s immensely popular, award-winning Horizon series of video games". Sony are seeking to prevent the release of the game, along with seeking damages of "up to $150,000 for each separate work in the Horizon Franchise infringed".</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6prk0Jxg7Cw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">recent trailer</a> does look shockingly similar, as does all of their promotional material, as pointed out very clearly by Sony in the lawsuit. In <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/light-of-motiram-takes-horizon-zero-dawn-and-turns-it-into-a-co-op-survival-game/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my original article</a> about the game I even said "The copying here is pretty blatant" and it really is. Everything about it screams they wanted to make a Horizon game.</p>
<p>Reading further into it, representatives from Tencent (a claim from Sony) did actually approach them to discuss licensing the Horizon franchise in March 2024 at GDC. Here Tencent "pitched a project to SIE, wherein they outlined Tencent's desire to license SIE's intellectual property rights in the Horizon Franchise to create a mobile video game set in the Horizon universe" noting that the team involved were "[d]ie-hardfans" of the franchise.</p>

<p>Clones and games inspired directly by popular games are everywhere, they appear every day. However, this looks like it's probably just a bit too close especially with the creature and character designs, even if they're going for a different gameplay style with it being a co-op survival game. So it will be very interesting to see what happens as a result of this one.</p>

      <title>Cerebral psychological horror s.p.l.i.t from the dev of Buckshot Roulette is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Costing less than £3, here's your chance at some cheap thrills with the release of s.p.l.i.t from Buckshot Roulette developer Mike Klubnika. It's properly weird in the best kind of way and it won't take you long to complete either, good for a single run one evening.</p>
<p>What you get is an intense 90-minute or so psychological-horror-hacker game. s.p.l.i.t, plunges you into the dark, sickly world of cybercrime, as you attempt to gain access to an unethical superstructure, and once in - execute a devastating malware attack. One I'm sure plenty of Linux fans will appreciate with the keyboard-driven raw command-line interactions, wrapped up in Klubnika's trademark dystopian, low-fi audiovisual stylings.</p>

      <title>Seriously cool car combat game FUMES has entered Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>FUMES really impressed me with the demo, and now you can jump in and blow some vehicles up in this fast-paced single-player car combat game. The demo was recently updated too and works great with Proton.</p>
<p>The initial release comes with quite a lot of content including 12 cars, 12 weapons, 3 giant bosses, 12 mini bosses, 3 different types of anomalies to discover and more. FUMES is very much a game like the classics both in terms of style and gameplay, reminds me of a lot of similar games I played back in the days of the original PlayStation.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HvQr6nI5mdI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/50a650fe3538e1b1b08337fe3565ec2c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HvQr6nI5mdI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The roadmap they've shared has lots of goodies planned for the game too. More activities and racing modes, melee combat, engine swapping, more exploration, more end-game content, a full proper story and much more. We might also see it get mod support and online co-op but they're not promising those.</p>
<p>It's seriously ace, you should grab it.</p>

      <title>SoulGame Studio release Flash classics in the Swords &amp; Souls Legacy Collection</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The new Swords &amp; Souls Legacy Collection from SoulGame Studio brings five Flash classics back with a Steam release. I'm sure a fair few readers will remember these, I certainly do. Now playable properly on modern systems in full-screen 16:9 for the first time.</p>
<p>Each title in the Swords &amp; Souls Legacy Collection offers a unique spin on action, adventure, and humour, all tied together by SoulGame Studio’s trademark charm and the unifying ‘Souls’ theme. While there isn’t a single overarching storyline across the five titles, each game features its own distinct world, characters and gameplay style.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DPPUsHC-J-c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6b55737ede1fe0877d326821a32d6734.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DPPUsHC-J-c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The games included are:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4><strong>Swords &amp; Souls</strong></h4>
<p>In this iconic RPG-training hybrid, design your Soul from the ground up, train them in skill-based mini-games, and prove your mettle in the deadly Arena. Hone reflexes, level up abilities, and unlock powerful gear as you face increasingly tougher foes and rise through the ranks. With charming animations, quirky humor, and deep character progression, <em>Swords &amp; Souls</em> stands tall as a Flash-era legend, and now it's back, better than ever.</p>
<h4><strong>Rogue Soul</strong></h4>
<p>Become the most wanted rogue in this fast-paced action-runner where style is everything. Sprint, slide, and slash your way through city rooftops and dodge enemy patrols as you collect loot and grow your notoriety. With responsive controls, acrobatic moves, and an ever-expanding list of treasures to uncover, <em>Rogue Soul</em> delivers a thrilling blend of precision and personality. Robbing from the rich has never been this slick.</p>
<h4><strong>Rogue Soul 2</strong></h4>
<p>The rogue returns, bigger, faster, and more dangerous. <em>Rogue Soul 2</em> builds on everything that made the original great with sprawling environments, new enemy types, powerful upgrades, and challenging boss encounters. As you explore vast new areas filled with traps, treasures, and secrets, you’ll unlock cosmetic gear, complete quests, and perfect your rogue’s moveset.</p>
<h4><strong>The Soul Driver</strong></h4>
<p>Buckle up for mayhem in <em>The Soul Driver</em>, a high-octane chase game where you're a fugitive with nothing to lose. Customize your ride, take on daring challenges, and smash through 42 miles of chaos as you flee an increasingly desperate police force. From roadblocks and helicopters to comically intense upgrades, this game delivers nonstop laughs and thrills. Can you make it to the border before the law catches up?</p>
<h4><strong>The Gentleman</strong></h4>
<p>Put your monocle on and prepare for refined platforming. In <em>The Gentleman</em>, gravity is just a suggestion as you gently stroll, leap, and float through clever puzzle-platformer levels using nothing but your umbrella and wit. This elegantly tricky title is packed with head-scratching levels and stylish charm. With its dashing hero and unique mechanics, it’s a love letter to players who like their challenges served with sophistication.</p>

      <title>Stardock Entertainment revealed Elemental: Reforged bringing together multiple games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Stardock Entertainment have announced Elemental: Reforged, which is kinda of like a super remaster of three different games to finally realize their vision.</p>
<p>It brings together the 4x series Elemental that was split into three games across Elemental: War of Magic, Fallen Enchantress, and Sorcerer King. Stardock said their original plan conceived back in 2008 was limited by the technology of the time and so this brings a modernized 64bit game engine to deliver on their original vision. There will be some game mechanics from each in the series, along with entirely new features. Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QHOH_iLe_Z8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d59135d6bec49eb9d610cc2509c1915c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QHOH_iLe_Z8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“With Elemental: Reforged, we’re finally able to deliver the original design we wanted,” said Brad Wardell, CEO of Stardock Entertainment and lead designer of the original Elemental game. “As we developed Elemental, we realized that the design wouldn’t fit in a 32-bit game and pared it down to into Elemental: War of Magic, which still had challenges fitting in 32-bit memory space. So then we made Elemental: Fallen Enchantress, which did much better but was still a shadow of what we had designed. Then we made Elemental: Sorcerer King where we focused on the crafting and quest elements of the original design. Now, thanks to remastering the engine to 64-bit, we can actually make the full game we originally envisioned in 2008.”</p>
<p>Elemental: Reforged Highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unified Elemental Experience. Brings together the strategic depth, smart AI, and rich gameplay from Fallen Enchantress, the immersive crafting and quest systems from Sorcerer King, and the dynasty-building, terraforming, and innovative mechanics first introduced in War of Magic. </li>
<li>Rich, Dynamic Worlds. Enjoy endless replayability through procedurally generated fantasy worlds filled with lore-rich quests, evolving environments that respond to your magic, unique fantasy civilizations, and bustling cities populated with individually simulated characters. </li>
<li>RPG-Infused Unit Design. Customize heroes and armies through an intuitive RPG-style character designer, crafting each unit with their own unique history, stats, equipment, and abilities, growing stronger with experience. </li>
<li>Compelling Tactical Combat. See how your designed units and characters fare in battle in highly refined tactical battles that reward strategic thinking, or leverage a sophisticated auto-resolve system powered by advanced AI for streamlined empire management. </li>
<li>Deep Quest and Story Integration. Embark on rich, narrative-driven quests seamlessly woven into the empire-building experience, influencing diplomacy, unlocking secrets, and offering meaningful rewards.</li>
<li>Modernized UI and Graphics Engine. Explore enhanced visuals powered by DirectX 11, seamless zooming from strategic cloth-map to detailed tactical view.</li>
<li>Integrated Modding tools. A comprehensive built-in modding and map-editing tools, and a fully redesigned user interface optimized for modern PC gaming with Steam workshop integration.</li>

      <title>The Crazy Hyper-Dungeon Chronicles (TCHDC) combines the ideas of Undertale and Dungeon Master</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Due to arrive in October, The Crazy Hyper-Dungeon Chronicles (TCHDC) combines the worlds of Undertale and Dungeon Master.</p>
<p>Here you get to decide exactly what type of adventurer you want to be. You are the hero of this story. You could opt for the goal-oriented Explorer who excels in puzzle-solving and stealth, dive right into the role of the Destroyer if you prefer to fight first and ask questions about the story later, or become the Resolver who seeks to uncover Hyper-Dungeon's lore and talk issues out instead of fighting when possible.</p>
<p>Sounds like a thoroughly odd but unique blend of game mechanics here. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UiTmM3faw-0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a4282a1fdf3dd5cb540420d913058ec4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UiTmM3faw-0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>According to the press release the labyrinthine is filled of traps, brain-scratching puzzles and you'll have to deal with the combat system that "blends traditional turn-based encounters with arcade action elements". As you explore you'll also encounter "a host of whimsical characters and have interactions laden with references to video games, geek culture, and subcultures galore".</p>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Procedurally generated levels ensure every trip into the Hyper-Dungeon is different and full of surprise encounters and opportunities.</li>
<li>Character profiles let you choose how to play: focus on lore and talk your way out of fights with the Resolver, dive right into combat with the Destroyer, or become the Explorer to excel at puzzle solving and stealth.</li>
<li>Combat blends turn-based strategy with real-time interactions, similar to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 or Super Mario RPG.</li>
<li>The Hyper-Dungeon is packed with in-game lore to unearth and pop/game culture references to discover.</li>
</ul>

      <title>OpenLinkHub is an open source interface to manage iCUE LINK Hub and various Corsair devices on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For people who have Corsair hardware, the OpenLinkHub project might be one you need to take a look at to help you manage it all including iCUE LINK Hub.</p>
<p>It's not an official Corsair project, since like many other big-name brands, they don't provide direct Linux support. So one one Linux user decided to create a project to manage it all. OpenLinkHub supports over 100 devices across iCUE LINK Hub and other Corsair AIOs and Hubs for RGB lighting, fan speeds, system metrics, as well as keyboards, mice and headsets via a web dashboard. </p>
<p>The point is to unify all Corsair devices into a single UI available via the web.</p>

      <title>Cattle Country the western styled Stardew gets expanded mining and new features</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cattle Country is a really nice western styled life and farming sim that's a good pick for fans of Stardew Valley. Now with a big content update! <em>ICYMI: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/move-over-stardew-its-time-for-cattle-country/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">See my original thoughts on it</a>.</em></p>
<p>What is it? A cosy frontier life-sim where players can build their dream homestead, raise livestock, craft tools, and carve out a peaceful life beneath the wide Western skies. While you can also romance characters, it's not all sunshine and rainbows - there's bandits that come along too, all part of life on the range.</p>
<p>The developers just released the "Beneath and Beyond" Update and it sounds like a good one. With expanded underground mining, and multiple big new features for all the above ground adventuring you'll be doing.</p>

      <title>HIPS N NOSES is a cafe management sim with magical twists and great looking game mechanics</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cafe management with a magical twist, plus roguelike combat elements and a pretty cool witchy style. HIPS N NOSES is one to keep on your wishlist.</p>
<p>The developer PepperStones from Korea noted that by day you run a "cozy yet mysterious café that helps customers regain their lost memories" and by night you "dive into surreal dream worlds, battling monsters and gathering rare ingredients to brew memory-restoring drinks".</p>
<p>It's not just the style that grabbed my attention here, it's the pretty surprising game mechanics with the way you serve customers. HIPS N NOSES just oozes style. Check it out in the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uwYtKfG3LPs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c6d2075585cedd0ef1ce7333615f5f0a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uwYtKfG3LPs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Recipe Customization - Each customer visiting the café has unique tastes and preferences. By picking up subtle hints in their conversations, players can adjust and enhance recipes with the best possible ingredients. Successfully satisfying even the most demanding customers leads to greater rewards and increased profits.</li>
<li>Combat in Dream World - The ever-changing dream world offers new experiences with every exploration. Meet various people in reality who also appear in the dream world, and together, defeat numerous monsters to collect special materials that cannot be obtained in reality.</li>
<li>Elements That Provide the Fun of Growth - Players can customize their café with various kitchen tools, interact with diverse customers, and grow stronger by defeating dream monsters. These growth systems enable players to handle more customers more efficiently, adding depth and long-term engagement to the gameplay.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's currently aiming for a 2026 release.</p>

      <title>Mecha fans should keep an eye on Ironwing Valiant: Record of Astera</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A mecha action-JRPG with ranged and melee mechanics, mech customization, companion customization and lots more? Sign me the heck up. The style of Ironwing Valiant: Record of Astera looks awesome, and we definitely have a lack of really good modern mech games like this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ironwing Valiant is a fast-pace, mecha action-JRPG game with shooting and melee mechanics, mech customization, companion customization, real-time with pause command abilities in combat, and a compelling storyline and characters. Taking the guise of a young mecha pilot named Reinhardt, you will battle through sleepy villages, imposing fortress cities, and war-scarred industrial centers, fully customize your Valiant (our term for mecha) to fit your playstyle. The game features full parts customization (Head, Arms, Legs, Core, minor components), a large selection of unique melee, ranged, and axillary weapons, companion and party customization, multiple enemy types (Infantry, armored vehicles, mechs, elite enemies, and more) and a JRPG-style storyline.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like a colourful Armored Core mixed with Valkyria Chronicles. Do you need any more than that? Check out their most recent demo trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yLEaOdIBc38"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6dac87a319f2ab33a6520c13284eb57d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yLEaOdIBc38" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>According to the developer the game world and story is based off of Chinese and Korean mythology and The Romance of The Three Kingdoms novel! So this is definitely one to watch.</p>
<p>There's a very early demo on their itch page and you can follow it on Steam directly too. An upgraded demo is also currently in the works but there's no release date set for the full game yet.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Audio is part of what makes a game great right? Theme Hospital game engine CorsixTH 0.69 is out now to enhance this absolute classic. A game I very much loved when it was originally released, and I really enjoy going back through it with a free and open source enhancement like this.</p>
<p>The main additions in this release include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Custom level/campaign creators can now use an existing level file as an overlay to copy and extend their level file with the #overlay variable. See the 'Custom Level' Wiki page for more information.</li>
<li>A new machine menu has been added. Now you can view the status of all your hospital machines in one place!</li>
<li>Changing speed in game now happens immediately.</li>
<li>Patient happiness can now be a win/lose factor in custom games.</li>
<li>Transparent walls can now be toggled using Shift + X.</li>
<li>Soda price can now be configured in the level file.</li>
<li>Improvements and fixes for the ChirzmanTV custom campaign.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<em>Pictured - CorsixTH on Linux</em></p>
<p>Plenty of smaller but still great changes came in this update too, like finally hearing patients vomiting. Improved AI for idle staff to look for work, VIPs now walk slower to match the original game and a number of bug fixes too.</p>
<p>Check out the full list on <a href="https://github.com/CorsixTH/CorsixTH/releases/tag/v0.69.0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>You need the original game files for it - you can <a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/theme_hospital?as=1636858786" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">buy Theme Hospital on GOG</a>. Then just run the AppImage from the CorsixTH downloads on <a href="https://github.com/CorsixTH/CorsixTH" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, and point it to where you've installed Theme Hospital.</p>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 mod Open Fortress is getting closer to a Steam release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/tf2-mod-open-fortress-is-coming-to-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Back in May</a> we had the announcement that Open Fortress is coming to Steam, and the latest update on their progress sounds great for this Team Fortress 2 mod.</p>
<p>What is it? A full standalone mod of Valve's TF2. The developer said it "builds on Team Fortress 2’s world-famous gunplay to create a smooth, stylish experience inspired by old-school FPS games" to bring all new maps, new game modes, new guns and an original soundtrack along with taking some inspiration from 1970s action flicks.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20850901511753700240gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>In the latest Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3561320/view/515216422280888823" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> the mod team announced that work has completed on porting it to the new official <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/team-fortress-2-major-update-released-and-source-available-for-modders-via-the-source-sdk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TF2 SDK that Valve released back in February</a>. The devs of Open Fortress say they can now upload builds to Steam which will be soon but "not yet". While the "titanic effort of getting Open Fortress SDK-compatible is over" they're still working to bring it up to a fully polished level. This includes improving lots of weapon models, refining maps, remastered sounds and more.</p>

      <title>20 years later, DnD classics Demon Stone and Dragonshard are getting upgraded Steam releases</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Game publisher SNEG recently announced Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dragonshard and Forgotten Realms: Demon Stone are coming to Steam with plenty of upgrades.</p>
<p>There's also a <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/dungeons-dragons-classics-collection" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Dungeons and Dragons Classics Collection Humble Bundle</a> live with the announcement, where you can get 13 classics from SNEG for £7.40 for the whole lot.</p>
<p>More about each of the re-releases below from the press release.</p>
<p><strong>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dragonshard</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Originally released in 2005, Dragonshard returns in a respectful re-release that quietly modernizes the classic: modern-resolution support, localization-friendly saves and profiles, smoother timers and physics, ASLR compatibility, and other under-the-hood fixes for a cleaner experience on today’s PCs.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS® Real-Time Strategy Experience</li>
<li>D&amp;D® game from the Eberron campaign setting</li>
<li>Game design with two levels of interconnected action: RTS war above ground and critical RPG-styled battles in dungeons below</li>
<li>Four ranges of controllable units: powerful champions, heroic captains, trainable henchmen, and nearly unstoppable battlefield juggernauts</li>
<li>Unit development based on 'Experience Points', allowing players to "level up" units - an added RPG twist to the classic RTS gameplay structure</li>
<li>An innovative village grid system - the "Nexus System" - where choice and placement of buildings can specifically affect units' powers</li>
<li>Three warring factions, each with its own history, campaigns, unique strengths... and weaknesses.</li>
<li>Game story by Eberron creator Keith Baker</li>
<li>A variety of threatening environments, all with the "Hyper Terrain" feature, creating real-time terrain deformation in the wake of unit movements</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Update 29/07/25</strong>: as pointed out in the comments, it's not actually the first DnD RTS. Clearing this up with SNEG, here's what they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can add even more, in my opinion, the first RTS in D&amp;D was Stronghold that had real-time city building and was released in 1993.</p>
<p>That said, we are not inventing anything new. That’s how the game was officially positioned - https://www.mobygames.com/game/19289/dungeons-dragons-dragonshard/cover/group-28777/cover-92156/ Check the top of the DVD-box cover. This statement was the main message of the campaign in 2005 and we wanted to keep it in the game description as many gamers remember it this way.</p>
<p>Why was it done? Probably because previous games were using the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons license while this one was the actual D&amp;D one. Previous games wouldn’t be called RTSs at that time either. Stronghold was about managing kingdom in real time and Blood &amp; Magic was about real time tactics without any base building as such.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/870761521753699794gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p><strong>Forgotten Realms: Demon Stone</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>First released in 2004, Forgotten Realms: Demon Stone returns in a polished re‑release: smoother startup and gameplay, proper widescreen scaling, borderless/windowed modes, optimised shadows, full XInput controller support with rumble and hot‑plugging, adjustable audio, and a new in‑game settings menu for modern PCs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick-up-and-play combat: hand-to-hand battles and melee brawls (the fighter), ranged and projectile power (the sorcerer), sexy stealth attacks (the rogue)</li>
<li>Sprawling story by N.Y. Times - bestselling author R.A. Salvatore</li>
<li>Voice performances by Patrick Stewart and Michael Clarke Duncan</li>
<li>Beautiful, ominous Forgotten Realms environments, from the Gemspark Mines to the Jungles of Chult, to the Underdark and beyond</li>
<li>Devastating DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS® creatures including Bugbears, Slaadi, and Yuan-tis</li>
<li>Expansive range of combo moves, skill upgrades, weapons, armor, and more</li>
</ul>

<p>After watching it, I'm sold on it. The style actually looks incredible, and the vertical design of it with all the wall-running really looks like it will grab your full attention. You might want to take out controller insurance on this, it's sure to make you rage.</p>
<p>You can watch the new official developer commentary trailer below:</p>

<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Super Meat Boy 3D</strong> is a tough as nails platformer where you play as an animated cube of meat who's trying to save his girlfriend (who happens to be made of bandages) from an evil fetus in a jar wearing a tux – <strong>IN 3D</strong>!<br/>
<br/>
Our meaty hero will leap from walls, over seas of buzz saws, through crumbling caves and pools of old trash sacrificing his own well-being to save his damsel in distress – <strong>IN 3D!</strong><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Super Meat Boy 3D</strong> brings the old school difficulty of classic retro titles we all know and love and streamlines them down to the essential no bull straight forward twitch reflex platforming. Ramping up in difficulty from hard to soul crushing Meat Boy will brave lush (but also on fire) forests, vast dumps filled with the waste of mankind, and high-tech forges producing the very traps that will inevitably kill Meat Boy over and over and over - <strong>IN 3D!</strong><br/>
<br/>
And if a bunch of levels weren't enough, we also have epic boss fights and tons of unlockable secrets – <strong>IN 3D!</strong></p>

      <title>Valve reveal new Steam store menu and enhanced search now in Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're on the Steam Client Beta (Desktops), you might have noticed the Steam store looking a bit different with the latest update. Valve <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/500579345320904591" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> a refresh of the Steam store menu noting it's designed to "provide easier access to the places Steam users most frequently visit".</p>
<p>What's changed? A lot actually. The whole left sidebar of links is entirely gone, combined into the new store bar at the top. It also puts the bar on more pages across on Steam, to give you access to the search and links easily. It will also disappear when you scroll down, just scroll up a bit for it to reappear.</p>
<p>Valve have also enhanced the search bar too. It now offers more options when searching including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Popular Searches</strong>: See what others are searching for right now</li>
<li><strong>Recently Viewed</strong>: An easy way to jump back to games you've previously looked at</li>
<li><strong>More than just games</strong>: Search for categories/tags, publishers, and more</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Search link</strong>: For those who want to refine their game search even further, we’ve made it easier than ever to access the advanced search page with a variety of filters.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>There's more including recommendations, categories and tags personalised to you and various smaller changes.</p>
<p>If you've tried it out in the Steam Client Beta, drop a comment to let us know what you think.</p>

      <title>Last Epoch devs Eleventh Hour Games have been acquired by Krafton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Subnautica 2 publisher Krafton have acquired Last Epoch devs Eleventh Hour Games, ahead of the latest season launching next month.</p>
<p>In a post on the Last Epoch forum Judd Cobler, Founder of Eleventh Hour Games, <a href="https://forum.lastepoch.com/t/a-new-chapter-for-eleventh-hour-games/78482" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">wrote</a> "Today I’m excited to announce that Eleventh Hour Games is joining Krafton, the powerhouse behind PUBG, who shares our passion for the action RPG genre and is ready to help fuel our efforts in raising Last Epoch to new heights. With this partnership we will have the opportunity and resources to execute on our goal of creating the very best ARPG in the genre.</p>
<p>After speaking with dozens of potential strategic partners, Krafton clearly demonstrated that they’re aligned in helping us achieve our goals and can both enable and guide us through some of the largest upcoming challenges we’ll face as a studio. This partnership will allow us to deliver things we’ve only dreamed of previously and I’m excited to share details on those at a later date".</p>
<p>Cobler noted how Eleventh Hour Games will be hiring "many" roles in the "near future".</p>
<p>This was announced by Eleventh Hour Games the same day they released a full trailer for Season 3 of Last Epoch.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="TnDnhPqC0BA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5408b28a580d4baa187b9a536f6e6fcb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/TnDnhPqC0BA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>Related: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/last-epoch-drops-the-native-linux-version-devs-tell-players-to-use-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in September 2024</a>, Eleventh Hour Games dropped support for their Native Linux version of Last Epoch telling people to use Proton instead.</em></p>
<p>From the Krafton press release: "We are thrilled to welcome Eleventh Hour Games into the KRAFTON family," said Maria Park, Head of Corporate Development at KRAFTON. "The team’s commitment to the ARPG community and innovative approach to game development resonated strongly with our values. Their rise from a grassroots studio to a globally renowned ARPG developer is nothing short of remarkable. We believe this acquisition lays the groundwork for diversifying KRAFTON’s genre portfolio and expanding distinctive franchise IPs. This acquisition also reaffirms our unwavering passion for great games and the teams that build them. We will always stand behind developers who put players first.”</p>
<p>KRAFTON acquired 100 percent of Eleventh Hour Games’ shares. The acquisition amount includes an initial consideration of USD 96 million.</p>
<p>Krafton are currently involved in a pretty dramatic legal spat with the original Subnautica founders, but that's clearly not putting the brakes on the rest of their publishing. Hopefully this won't one day turn into a sour situation as well. Probably not the best timing to be announcing such a thing though.</p>

      <title>Garry&#39;s Mod now has lots of Counter-Strike: Source and Half-Life 2 content included</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have given special permission to Garry's Mod from Facepunch to include a whole bunch of extra content for the popular physics sandbox.</p>
<p>In the July 2025 update the developers noted "The biggest user-facing change in this update brings most of Counter-Strike: Source and Half-Life 2 Episodic content to Garry's Mod by default, with gracious permission from Valve. This means that you no longer need to own those games and have them installed to play on community maps that expect you to have this content".</p>
<p>However it doesn't come with the maps, voice over files and music. You still need to own and install the games to use that part of each. Still, a thoroughly great change to see that should make jumping into Garry's Mod a whole lot easier going forwards.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7203514311753458878gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Facepunch also said this update means that "Half-Life 2: Episode 2 content is now available in the spawnmenu for every player by default". It won't remove all instances of missing textures, but the majority of them.</p>
<p>The update also contains a lot of smaller changes including crash fixes, optimizations and more. See the <a href="https://gmod.facepunch.com/news/july-2025-update" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">full update notes</a>.</p>
<p>It's actually pretty amazing how open Valve are in many ways with things like this, they're really nothing like certain other big companies.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While this is not the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/mann-vs-machine-is-getting-an-upgrade-in-team-fortress-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mann vs Machine update we were previously promised</a>, Team Fortress 2 still has a big update our for the Summer 2025 Event. Still seems like a great time to jump back into the classic free to play FPS from Valve.</p>
<p>As usual for these event updates, Valve pulled in the community for basically all of the actual content that's included. Not something you see from other developers often.</p>
<p>For the Summer 2025 Event this is what was added:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Featuring 10 new community maps: Citadel, Aquarius, Fulgur, Cargo, Conifer, Boardwalk, Blowout, Mannhole, Demolition, and Pressure</li>
<li>Added the Summer 2025 Cosmetic Case
	<ul>
<li>Contains 23 new community-contributed items</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Taunt: Bear Hug</li>

<li>Taunt: Flying Colors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added 14 new community-created Unusual effects
	<ul>
<li>7 new effects for Unusual hats</li>
<li>7 new effects for Unusual taunts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All cosmetic and taunt cases will grant Summer 2025 Unusual effects instead of their normal Unusual effects during the Summer event. This does not include crates.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The Summer event runs through September 15th, 2025.</p>

      <title>THE FINALS devs confirm (again) continued compatibility for Linux / Steam Deck with Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Embark Studios have reconfirmed their for THE FINALS to continue working with Proton for Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck players.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/the-finals-is-getting-new-kernel-based-anti-cheat-likely-to-break-it-on-linux-steamos-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Back in early July</a> we had Embark Studios detail new anti-cheat plans for THE FINALS, which caused some concern amongst Linux players since it could end up unplayable as we've seen with various other games. They quickly confirmed the game would continue to work though.</p>
<p>The key though, is that THE FINALS is <em>not</em> "supported" but they will ensure it's not intentionally blocked. In the latest Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2073850/view/541112120139317344" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> they've posted the below to reassure Linux platform players:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Steam Deck and Proton Support</strong></p>
<p>We noticed the concern about Linux following our last update. We’re testing everything across all platforms, and have made it very clear to our partners that Proton and Steam Deck are important to our development plans. While we don’t officially support Steam Deck due to our required dependence on Proton Experimental, we are committed to ensuring compatibility, and we work with external partners to fix issues before we ship a patch. The experience of every player is important to us. Despite many factors, we are still dedicated to supporting it because we know it matters. However, general Wine support is not tested, and native Linux support is not planned. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Really great to see, hopefully more Linux players will actually take a look at THE FINALS given their repeated statements on it. Nice that a few bigger games like it aren't blocking us.</p>

<p>A smaller update to the Heroic Games Launcher for running games from Epic, GOG and Amazon on Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck arrived with v2.18.0.</p>
<p>Included with this release along with several improvements is their new opt-in analytics system. It uses Plausible Analytics, which is open source and privacy focused where "All data is 100% anonymous and it serves only to have an idea of the number of users across the different operating systems we support" so they know where to focus for updates.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4044264111753455998gol1.png"/></p>
<p>The main changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>[Linux] Prioritize GE-Proton Versions and adds a setting to show/hide non-GE version on Wine List.</li>
<li>[UX] Several improvements to Joystick and Keyboard navigation.</li>
<li>[UX] Adds a new option to launch games with or without logs from the game page.</li>
<li>[macOS] Adds Wine-Staging back to Wine Manager and Fix an issue with picking up the wrong wine binary when using GPTK.</li>
<li>[General] Adds Opt-in Anonymous analytics.</li>
<li>Several other fixes and improvements.</li>
</ul>

      <title>GOG Preservation Program adds Heroes of Might and Magic titles and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The <a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> team recently announced another expansion of the GOG Preservation Program, bringing in  Heroes of Might and Magic titles and more.</p>
<p>On top of expanding their support for classics, they also did something quite fancy. They've put <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_3_complete_edition" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Heroes of Might and Magic 3: Complete</a> that's also in the Preservation Program onto a 5D optical crystal. Created in collaboration with SPhotonix, tech that was shown off in a recent Mission Impossible movie. Apparently it can survive "billions of years, extreme conditions, and even a trip through an oven".</p>

<p>Nice to see more retro games that should live on for a good few more years on modern systems.</p>

      <title>Game store itch.io has &#34;deindexed&#34; adult content due to payment processor scrutiny</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/valve-gets-pressured-by-payment-processors-with-a-new-rule-for-game-devs-and-various-adult-games-removed/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Steam had issues recently with payment providers</a>, game store itch.io are facing the same problems with certain types of adult content.</p>
<p>Writing in a blog post on the store, itch founder Leaf Corcoran noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have “deindexed” all adult NSFW content from our browse and search pages. We understand this action is sudden and disruptive, and we are truly sorry for the frustration and confusion caused by this change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Corcoran named an organisation called <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/open-letter-to-payment-processors" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Collective Shout</a> that have "launched a campaign against Steam and itch.io, directing concerns to our payment processors about the nature of certain content found on both platforms".  Unfortunately, creators on the platform got no heads up. It was all very abrupt as the "situation developed rapidly".</p>
<p>As a result of this the itch team are doing a "comprehensive audit" of all the content to ensure they meet whatever demands are placed on them from payment providers. This means certain content will be permanently removed from the store.</p>
<p>Initially, there were reports that itch were stopping payouts that spread across social media, but the official itch.io account on BlueSky <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/itch.io/post/3luq77xpjjc2y" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have not denied any payouts to creators as part of yesterday's review. If there are any creators in which we are unable to process a payout for then we'll contact them directly. We do understand that the eligibility message is confusing given the context so we're updating the text on the notices</p>

      <title>NVIDIA reveal more GPU driver security issues for July 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Time to get updating your NVIDIA GPU driver, as more security issues have been revealed in their July 2025 Security Bulletin.</p>
<p>We were wondering why NVIDIA had been incredibly vague on what actually changed in their recent driver releases. With both the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/nvidia-570-172-08-released-for-linux-as-the-main-stable-driver/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">570.172.08</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/nvidia-stable-driver-575-64-03-released/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">575.64.03</a> that I covered here on GamingOnLinux only noting "Minor bug fixes and improvements". NVIDIA did the same again with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/details/251038/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">575.64.05</a> that arrived earlier this week. Now we know why then.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5670" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">security bulletin</a> here's the issues noted that affect Linux systems:</p>
<table border="1" style="width:100%">

</table>
<p>There's a few more specific to Windows I'm not including here.</p>
<p>According to NVIDIA you're safe if you're on at least 575.64.05, 570.172.08 or 535.261.03. All prior versions in each series are vulnerable to the issues.</p>

      <title>Oceaneers is a survival-crafting adventure set in a flooded world of sinking islands</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Arriving later in 2026, Oceaneers has a really fun sounding idea. It's a survival-crafting adventure in a flooded world of sinking islands. Can't wait to get my hands on this one, really do love the overall style of it.</p>
<p>It's part colony builder, part survival game that really seems unique. Build up a colony, craft your equipment, train up your survivors and then build a raft to go off scavenging across various islands. You might even find some "lost Float-Tech from an old-world corporation", oooh. The limited space you get to actually build up will make things interesting, as will the resource system while you all try to keep your heads above water.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_ykuHNa_xcw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b43b52f2c91db01dcdda4aecd1cffc02.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_ykuHNa_xcw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"After first concepting the idea back in January 2023, it’s exciting to be launching a second PC title on Steam", shared Oceaneers developer James Thomas. "As huge fans of colony sims and crafting survival games, it’s been a fun challenge figuring out how to smoothly integrate story and objectives into these very sandboxy genres while still keeping replayability high. We grew up in the golden age of Sierra and LucasArts games, and we hope players enjoy this extra layer of quirkiness on top of the mechanics they already love."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Control multiple characters in this single player experience.</li>
<li>Design multiple rafts and send survivors on expeditions.</li>
<li>Haul islands back to your colony to expand your island home.</li>
<li>Improve island buoyancy with contraptions that keep islands afloat.</li>
<li>Research and unlock advanced workstations and upgrades.</li>
<li>Survive against weather events, and threats on both land and sea.</li>
<li>Farm crops, prepare rations and cook meals.</li>
<li>Customize your survivor names, traits, hair styles... including beards &amp; mustaches!</li>
<li>Uncover the deep sea storyline plot alongside the survival journey.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Space Dingus is a spiritual sequel to Death Road to Canada</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Death Road to Canada is a lot of fun and so I have great expectations for the next game from Rocketcat Games, which is a spiritual sequel named Space Dingus.</p>
<p>They actually announced it a couple of weeks ago, which I entirely missed due to the overflowing amount of news lately. So I imagine a lot of readers missed it too. I'm always on the lookout for more online co-op games to play with my crew and this could fit the bill. A co-op horror road trip you say? With ship management? And full modding support? Oh I'm in, sounds awesome.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Giving a little detail on what to expect from it they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're going to be keeping a lot of familiar gameplay compared to Death Road, such as the Choose your own Adventure Events, general structure for picking your locations, and giant swarms of enemies. There will also be a lot of differences from Death Road. Here's a short list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Online multiplayer! This was a huge request from Death Road to Canada, now possible with the new engine we built.</li>
<li>Mouse aiming controls! You can see this and the headshot system in the Teaser Trailer.</li>
<li>Between picking locations, you have a big customizable Spaceship as a hub area.</li>
<li>Multiple enemy factions! A few will be the "slow zombie" archetype, and even those will have new twists that set them apart from both Death Road's zombies, and each other.</li>
<li>Goofy, giant swan dives that will get you killed.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the reveal trailer below:</p>

      <title>Splitgate 2 is &#34;going back to beta&#34; with the original shutting down as 1047 Games have layoffs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>1047 Games have announced that Splitgate 2 is going to be reworked, and they're shutting down the original Splitgate. The developers have also announced that due to all this they've made the "incredibly difficult decision to reduce certain roles".</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2918300/view/510712444576860070" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> posted on Steam and Reddit notes how they "launched too early" and that they "bit off more than we could chew" with certain parts of it rushed, along with making a number of "boneheaded mistakes". Mistakes like wearing that utterly<em> <a href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/524753701753210187gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">stupid hat</a></em> on stage, which caused a whole lot of controversy. The insanely expensive micro-transactions certainly didn't help at the start either and perhaps launching as <em>yet-another</em> Battle Royale was a poor choice too.</p>
<p>So now they're "going back to beta" and will be "heads down until early next year" as they rebuild the game to try and pull players back in. They said this includes "reworking progression from the ground up, adding more portals to our maps, simplifying monetization, refocusing on classic game modes you've been asking for, and more".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16732194301753210592gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>It's a tough time to be a game developer, especially so if you're insane enough to launch a multiplayer-only title. You're competing against some of the most-played and most-popular games in history. You have to be nuts. 1047 Games better have a good plan for the next attempt, or it could end up being another expensive mistake and the last one for the studio, there's only so many times you can screw-up.</p>
<p>I'm not holding out hope on this one. That said, I do hope they come back stronger with a decent plan, because the basics of it on paper are good, and the original Splitgate at the start was a lot of fun. It has everything that <em>should</em> make for a good game, they just have to get it all together.</p>

      <title>Extreme sports game Descenders Next has released into Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Descenders Next is a fresh extreme sports game from RageSquid / No More Robots and it shadow-dropped on Steam in Early Access. They must be crazy, with little to no build up, the game just sneakily arrived along with an update to the original Descenders to add in a racing mode.</p>
<p>You have be pretty wildly confident in your game to just release it like this, especially after it was delayed previously. The publisher did send over a key, and it has been running beautifully on Desktop Linux with Proton 9.0-4. It's also rated Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="fE11hzKkErQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cbdd447d2453c818e2b86d047305243d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/fE11hzKkErQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The publisher noted that while it's starting off with snowboarding and mountainboarding their aim is for it to "become the only extreme sports game you'll ever need, slowly but surely adding more and more adrenaline-fueled activities over time". It's a pretty crazy goal to have but I appreciate it, we've needed something to come along to provide just good old-fashioned crazy sports like this that other bigger publishers rarely do.</p>
<p>Much like the original Descenders, it's going to change a lot during Early Access and so true thoughts on it will be reserved for the big 1.0 release which isn't for another two years or so. They told me it "already features as much content as the original Descenders", I can't say if that's true or not as I haven't yet had enough time with it - but there is quite a lot there already.</p>
<p>If you played the original Descenders, you'll know what to expect here. It feels very similar in the actual mechanics of the sports on the controls, which isn't surprising of course since this builds on top of what they created with the original. However, each sport that's included feels just about different enough to make it worth playing through each of them.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px">What they have here currently is a wonderful base package to build upon, one that's already a <em>lot</em> of fun. I really enjoy the way you progress through it! With you picking a sport and then you're given a overworld map with various nodes on it like some sort of roguelike, instead of just a basic level list. Gives a really different feeling.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15271420661753192714gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>You get to pick which way you go, with each node giving a different set of tricks you need to pull off in a new environment. There's no real strategy to what you're picking here, as you don't really know what you're going to get apart from the points on the level steepness, curves and stunts.</p>
<p>You have a limited "health" stat to get through a single run, with each time you bail reducing it by one but successfully pulling off the needed tricks in each node will help you increase it. A really interesting choice for how they keep it feeling different and fresh on each run. Plus there's also the big main areas you can just ride around to pull of some tricks to practice too.</p>
<p>The insane speed you can get on some of the courses really gets your heart pumping, as you attempt another death-defying trick and then face-plant the floor. I think the biggest problem is the speed right now, a lot of the time it feels just a bit <em>too</em> fast, it's as if you have a rocket strapped to you. I think if they reduced the feel of the speed a bit, to give just a little more reaction time or more control on your descent it would be more enjoyable.</p>
<p>So far, a great start with obvious rough edges and plenty of room to grow. A much needed injection into the extreme sports genre.</p>

      <title>Hellraiser game announced with Clive Barker&#39;s Hellraiser: Revival</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The first proper Hellraiser game has just been revealed with Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival. Looks like it will be a good one for fans of classic horror blended with modern game design.</p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Experience a new chapter in the legendary horror series like never before. <em>Clive Barker’s Hellraiser: Revival</em> takes first-person action horror survival to the next level.</p>
<p>Play the story of Aidan, who must use the power of a mysterious puzzle box – the Genesis Configuration – to help his girlfriend Sunny’s escape from the otherworldly hellscape of the Labyrinth.</p>
<p>Wield the powers of the box to survive your bargain with the infamous Pinhead and do battle with the horrific cult devoted to the Cenobites.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="E_4kAp6gsZE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d33d1052dfd3a4936b92cb514c468bbd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/E_4kAp6gsZE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release Clive Barker, creator of the Hellraiser franchise, said: "Working on the first true Hellraiser game has been a venture deep into the recesses of my darkest imaginings. The dedication that Saber and Boss Team Games have shown is nothing short of remarkable. They've immersed themselves in the Hellraiser universe, capturing its essence - the seductive pull of suffering, the beauty within the grotesque - and forged a narrative that invites players to step beyond the threshold. I'm eager for both the curious and the damned to experience this new chapter in the Hellraiser mythos, where every moment balances on the brink of nightmare and revelation".</p>
<p>"Hellraiser is the quintessential horror franchise, and lends itself perfectly to a video game," said Matthew Karch, CEO and co-founder of Saber Interactive. "Saber has had success with horror IPs in the past, and working alongside Clive to create tense gameplay and a new story that delves into the twisted depths of pain and pleasure has been a real treat. We look forward to opening up the gates of hell."</p>
<p>It's also been confirmed that actor Doug Bradley will return to voice Pinhead in the game.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A New Story in Hellraiser's Canon</strong> – Unwittingly kickstart Pinhead’s ritual to unleash greater pain and pleasure than ever before.</li>
<li><strong>Harness the Power of the Box</strong> – Combine the unique, hellish abilities of the Configuration with an arsenal of earthly weapons to inflict bone-breaking, flesh-searing pain - or is it pleasure? - upon masochistic enemies.</li>
<li><strong>Fight Against Unholy Enemies</strong> – Take on hell's wretches, deviants, cultists, and even its most infernal priests in a story-driven horror survival game.</li>
</ul>
<p>Will this be one you're going to be picking up? I'm really surprised we haven't seen something like this before for the Hellraiser universe but it sounds like horror fans are in for a real treat.</p>

      <title>Co-op climbing game PEAK is a truly great time with friends</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PEAK is another in the list of quality co-op chaos games to add to your collection. From Landfall and AGGRO CRAB, it's an online co-op climbing game with some floaty silly physics and currently one of the most popular multiplayer games on Steam.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16959092611753186281gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16959092611753186281gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18557220931753186282gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18557220931753186282gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>We've seen a fair amount of cheap and janky chaotic online co-op games releasing over the last year, and this just might be one of the best. I picked up a personal copy recently to add to my list next to R.E.P.O to play with a few friends, and we've ended up really loving the experience. Good for a somewhat younger audience too (teens+) I would say, as I've also been playing it a fair bit with my own smaller human who has also been thoroughly enjoying it with me.</p>
<p>So what's it all about? Climbing. Obviously. You and friends go and board a plane, which unfortunately crashes leaving you all stranded. So you've got nothing to do but recover some luggage and climb.</p>
<p>But it's also a lot more than that. It's about the power of friendship to help each other laugh and struggle through it because it is a real challenge. To help you climb ever-higher through different biomes, there's lots of items to find in all that luggage scattered across the map. From bottles of water to really stupid items, there's a lot of ways to approach how you're going to attempt to reach the peak.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6850057311753186283gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6850057311753186283gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/866843061753186283gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/866843061753186283gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's different types of luggage to find from standard boxes to open that may have some food, rope, a rope cannon and other items to ancient luggage that will contain all sorts of weird treats.</p>
<p>What's really just generally clever about it is how mechanically simple it actually is as a whole. There's not a lot of gameplay elements to it, but the developers have really maximised what they're doing with it. The generation of the island is also one that will keep it feeling fresh for a long time, as you get an entirely new place to climb every 24 hours.</p>
<p>As you progress you'll also earn badges depending on how far you get, or what you manage to discover. These badges then unlock new cosmetics for you to customise your climber and you can make your character look pretty hilarious with the facial features.</p>
<p>One especially interesting feature that's really core to the gameplay is the stamina bar. If you've played the newer open-world Zelda games, you'll be familiar with it. Climbing reduces your stamina the longer you go, until you eventually fall. However, here it's also combined with the health system into one single bar. This bar fills up with hunger, weight from carrying items, poison, sleepiness and more to reduce your overall stamina. But you can fill it back up with various items you find. So it's a constant tossup between using different items at different times to maximise that stamina.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13464666281753186284gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13464666281753186284gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12710303441753186285gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12710303441753186285gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I mentioned this whole power of friendship thing, which is where the fun really begins. Each of you will have a different amount of max stamina depending on your current status, so all those items will come in use. One with more stamina can climb higher and set down a rope for others, or stand at the top to grab you before you fall. Or, be incredibly unhelpful like me and accidentally push people off — woops.</p>
<p>Even with the hours we've played, I still feel like we're only scratching the surface and the developers keep expanding it too with plans for even more to content to come.</p>
<p>You don't actually <em>need</em> friends to play it though, you can climb through it entirely solo, although it's far more interesting to play with others.</p>
<p>It works great on Desktop Linux with Proton, although the controller support is a bit odd at times. Other than that, one of the easiest recommendations I've ever made. Really entertaining.</p>

<p>The game is going to be presented at the next BitSummit event, so they've gone through and upgraded the demo. If you tried the demo previously, they said there's a lot of new things to discover in it. There's also improved gamepad support, a new photo mode, new cosmetics, new conversations and lots more. Progress will also now carry over to the full game which still does not have a confirmed release date yet.</p>
<p>In the demo you can "Fly at your own pace, trade over 200 items between five different towns, upgrade and customise your airship, discover landmarks, find random events, and much more".</p>

      <title>Dwarf Fortress gets much more powerful modding in the latest update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I can't wait to see what the community cooks up for Dwarf Fortress, with the latest update bringing much more advanced modding capabilities to the game.</p>
<p>While the old way of modding the game will still work, this new way brings a lot more options. The new system uses Lua, with a lot of previously hard-coded options now open for modders to do whatever they like. There's a lot that's open for it including inorganic materials, languages, creatures, interactions, various items, reactions, entities, and plants. The developers said this update also acts as the foundation for the upcoming "procedural magic system which will be added to all modes".</p>
<p>You can see their original video announcing the new modding capabilities from when it went into experimental testing below:</p>

<p>There was also recently another developer update video going over all the work going into the game:</p>

      <title>Valve restores the Steam page for Old School Rally after it got hit with a DMCA</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/old-school-rally-gets-hit-with-a-dmca-and-taken-down-from-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently receiving a DMCA takedown notice</a>, Old School Rally had its Steam store page removed. Valve have now restored it and work on it continues.</p>
<p>In the Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2824660/view/515216044012341117" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> the developer said "We’re happy to share that after a thorough review by Valve's DMCA team, Old School Rally is now back online!" and that "The development team has been hard at work behind the scenes, already replacing two of the affected models, with three more set to return within the next 24 hours. We aim to bring all the missing cars back into the game with entirely new, original models over the next 3–4 weeks, minimizing disruptions to the rally experience".</p>

<p>Nice to see the situation has been resolved. An annoying and messy situation for all involved from the developer to gamers interested in picking it up. </p>

      <title>Build up a shop and make potions in the cute Penny for Your Potion</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Penny for Your Potion looks like a nice one for fans of casual crafting and management, with you running your own shop and brewing potions for customers. It's due to arrive in Early Access with Linux support later this year.</p>
<p>More about it: "Penny for Your Potion is a medieval potion shop management game where you build, maintain and run your own potion shop! Organise your shop, harvest ingredients and brew powerful potions, and you'll be ready to welcome your first customers! Pay attention to what they want, keep them happy, build your reputation and unlock exciting ways to expand. Stay committed to building your shop, and your business will flourish in no time."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Qx1l4HG1dfY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/44ea83a54ced3c62430215fe300147e0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Qx1l4HG1dfY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>An immersive alchemy shop management.</li>
<li>Customising your own shop.</li>
<li>Managing your garden.</li>
<li>Brewing potions for your customers.</li>
<li>Levelling system and skill tree.</li>
<li>Compete against a greedy old fellow shopkeeper.</li>
<li>Intriguing story including the lives of townfolks and heroes.</li>
<li>Soundtrack featuring medieval tunes.</li>
<li>20-30 hours of playtime.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like even though it's entering Early Access, that a lot of it is already complete so they'll be using that extra time to polish it up and ensure it has a proper ending.</p>

      <title>Fallout: Bakersfield looks like an awesome Doom total conversion with a new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Made with GZDoom, a fresh teaser for Fallout: Bakersfield has been released and now I'm excited all over again for it. Previously it had a teaser back in September 2022 which was a brief 55 seconds.</p>
<p>The new trailer is over 4 minutes long and notes it's a "'non-commercial 1993' Doom total conversion (GZDoom WAD)" in the description. The developer also gives special thanks to Dave Oshry, CEO of New Blood Interactive.</p>
<p>Check it out below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6e8WrmOibpM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/acea239ab911715d9e18717f2d2e498d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6e8WrmOibpM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>No word on a release date, as the trailer has a release date bit at the end that quickly flickers from 2027 and 2025 and then flickers about again. So we really have no clue right now. Overall the trailer suggests it's about 60% done, so clearly a while away yet.</p>
<p>Modders will stop at nothing to make the most crazy things in GZDoom and I love it. Should hopefully be easy enough to get it working on Linux thanks to GZDoom's excellent cross-platform support.</p>

      <title>Mycopunk is a seriously bizarre co-op shooter and a new favourite</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pure chaos, that's what Mycopunk is. It's exceptionally bizarre and now my new favourite first-person shooter because it's so wildly unique. <em>Note: key provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>I was already quite <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/fight-off-a-planet-wide-fungal-catastrophe-in-the-upcoming-co-op-shooter-mycopunk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">impressed with the demo</a> and now after playing more, I'm hooked. It's very much a wonderful combination of elements from the likes of Risk of Rain 2 for the ongoing chaos during missions and Deep Rock Galactic for the structure of it only with the weirdness turned up to maximum level.</p>
<p>You pick a character class, and then go solo or team up with others across various different types of missions in various biomes across a planet. Missions can range from simply crushing as many enemies as possible, to building pipes across the map to connect points up and all sorts in between.</p>
<p>The different classes you get are quite fun but it's the enemy variation that really makes this completely nuts. Enemies are constructed of various parts you blow up and they fall apart, but other enemies might pick up their parts and attach it to themselves. </p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cR6nCcCi01g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cb7840d282ef0d12a685a1267b5f5c62.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cR6nCcCi01g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Half the time I don't entirely know exactly what's going on, because it really does just turn into pure explosive chaos. You have enemies appearing from everywhere, and some of them are massive freakish creations that fire all sorts of weapons at you. Some can be destroyed from afar, some need you to get up-close and personal. So it's good you have your own varied arsenal of weapons too.</p>
<p>There's lots of different weapons but you also get a customisation system. As you level up your character and weapons individually, you get access to various upgrade modules. You can place lots of them on your weapons in a no limits grid-based system, so as long as they fit together you can use them. It makes creating a build very unique with each player potentially being very different even when playing as the same class.</p>
<p>Quite funny that downed team mates need you to piece them back together, as you run from their legs to their torso to bring them back into the game. This will happen a lot if you're on my team, because friendly fire is most definitely a thing here. And with all the action going on, it's a bit too easy to annihilate your friends (sorry!).</p>
<p>Fantastic atmosphere too. The visual style in especially odd but in a good way it all fits together, and it definitely leans into the comedy side of things with some of the interactions and voice-over.</p>
<p>Mycopunk works perfectly on Desktop Linux with Proton 9.0-4. Valve also rated it Steam Deck Playable, the only issue being noted is you need to manually bring up the on-screen keyboard.</p>
<p>It's in Early Access so everything is subject to change and more content is to come, but what's there right now is already a huge amount of fun and an easy recommendation from me. A great choice to run around in with a couple of friends.</p>

      <title>Xenopurge has a great concept and a good start for a tense tactical auto-battler</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Xenopurge puts you in the command chair overseeing marines running around various buildings, as you take down the alien threat. <em>Note: a key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>Here you're not running around with them and you don't directly control them. Instead, you watch on your screen as they engage in the mission automatically, with you being able to give out various orders to redirect them. It's a clever and interesting concept, which is clearly inspired by the Aliens film series and the gameplay style is a bit reminiscent of Duskers.</p>
<p>You start off by picking a squad, and the select to go through various missions on a node-based map. A map type you may be familiar with from the likes of FTL and Slay the Spire. Each node being a different type of encounter from exploring and fighting aliens to upgrading your marines.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="jtVVq-V9Vso"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2021ecdbd1c846c80d47bcfe96fb0316.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/jtVVq-V9Vso" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's surprising just how tense it can become as you progress through it. Especially once you got a few upgrades going, you really don't want to watch your marines fall to the aliens. Hearing their remarks over voice comms really brings it all to life. Especially so, since all you can do is watch, issue orders and basically hope for the best. </p>
<p>Personally, I found the gameplay loop quite satisfying but due to the graphical style it clearly won't be for everyone. It's quite simplistic but in a way I still found to be rather engaging. It's funny how quickly I sit up in my chair as soon as a red dot appears while my marines are off exploring.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">With it now in Early Access its journey has only just begun, and I hope to see a lot more from this one. They've said the current focus is on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full Steam Deck Compatibility</li>
<li>Optimisation</li>
<li>Accessibility options and Settings(Screen effects, Resolutions etc)</li>
<li>Keybindings</li>
<li>Steam Cloud Save</li>
</ul>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tactical game with Sci-fi horror / tension: </strong>A tense, squad-based tactical where you’re leading your troops to hunt and exterminate alien threats in the depths of space. Inspired by the likes of Alien &amp; Space Hulk.</li>
<li><strong>Recruit and equip your squadron: </strong>Through the progression of the mission, take the opportunity to recruit new members and equip them to create a team that matches your command style.</li>
<li><strong>Quick, Engaging Sessions – Playable in Short Bursts: </strong>Designed for fast, intense tactical runs, Xenopurge allows players to jump in and complete a mission in around 20 minutes. This makes it easy to pick up and play, whether you have time for a single mission or an extended session.</li>
<li><strong>Accessible Controls: </strong>Designed to be as intuitive and accessible as possible, with the options to use keyboard, controller or mouse input. Remains smooth and responsive with simple, readable UI.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>"Xenopurge is built around the fantasy of being inside a command room — directing missions, adapting to unpredictable dangers, and feeling the weight of every decision," said Michalis Papagathangelou, designer at Traptics. "Our goal is to simulate that experience as closely and accurately as possible. Launching into Early Access allows us to collaborate directly with our community and evolve the game together."</p>
<p>It runs to perfectly on Desktop Linux with Proton 9.0-4.</p>

      <title>Space Drilling Station looks fun for building and automation fans - with a new Steam Deck compatible demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Space Drilling Station has you manage and automate a drilling station on a distant planet. The developer detailed their Steam Deck work with a new demo.</p>
<p>My first time hearing about this one when finding it today. Here you build your station by making very careful use of space with vertical building. Not only are you building up a facility and automating things, but you also need to address the needs of all your people too.</p>
<p>You'll be dealing with assigning roles to all your workers to achieve the best efficiency, keeping an eye on their health and wellbeing and sorting out various production lines through your big tower. Check out the first trailer below:</p>

<p>The developer wrote a Steam <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2134850/announcements/detail/542237641778659375" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> announcing they've managed to get the first playable demo working well even on a Steam Deck, after the developer noted they received one as a gift and dedicated to get it fully working. Part of their work was ensuring the controls for such a game weren't overwhelming, along with sorting out performance issues and making sure text on the smaller screen was readable.</p>
<p>Here's what they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>🎮 Controls: Less Is More!</h4>
<p>At first, I wanted to use all of the Steam Deck's options: trackpads, joysticks, buttons... I thought it was awesome to exploit every possibility. Except, when playing, I quickly realized it was anything but pleasant. My "lazy" side took over, and I got tired of juggling between trackpads and joysticks. So I radically simplified: goodbye trackpads! I streamlined the controls to use only the bare minimum, making the experience much smoother and more intuitive.</p>
<h4>📉 The Performance Wall: Chasing Milliseconds!</h4>
<p>Once the controls were set, I hit the performance wall head-on. I knew my game wasn't an optimization champion, but on the Steam Deck, it was a disaster! I spent a good week tracking every millisecond, juggling parameters to find the right balance between fluidity and visual quality, and most importantly, to avoid draining the battery in less than 30 minutes. A real headache!</p>
<h4>📜 The "Verified" Holy Grail: Valve's Requirements</h4>
<p>Valve has very strict guidelines for the "Verified" badge. I had to face two big challenges: making all text readable from 30 cm away (you almost needed a magnifying glass before!) and removing all mentions of a mouse or keyboard. That meant redoing all the in-game videos and explanations so they were perfectly adapted to the Steam Deck. A huge amount of work!</p>
<h4>🙏 A Month Later, Pride!</h4>
<p>More than a month after receiving my Steam Deck, I'm incredibly proud to have managed to solve all the issues. It's immense satisfaction to see <strong>Space Drilling Station</strong> come to life on this machine.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope you'll enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it compatible. Please don't hesitate to give me your feedback; it's essential for continuing to improve the game!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right onto my personal wishlist it goes.</p>

      <title>Don&#39;t have time for Total War and Crusader Kings? Try the new Bellfortis</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bellfortis is a medieval turn-based strategy game for players who love the genre, but don't have as much time to commit their lives to it.</p>
<p>The developer told me they were directly inspired by the likes of Total War, Centurion, or Crusader Kings 3. Giving you a chance to become a conqueror and build up a new empire, but it won't take you an entire age to finish a game with its faster gameplay. Good for those of you with busy families!</p>
<p>The game features 7 large scenarios, which can be conquered by up to 18 different factions from 9th and 10th century Europe and North Africa. Each campaign can be completed in 2 to 5 hours. In addition to the campaign, you can also play standalone battles, which are scored and timed.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EBo3QjqTwP4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b416257c1cd5a2961ba37d108d739049.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EBo3QjqTwP4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer sent over a key to GamingOnLinux and it appears to work perfectly with Proton 9.0-4, just hit Play in Steam and away you go. Created by developer Rake in Grass, one of the oldest "garage" dev teams from the Czech Republic. They've released more than 20 games across 8 platforms, including the popular Rampage Knights and Jets'n'Guns series.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Build your empire.</li>
<li>Recruit armies and fight exciting battles.</li>
<li>Play as 18 different factions across 7 unique scenarios.</li>
<li>Use politics and intrigue, diplomats and spies.</li>
<li>Face random events that can change the gameplay.</li>
</ul>

      <title>There&#39;s now an unofficial GUI for Lossless Scaling&#39;s Frame Generation on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Keeping up with the excitement about <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/lossless-scalings-frame-generation-for-linux-gets-upgraded-to-the-latest-v3-1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lossless Scaling's Frame Generation on Linux</a> with the lsfg-vk project, there's now an extra unofficial GUI app.</p>
<p>It's quickly getting easier to install and set it all up, with the lsfg-vk project now having a much easier install ready for various Linux distributions too.</p>
<p>We already had a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/lossless-scaling-frame-gen-gets-a-decky-loader-steam-deck-plugin-but-theres-drama/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Decky Loader plugin for Steam Deck</a> to make it easier, although that came with a bit of (now solved) drama attached. And now for Desktop Linux users who want to try it out and don't want to keep diving into a text config file, you can try the new lsfg-vk-ui project.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20631792331753092971gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20631792331753092971gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Check out lsfg-vk-ui on <a href="https://github.com/Caliel666/lsfg-vk-ui" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Give it another month, and the project as a whole will probably be even easier again. Still far from ready for beginners, as you still need to know what you're doing.</p>

      <title>GeForce Infinity is a new app for GeForce NOW on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GeForce Infinity was announced recently as another option for running GeForce NOW on Desktop Linux, since NVIDIA haven't put out an official app.</p>
<p>While NVIDIA do have an official app for Steam Deck, we're currently missing all the extra options and better quality streaming on Desktop Linux. GeForce Infinity is not from NVIDIA directly but made by the community. It's also not the first of its kind, there's also GeForce NOW Electron that's been going for some time.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13793394291753091116gol1.png"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the GitHub the current features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhanced UI</strong>: GeForce Infinity aims to improve the user interface of GeForce NOW, providing a more intuitive and enjoyable experience.</li>
<li><strong>Custom Discord Rich Presence</strong>: Show off your gaming status with personalized Discord Rich Presence. Display game details and status updates directly in your Discord profile.</li>
<li><strong>Instant App Switch</strong>: Automatically switch to GeForce Infinity once your gaming rig is ready for action!</li>
<li><strong>Notifications</strong>: Get notified once your gaming rig is ready for action!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They're also planning to add Discord Rich Presence, account switching and automatic game startup options.</p>
<p>It still has the issues other apps and using GeForce NOW in the browser have, with the options for quality and resolution being limited because NVIDIA don't support a lot of it on Desktop Linux even if you have their highest subscription.</p>

      <title>Steam Beta upgrades the in-game performance monitor for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/steam-gets-a-new-steam-deck-like-performance-monitor-now-in-beta-replacing-the-fps-counter/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Back in June</a>, Valve revealed the new performance monitor for the in-game Steam overlay, and now the Linux version has been upgraded.</p>
<p>Initially, only Windows had all the extra options with Linux stuck with just FPS details. Now we get all the extras too as of the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/545615175941619843?snr=2___" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">July 17th</a> Steam Beta, as long as you have an AMD or NVIDIA GPU. You can select between seeing just FPS value, FPS details, FPS details with CPU and GPU utilisation and then a further option to get everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7456466821753088098gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7456466821753088098gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The screenshot above (click it to enlarge) shows Cyberpunk 2077 on Linux with the new Steam performance monitor (top left), with the most detailed option picked.</p>
<p>While it's good to have options, and this is better than just the FPS value that the in-game overlay had, you can still get far <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-use-mangohud-for-linux-game-performance-monitoring/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">more customization on Linux with MangoHud</a>.</p>
<p>The full changes from the Steam Beta:</p>
<blockquote><strong>General</strong>
<ul>
<li>Added a notification for when a trade is reversed via Trade Protection</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with deleting screenshots from the focused screenshot view briefly showing an error and potentially navigating the user away from their screenshots</li>
<li>Fixed minimum and maximum client window size not updating in some situations.</li>
<li>Fixed friends list window remaining open in Steam overlay when switching between desktop and Big Picture Mode.</li>
<li>Fixed modal dialogs opening behind the window displaying them.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Steam Input</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed gamepad input for browser-based games on Windows</li>
<li>Added support for the PDP REALMz Wireless Controller for Switch</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where editing commands on an input bound to a modeshift could duplicate bindings</li>
<li>No longer open Big Picture Mode on Guide button press when guide button chording is disabled in controller settings</li>
</ul>
<strong>Game Recording</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the player pausing when seeking near the end of a game recording or clip</li>
</ul>
<strong>macOS</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed input on some web views working incorrectly after page loads causing effects like input cursor not displaying and payment dropdown during checkout continuing to have focus after selecting an option.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Linux</strong>
<ul>
<li>Enabled advanced options for the in-game performance overlay for AMD and Nvidia GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare case where the Big Picture update progress UI would disappear.</li>
</ul>

      <title>According to one source Linux hits over 6% desktop user share</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Depending on where you look, Linux on the desktop has somewhere between 4-6% user share on the desktop. Showing it's growing slowly but steadily overall.</p>
<p>A lot of people like to look at Statcounter, which we've covered here at GamingOnLinux quite a few times which currently showings Linux on the desktop at about 4.1% for June 2025 globally. However, there's another pretty big source of data we can use for checking on this – the US government.</p>
<p>Using the US government <a href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">public data</a>, we can see that over the last 30 days the Linux user share hit an all-time high there at 6.1%. Pretty healthy looking percentage there, and if we filter it to the current calendar year overall it's at 5.8%. That's a surprisingly high number, given their data mentions how they've had "1.48 billion sessions in the last 30 days" to pull the data from.</p>
<p>Going back to <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/united-states-of-america" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Statcounter</a> and filtering to the US, it's also showing an all-time high for Linux at 5.1% too. And then there's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our Steam Tracker</a>, showing Linux for gaming has been steadily trending upwards too.</p>
<p>We've all seen the running joke of the "Year of the Linux desktop", and while most celebrations on it are rather premature, we've truly over the last year or two seen quite a seismic shift in how people have been looking at Linux. Not just from data points like these, but the wider consensus when you look at how even bigger influencers have been pouring more time into covering Linux too (and their videos doing well). Look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVI_smLgTY0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">PewDiePie</a> with 110M subscribers telling people to now install Linux, or how about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa8nMiEoti0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">JayzTwoCents</a> too and various others.</p>
<p>Seems like there's never been a better time to try out Linux on the desktop.</p>

      <title>Next-generation brick building sandbox Brickadia is out with Linux / Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>Roblox? LEGO? Who needs it. I'm all about Brickadia life now. Out in Early Access, it's a next-generation mixture of LEGO styled block building, a little of Garry's Mod too perhaps and Roblox style mini-games.</p>
<p>A dynamic sandbox where your imagination is (sometimes) the limit, game features allowing of course. There's already a lot you can do with it too with real-time co-op building all directly in-game with no external editors needed. This includes fully functioning vehicles, a wiring system and big open-world environments.</p>
<p>While I was in the middle of writing this up as I previously spoke to the developer and they provided a key, another email entered the GamingOnLinux inbox today and they certainly knew how to get my attention. With a title starting "*LINUX PLAYERS!*" — okay, you got me.</p>
<p>In the email they noted "Brickadia is fully playable on Steam Deck with great performance, and works nicely on other desktops through Proton. The studio is working on being listed as Verified for the Steam Deck. A Linux dedicated server is also available". True to their word, it works great with Proton 9.0-4 on Desktop Linux.</p>
<p>See, it doesn't take much. While the likes of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/game-over-for-roblox-on-linux-steam-deck-as-its-now-blocked/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Roblox continue to just block Linux platforms</a> along with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">various other games with anti-cheat</a>, perhaps something like Brickadia could eventually take its place. Once it's further along of course, there's a lot of work ahead of it that the developers are aware they need to either fix, improve or expand upon.</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Some highlights the developers noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Unleash Your Creativity: Build absolutely anything you can imagine with a powerful, intuitive building system that handles millions of bricks effortlessly. Any brick can be turned into a physics object using the Selector tool.</li>
<li>Build Together, Live: No need for external editors, everything is done in-game. Modify the world in real-time alongside friends, enabling seamless creative collaboration in multiplayer.</li>
<li>Play Your Way: From high-intensity combat gamemodes to laid-back social servers for building and hanging out, Brickadia supports a wide range of play styles.</li>
<li>Vehicle Creation: Design and build your own cars out of bricks, complete with engines, seats, and a variety of wheels to choose from.</li>
<li>Build Boats and Ships: Construct floating vehicles with buoyancy physics, engine bricks, and seats perfect for exploring or racing on water.</li>
<li>Bring Builds to Life with Wires: Use a powerful wiring system to make your creations interactive. With an easy-to-use wiring tool and a wide range of functional gates and components, complex logic is at your fingertips</li>
<li>Advanced Mechanics: Combine physics joints with wire circuits to build intricate, functional machines using an advanced physics engine.</li>
<li>Explore and Share with the Gallery: Instantly access massive player-made worlds and a huge collection of community-built prefabs through the in-game Gallery.</li>
<li>Dynamic Worlds: A fully customizable environment system lets you control stunning visuals and weather effects, with real volumetric clouds!</li>
<li>Lighting That Pops: Add dynamic lights to bricks to enhance the look and feel of your builds with gorgeous detail.</li>
<li>Immersive Audio: Integrate ambient sounds and custom effects into your creations using versatile audio components.</li>
<li>Next-Gen Visuals: Enjoy breathtaking graphics powered by HDR and ray tracing, making your worlds and creations look better than ever.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It is impressive though. Not only does it look great but it performs well too and I do love how accessible it all is to get going, it's really very inviting. This could end up being a great one for all audiences of all ages. There's some clever tools it gives you too that will no doubt be an absolute dream for LEGO building enthusiasts. Being able to warp blocks in various directions, copy and paste and more — there's so much to like about it.</p>
<p>Early indicators are that players have been enjoying it, with a Very Positive rating on Steam. However, games like this that entirely rely on a community can live and die rather quickly, it's a risky bet for game devs. We've seen lots and lots and lots more fail when they can't keep a player count so it will be interesting to see if they manage to do so. It's a tough world out there in game dev land. I'm hoping for the best on this one.</p>

      <title>Kaizen: A Factory Story is a great return from the Zachtronics team</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Reformed under the new studio Coincidence, the team from Zachtronics have now released Kaizen: A Factory Story with Linux / SteamOS support. It's also rated Steam Deck Playable by Valve. <em>Note: key provided by their PR team.</em></p>
<p>One of my favourite automation games is actually from Zachtronics, where I was completely captivated by Opus Magnum when it released back in 2017. And of course, because it's <s>Zachtronics</s>, uh - Coincidence, it comes complete with another solitaire game but this time with a pachinko theme to it. Nice to see them return to their roots a bit more with this one.</p>
<p>So what is it? Well, you might think you know what to expect from an automation puzzle game like it but it will surprise you a bit. Especially the visual novel styled intro, where you have to do a little musical rhythm game that I failed <em>miserably</em> at but it didn't seem to cause any problems. I just wasn't prepared for mashing a few keys like it when going in. You got me there, Coincidence. </p>
<p>For the main part of the game once you get into it your goal is to design production lines to create specific products. You get given a bunch of parts, and then it's up to you how they all fit together to make whatever retro product it is that you're tasked with. What you do is drag and drop pieces of the product around, and then the parts of the factory machines you're going to use onto a board, do a little simple code-block programming and see if it all comes together.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2450833791752840064gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2450833791752840064gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>If it doesn't, move all the pieces around until it will. Using a mixture of welders, arms that push things around and more eventually you'll have lots of moving parts that becomes a joy to watch.</p>
<p>In between you get more little visual novel bits diving into the expanding story of how you, David, were really not meant to be building things in a factory.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Ib8YhZSgb_s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9ee58aa00b0af3a26f62c3679835bebb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Ib8YhZSgb_s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Compared with other similar games from the developers formerly at Zachtronics, it feels a lot less complicated. It's much more inviting and feels a lot more like you're slotting puzzle pieces together with a little automation flair. Still quite puzzling at times though, a few of them really left me scratching my head for a while. The inviting nature of it can certainly hide the challenge.</p>
<p>If you like the sound of some puzzling automation wrapped up in a retro 1980s Japanese theme, it's one for you. It's not perfect though, as story-telling clearly still isn't a strong point for the developers with nothing about the story and dialogue being at all interesting or noteworthy, it's just kind of…there. It breaks up the building a little, but that's exactly why we're all here. Other than that, it still makes me feel like a tiny genius when I solve the later levels so i did really enjoy it.</p>

      <title>If you love Brotato you should check out Noobs Are Coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Noobs Are Coming is a new release that takes the skin of Brotato and puts you in the shoes of a final boss, complete with really weird abilities. <em>Note: key provided by the developer.</em></p>
<p>The developer said they were directly inspired by Brotato and The Binding of Isaac, which you can tell within a few seconds based on the gameplay and some of the visual style. It's an arena-based top-down rogue-lite shooter, where you pick a boss and go through rounds where you get more and more powerful. </p>
<p>You likely already know the drill for these games but if not — you pick a character and some abilities, then run around a small arena fighting off waves of enemies while collecting experience points from little orbs they drop. In between waves you spend orbs to add new weapons to your arsenal, or upgrade existing weapons and add buffs to your character ready to go through the next more challenging wave.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="159Mh6z_YY0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e21a6eec8bd11c502431acc068381669.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/159Mh6z_YY0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Currently in Early Access so it's not a finished game but what it has is good fun though, with lots of weird combinations to try out for all the characters. They're all so different which is nice, with their play-style being thoroughly unique between them on what you can pick to begin with and how you can power up during a run. Like the boss that starts with a mini-me attached to you via an umbilical cord that you can keep upgrading, or the ability to repeatedly plant an angry tomato you need to run over to water and then they will spring up and dash at enemies. It can be pretty funny in a completely ridiculous way.</p>
<p>I'm keen to see how it will evolve during Early Access, as I think it still needs to pull itself apart from the Brotato roots just a little bit more.</p>
<p>Quite an early hit too with it selling over 5,000 copies in a single day. Not a lot for bigger developers but pretty great for a tiny indie with no real marketing behind it. </p>
<p>The developer mentioned they plan to add "more content, such as new playable characters, weapons, items, enemies" and they're looking into "expanding playstyle variety to deepen build options and synergies".</p>
<p>If you love fast-paced arena fights with auto-shooting like Brotato, Vampire Survivors and the like you'll probably get on quite well with this. The Native Linux version tested runs well, although the Steam Overlay didn't work with it for me.</p>

      <title>Handmade stop-motion digging adventure Mashina arrives July 31</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From the team that made Judero, the handmade stop-motion digging adventure Mashina is set to arrive on July 31st.</p>
<p>I really love what they're doing with the art in their games, there's truly not many at all that will go to these lengths to make their games stand out in this way. Every single thing in the game is made out of various materials and animated using traditional stop-motion techniques. The gameplay looks just a weird and wacky as the art-style.</p>
<p>You play as Mashina, a friendly mining robot tasked with finding minerals to help mend, build and nurture her quirky robot community. The gameplay in Mashina is divided into two distinct sections; a deep, mysterious underground full of trinkets and minerals and a vibrant, fully explorable 3d overground.</p>
<p>Check it out below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="XH2zSrOoMgY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3bd3f888daf4b94d21b4a3612758938d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/XH2zSrOoMgY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Traditional Stop-Motion Animation:</strong> Everything in Mashina is handmade out of various materials and animated using traditional stop-motion techniques.</li>
<li><strong>Digging / Mining:</strong> An entire under world to explore and dig around! Dig by hand, use your radar to find precious items and work your way up to a fully automated process with tools and inventions you find along the way!</li>
<li><strong>Inventory Management:</strong> Digging up minerals, trinkets and treasures takes up a lot of space! Make sure you manage your inventory to maximize your time in the under world.</li>
<li><strong>Secret Items and Unlockables:</strong> Excavate rare minerals, find items that help you unlock new inventions and friends that will join you and help you on your adventure!</li>
<li><strong>Equipment Upgrades:</strong> Upgrade your digging and mining equipment to maximize your under world operation!</li>
<li><strong>Exploration and Base Building:</strong> Take the items you find in the under world above ground! Friends around your island help you in all sorts of ways!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Their previous game Judero is Steam Deck Verified and Platinum on ProtonDB, no doubt this will work well too.</p>

      <title>2.5D turn-based strategy game Avante! Atlantis gives off Advance Wars vibes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Avante! Atlantis is an upcoming turn-based strategy game that looks like you're playing a board game with a clever 2.5D style. The developer recently announced full Native Linux and Steam Deck support. There's a demo available right now too which they keep updating for you to get an early taste of what's to come.</p>
<p>More about it: "Amid global conflict and scarce resources, the lost city of Atlantis has mysteriously resurfaced. Rich in natural resources, it quickly becomes the focus of every major nation’s ambitions. But Atlantis didn’t return by chance. As battles rage across its ruins, a deeper mystery begins to unfold...one that could reshape the world."</p>
<p>Getting some Advance Wars vibes from this one for the mixture of the level and battle scene style, but at least unlike other very similar games to Advance Wars, the overall aesthetic is more unique.</p>
<p>Check out their original trailer below:</p>

<li>Many ways to Play!: Battle solo or compete with friends in exciting matches! Play locally or over LAN for an intense and thrilling experience. Up to 4 Players in a match!</li>
<li>Board Game Experience: Roll the dice for victory! Each roll can slightly boost or reduce your unit’s base power, adding a small layer of unpredictability to your strategy.</li>

      <title>City-building on the back of a giant creature, The Wandering Village 1.0 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Wandering Village from Stray Fawn Studio is a really unique city-builder that takes place on the back of a giant moving creature. It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified / SteamOS Compatible.</p>
<p>It's unlike any other village / city-builder I've played due to the way the game progresses, with you going through different locations with events. A really great idea and visually pleasing too. Nice to see it fully release now with a lot of content enhancements since the initial Early Access release. </p>
<p>As usual for a lot of games now, the 1.0 release is not the end of the road. They're working on addressing feedback and a 1.1 "Quality of Life &amp; UX update" is planned, along with a further 1.2 update to expand the interactions and relationship you have with the giant creature named Onbu.</p>
<p>For the 1.0 release they made a sweet animated trailer:</p>

      <title>Old School Rally gets hit with a DMCA and taken down from Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Showing just how tough game dev can be for smaller teams and solo devs, Old School Rally has been hit with a DMCA and the Steam store page is gone. This is hopefully only a temporary situation, while the developer of the game works through the issue.</p>
<p>Writing in a Steam <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2824660/discussions/0/590651049589629945/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">forum post</a> the developer noted how they sourced certain car models from Sketchfab, a website where people can share and buy 3D models. The game developer said they spoke to the original uploader to verify approval for use in the game. All of that was agreed, so the game developer continued using the models and released the game with them. Unfortunately, a week ago the game developer received a claim of ownership over the car models from someone else. The original uploader of the car models maintained they own them, and the game developer reached out to the claimant to explore solutions. Sadly, "on Monday Old School Rally was abruptly issued with a DMCA takedown notice, prompting Steam to temporarily remove the game from the store as per their policies (which is standard practice)".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="62T8hbNBXfo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fdb06debb31eecbe3832d3f42dc0fe46.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/62T8hbNBXfo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>So for now the game store page is just gone. The game developer is planning to update the game to lock the models and note they will return, as they're working on "all-original car model designs that still show resemblances to the classic legendary rally cars that we all love as replacements in waves".</p>
<p>What a sticky situation. Dev grabs models with the author's permission, and it turns out they might not actually own those models. Just goes to show how difficult it can be for game devs sourcing art from elsewhere. And, with the rise of AI generation, that might only get more troublesome.</p>

      <title>Cyberpunk 2077 2.3 is out with new vehicles, auto drive, AMD FSR 4, Intel XeSS 2 and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>CD PROJEKT RED have released the latest major free update for Cyberpunk 2077 today, bringing with it new content and graphics enhancements. It's quite a big one too, with a lot more than I expected them to add in after the last update. Nice to see them still continue to expand it though.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qPcPBaWhny4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/64a924f4b2cf93127f147f1ca37d22cc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qPcPBaWhny4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The full changelog:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Vehicles</h4>
<ul>
<li>Added 4 new vehicles, including several Side Jobs tied to acquiring them:
	<ul>
<li><strong>Yaiba ARV-Q340 Semimaru</strong> Reward from a new side job (to unlock, complete The Hunt and The Beast In Me). An additional side job unlocks the CrystalCoat™ feature for it.</li>
<li><strong>Rayfield Caliburn "Mordred"</strong> Reward from a new side job (to unlock, complete The Beast in Me: Badlands, The Beast in Me: Santo Domingo, Transmission, and Search and Destroy)."</li>
<li><strong>Yaiba ASM-R250 Muramasa</strong> Reward from a new side job (to unlock, purchase 1 Yaiba vehicle, purchase at least 3 vehicles through AUTOFIXER, and complete Reported Crime: You Play with Fire...). If you fail the side job, the vehicle can later be purchased through AUTOFIXER.</li>
<li><strong>Chevillon Legatus 450 Aquila</strong> Available for purchase on AUTOFIXER.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Introducing AutoDrive! This cutting-edge, autonomous driving feature will take you to your chosen destination (i.e. job objective or placed pin on the map). If you have no set destination, it will take you on a leisurely ride through the streets of Night City. Simply hop in any of your vehicles, make sure you're on a road, and hold H (PC) / Left Stick (consoles) to activate. This feature is disabled when you enter combat or when your vehicle is heavily damaged.</li>
<li>Implemented Cinematic Camera for AutoDrive. Hold Q (PC) / D-Pad Right (consoles) to activate. Sit back and enjoy cinematic views of Night City as you cruise toward your destination.</li>

<li>Rayfield's CrystalCoat™ is now available for vehicles from partner brands, including motorcycles. Additionally, the infamous hacker known as Cosmetic_Troll exploited a vulnerability and created a cracked version of Rayfield's CrystalCoat™ technology for lower-end vehicles. Please note, however, that some models do not support the technology, such as heavily modded nomad vehicles and job-related vehicles.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where unique color schemes did not work properly on the Mizutani Shion MZ1 and MZ2.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where unique color scheme could not be applied properly to the Villefort Deleon "Vindicator".</li>

      <title>NVIDIA 570.172.08 released for Linux as the main stable driver</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA are continuing to make us guess what's included in their updates with the NVIDIA driver <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/details/249205/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">570.172.08</a> release today.</p>
<p>This is part of their Recommended/Certified driver series, their main stable series that updates a bit slower with new features compared with the New Feature Branch. Much like NVIDIA did with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/nvidia-stable-driver-575-64-03-released/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent driver 575.64.03 release</a>, they're being rather vague as they channel mobile app store changelog energy with this.</p>
<p>The entire changelog is:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Minor bug fixes and improvements</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep. And unlike the 575.64.03 release, they haven't stealthily added RTX 5050 support to it as that's not currently listed in the supported products for this driver.</p>
<p>At this point I can only speculate, as it's not even listed yet on the NVIDIA open-gpu-kernel-modules GitHub to sleuth through. Perhaps we <em>might</em> see some more security issues get revealed in a few weeks / month, which would make some sense on why they're being repeatedly vague with these latest two driver updates as to not give anything away but get people updated and prepared. Potentially related to <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5671" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Rowhammer</a> that they recently put up a security bulletin on. It could also be nothing of the sort - we just don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Update at 16:50 UTC</strong> - now that it's actually up on the open-gpu-kernel-modules GitHub, we <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/commit/4d6c416e7fd20dba9b24e6b1d352284473af7812" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">can see</a> they did in fact tag RTX 5050 as supported with this release, despite the models missing from the driver update page.</p>
<p><em>I've emailed NVIDIA this time to see if we can get some clearer details.</em></p>

      <title>Extreme sports game Descenders Next is Steam Deck Verified ahead of release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Extreme sports game Descenders Next is set to arrive sometime soon, and they've ensured it works well on Steam Deck as it's Verified ahead of release. They're not giving the release date out for Early Access yet, but the publisher has already sent a key for GamingOnLinux testing.</p>
<p>More about it: "It's time to conquer the world of extreme sports. This is Descenders Next. Grab your snowboard and tackle the steep, snowy slopes, or tear up the harsh, lush terrain with your mountainboard! Feel like taking on the challenge with a squad? Match up with your friends and Descenders players all around the world, and take on the tracks together! The mountain is calling - will you master it?"</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3155816311752758559gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Sharing the Steam Deck news in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2375530/view/535481986904490066" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they said "One of the main things we wanted to make sure is that Descenders Next runs great on Steam Deck, so we're super glad we can give you the ultimate experience!". The status isn't live yet, but developers do get notified before the Steam Deck notice goes live.</p>
<p>It was originally due to launch April 9th, but it was delayed in March to give it a little more time to cook. During Early Access they plan to add in more sports, more game modes - more everything.</p>
<p>They have more news to come on Descenders Day, July 21st.</p>

      <title>Impressive free and open source RTS 0 A.D. gets an essential patch update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>0 A.D. is a free and open source RTS game that saw a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/open-source-rts-0-a-d-alpha-27-released-bringing-a-new-vulkan-renderer-new-maps-amd-fsr-and-lots-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">first release in years back in January</a>, now an important bug fix patch is out now. This aims to clean up the most pressing issues, as part of their new workflow to get releases out much quicker.</p>
<p>The game has often been compared to the likes of Age of Empires, actually starting life as a concept mod for Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings. It's a full free standalone strategy game like the classics.</p>
<p>See the previous update trailer for some footage on it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3MhcRPm7Zhg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6c87fd27136abb6533f05e58d5d13c35.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3MhcRPm7Zhg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here are the changes included in A27.1:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A fix for the large performance issue observed by some players on older hardware.</li>
<li>Several small performance improvements in the calculation of simulation hashes (related to multiplayer stuttering).</li>
<li>Fixed support of Windows 7.</li>
<li>A fix for modifying your lobby password when you have an uppercase letter in your username.</li>
<li>A fix for the distorted 3D models with GPU Skinning.</li>
<li>Fixes for crashes with Vulkan and/or with GPU Skinning.</li>
<li>A fix for changing player perspective in replays.</li>

      <title>felix86 emulator for Linux for x86 and x86-64 apps on RISC-V can now run Steam and major games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You can now play some major games on RISC-V systems running Linux, thanks to the felix86 emulator that's really coming along. <em>I covered the felix86 project initially <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/felix86-is-a-new-open-source-linux-emulator-to-run-x86-64-linux-programs-on-risc-v-processors/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here on GamingOnLinux back in May</a>.</em></p>
<p>With RISC-V slowly and steadily growing in the background, it's great to see projects like this for gaming on more hardware. One of the developers emailed in to note they've "made quite a bit of progress since May" and that "Now, felix86 can run Windows titles like Crysis and Witcher 3 on RISC-V". Additionally, "we even got the Linux Steam client working, which means games that have Steam DRM can be played on RISC-V with felix86".</p>
<p>They sent along a screenshot of Steam running on their RISC-V board too:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14847659061752748516gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14847659061752748516gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>The latest release from June 30th implemented a lot of what was missing to get to this stage, which they covered in a fresh <a href="https://felix86.com/AAA-Games/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Amazing work by all the developers involved.</p>

      <title>Make-A-Wish UK launches the Wish 200 Week Charity Sale</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Help make some dreams come true for critically ill children in the Wish 200 Week Charity Sale that's now live on Steam.</p>
<p>During this event a bunch of games are going on sale, with each game donating a percentage of sales to Make-A-Wish UK. Your chance to grab some new games and feel good about it at the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19443750341752748038gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>From the press release, Jason Suckley, Chief Executive of Make-A-Wish UK says: ​ </p>
<p>"We’re thrilled to see the Wish 200 Week campaign return in 2025 for its fifth year. One of the highlights is the Make-A-Wish UK Charity Sale, which will directly support in helping to make more life-changing wishes come true. </p>
<p>For many critically ill children, gaming is a lifeline. It provides a social outlet during long treatment cycles when they can’t attend school or clubs with friends; it offers respite and distraction from daily challenges, and it opens the door to a welcoming community where they can be themselves again. </p>
<p>Thanks to the incredible generosity of our supporters, we hope to raise vital funds that will bring hope, joy, and strength to even more children when they need it most.  </p>
<p>We’re incredibly grateful to everyone who has helped make this charity sale a reality. Thank you."</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/45565804/sale/Wish200WeekCharitySale" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">full charity sale on Steam</a>. It runs through July 20th.</p>

      <title>Battlesmiths: Blade &amp; Forge announced Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Battlesmiths: Blade &amp; Forge is a tactical RPG where every piece of gear is forged by you, and there's also some town-building involved too.</p>
<p>Sounds like a really fun mixture of genres here and it's nice to see the developer getting dedicated Steam Deck testing in early. As they said in their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2583940/view/527600687561834544" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> the game is a while away but "Our testing shows great results with launching and playing Battlesmiths on Steam Deck (in fact, some of our developers now prefer it to any other platform)".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="N7NIzg1azVs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8249d912549e25f9f1c07a7a44fa11c4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/N7NIzg1azVs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Additionally they said "We can safely say that Battlesmiths is already fully playable on Steam Deck via the already available touch screen control options and will be compatible with Steam Deck upon Steam release".</p>
<p>More about it (from Steam):</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Crafting that matters</h4>
<p>In <em>Battlesmiths</em>, gear isn’t loot — it’s the result of your labor.<br/>
Weapons and armor are crafted by you and directly affect how your heroes look and fight. Add runes to weapons for powerful abilities. Enchant armor to customize your squad. Customize the appearances of every hero the way you like.</p>
<h4>Rebuild a broken town</h4>
<p>Upgrade blacksmiths, alchemists, miners and more. Each building adds new systems, from resource production to advanced gear recipes. Your town is the heart of your progress.</p>
<h4>Tactical, squad-based combat</h4>
<p>Command a team of up to four heroes in strategic semi-auto battles.<br/>
Choose gear carefully: classes are defined by weapon types, and every loadout impacts movement, damage, and attack speed.</p>
<h4>Multiple game modes</h4>
<p>Whether you love PvE or PvP, there’s always something to conquer:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Campaign</strong>: story-driven solo missions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Arena</strong>: fight other players and prove you're the best</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Labyrinth</strong>: test your build in a brutal survival mode</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tower of Trials</strong>: scaling challenges with high rewards</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clan boss</strong>: cooperate to bring down a massive foe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adventure</strong>: limited-time missions and side quests</p>
</li>
</ul>

      <title>8BitDo Pro 3 Bluetooth announced with swappable magnetic ABXY</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I don't need another controller, at this point I have 7 but another couldn't hurt right? The 8BitDo Pro 3 Bluetooth with swappable magnetic ABXY looks lovely.</p>
<p>Compatible with SteamOS / Steam Deck too, with 8BitDo saying "all of its inputs have been optimized to fully work with Steam". This has me quite excited actually. It's a fully featured controller too with a charging dock, 2.4G wireless in addition to Bluetooth, Hall Effect Triggers &amp; Mode Switching, TMR Joysticks and of course there's the fancy magnetic ABXY so you can play it in the standard or Nintendo layout.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2828702481752745040gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2828702481752745040gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>It also has extra remappable Fast Bumpers (R4 and L4 buttons) that doesn't require any software, a refined D-pad, back buttons and wear resistant joystick rings. Sounds like an excellent update over the Pro 2 Bluetooth.</p>
<p>Currently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/the-8bitdo-ultimate-2-wireless-controller-is-a-top-premium-feeling-controller/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Wireless is my all-time favourite</a> controller but I do love the look of this.</p>
<p>It will release August 12, 2025 for the US at $69.99, but no exact date for the UK or EU yet.</p>

      <title>Umamusume: Pretty Derby now Steam Deck Playable / SteamOS Compatible and works on Desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another game with anti-cheat that released on Steam recently is Umamusume: Pretty Derby. Valve just rated it Steam Deck Playable / SteamOS Compatible.</p>
<p>What is it? This Anime gacha game is all about magical girl horse racing. You recruit various characters for your team, get them training and compete in races. In between there's lots of visual-novel style animated chatter, with plenty of voice acting too. It's a thoroughly weird concept but as an Anime fan, I've seen a <em>lot</em> stranger than this. It also looks surprisingly…good?</p>
<p>Clearly popular too with a peak player count of 48,266 in the last 24 hours and a Very Positive rating on Steam.</p>
<p>It uses "CrackProof" kernel-level anti-cheat so it's pleasing to see the developer Cygames, Inc. has enabled it for Linux platforms. Valve tested it with the latest stable <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-4</a> for their verification and the only thing holding it back from being Verified according to Valve is that some text can be a bit small on the Steam Deck screen.</p>
<p>As usual for GamingOnLinux, I like to first-hand verify everything I possibly can that I report on. And despite complete information <em>overload</em> when going through all the tutorials, it works with no problems on Steam Deck.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17297084901752673458gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17297084901752673458gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19221286731752673459gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19221286731752673459gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>

<p>Testing it myself also on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 25.04) with Proton 9.0-4, it also worked completely out of the box. No launch options needed, no changes to the Proton version. Just completely click and play with the defaults which is really great to see.</p>

<p>Just be aware if you decide to try it that once it's downloaded and launched, it then needs to do an additional in-game download before you can actually play it.</p>
<p>See the original release trailer below:</p>

<p>Even if this style of game is not your personal go-to, it's important to see as many of these working as possible. It only takes one or two games not working to prevent someone being comfortable using Linux, SteamOS / Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Nice to see more games with anti-cheat get enabled like this along with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/lost-ark-from-amazon-games-appears-to-have-enabled-the-anti-cheat-for-linux-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lost Ark</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/wuthering-waves-now-steam-deck-playable-and-works-on-desktop-linux-with-one-tweak/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wuthering Waves</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/blue-archive-from-nexon-arrives-on-steam-and-works-on-linux-steamos-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Blue Archive</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/the-finals-is-getting-new-kernel-based-anti-cheat-likely-to-break-it-on-linux-steamos-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Finals</a> getting confirmed to continue support.

      <title>Silence of the Siren renames to Heroes of Science and Fiction to pull in more HoMM fans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Heroes of Science and Fiction is the new name for Silence of the Siren from Oxymoron Games, as they try to pull in more fans of Heroes of Might and Magic. <em>The name change came along with a major update to the game.</em></p>
<p>What is it? A turn-based strategy game where several different space-faring civilisations fight over control of a distant star system. Explore what's left on the planets and secure resources to build mighty cities. Raise powerful armies and defeat your opponents on the battlefield. Overall, it's a pretty great take on modernised HoMM-styled strategy and it has a Very Positive rating from players on Steam.</p>
<p>Explaining why they changed the name they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To address the elephant in the room first though, your eyes are not misleading you - after carefully considering this step for months, we decided to change the name of the game from Silence of the Siren to the long-term working title, Heroes of Science and Fiction. You're no doubt curious why, so here are the main reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It was really easy to mix up the name with other games in the genre, and we saw too many cases of for example Youtubers struggling to remember the name.</li>
<li>The new name should make it much more obvious to HoMM fans that this game is in the same genre as the beloved classic, which is really important when players see it on any list on Steam and decide whether to have a closer look.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The new update includes a full Map Editor, Steam Workshop integration and quite a lot of new content. There's a whole new planet with a 6-phase day-night cycle, 7 new maps, new neutral units, a Beta version of a map generator and various smaller changes.</p>
<p>A new mini trailer was released to highlight the features in the update:</p>

      <title>Lost Ark from Amazon Games appears to have enabled the anti-cheat for Linux / SteamOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lost Ark is a free to play MMO from Smilegate RPG and Amazon Games that was previously blocked on Linux platforms like SteamOS / Steam Deck but now works.</p>
<p>Originally launched February 2022, there's been one or two times in the past where the anti-cheat very briefly let people in and then continued blocking shortly after. But not it appears it might actually be here to stay. The developer did not make any announcement on this I can find anywhere, but their Easy Anti-Cheat system appears to have been enabled for at least a full two weeks now.</p>

<em>Pictured - Lost Ark on Kubuntu 25.04</em></p>
<p>Using the current main stable <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-4</a>, the game was completely click and play for me. Nothing special needed, no launch options — it just worked. Nice to see another online game working on Linux platforms! Shame it took so long on this one.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated Linux anti-cheat compatibility page</a> has been updated.</p>

      <title>Avowed from Obsidian and Xbox now Steam Deck Verified with Update 1.5</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Avowed from Obsidian Entertainment / Xbox Game Studios is now fully Steam Deck Verified with the big new 1.5 update.</p>
<p>You have to hand it to games published by Xbox Game Studios (Microsoft), they've been some of the most open AAA games that have ensured they work well on Linux platforms with Proton like SteamOS. Along with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/gears-of-war-reloaded-is-officially-steam-deck-verified-and-steamos-compatible/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">enabling anti-cheat</a> in their games too where <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">many other publishers do not</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1660988641752660953gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Nice how being Steam Deck Verified is right at the top of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2457220/view/510711823303967381" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">list</a> of changes. Not just that though the update adds in new abilities and passives for the Ranger and Fighter, new items, there's an update to enemy combat behaviour, TAA will now actually be off if upscaling is off, there's a new 40FPS limit option (likely for Steam Deck), custom map markers were added in lots more.</p>

      <title>Blender 4.5 LTS arrives with Vulkan fully supported and lots of performance improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A big day in Blender land with the arrival of Blender 4.5 LTS, finally bringing Vulkan up to full supported status with it matching OpenGL. This will ensure Blender can continue building up advanced graphical features with good performance.</p>
<p>Blender is easily one of the most important open source projects out there, and it's great to see more and more game devs pick it up. Along with other industries. In case you missed it the Blender Studio team recently released <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/dogwalk-is-a-free-casual-game-from-the-blender-studio-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DOGWALK made with Godot</a>.</p>
<p>There's absolutely masses of new features, and plenty of features were tweaked to improve their performance for this release too. So the app should start up faster and remains smoother. A lot of UI work again went into this release to polish it up, make it more intuitive and accessible.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wPhA0imjvVs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0b58e666bb974a42c664f898a2df05ae.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wPhA0imjvVs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Specifically on Linux they also added large cursors for hi-DPI monitors and support for the Hyper modifier key.</p>
<p>Check out all the changes on the <a href="https://www.blender.org/download/releases/4-5/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Blender website</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam adds Trade Protected Items starting with Counter-Strike 2, along with a bit of Half-Life fan trolling</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Counter-Strike 2 has begun a new season, and Valve added a new feature called Trade Protected Items and they're poking fun at Half-Life fans too.</p>
<p>Firstly the funny bit. This is <a href="https://www.counter-strike.net/newsentry/529852487375519751" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Season 3 of Counter-Strike 2</a>, and we all know the joke about how Valve "can't count to 3" right? How Half-Life 3 is this mythical beast that will never arrive. And, even if / when Valve do a new Half-Life many expect it not to be called Half-Life 3 just to avoid it. Well, Valve called Season 3 of Counter-Strike 2 "Season Two: Episode One" just to rub it in that little bit more.</p>
<p>A nice bit of self-awareness. Amusing.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3846304721752659117gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>A new feature has also been added to Steam starting with Counter-Strike 2 called Trade Protected Items. Allowing you to reverse all CS2 trades from the last 7 days, which could help in the unlikely event you lose control of your Steam account or were the target of a scam.

      <title>Valve gets pressured by payment processors with a new rule for game devs and various adult games removed</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 17/07/25 21:44 UTC</strong> - Valve press replied to GamingOnLinux with this statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We were recently notified that certain games on Steam may violate the rules and standards set forth by our payment processors and their related card networks and banks. As a result, we are retiring those games from being sold on the Steam Store, because loss of payment methods would prevent customers from being able to purchase other titles and game content on Steam.</p>
<p>We are directly notifying developers of these games, and issuing app credits should they have another game they’d like to distribute on Steam in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>Valve have added a new rule to the Onboarding guide for game developers, noting that payment processors get a say in what stays on Steam.</p>
<p>Recently, a number of people noticed and posted across various Reddits that PayPal has been unavailable for days, so it's possible this is all coming from PayPal but nothing has been confirmed on that.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steamworks</a> the new rule is noted under the "What you shouldn’t publish on Steam" heading:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Content that may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam’s payment processors and related card networks and banks, or internet network providers. In particular, certain kinds of adult only content.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>SteamDB noticed this, and also noted in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/steamdb.info/post/3lu32vdlsmg27" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> thread how numerous incest games had been removed:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8499127041752665425gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>That's a very specific type of game removal but could only be the beginning of a wider crackdown on the types of adult content allowed on Steam.</p>
<p>Valve certainly aren't the first to have this happen. Patreon has also seen issues with payment processors like PayPal in the past with adult content. So, it's not really a surprise that this has happened, the surprise to me is that payment processors haven't come down on Valve sooner for all these types of games because they really don't like their services being used for it. It's not like Valve have a choice in this either, they could fight it but it would probably be a lot more costly than it's worth to them.</p>
<p>I've asked Valve to provide a comment and will update if they reply but it's unlikely they will in cases like this.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this?</p>

      <title>The upcoming skate. from EA will be unsupported on Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck due to anti-cheat</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>skate. is an upcoming next-generation skateboarding game and it's now confirmed it will not support Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck due to anti-cheat.</p>
<p>This should perhaps be no surprise since it's an EA (Electronic Arts) published title. They've been gradually moving over older games to their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/ea-rebrand-and-refresh-their-anti-cheat-into-ea-javelin-anticheat-still-blocks-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">newer EA Javelin Anticheat</a> that completely blocks Linux platforms. Plus, how they also <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/ea-respawn-now-block-apex-legends-from-running-on-linux-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blocked Apex Legends too</a> which uses Easy Anti-Cheat. And with skate. being an online game with no offline mode, it was a given that it would have anti-cheat and now it's fully confirmed.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7495807271752616244gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - skate., credit: EA</em></p>
<p>In the latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3354750/view/636812613495292422" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update post</a> on Steam, these two key FAQ points should be noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How will we make sure players have all the appropriate safety/privacy controls? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>At EA and Full Circle, we believe in the power of Positive Play. In skate, we want to ensure everyone has a great time, but if something goes sideways, it’s important to empower players to let us know quickly. We have EA Javelin anti-cheat monitoring for any unfair gameplay issues and in-game reporting for other issues like griefing. There are also numerous privacy options (blocking teleporting, spectating, and disabling the ability of others to move your Build Kit items).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Will skate. be available for Mac OS, Steam OS, Proton/Linux systems (handle held PCs like the Steam Deck) for Early Access? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We want to bring skate. to as many platforms as possible and will continue to listen to feedback and look at the feasibility of adding new platforms in the future, but for Early Access launch, MacOS, SteamOS, Proton/Linux will not be supported.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I really do hope Valve keep pushing SteamOS <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/steamos-moving-from-steam-deck-to-more-handhelds-gives-me-hope-for-better-anti-cheat-compatibility/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">so this anti-cheat problem can eventually be solved</a> as I wrote about before here on GamingOnLinux. It's such a thorn in the side of Linux gaming, one of the last true major hurdles for it to overcome.</p>
<p>At this point, it's also worth reminding people that any upcoming Windows kernel changes will mean nothing for Linux / SteamOS gaming. I wrote about it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/microsoft-windows-kernel-changes-dont-suddenly-mean-big-things-for-linux-gaming/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here on GamingOnLinux back in September 2024</a> due to various clickbait articles elsewhere. It's come up <em>again</em> recently due to another Microsoft <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2025/06/26/the-windows-resiliency-initiative-building-resilience-for-a-future-ready-enterprise/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>, which talks about new security solutions that work outside of the kernel (for people who don't read it - developers "can" use it, they're not being forced), but everything I wrote before remains the same. If developers want to block Linux, they will continue to do so.</p>

      <title>Popular free online shooter STRAFTAT just got a big content expansion with 4 player support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>STRAFTAT is a free to play arena shooter that's quite popular, and it just had a big content expansion with support for 4 players. It has a Native Linux version too.</p>
<p>Originally a 1v1 frag-fest, it now supports teams along with free for all up to 4 players total. This can be a mixture of 2v2, 1v2, 1v3 and so on. While there's a lot of online shooters, STRAFTAT sets itself apart from the back-to-basics arena gameplay with each round being a completely different environment with a different set of weapons. It's complete chaos in the best of ways.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-F7PsHqJh_4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6d8ab54aa20d3bf523c824d016109f2d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-F7PsHqJh_4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights from the update:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New Gamemodes : Teams, FFA (both : up to 4 players).</li>
<li>New lobby settings (Friendly fire, mid match joining, player outline).</li>
<li>Reworked and improved Main Menu interface.</li>
<li>Lots of improvements on Logs in killfeed.</li>
<li>Added 4 Player Spawn Points to each map.</li>
<li>Weapon Randomizer Improvements (Customize weapon pool, spawn rate…).</li>
<li>Native Map Playlists.</li>
<li>Added Speedometer (Enable in Graphics Options).</li>
<li>Map Playlists export/import (easy to share your playlists online).</li>
<li>Killcam improvements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A fair revenue model too for a free game. There's a DLC with more maps, weapons and cosmetics. The maps and weapons are enabled for any players as long as the host owns it. There's also a new supporter edition DLC with this update that adds more cosmetics.</p>

      <title>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Neverwinter Nights 2: Enhanced Edition has arrived and Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Neverwinter Nights 2: Enhanced Edition is now here from Aspyr Media, updating the classic from 2006. It arrives after multiple leaks rated by Valve as Steam Deck Verified, SteamOS Compatible and should work fine on Desktop Linux with the Proton compatibility layer.</p>
<p>Nice to see another oldie revived with a number of enhancements, but will it be enough to pull in some fresh players?</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2N_7XaKuFLA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/796b88cec525a9e1e2a6ec7c3536b965.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2N_7XaKuFLA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gather Your Party</strong>: Assemble a team of your friends across any and all platforms with fully supported crossplay. Together, embark on an epic journey governed by the Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3.5 ruleset.</li>
<li><strong>Become a Legend</strong>: Make your mark on the Realms as you play your way through over 100 hours of immersive gameplay and four unique campaigns, each as expansive as the Bag of Holding.</li>
<li><strong>Or a Dungeon Master</strong>: Bring your pen-and-paper campaign to life! Craft your own solo or multiplayer D&amp;D adventures or explore the creations of others.</li>
<li><strong>A Relic, Restored</strong>: Everything you loved about Neverwinter Nights 2 has been preserved. Enjoy smoother gameplay with refined camera controls, polished mechanics, enhanced textures, and full controller support with a newly designed controller-specific UI.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not really nostalgic for the Neverwinter Nights series, so it's one frankly I'm skipping over entirely.</p>
<p>Are you going to be picking it up? Aspyr are doing a lot of these remasters now, so hopefully it's a good one. If not, hopefully they will get some updates out to solve any lingering issues.</p>

      <title>Wuthering Waves now Steam Deck Playable, and works on Desktop Linux with one tweak</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>After Wuthering Waves launched on Steam, it was left broken on all Linux platforms including SteamOS and Steam Deck but now it works.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/wuthering-waves-arrives-on-steam-another-with-anti-cheat-problems-on-steam-deck-and-desktop-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">developer noted on their Steam page</a> after release how they were working on it, and it seems they've recently updated their version of Anti-Cheat Expert (ACE) to allow it all to work.</p>
<p>For the Steam Deck / SteamOS, Valve have today <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3513350/history/?changeid=30069803" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">officially</a> bumped it up from Unsupported to Playable with Valve's testing using <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-4</a>. I've launched it on my Steam Deck LCD, and it does indeed load up fine now and you can get in-game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7610375921752592512gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7610375921752592512gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Valve note a couple of issues though, preventing it being fully Verified:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This game's launcher/setup tool may require the touchscreen or virtual keyboard, or have difficult to read text.</li>
<li>Some functionality is not accessible when using the default controller configuration, requiring use of the touchscreen or virtual keyboard, or a community configuration.</li>
<li>Entering some text requires manually invoking the on-screen keyboard.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It does have an Unreal Engine 4 prerequisites installer that needs the touch-screen or emulated mouse input on Steam Deck. Same with agreeing to their terms of service on the initial first run. Then you get to the login, and agreeing to other terms of services. After that, gamepad controls works fine.</p>
<p>As for Desktop Linux, we saw <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/ge-proton-10-8-brings-fixes-for-doom-eternal-wuthering-waves-and-wayland/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">updates to GE-Proton</a> only recently that enabled it to work too. Currently, Proton 9 and Proton Experimental do not work for it out of the box. However, Proton Experimental <em>will</em> allow you to get in if you set this launch option:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">SteamOS=1 %command%</code></p>
<p>Otherwise, you can use the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/ge-proton-10-9-released-with-ntsync-and-fsr4-upgrade-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest GE-Proton 10-9</a> that does it for you. <em>See my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-ge-proton-on-steam-deck-steamos-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full guide to installing GE-Proton for help</a>.</em></p>

<p>Since it's not supported on Desktop Linux, it could potentially break again. But it works for now. Check out more on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our dedicated anti-cheat page for Linux systems</a>.</p>

      <title>Shark Dentist looks a bit silly, tense, gruesome and I need to play it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I don't know who thought that it was a good idea to be a Shark Dentist, in what looks like a set from a cheap horror movie - but now I have to try it.</p>
<p>Coming from Alice Games who previously made two VR games Monster Rampage VR, Santa’s Letters VR and the non-VR Broventure: The Wild Co-op. Frankly, I had never heard of any of those until now. Perhaps this silly idea might be their first proper hit. They say it will appeal to "horror fans, streamers, and lovers of films like Jaws, The Meg, and Saw". I just recently watched The Meg and The Meg 2 as well, so it's rather timely. I do love a bit of dumb monster horror like this.</p>
<p>Your main enemies in it will be: Shark Stress, bringing it ever-closer to waking up and snacking on you; Limited Resources, so don't use too much anaesthetic; and Random Event, where your equipment might fail on you and various "other surprises".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="B7HjJipvOxk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f6ac7b86ad6fc2c9831e50af553a4c39.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/B7HjJipvOxk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Intense Gameplay: Treat a shark's teeth without waking it. Every mistake can lead to deadly consequences.</li>
<li>Roguelike Mechanics: Randomly generated dental issues, tools, and debuffs make each attempt unique.</li>
<li>Multitasking: Monitor the shark's pulse, maintain oxygen supply, manage anesthesia, and choose the right tools.</li>
<li>Realistic Tool Interaction: Use syringes, drills, mirrors, and even a circular saw to tackle various tasks.</li>
<li>Organic Balance: Manage the shark's stress level by finding a balance between the pain of treatment and limited resources.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the press release the dev was inspired by viral sensations like Buckshot Roulette, with it blending dark humour and roguelike mechanics wrapped up in a creepy aesthetic.</p>

      <title>The Alters gets patched to replace AI generated bits, fix a Steam Deck crash and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Alters from 11 bit studios appears to be doing very well, apart from the controversy over the AI generated bits. A new patch is out to fix it up.</p>
<p>Back in June, there was a lot going around about players discovering some AI generated assets in the game, which were not disclosed on store pages like Steam. Not a lot, but enough that it caused a bit of an uproar. The developer posted on social media (like <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/11bitstudios.bsky.social/post/3lstiwaoxcc2i" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>) with a statement to clear it up noting that they were meant as placeholders. There were also some AI translations for a few licensed in-game movies in the social area that were done due to "extreme time constraints" they had planned to replace.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="965Km7t6KwM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/363c3b32c727fb63b37c93538bb3a17a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/965Km7t6KwM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601570/view/555747819912167772" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">patch 1.1.0</a>, this should all be cleared up now, as noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Localization and VOs: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple missing and wrong translations.</li>
<li>Occasional missing voiceovers.</li>
<li>Replaced LLM generated text on Command Center asset.</li>
<li>Replaced machine translated subtitles in Social Room movies.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A fair amount of bug fixes came with this update too like a Steam Deck crash when progressing onto a new chapter. Nice to see direct fixes like that.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px">The developer also recently revealed that less than a month after release it sold over 280,000 copies as well.</span></p>

      <title>RimWorld – Odyssey expansion is out now along with update 1.6</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>RimWorld has expanded in a massive way with the Odyssey expansion and the 1.6 update, now available for all players.</p>
<p>This is the fifth expansion to the hit sci-fi colony building sim. Pushing beyond a single map to allow your colonists to build a flying home and travel across the planet and even into space. With new biomes that introduce diverse landmarks and exotic wildlife, and dynamic quests include hunting alpha thrumbos and raiding ancient cryosleep bunker. And when you're done on land you can head into space where you'll find space stations, asteroids and something stirring in the dark.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FutmQwQ-O2A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fa8dae10770bd166202cd51e00f76a58.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FutmQwQ-O2A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“The game has always created a whole world beyond the colony, but it was hard to get out there and actually explore it,” said Tynan Sylvester, founder of Ludeon Studios. “Turning the whole colony into a giant movable ship unlocks all that latent story potential. And once we did that I figured hell, why not go to orbit as well?”</p>
<p>With the new biomes there's distinct hazards and new opportunities, along with a new landmarks system that transforms the world generation. Giving you many new options to build colonies, there's also a lot of new animal species to find, fishing mechanics were added, multi-part story quests and then list of what's new goes on and on. With all of it coming to a new late-game threat with the machine hive mind.</p>
<p>The expansion also includes a whole new album from Alistair Lindsay, composer of the RimWorld soundtrack.</p>

      <title>Try the big demo upgrade for Demon Tides, an impressive looking open-world 3D platformer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>An open world platformer where you express yourself with different movements, Demon Tides looks like a lot of fun and it just had a huge demo upgrade. It's in development by Fabraz. A name perhaps you might recognise from Slime-san and Demon Turf.</p>
<p>You navigate the open seas to find distant structures, which you then explore with a diverse set of moves. Beat challenges, find chests and go collecting. Some trinkets you find can even modify and expand you abilities and outfits. Looks really cool, check out the original reveal trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BOqwY4H1d0Q"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/111598e28247bcef261298c0081c75b4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BOqwY4H1d0Q" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A big 2.0 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2585890/view/505080786253254544" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">demo update</a> just went live that includes a whole lot of performance improvements, especially nice for devices like the Steam Deck. It's a long list of what's changed, including lots of gameplay updates and bug fixes. Well worth a go now and should work fine with Proton.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A deeply expressive platforming move-set that enables you to travel through the world in countless unique ways. Express yourself through your schmovement and get lost in the flow!</li>
<li>Travel the seamless, open ocean and reach any point of interest at blazing speeds! Explore each locale and figure out creative ways to beat challenges or reach certain areas!</li>

<li>Acquire a ton of unique head gear, outfits and hair dyes to change up your appearance! With over 50,000 possible combinations there’s no shortage of drip.</li>

      <title>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition to release August 14</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Relic Entertainment have announced that Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition is set for release on August 14th. Hopefully it will see a better reception than the recently released Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition, which is currently on Mostly Negative on the Steam user reviews.</p>
<p>At release it will cost $29.99, with a 30% discount if you own the Anniversary Edition.</p>
<p>See the new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="pY_JzB0WxSA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d251e766aac3d585242b205b2964c4fc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/pY_JzB0WxSA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer has mentioned there will be no new content or post-launch DLC, as their focus is on "delivering the ultimate Dawn of War experience" to have everything from the original. As for multiplayer, they're aiming to keep everything mostly the same there apart from "fixing some of the most egregious legacy bugs that should help improve the multiplayer experience". However, they've also said "not all legacy bugs will be addressed for launch" and they're already planned updates at release.</p>
<p>They also have a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dawnofwar.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky account</a> you can follow too.</p>

      <title>Lossless Scaling Frame Gen gets a Decky Loader Steam Deck plugin but there&#39;s drama</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Update 14/07/2025 at 17:50 UTC - the developer of lsfg-vk, "Pancake", issued a new statement about the situation. This was <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1042475930217631784/1392093575755468921/1394368550583668736" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> into the Lossless Scaling Discord:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Update on Deck Wizard's video and the Decky plugin</strong></p>
<p>Hello everyone! I'd like to clear up some things after the previous announcement, which caused way too much unnecessary drama.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, I've been talking to both Deck Wizard and Kurt (xXJSONDeruloXx on GitHub), who is the creator of the Decky plugin. The situation we got into was caused purely by poor communication, so we sat down and discussed the future of the plugin together.</p>
<p>Let's get into the news then.<br/>
The Decky plugin will remain unofficial and unsupported in this discord, not as a means to discourage using it, but rather to keep the growing load of support away from me, as I have barely anything to do with the plugin. Together with Kurt and Deck Wizard we've fixed the major labeling issues in the plugin, as well as created an update video on Deck Wizard's channel that you can watch here:<br/>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhkCev9M6lM<br/>
Future support with the Decky plugin will happen in the Discord server linked in the video description and depending on which category your issue falls into, you may be forwarded to this discord instead.</p>
<p>In the future, some pretty big changes will be coming to lsfg-vk which will likely require a portion of the plugin to adapt. I will be working with Kurt to get the changes into the plugin as quickly as possible, however this warrants a whole other announcement and I can't promise any timeframe (it could be hours, days or weeks).</p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>There's some drama in Steam Deck land with a Decky Loader plugin, that works with Lossless Scaling Frame Generation from the new lsfg-vk project for Linux.</p>
<p>The lsfg-vk project itself was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/lsfg-vk-aims-to-bring-lossless-scalings-frame-generation-to-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">first covered here on GamingOnLinux on July 7th</a>, and the developer has recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/lossless-scalings-frame-generation-for-linux-gets-upgraded-to-the-latest-v3-1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">managed to upgrade it</a> with the help of the original Lossless Scaling developer. It's still a work in progress and a little rough but it does work.</p>
<p>Since there was a lot of excitement around it, a <em>different</em> developer decided to make a Decky Loader (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-set-up-decky-loader-on-steam-deck-steamos-for-easy-plugins/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">see my Decky Loader guide</a>) plugin (<a href="https://github.com/xXJSONDeruloXx/decky-lossless-scaling-vk" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>) to make it easier to work with it on SteamOS / Steam Deck. It was then showcased by the YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KCXxhD-Y8s" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Deck Wizard</a> but now onto the drama…</p>
<p>The creator of lsfg-vk, "Pancake", <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1042475930217631784/1392093575755468921/1394103380787593277" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> this to the Lossless Scaling Discord server:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Important information regarding the Decky plugin and Deck Wizard's video</strong></p>
<p>A couple of hours ago Deck Wizard has made a video on Lossless Scaling in which they present a new Decky plugin for lsfg-vk.<br/>
On Reddit, the creator of that plugin claimed they had collaborated with me to create this, however this is incorrect and was likely the result of a language barrier.</p>
<p>I was asked to collaborate, but I instead requested them to wait with the plugin until the new configuration system was written, as otherwise a large portion of the plugin would have to be rewritten to account for it. They did not listen and pushed the plugin out without communicating with me beforehand.</p>
<p>As a result of this, the plugin already has many issues such as incorrect labeling of options and misleading descriptions of other options. Likely in collateral, the video created by Deck Wizard further spreads these wrong explanations. I want to clear up these things.<br/>
First of all, the settings recommended by Deck Wizard are 30% flow scale and no performance mode. I can not state enough how terrible these options are. With 30% flow scale, internal calculations are happening in 96x54 images with some going down to 2x1, producing extremely inaccurate results.<br/>
Instead, it is recommended to keep flow scale at 85-100% with performance mode enabled, as this gives a much larger performance boost while retaining immensely higher quality.</p>
<p>Clearly all of this is simply a result of poor communication and as such I will not support the Decky plugin. Do not ask about help with lsfg-vk when using the Decky plugin. Perhaps in the future an official lsfg-vk Decky plugin can be made in actual collaboration with me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This all seems a bit <em>dramatic</em>. But I don't blame the developer of the original Linux tool wanting things to be correct and ready for it to not be disappointing for users, and not to overwhelm them.</p>
<p>Hopefully this situation will have a happy ending.</p>

      <title>Open source Medal of Honor: Allied Assault adds better bots and a new master server for online play</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fancy some Medal of Honor: Allied Assault on modern systems with online play? OpenMoHAA is what you need to check out. Covered here initially on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/medal-of-honor-allied-assault-open-source-remake-gets-a-first-beta-release/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux back in November 2024</a>, the community project is quickly coming along with a whole lot of big improvements in the latest v0.82.0-beta release.</p>
<p>Some highlights of this release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The navigation system has drastically improved for bots thanks to the Recast Navigation library. The mp-navigation pk3 file is no longer needed.</li>
<li>Docs have been reorganized and clarified. There is a new website for the documentation: <a href="https://docs.openmohaa.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.openmohaa.org/</a>.</li>
<li>On Windows there is now a setup file (MSI) to install OpenMoHAA.</li>
<li>Multiplayer server list has evolved!</li>
<li>Lot of fixes... Including some that address bugs present in the original game.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The bots are now a lot smarter and can navigate more difficult paths properly including those requiring jumping, falling or climbing ladders and navigating around obstacles. The most exciting addition though is the new master server powered by <a href="https://333networks.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">333networks</a>. With this update OpenMoHAA also now supports multiple master servers, and queries them all together to build the server list.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9603253361752486752gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9603253361752486752gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - OpenMoHAA multiplayer on Linux</em></p>
<p>OpenMoHAA supports the full original game (including the campaigns) with support for modern systems. Along with plenty of modern enhancements.</p>
<p>You need the original game to work with it that you can <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/medal_of_honor_allied_assault_war_chest" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">buy from GOG.com</a>.</p>
<p>Running it on Linux is really easy. You can use the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/heroic-games-launcher-2152-released-fixing-amazon-gog-and-epic-games-issues/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Heroic Launcher</a> to download the game from <a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/medal_of_honor_allied_assault_war_chest?as=1636858786" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>, then drop the release files from the OpenMoHAA GitHub into the installed folder and launch it.</p>

      <title>Split-screen game launcher for Linux / SteamOS adds support for multiple keyboards and mice</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PartyDeck is a free and open source split-screen game launcher for Linux / SteamOS, and the latest release sounds great. I mentioned it in a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/partydeck-is-a-split-screen-game-launcher-for-linux-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previous GamingOnLinux article back in May</a>.</p>
<p>It allows you to run up to 4 instances of a game, supporting both Native Linux and Windows games via Proton. It sets it all up for you, with sandboxing to ensure each instance only sees the control inputs assigned to it and positions the game windows around your screen for you.</p>
<p>Pretty clever stuff, and now with the 0.5.0 release even supports multiple keyboards and mice. You can also now add multiple devices per instance, and there's been a few UI adjustments.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights from the GitHub:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Runs up to 4 instances of a game at a time and automatically fits each game window onto the screen.</li>
<li>Supports native Linux games as well as Windows games through Proton.</li>
<li>Handler system that tells the launcher how to handle game files, meaning very little manual setup is required.</li>
<li>Steam multiplayer API is emulated, allowing for multiple instances of Steam games.</li>
<li>Works with most game controllers without any additional setup, drivers, or third-party software.</li>
<li>Now works with multiple keyboards and mice!</li>
<li>Uses sandboxing software to mask out controllers so that each game instance only detects the controller assigned to it, preventing input interference.</li>
<li>Profile support allows each player to have their own persistent save data, settings, and stats for games.</li>
<li>Works out of the box on SteamOS.</li>
</ul>

      <title>System76 reveal the new Adder WS laptop, their &#34;most affordable&#34; powerhouse</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Linux hardware vendor and Pop!_OS Linux distribution developer System76 have revealed the Adder WS laptop, and it's quite powerful. If you're in need of new hardware and need something that has quite a kick, perhaps this may be what you want.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2981974521752484019gol1.png"/></p>
<p>It's their "most affordable power-graphic's unit" but still with quite a cost attached at $2,099. Their press release noted it's a "light workstation laptop".</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">As standard it comes with:</p>
<ul>
<li>15.6" Matte FHD Display w/ GeForce RTX 5050 (2560 CUDA Cores). Other options include:
	<ul>
<li>15.6" Matte FHD Display w/ GeForce RTX 5060 (3328 CUDA Cores).</li>
<li>17.3" Matte FHD Display w/ GeForce RTX 5060 (3328 CUDA Cores).</li>
<li>17.3" Matte FHD Display w/ GeForce RTX 5070 (4608 CUDA Cores).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX, up to 5.4 GHz - 36MB cache - 36 TOPS - 24 total cores.</li>
<li>16 GB DDR5 5600 MHz.</li>
<li>1 TB PCIe4 (up to 5,000 MB/s read, 3,600 MB/s write).</li>
<li>WiFi 7 + Bluetooth 5.4.</li>
<li>Built-in Webcam &amp; Microphone.</li>
<li>1x USB 3.2 Gen 2 (Type A), 1x USB 3.2 Gen 1 (Type A), 2x USB 3.2 Gen 2 (Type C).</li>
<li>1x HDMI, 2x DisplayPort 2.1 over USB-C.</li>
<li>4 cell Polymer battery pack 73WH.</li>
</ul>
<p>They also made a rather silly Infomercial like the classics:</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 10-9 released with NTSYNC and FSR4 upgrade support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GE-Proton 10-9 is out now with some exciting sounding new features like NTSYNC and FSR4 upgrade support for gamers on Linux, SteamOS and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>This is the community-made compatibility layer, not supported by Valve. See <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my explainer on the different Proton versions</a> and my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-ge-proton-on-steam-deck-steamos-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">guide to install GE-Proton</a> for more.</p>
<p>From the changelog:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added ntsync support:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Enable with PROTON_USE_NTSYNC=1</code></p>
<p>NOTES:<br/>
1. Your kernel must be patched with ntsync patches. If your system does not have /dev/ntsync then your kernel does not have the patches required to use ntsync.<br/>
2. Some applications, mostly 32 bit, may also need PROTON_USE_WOW64=1 when using ntsync</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added FSR4 upgrade support via PROTON_FSR4_UPGRADE=1 (auto upgrades from amd directly <a href="https://download.amd.com/dir/bin/amdxcffx64.dll" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://download.amd.com/dir/bin/amdxcffx64.dll</a>).</li>
<li>Added fixes from upstream for flicker/rendering issue when using wine-wayland.</li>
<li>Refactored a lot of the patches section and cleaned up outdated or merged patches.</li>
<li>Update wine-wayland patches.</li>
<li>Updated wine to latest bleeding edge.</li>
<li>Updated dxvk to latest git.</li>
<li>Updated vkd3d-proton to latest git.</li>
<li>Imported all upstream proton changes.</li>
<li>protonfixes: added a fix for winetricks wget gnutls failing inside fex.</li>
<li>protonfixes: add fix for sifu freeze (thanks UsernamesAreNotMyThing).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10087377661752482846gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Sifu</em></p>
<p>Before getting too excited about NTSYNC though, do note what Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais mentioned that I included in the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/linux-kernel-6-14-out-late-due-to-pure-incompetence-dont-get-too-excited-about-linux-gaming-boosts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Linux kernel 6.14 release post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We already include fsync, which should be as fast or faster as ntsync. We developed ntsync as a general solution that'd be acceptable in upstream Wine, but there's no urgency in including it in the Deck / SteamOS kernel.</p>

      <title>Wine 10.12 brings EGL backend in the X11 driver, support for Bluetooth Low Energy services</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wine 10.12 is out now as the latest development release towards Wine 11, bringing new features and bug fixes for running Windows apps / games on Linux. <em>Wine is also a major part of Valve's Proton.</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Noted as the highlights of this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Optional EGL backend in the X11 driver.</li>
<li>Support for Bluetooth Low Energy services.</li>
<li>More support for generating Windows Runtime metadata in WIDL.</li>
<li>ARM64 builds enabled in Gitlab CI.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's a pretty old memory leak <a href="https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19561" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">bug</a> that was checked off with this release, from way back in 2009. Looks like it was actually fixed quite a few years ago. A fair amount of bugs that are noted with each Wine release aren't necessarily fixed with this specific version, it's just what bug reports they've gone over to see if they still happen. There's probably quite a lot of these older reports that still need checking given the size of the Wine project.</p>

      <title>DOGWALK is a free casual game from the Blender Studio out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Blender Studio team have now released DOGWALK, a free casual game made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>. A showcase of what's possible with free and open source tools.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://studio.blender.org/projects/dogwalk/production-logs/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a>, their team put up various development logs you can read over to see how they got on with Godot. Originally they said "The goal of this project is to create a pipeline between Blender and Godot to make the asset and level creation process as seamless as possible".</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="gPENs56vfYk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/21dd1524375c087a7230460f37d4081f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/gPENs56vfYk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore - You are let loose to roam camping grounds, forest paths, idyllic creeks and a frozen pond in this miniature open world.</li>
<li>Bound together - Guide or drag around your little kid owner that you have in tow. Help each other out, be a menace or be a good boy.</li>
<li>Play your way - Dive straight in and have the game react to your play-style and choices. There are no fail states. Only player driven moments.</li>
<li>A paper craft world - Traverse an environment made of real-life paper crafted models, scanned and recreated to be played with.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The source code and various assets it's made with are also available, but you need to subscribe to Blender Studio to access all of it. The game itself is completely free though. You can also buy the Supporter Pack on Steam for the source code.</p>

      <title>Limbo and Inside are getting delisted from GOG</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GOG have announced that <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/limbo" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Limbo</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/inside" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Inside</a> from studio Playdead are being delisted, so you might want to grab them while you can.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general/delisting_limbo_and_inside/post1" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> GOG made didn't go into details and just said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry to inform you that Limbo and Inside will be removed from our store on July 17th, 2025, 3 PM CEST.<br/>
<br/>
We don't have any information on discounts yet.<br/>
<br/>
Wish I could have better news for you, but grab it while it's still here!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why? We can only speculate at this point but it's likely related to the ongoing legal spat between Playdead and co-founder Dino Patti.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5451388291752481194gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Inside from Playdead</em></p>
<p>Back in March, Patti <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dinopatti_dino-we-made-it-thats-what-he-told-activity-7303723474152230913-QJ9G/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> on LinkedIn to note "My old partner has threatened me with an IP lawsuit because I used a publicly available picture, in a linkedin post 3 months ago, of the game LIMBO that we created at Playdead together" and that Patti would make it public if it continued (which it obviously did). The post showed the latest legal threat letter that Patti had received.</p>
<p>According to an article from <a href="https://80.lv/articles/exclusive-playdead-has-filed-a-lawsuit-against-its-co-founder" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">80.lv</a>, Playdead followed up with an actual lawsuit against Patti in June.</p>
<p>No word if the games will be removed from other stores but it's entirely possible.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental updated to fix the Epic Games Store and a few games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve put out a small update to Proton Experimental to begin the weekend, with fixes for the Epic Games Store and a few games for Linux, SteamOS and Steam Deck.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's all the changes below for the July 11th update:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed experimental regressions:
	<ul>
<li>RiME should no longer exhibit weird windowing behavior when Alt+Tabbing on certain setups.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed intro video in Warhammer 40,000: Dakka Squadron - Flyboyz Edition having no audio.</li>
<li>Fixed Warrior Maiden Lecia and the Lost Fortress hanging on exit.</li>
<li>Fixed video playback in Roboquest.</li>
<li>Fixed sending feedback not working in Cosmoteer: Starship Architect &amp; Commander.</li>
<li>Fixed Teardown hanging when publishing a mod to the workshop.</li>
<li>Fixed a recent update causing Epic Games Store not launching under Proton.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Source: <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a></em></p>
<p>For anyone confused why Epic Games Store is noted it's because <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-play-games-from-gog-and-epic-games-on-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">you can install it using Proton inside of Steam</a>. I mentioned to Proton developers while working on that linked guide that it was broken, and it was fixed in the bleeding-edge Beta only a day later and now it's in Proton Experimental proper.</p>

      <title>Try having a shotgun for an arm in the demo for Captain Wayne - Vacation Desperation</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Captain Wayne - Vacation Desperation is an upcoming retro-styled completely over the top FPS, it looks awesome and a demo is now live.</p>
<p>One I missed that was shown off during THE MIX event earlier this year. The game as a whole just sounds completely nuts. The developers own explanation of it is just ridiculous too. As they explain: "The hot pink-wearing, fish-chomping, cigar-huffing Captain Wayne refuses to let anything stand between him and his gory conquest to rob and humiliate every rich asshole around the globe."</p>
<p>You're also missing an arm, chomped away by a legendary "Vampire Whale" and so you replaced it for a shotgun. Now you're marooned, with your ship stolen and so off you set "annihilating everyone responsible".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3tNdGudqdCk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4a9ca927e791002b2b3c9d6dba90df4e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3tNdGudqdCk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's actually using GZDoom, so you can most likely get it running in the Linux version of GZDoom. Otherwise, Proton is an option to try if you love your retro-fuelled shooters.</p>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Witness an elaborately hand-drawn, action-packed epic inspired by the FPS greats!</li>
<li>Make use of the many devastating weapons in Wayne’s arsenal and achieve maximum destruction!</li>
<li>Explore dangerous locales through 8 humongous areas all across Orca Isle!</li>
<li>HALF GAME, HALF CARTOON! Delight in the Captain’s depth-defying tale in CAMPAIGN MODE as you view tons of animated cutscenes exploring his adventure.</li>
<li>Experience a high-octane soundtrack that emphasizes AGGRESSION and CHAOS!</li>
<li>Go for the gold in our ENDLESS MODE–how long can you survive the onslaught?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The demo is live on Steam now.</p>

      <title>SuperWEIRD is a co-op mixture of automation, tower defense and adventuring</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SuperWEIRD is the next planned game from developers Luden.io, merging together a few different genres into something thoroughly odd.</p>
<p>Even the developer is confused about it. As they said: "We want to cross tower-defense gameplay with co-op and automation, and see what comes out of this mix. You find yourself in a place that's obviously broken. The local store is closed, the robots are malfunctioning, and there are occasional golem attacks in the wilderness. This all sounds SuperWEIRD, so... Good luck?"</p>
<p>In the game you will open up your own store, and then gather resources to craft goods to sell to the locals. While also fending off thieving robots. The developer previously made <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/619150/while_True_learn/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">while True: learn()</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1724140/Craftomation_101/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Craftomation 101</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1150090/Learning_Factory/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Learning Factory</a> so of course there's a little programming involved with helper bots (but all simple - no coding skills required they say).</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OwIWbkia6V0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d8012af773e8809f52ea034e232f81d6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OwIWbkia6V0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Use flags to mark paths for an endless stream of mindless robots.</li>
<li>Make them harvest resources and craft stuff for you.</li>
<li>Arm your robots, or even better: make robots arm other robots.</li>
<li>Build and optimize huge and complex systems of robots.</li>
<li>Play with friends in co-op mode to make things better… or much worse.</li>
<li>Outsmart the madness.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Partly educational too. It's being developed in partnership with <a href="https://www.carina.fund/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Carina Initiatives</a>, a nonprofit philanthropic foundation working on building a deep and connected math talent ecosystem.</p>

      <title>Lossless Scaling&#39;s Frame Generation for Linux gets upgraded to the latest v3.1</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The dev of the popular Lossless Scaling app has been helping the lsfg-vk project that brings Lossless Scaling's Frame Generation to Linux to get it upgraded. Quite exciting news that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/lsfg-vk-aims-to-bring-lossless-scalings-frame-generation-to-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux shared recently</a>, and progress on improving it has been ongoing.</p>
<p>Writing in the official Discord for Lossless Scaling, the developer behind the lsfg-vk project noted how they've had help from the original Lossless Scaling developer THS behind the scenes. Thanks to their help lsfg-vk has now been updated to support LSFG 3.1 (the latest version of LSFG).</p>
<p>As developer Pancake said on the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1042475930217631784/1392093575755468921/1393003249224777858" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Discord</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Update to LSFG 3.1</strong></p>
<p>As promised the new version of lsfg-vk is updated to use LSFG 3.1, making it both faster and better!<br/>
When updating, make sure you change the branch on Steam back to the normal release branch.</p>
<p>This new release also brings with it the <code class="inline-code">LSFG_FLOW_SCALE</code> property, which can be used to override the flow scale from 1.0 (100%) down to 0.25 (25%). If you're encountering performance issues, you might want to consider lowering this option. Performance mode not yet supported unfortunately.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As part of the updates there's now a new LSFG 3.1 Benchmark you can use with instructions added to <a href="https://github.com/PancakeTAS/lsfg-vk/wiki/Configuring-lsfg%E2%80%90vk" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the Wiki</a>.</p>
<p>Installing it should be a little bit easier now too, as the developer also announced they've enabled a GitHub workflow to build binaries constantly. However, it builds on Arch Linux so will only work on Arch-based systems. They've also made an installation script too but it still needs further testing and expanding to support more distributions.</p>
<p>Over time, as more people use it and help with it, I expect it to get a lot easier to use.</p>
<p>You can get it on <a href="https://github.com/PancakeTAS/lsfg-vk" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> for Linux but you do need to own Lossless Scaling on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/Lossless_Scaling/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Craft-and-thrive adventure Squirreled Away tweaks the graphics for Steam Deck players</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Squirreled Away is a cute casual craft-and-thrive adventure that you can play solo or with friends, and now it should work great out of the box on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Checking off the last thing on the list to get it bumped up from Playable to Verified, the developers have implemented new graphics options with a default for the Steam Deck to perform better. Manually configuring it was why Valve gave it a Playable rating, so it's likely now it can be Steam Deck Verified with a big green tick. It's also SteamOS Compatible.</p>
<p>The developers also "significantly" lowered the CPU and GPU usage while in the main menu. As for content there's also some new stuff in this update. They added in the "Telly-porter", a TV that allows you to transport between places which sounds pretty great.</p>
<p>Not seen it before? It's super cute. Check out the trailer below:</p>
