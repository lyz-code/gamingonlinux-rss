      <title>Intel Arc A770 GPU releases October 12th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Along with announcing their new Raptor Lake desktop CPUs, Intel has also finally announced the release date of their Arc A770 GPU for October 12th. This is their top-end GPU, that they claim "delivers 65% better peak performance versus competition on ray tracing".</p>
<p>Coming in at $329, putting it in line with the RTX 3060 which they previously compared it against. They're facing some fierce competition with NVIDIA and AMD already well established in the market although given the insane price on<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/nvidia-announces-ada-lovelace-their-3rd-generation-rtx-dlss-3-and-portal-rtx/" target="_blank"> NVIDIA Ada Lovelace</a>, perhaps more will be looking at alternatives?</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/108796751664305625gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/108796751664305625gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Very little else was really said about it that I can find, other than what they've previously revealed about it which is pretty much everything with all the specifications already available on their website. As a refresher, their Limited Edition version is mainly the card with the 16GB GDDR6 and they said previously most of their partners will do it in 8GB.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10002567851664306213gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10002567851664306213gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>You can find out more on the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/arc-discrete-graphics/7.html" target="_blank">Intel website</a>. The XeSS SDK is also now available on <a href="https://github.com/intel/xess" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>I'm keen to see how Intel do with their first lot out properly, as a third vendor has been needed like this in the GPU space. With open source drivers too, there's a lot for Linux users to like about it.</p>

      <title>Intel reveals 13th Gen &#39;Raptor Lake&#39; desktop CPUs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Intel has today formally revealed their brand new line of desktop CPUs, just as AMD are launching <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/amd-announced-qzen-4q-with-ryzen-7000-series-rdna3-teased/" target="_blank">Ryzen 7000 processors</a>. I don't think we need any guessing on why it was revealed today, nothing like trying to step on your competitor's toes eh?</p>
<p>Continuing to be built on their "Intel 7" process node, they're claiming their new flagship with the Core i9-13900K once again offers up the "world's best gaming experience". It is a pretty powerful chip with 24 cores (8 P-cores, 16 E-cores) and 32 threads.</p>
<p>Here's the full list of what's been announced:</p>

      <title>Silence of the Siren is a gorgeous new strategy game from the Project Hospital devs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oxymoron Games, developers of the Project Hospital game have announced their second title with Silence of the Siren and it's looking quite impressive.</p>
<p>Writing over email, they mentioned how Project Hospital was a great success for their team, enabling the production on this new game which has been in development for "several years". They also confirmed it will have Native Linux support just like the previous game.</p>
<p>Taking place in a chaotic universe in their own original setting, where several space-faring civilizations are fighting over control of a distant star system and trying to discover its dark history. Check out the first teaser below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="IcFyILv3tWE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3a33aec5dd0b30df5cc3bb12a7c2aba3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/IcFyILv3tWE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Siren star system, birthplace of a galactic alliance, and the homeworld of a lost Primals civilization, has been cut from the rest of the galaxy. As a result, the carefully built alliance split into bickering factions and secluded colonies. These days, hardly anyone pays attention to the ruins scattered all over the few habitable planets of a freshly isolated system. The deeper you venture into the uncharted regions, the stronger the feeling of endangerment grows. There is something else. An entity, a shade, an echo of whispers from below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore a rich sci-fi world and discover secrets of a lost civilization.</li>
<li>Collect powerful artifacts, secure important resources, upgrade your bases and hire the strongest units.</li>
<li>Level-up your commanders and crush your opponents in exciting turn-based battles.</li>
<li>Take control over several different species and factions.</li>
<li>Old-school strategy game with modern controls and intuitive UI.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2147380/Silence_of_the_Siren/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>JSAUX released a firmware update for their Steam Deck Docking Stations</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>JSAUX (pronounced Jay-Socks), <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/blogs/steam-deck/were-upgrading-our-steam-deckss-docking-stations-firmware" target="_blank">announced</a> recently that they've made available a new firmware update for their first two models of the Steam Deck Docking Station.</p>
<p>This concerns the original <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/steam-deck-docking-station" target="_blank">Docking Station</a> and the <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/upgraded-docking-station-for-steam-deck" target="_blank">Upgraded Docking Station</a> (which I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/no-need-to-wait-on-valve-the-steam-deck-docking-station-from-jsaux-is-great/" target="_blank">reviewed</a>) and not the newest version that features an M.2 SSD slot that I'll be reviewing sometime soon.</p>
<p>What's new? JSAUX say they worked to improve the compatibility with televisions and monitors from LG. While small on changes, any increase in compatibility is great and shows they don't just forget about old models when moving onto the next. In their own words they said "With this new firmware we want to show our customers that we are focused and committed to improving our lineup of Docking Stations. To us, every client matters and that’s why we thrive to give you the best possible experience.".</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is a catch. Their firmware update is only designed for Windows. However, I have mentioned the <a href="https://fwupd.org/" target="_blank">Linux Vendor Firmware Service</a> to them, so hopefully they can put it up on there giving Linux users an easy way to update too.</p>

      <title>Mellow indie adventure One Dreamer is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One Dreamer is a point and click programming adventure game about a burned-out indie developer making games. It's officially out with Native Linux support. Note: key provided by the developer.</p>
<p>While the programming in it is quite basic and based on small puzzles, it's part of the overall experience of going through the motions of what it's like to work on games and do work on the side too. It's quite an interesting mellow experience, great to play through on a weekend. If you like chilled story-based adventures with a little puzzling, along with meta about the games industry, it's pretty great.</p>
<p>"Help Frank, a burnt out indie game developer, rediscover his love for video games while struggling to release his debut title. Reprogram objects, fix bugs and solve coding puzzles as you journey through the story of One Dreamer."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ciD0p3h72KM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a1ad4ab7d2f8e581a90d6aa2cd9adef4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ciD0p3h72KM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With some blocky but still good pixel-art blending with nice lighting, and a soundtrack that really helps you relax it's quite an experience. As someone else who works alone, it certainly hit home in a few places. Some of the little messages you get about the world, the people and the developer can hit pretty hard if you're paying attention to all the conversations you pass when running through the world. Lots to appreciate about this one including some good voice acting too.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A narrative-driven, emotional story about the gruelling development process behind making an indie game.</li>
<li>Realistic, but easy to understand pseudocode puzzles based on C#. Edit over 350 snippets of code from Frank’s toaster to playable mini-games.</li>
<li>Meet an extensive cast of charming characters, complete with full English voice acting.</li>
<li>Explore a wide range of atmospheric, pixel by pixel drawn environments.</li>
<li>A beautiful original soundtrack composed over a period of 7 years.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Rust for Steam Deck / Linux still some time away</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For those of you wanting to play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/252490/Rust/" target="_blank">Rust</a> again on Linux desktop or Steam Deck, it sounds like it's still some time away as Facepunch continues thinking on Easy Anti-Cheat support.</p>
<p>While for some developers it may just be a case of ticking a box, or putting things in the right place, we know that's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/anti-cheat-work-on-warhammer-vermintide-2-for-steam-deck-a-linux-on-hold/" target="_blank">not always</a> the case. Outside of the technical implementation, developers also need to think on EAC's effectiveness and about opening their games to another platform to protect against cheating.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6267965841664278852gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>In the case of Rust, it seems the biggest issue is the protection that Easy Anti-Cheat can offer and if it's worth the time involved in setting it up and supporting it in a public environment.</p>
<p>On Twitter, Facepunch's Garry Newman <a href="https://twitter.com/garrynewman/status/1574466250167787520" target="_blank">mentioned</a> in reply to a user:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're working through some issues, trying to justify it. It would be a lot of extra work to put on EAC, we can't do it if it's detrimental to the main Windows player base..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I replied asking about Steam Deck, Newman replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well that's what we're evaluating. Steam Deck compatibility is the only reason to do it at all..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a follow-up when asked what the issues are Newman said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's not one issue. I worry that by opening another platform we're forcing EAC to spread themselves too thin. I don't want to put that pressure on them if it's going to reduce effectiveness of their team on Windows. When we had a Linux version before we...</p>
<p>... noticed that while the majority of cheaters were on Windows, a good chunk of actual cheat makers used Linux and stayed undetected for a long long time. Trying to persuade EAC to hunt these handful of people down wouldn't be a great use of their time considering their impact..</p>
<p>.. on the overall population of the game. So internally we're talking about whether this is a door worth opening. This isn't a linux thing, it's a "another platform" thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's hard to argue such a clear explanation of the issue at hand. Developers of games that are primarily multiplayer will always be thinking hard on opening them up to another platform.</p>
<p>That said, Easy Anti-Cheat must be somewhat effective even on Linux / Steam Deck as it seems it's good enough for EA / Respawn with Apex Legends which has a player base multiple times larger on Steam compared with Rust. But, one size does not fit all of course. Newman <a href="https://twitter.com/garrynewman/status/1574720935130808322" target="_blank">mentioned</a> this too in a reply to a user asking about it and it's another fair point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don't know too much about the cheating situation in Apex to talk about it. Rust is really sensitive to cheating. A cheater doesn't ruin a single 10 minute match, they ruin 3 weeks of hard work and grind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Something to make you think, not something specific I had actually considered before either about the vastly different use-case for a game like Rust.</p>

      <title>Don&#39;t Shit On My #!$@&amp; Roof is the latest 2D horde shooter out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You know me by now, I'm going to play everything I can that in some way resembles Vampire Survivors and this new influx of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/a-genre-is-born-horde-games/" target="_blank">horde games</a> and Don't Shit On My #!$@&amp; Roof is the latest. Note: personal purchase.</p>
<p>While not the true evil (hello Seagulls), Pigeons can be quite a nuisance too and this game has you deal with them. Like most other similar horde survival shooters you're tasked with surviving as long as possible, while continually levelling up and becoming more powerful as more and bigger enemies come flying in. Here though, you're protecting your house from bird poop on top of watching our for yourself.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qgJf6eJWg9k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0ffc549008acda279d9862d3f0f1a453.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qgJf6eJWg9k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Right now in Early Access it's somewhat basic, but a good platform for the developer to continue building on it. I would honestly wait on this one until they've pushed it along some more, as it's a little too flat and simple than I would personally like. It has a fun setting idea but it needs to do a little more with it to pull me away from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/void-scrappers-is-my-new-favourite-coffee-break-game-m-try-the-free-prologue/" target="_blank">Void Scrappers</a>.</p>

      <title>Custom boot animations for the Steam Deck are pretty sweet</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Did you know you can change the boot animation on the Steam Deck? Well you can and the community has naturally gone and done some pretty amazing things with it.</p>
<p>After messing around for a little while, I've come up with a full and hopefully easy enough guide to follow both in video and text form for anyone interested in doing it themselves. This was directly inspired by a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/xi3vno/comment/ip196e6/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank">Reddit post</a> on it where the user changed their Steam Deck bootup to a Futurama animation with the Steam Deck wording which is pretty <em>fantastic</em>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="a4mctgqWM8o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7a0afa51019489d66717faf32bda086d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/a4mctgqWM8o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Text Guide:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, you need a .webm video file of an animation, whatever you want. You can easily convert videos to webm using services like <a href="https://cloudconvert.com/" target="_blank">CloudConvert</a>, your favourite <a href="https://kdenlive.org/en/" target="_blank">video editor</a> or even ffmpeg scripts.</li>
<li>In your Home folder in a file manager, unhide the files. <em>CTRL+H or via the options menu in the top right.</em></li>
<li>Head to .local/share/Steam/steamui/movies/ and make a backup of deck_startup.webm if you wish.</li>
<li>Get the filesize of the deck_startup.webm by right click -&gt; properties and make a note of the one in brackets.</li>
<li>Replace the original deck_startup.webm with your chosen video file, using the same name.</li>
<li>Open a terminal window inside this folder (right click -&gt; open terminal) and run this command (with the correct filesize you noted):<br/>
<code class="inline-code">truncate -s 1840847 deck_startup.webm</code></li>
<li>Go into .local/share/Steam/steamui/css/ and make a backup of library.css and again make a note of the filesize. This file tends to change filesize between Steam Deck updates.</li>
<li>Open the library.css file, go to the line that has "video" and edit just after it to read like this:<br/>
<code class="inline-code">video{flex-grow:1;width:100%; height:100%; z-index:10}</code></li>
<li>Now open a terminal inside this folder as you did before, then run this (with the correct filesize you noted):<br/>
<code class="inline-code">truncate -s 38492 library.css</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Now you're done. You can reboot and watch your new boot video! Enjoy.</p>

      <title>Caesar III game engine Augustus has a new releases up</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/Keriew/augustus" target="_blank">Augustus</a> is a game engine reimplementation for the classic Caesar III, enabling you to play on modern platforms (like Linux / Steam Deck). It's a fork of another called Julius that focuses on accuracy, with Augustus aiming to improve the game with a number of changes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17415989431664196447gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17415989431664196447gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Version 3.2.0 was released and here's some highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A warning is displayed when the game can't be saved.</li>
<li>Added a yearly autosave option.</li>
<li>Fulfilling the emperor's requests will now spawn cartpushers heading to Rome with the resources.</li>
<li>Added walkers who deliver food from the supply post to forts.</li>
<li>Added inverse direction option to right mouse click dragging.</li>
<li>Added relevant advisor buttons to many message types.</li>
<li>Added hotkeys for setting the map orientation to north.</li>
<li>Added the option to display messages as alerts on top of the screen.</li>
<li>Added the option to display the building grid.</li>
<li>Farms, raw materials buildings, workshops and wharves now display the efficiency of the building.</li>
<li>Added support for MPG video files. Create a “mpg” folder in your Caesar 3 install directory and place the MPG video files inside, to use them in-game instead of the SMK video files.</li>
<li>Added play/pause button to sidebar.</li>
<li>Added hedge/palisade gates. They are created by building hedges/palisades over the roads.</li>
<li>Added purple variants of columns and pavilions.</li>
<li>Added watchtower variants.</li>
<li>Added medium statue rotation.</li>
<li>Added gladiator statue.</li>
<li>Added support for assets relative path to the executable.</li>
<li>Added a support for saving high-res screenshots of the minimap.</li>
<li>+ a lot more.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You need the original game assets which you can grab easily with a DRM-free copy of Caesar III on<a href="https://af.gog.com/game/caesar_3?as=1636858786" target="_blank"> GOG.com</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/517790/Caesar_3/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>If you wish to play it directly from Steam, you can use the Luxtorpeda project to run it which I've covered before in various articles <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/steam-deck-using-luxtorpeda-for-morrowind-warzone-2100-and-x-com/" target="_blank">like this guide</a>.</p>

      <title>Trombone Champ is my new favourite rhythm game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Discover the mysterious of the Trombiverse in Trombone Champ, a new hilarious rhythm game and absolutely now a clear favourite of mine. Come listen to me destroy it. Note: personal purchase.</p>
<p>Released on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1059990/Trombone_Champ/" target="_blank">Steam</a> on September 16th, the developer says it's "the world's first trombone-based rhythm music game. Unlike most music games, you can freely play any note at any time. You're not just following along with the music, you're actually playing the music".</p>
<p>I came across a lot of noise about it on Twitter, including a Valve developer giving it a go on Steam Deck. I thought it looked and sounded hilarious and so I just had to give this one a go myself with the gyro controls on Steam Deck and it's as completely ridiculous as you might think but it wouldn't take all that much practice to get really good at it I think.</p>
<p>Here's a video of me committing musical murder:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3YeJhPzRqTk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cad9601292e7c2e22a8581797f4a6436.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3YeJhPzRqTk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Toot your way through <strong>over 20 tracks.</strong> The better you play, the more toots you earn!</li>
<li>Collect all <strong>50 Tromboner Cards!</strong></li>
<li>Baboons on nearly every screen!</li>
<li>Improvise and play whatever you want in <strong>Freeplay Mode!</strong></li>
<li>Uncover the secrets of the Trombiverse and become the True Trombone Champ!</li>
<li>Absolutely zero microtransactions!</li>
<li>Playable with mouse and keyboard (recommended) or USB controllers (coming after launch)!</li>
<li>Appropriate for all ages!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It works great on Steam Deck out of the box and on my Fedora Linux desktop it worked just as well there with Proton 7 using mouse controls. Although for mouse controls, they're inverted by default which felt pretty terrible but thankfully in the settings they do let you put it normal which felt better. Overall though, I had far more fun with it on Steam Deck with gyro than I did on desktop.</p>

      <title>Blizzard don&#39;t officially support Steam Deck / Linux but they still fix issues for it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently, there were was an upgrade to the Battle.net client that caused it to break on Linux desktop / Steam Deck but it seems the issue is thankfully solved now.</p>
<p>The thing is, Blizzard don't support Linux as a platform at all for the client or their games. However, they do have a bit of history of now and then fixing up major issues preventing people playing with the Wine compatibility layer. Seems that level of support is still ongoing after the latest incident.</p>
<p>Around <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/blizzard/t/last-update-completely-breaks-wine-compatibility/33122" target="_blank">9 days ago</a>, it seems an update just broke it entirely and the app wouldn't install and update properly resulting in some sort of loop. While it's a shame no testing is done for Linux and Steam Deck before updates are rolled out, at least we're not stuck forever as they've now <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/blizzard/t/fix-for-linuxlutris-users-stuck-in-battlenet-update-loop/33340/9" target="_blank">solved it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="cooked">
<p>Howdy Everyone!</p>
<p>I do apologies we didn’t post here sooner but the development teams was aware that a recent change did cause havoc with Wine and the software used for Steam Deck. This wasn’t intended.</p>
<p>A fix was deployed and it appears it’s working. If you are still having issues please try a reinstall of the app so it fully updates to the 8020 build.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Check on it today and it seems all good on my end now too.</p>
<p>Good news, since Overwatch 2 releases next month and I'm sure plenty will want to play it.</p>

      <title>Canadian customers seeing a temporary delay for the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Valve has been able to repeatedly speed up production of the Steam Deck smashing expectations, they've hit a snag when it comes to Canada.</p>
<p>Due to the issues, if you're awaiting an order email for the Steam Deck you're going to have to wait a little bit longer due issues out of Valve's hands.</p>
<p>As the official OnDeck Twitter account said across a series of <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1573001930515050502" target="_blank">tweets</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steam Deck production is faster than ever, and we're on track to fulfill all reservations before the end of the year! There's temporary snag for our Canadian customers that we wanted to address – please see the follow up tweet for more details:</p>
<p>Our distributor has hit a processing backlog for orders to Canada, so folks in this region will see a (very) temporary pause on order emails. We're working on it, and are optimistic we can resume emails to Canada soon. This doesn't impact emails or shipments to other regions.</p>
<p>To clarify, the reason for this pause is so our distributor can make it through the backlog of paid orders (in Canada), before we resume sending emails to folks in this region.</p>

<p>This will no doubt be an exciting one for a lot of people, as one of the biggest complaints is easily the docked experience and absolutely one of the unsaid reasons why Valve has delayed the dock for so long.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3308480236507039963" target="_blank">what's new</a> in the Steam Deck OS Beta:</p>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4095198751663917915gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4095198751663917915gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The FSR fix is also a welcome one, as it was causing frame spikes quite regularly so things should be a bit smoother now.</p>

      <title>Valve launches Steam Charts giving us better details on games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/" target="_blank">Steam Charts</a>, the name of the new system Valve just launched gives us a better look behind the curtain on how games are doing on Steam overall. This replaces the basic stats page that showed the online count for Steam and the Top 100 most played games with a lot more information.</p>
<p>We still have the Most Played games list, although it's a bit more real-time as it's updated every 5 minutes now and it gives you a little more info like the price and any current discount making it a lot more useful:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14317083321663916311gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14317083321663916311gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The brand new Top Sellers system is also pretty slick. Giving a real-time look at what is the most popular on Steam, with you being able to filter it to various countries. This includes the number of weeks in the top sellers, the weekly change in rank and it accounts for the <u>total</u> revenue (DLC, various different editions etc). If a DLC for a game is what bumped it up the list, that will be noted too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8726266911663916532gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8726266911663916532gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Interestingly though, it doesn't list the Steam Deck here but they are listing that in their Weekly Charts still. Probably makes some sense, given that it's not a real-time thing you can just purchase at any time since it's still in the reservation system. So once there's no queue, it may end up in the real-time list.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20315961521663916579gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20315961521663916579gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Once again, it's great to see Valve continue to give more information to users and continue upgrading their store.</p>
<p>Given how the industry is often rather secretive about any form of stats on their games, it's thoroughly refreshing to see Valve actually make this a more prominent and useful feature.</p>

      <title>Paradox Arc to publish sci-fi base builder Stardeus, entering Early Access in October</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Stardeus from developer Kodo Linija (Bloody Rally Show) has found a publisher with Paradox Arc (Paradox Interactive's new publishing arm). It's also set to enter Early Access on October 12th with Native Linux support and it is already Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>What exactly is it? Stardeus is a sci-fi colony management simulator with aspects of automation, base building and space exploration. You're a new AI that gets tasked with building up a starship so you must supervise various robots, drones and humans too as you build a new life but of course it's in space so it's thoroughly unpredictable and accidents will happen as will violent raids from various space forces.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="E9RSZnVvuTw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9316c6b61428cb88f8fe0b2e95effb53.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/E9RSZnVvuTw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Inspired by the likes of Factorio and Rimworld, you can clearly see the inspiration when you play it but it's also very much a unique game too with plenty to appreciate. The developer sent me early access to this one quite some time ago, and I had quite an interesting time with it and did some of the early Steam Deck testing for it.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1380910/Stardeus/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>GNOME 43 is out now with Quick Settings, refreshed Files app and lots more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GNOME 43 is officially out now, bringing with it some pretty wonderful sounding changes to one of the most popular Linux desktop environments.</p>
<p>One of the new highlights is a Quick Settings feature. This is a redesign of the status menu in the top right, giving you more settings that are easy to change like the UI style, a screenshot button, the ability to switch between sound devices and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13692573401663852975gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13692573401663852975gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>More apps are switching over to GTK 4, the next-generation GNOME user interface toolkit and as of GNOME 43 these apps have newly moved over: Files, Maps, Logs, Builder, Console, Initial Setup and Parental Controls.</p>
<p>The Files app also went through a refresh with a new modern design for the file and folder properties window, the layout adjusts itself to various widths automatically, reorganized menus, a new layout for search results, recent, and starred files, there's a new Open With dialog and in the list view opening the context menu for the current directory is now much easier.</p>
<p>You will also find a new Device Security section in the privacy settings, a new and improved Web Apps feature to install websites to the desktop as apps and more.</p>
<p>Lots of other improvements including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The screen keyboard now shows suggestions as you type. It will also show Ctrl, Alt, and Tab keys when typing in a terminal.</li>
<li>Web’s screenshot feature is now easier to use: it can now be found in the web page context menu, or triggered with the Shift+Ctrl+S keyboard shortcut.</li>
<li>Also in Web, the style of interface elements in web pages has also been updated, to match modern GNOME applications.</li>
<li>The Characters app now includes a much wider selection of emoji, including people with different skin tones, genders, and hair styles, and more regional flags.</li>
<li>Some of the animations in the Activities Overview have been optimized, so that they are smoother.</li>
<li>The “about windows” of GNOME apps, which show details about each app, have been revamped.</li>
<li>In Software, application pages have an improved switcher for selecting the source and format.</li>
<li>The dark UI style used by GTK 4 apps has been polished, so the appearance of bars and lists is more harmonious.</li>
<li>When connecting to GNOME with a remote desktop app (using RDP), it is now possible to receive audio from the host.</li>
<li>GNOME’s range of alert sounds has been updated, and includes a new default alert sound.</li>
</ul>

      <title>DOSBox Staging 0.79.0 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>DOSBox Staging is a fork of the original DOSBox aimed at getting new features in faster, along with a better overall experience for users.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10277191101663851253gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>A new release with version 0.79.0 is out adding in lots of audio improvements like the ultra-rare AdLib Gold surround sound daughterboard is now emulated, DOSBox Staging can now accurately emulate the low-pass filter (and sometimes a high-pass filter too) that most DOS-era sound cards feature, filtering for small-speaker audio systems (PC Speaker, PS/1 Audio, Tandy, and the various LPT DAC options) to give a better experience and a new crossfeed option to mix the channels for some audio that might only play on one ear. There's even more like a chorus effect, adding stereo movement and increases the perceived stereo width, which is especially noticeable on purely mono signals on headphones.</p>
<p>There's also various graphical improvements like a shader reload shortcut, it is possible to override the default, canonical interpretation of the 16-colour CGA/EGA RGBI palette, improved scaling, window transparency support, a new Constant Frame Rate (CFR) presentation mode, which presents a constant frame rate defined by the emulated DOS rate and more.</p>
<p>The ability to mount physical CDs is now (re-)implemented in DOSBox Staging for better compatibility with games like Under a Killing Moon, System Shock, and The Pandora Directive. There's a huge amount more to it that you can <a href="https://dosbox-staging.github.io/v0-79-0/" target="_blank">read about here</a>.</p>
<p>For Linux users, <a href="https://github.com/luxtorpeda-dev/luxtorpeda" target="_blank">Luxtorpeda</a> also has support for this new release so you can easily use it with Steam games. You can install it via ProtonUp-Qt two tools I've covered numerous times now like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/steam-deck-using-luxtorpeda-for-morrowind-warzone-2100-and-x-com/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/01/try-out-luxtorpeda-a-steam-play-tool-to-run-games-in-native-game-engines/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

      <title>Core Keeper and Terraria are getting cross-over updates</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two rather great sandbox mining games are set for an official cross-over. Terraria and the new kid on the block Core Keeper will both be getting free updates for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21034521681663845606gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Announced by the Core Keeper developer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1621690/view/3371525557392086619" target="_blank">on Steam</a>, their update will land on September 26th and will allow players to summon the King Slime from Terraria:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can now reveal that, from the 26th of September, you’ll be able to summon a creature you’ll recognise as one of Terraria’s (pre-hardmode) heavy-damage dealers. That’s right, say hello to King Slime.<br/>
<br/>
This giant, royal blob doesn’t just spawn randomly, however. In fact, he’s a little bit like Omoroth in that you’ll need to summon him forth when you want to battle. “How do we summon him?” you ask. Well, that’s for us to know, and you to find out!<br/>
<br/>
Battling King Slime may be a challenge, but it could definitely be worth your while. Rumour has it that defeating King Slime will score you some pretty interesting loot that will make you the envy of your fellow explorers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, it seems like Terraria will be getting an update on September 28th (<a href="https://twitter.com/Terraria_Logic/status/1572612243115724802" target="_blank">source</a>) which sounds like another big one, and seems like the cross-over update will be bundled into it. For the Terraria side it will be this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cavelings are usually very hostile creatures, especially towards adventurers. That being said, there are one or two Cavelings that have proven friendly in the past (like the Caveling Merchants). It’s safe to say that Cavelings can be good company, in the right conditions, and it looks like you’re going to be able to make friends with one in Terraria.<br/>
<br/>
Introducing the Caveling Pet, a friendly Caveling Farmer that’ll follow your character around looking cute and offering a little moral support wherever you go. You’ll be able to summon this uncharacteristically docile Caveling in Terraria using a special item that you’ll also recognise from Core Keeper. We think it’ll be more fun for you to figure this one out yourselves, so we’ll say no more on the matter!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not a timed-event either, with the cross-over update being permanent additions to both games.</p>

      <title>HYPER DEMON is a vision-bending FPS from the creator of Devil Daggers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Devil Daggers was a great time-survival FPS and now the creator is back with HYPER DEMON, which will blow your tiny little mind. Well, it might blow your eyes wide open at least. It's nuts. Note: this was a personal purchase.</p>
<p>While Devil Daggers had you survive as long as possible, this one is a little different. Very similar in the basic idea but the entire style of it has been mangled and warped to be a thoroughly strange experience. Here you're chasing a score rather than a time too. It's ridiculously fast too and just hurt my poor brain. Check out the insane trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ScglDSi9KUs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6974c7424e4c37e75ea250801b04ab5c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ScglDSi9KUs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Much like the previous game the controls are simple, giving you only a few movement and weapon mechanics to master. However, it's easier said than done. The visuals become pretty overloading too, with what developer Sorath describes as "Groundbreaking spherical projection gives the player wide peripheral vision without pinching and shrinking the center of the screen like a traditional linear perspective, allowing fields of view up to 180 degrees" and you have to play it to really appreciate just how absolutely wild it is.</p>
<p>It really is Devil Daggers II with a different name, complete with what looks like re-used assets from it and a tweaked gameplay scoring mechanic but it's also a lot more than that and I'm thoroughly terrible at it. Watching some of the top replays just makes me sweat and wonder how the hell are some people that fast to react to, well, anything? Most of my runs end up with a minus score because I'm just too slow at it.</p>
<p>While there's no Native Linux release this time around, it does work just fine on Fedora Linux and Steam Deck with Proton 7. Performance in both cases seems just fine too. For Steam Deck though, there's no controller support so you're likely going to need to tweak the thumbpad and gyro to be any good at it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8N5ZAQpxqIw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a9e02d075a62c65421d5bfc6b02d27a4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8N5ZAQpxqIw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1743850/HYPER_DEMON/" target="_blank">on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Beta lets you create a collection filtered by games you and friends own</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a rather useful feature Valve just added to a recent release of the Steam Beta Client. You can now filter your Steam Library based on what you and your Steam Friends own.</p>
<p>So you can create a collection, let's say to match up games that offer co-op with a certain friend so you can easily pick things to play together. Honestly, that's pretty fantastic. Here's an example:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10538352721663775435gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10538352721663775435gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>I'm for sure going to be making great use of this. Since you can use it with dynamic collections, you'll always be up to date with people you pick to keep track of what to play.</p>
<p>Full <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/6074815775741130447" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Games to Play Together</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can now add Friends as a filter under Advanced Filtering in your Library. It will show games you have in common.</li>
<li>Right-click on any user in Chat or your Friends List to Find Games to Play Together and it will auto-populate your filter while also applying the Multiplayer tag.</li>
<li>Right-click a Group Chat header to do the same with smaller group chats or voice channels (8 members or less).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steam Overlay</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed web browser crash when loading certain blank URL's.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>macOS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed incorrect placement of "Restore Window" button when client window is maximized.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sign In Dialog</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed incorrect icon placement when signing in using a QR code.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Split game information and properties into different windows.</li>
<li>Add list view.</li>
<li>Allow DLC to be queued up for downloading.</li>

<li>Add option to disable update check per game.</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Isometric fantasy RPG Zoria: Age of Shattering gets a new demo and Kickstarter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Zoria: Age of Shattering from Tiny Trinket Games is not a name I've mentioned for a while but the developer is back with an updated demo and a Kickstarter campaign to finish it up.</p>
<p>"A squad-based tactical RPG with fluid turn-based combat, outpost, and follower management, set in the expansive Fantasy world of Zoria. Lead a team of four heroes with their unique skills and perks. Every team member contributes to undertaken battles."</p>
<p>It's been in development since 2018 and the team say they've finished about 80% of the content now. They've also teamed up with Anshar Publishing to help and now there's a crowdfunding campaign where they're hoping to raise at least €35,000 to finish it and add in new classes, locations, and mechanics and make the world more complex.</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fluid and fast-paced turn-based combat in a dynamically changing environment. Keep a close eye on your surroundings, as an enemy walking by may unexpectedly join the fray to support their comrade in need.</li>
<li>The rich world of Zoria, with its dungeons, ruins, necropolises, and fortifications, is waiting to be explored.</li>
<li>Your outpost will be your base. From here, you can plan your next expedition, send selected party members on a mission, replenish resources, and make changes to your squad so that the skills of individual members match the task ahead of you.</li>
<li>Each duel you fight affects your team's fatigue level and depletes resources. Set up camp to craft potions, upgrade weapons, heal wounds and remove curses, and take a nap when you're done.</li>
<li>During the quests, you will often find yourself in seemingly inaccessible places. Use the unique abilities of each team member, and you will discover new, previously inaccessible areas.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The full release will be up on <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/zoria_age_of_shattering" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1159090/Zoria_Age_of_Shattering/" target="_blank">Steam</a> with a new demo available to try now.

      <title>GE-Proton 7-35 out now with more fixes for Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom" target="_blank">GE-Proton</a> (GloriousEggroll), the community maintained version of the Windows compatibility layer version 7-35 is out now and here's what's new. Well, technically it's two version as 7-34 went up first with the main additions and 7-35 was a quick extra hot-fix.</p>
<p>What's new:</p>
<div class="markdown-body my-3" data-pjax="true" data-test-selector="body-content" data-view-component="true">
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Phantasy Star Online 2 fixed (again).</li>
<li>Persona 4 Golden fixed (again) -- Thanks tgurr.</li>
<li>GTA IV custom radio protonfix added -- Thanks xperia64.</li>
<li>upstream WINE_HEAP_DELAY_FREE fix for CoD BO3 Multiplayer + zombies added.</li>
<li>upstream LAA disable for Sword and Fairy 4 added.</li>
<li>wine updated to latest bleeding edge.</li>
<li>DXVK updated to latest git.</li>
<li>vkd3d updated to latest git.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the version of Proton you can add in yourself, that makes some games work better than the official Valve Proton due to pulling in fixes quicker before they've had wider testing (plus some things Valve can't legally do like video codec stuff).</p>
<p>How to use it? You can simply use the ProtonUp-Qt tool that we've covered here numerous times now. See the previous <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/protonup-qt-got-upgraded-heres-how-to-use-it-on-steam-deck-and-linux/" target="_blank">GOL Guide on GE-Proton with ProtonUp</a>.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA announces Ada Lovelace their 3rd generation RTX, DLSS 3 and Portal RTX</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA has revealed the first details of their third generation of RTX GPUs with Ada Lovelace, plus DLSS 3 is coming with big improvements too.</p>
<p>Models announced so far includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>RTX 4090 - $1,599 (£1,679) - 24GB GDDR6X - 450W - October 12th</li>
<li>RTX 4080 - $1,199 (£1,269) - 16gb GDDR6X - 320W or 12GB GDDR6X - 285W at $899 (£949) - (November sometime)</li>
</ul>
<p>Click pictures to enlarge:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8019684161663687430gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/8019684161663687430gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2624843091663687432gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2624843091663687432gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some other features mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Streaming multiprocessors</strong> with up to 83 teraflops of shader power — 2x over the previous generation.</li>
<li><strong>Third-generation RT Cores</strong> with up to 191 effective ray-tracing teraflops — 2.8x over the previous generation.</li>
<li><strong>Fourth-generation Tensor Cores</strong> with up to 1.32 Tensor petaflops — 5x over the previous generation using FP8 acceleration.</li>
<li><strong>Shader Execution Reordering</strong> (SER) that improves execution efficiency by rescheduling shading workloads on the fly to better utilize the GPU’s resources. As significant an innovation as out-of-order execution was for CPUs, SER improves ray-tracing performance up to 3x and in-game frame rates by up to 25%.</li>
<li><strong>Ada Optical Flow Accelerator</strong> with 2x faster performance allows DLSS 3 to predict movement in a scene, enabling the neural network to boost frame rates while maintaining image quality.</li>
<li><strong>Architectural improvements</strong> tightly coupled with custom TSMC 4N process technology results in an up to 2x leap in power efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Dual NVIDIA Encoders </strong>(NVENC) cut export times by up to half and feature AV1 support. The NVENC AV1 encode is being adopted by OBS, Blackmagic Design DaVinci Resolve, Discord and more.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>During the event they showed off Cyberpunk 2077 and Microsoft Flight Simulator running with DLSS3 and the performance uplift did seem pretty impressive. Oh, and Portal RTX is a thing coming as a free DLC in November.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AZHBl5yWqJk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3884cf9fdd1738bfb1764726c4ec41f9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AZHBl5yWqJk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"DLSS is one of our best inventions and has made real-time ray tracing possible. DLSS 3 is another quantum leap for gamers and creators," said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. "Our pioneering work in RTX neural rendering has opened a new universe of possibilities where AI plays a central role in the creation of virtual worlds."</p>
<p>DLSS3 will release with Ada Lovelace on October 12th and these games / engines will support it:</p>

<p>Oh, they also announced RTX Remix, a free modding platform built in their NVIDIA Omniverse that they say allows people to make RTX mods for various games that include "enhanced materials, full ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS 3, and NVIDIA Reflex". It will support DirectX 8 and DirectX 9 games with fixed function graphics pipelines.</p>
<p>Those with a keen eye might spot a familiar bit of open source tech being used for it too:</p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3842349201663689739gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3842349201663689739gol1.jpg"/></a><a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk" target="_blank">DXVK</a> for those who don't quite get it. The same translation tech used in Proton to get Windows games to run with Vulkan. So all mods made with it will run with Vulkan!</p>

<p>Linux hardware vendor and Pop!_OS distro maker <a href="https://system76.com/" target="_blank">System76</a> have today revealed their brand new Thelio desktop design, and I must admit I continue to be jealous and feel like I just need to own this case.</p>
<p>There's multiple different versions of the Thelio with this new redesign so far (according to their press info) only available for the Thelio, Thelio Mira and Thelio Major. So what's new? They've replaced the whole wood veneer that wrapped around the chassis with a slimmer and sleeker accent panel. It gives the Thelio a refreshed standout look.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16853811991663666451gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16853811991663666451gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The inspiration for the design came from a peculiar place. "I was waiting in line for a COVID test," says Carl Richell, CEO of System76, "and I was staring at the wood trim in my car, wondering how long it would all take. I stared hard enough to the point where I started thinking about the wood-to-metal ratio, and how modern the design felt with only a little bit of wood." With the wood-to-metal ratio leaning more metal, a second etching of the Rocky Mountains has been added on the new metal side-panel.</p>
<p>We also have a fancy little commercial to go with the launch, which System76 say "shows how multifaceted the Linux community is"</p>

<p>System76 also provided a couple of quick B-roll videos which I spliced together to give you another look at it:</p>

      <title>KDE are raising funds for the Kdenlive video editor</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kdenlive, a powerful free and open source video editor from the KDE team is now having a dedicated fundraising campaign to support the team working on it.</p>
<p>Probably one of my favourite pieces of software. I often have a love / hate relationship with it due to some historic instability issues, although it has genuinely gotten a lot better there. It could be improved as with anything and these funds will help towards that.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10762375581663679065gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>For the KDE team, this seems to be the first time they've done a dedicated fundraiser with previous campaigns being for KDE as a whole. The goal isn't even what I would call ambitious, at only €15,000 that's a tiny price to pay for such an important piece of free software.</p>
<p>It's what I use for editing nearly all the videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">our YouTube channel</a>, so it's quite important to me personally too because I just don't get on with any other editor.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://kdenlive.org/en/fund/" target="_blank">fundraiser here</a>.</p>

      <title>Intel announce their NUC 12 Enthusiast Mini PC and Kit with Arc graphics</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Intel have revealed their new NUC 12 Enthusiast Mini PC and Kit (code-named Serpent Canyon) and I must admit, it looks and sounds pretty nice. Coming with an Intel Arc A770M GPU with 16GB GDDR6 VRAM, this new Mini PC has plenty going for it with a 12th Gen Intel Core™ i7-12700H mobile processor.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1958851561663670795gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1958851561663670795gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13411472961663670794gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13411472961663670794gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Other features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for up to 64GB dual-channel DDR4 memory.</li>
<li>Three M.2 PCIe slots, including two Gen4 NVMe slots.</li>
<li>Two Thunderbolt™ 4 ports and six USB 3.2 Gen2 ports (Type-A).</li>
<li>Fast connection with Intel i225-LM 2.5Gbps Ethernet, Intel® Killer™ Wi-Fi 6E AX1690i and Bluetooth®5.2.</li>
<li>HDMI 2.1 TMDS-compatible port (up to 4K60).</li>
<li>Two DisplayPort 2.0 (1.4-certified) ports.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Intel NUC 12 Enthusiast Kit is one of the most exciting NUC's to launch because it’s the first to pair an Intel processor with discrete Intel graphics. The system provides a strong combination of high performance in content creation and gaming usages, and wide array of I/O – typically found in larger systems – all in a small form-factor design. More importantly, this NUC features helpful technologies like Intel® Thread Director and Intel® Deep Link that make it perfect for anyone trying to create and game in the convenience of a truly compact design.”</p>
<p>– Brian McCarson, Intel vice president and general manager of the NUC Group</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2294841121663670796gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2294841121663670796gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9048793221663670687gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9048793221663670687gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>When to expect it? They said in "late September" with prices ranging from $1,180 to $1,350, depending on the configuration. Not only will you be able to get the full kit to customize it to your needs (including adding your OS of choice), Intel said to expect fully equipped systems through retailers "at a later date".</p>

      <title>Steam Bash Bash event now live with demos and discounts</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest Steam event is now live with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/hack_and_slash" target="_blank">Steam Bash Bash</a>, a celebration of various types of fighting games. Specifically, those that are all about melee combat.</p>
<p>From now until September 26th at 10am PDT / 5pm UTC there will be discounts and demos on every type of game that was able to sneak into the event as long as it focused on fighting. For this Valve considered games that were a mixture of  Hack-and-slash, Spectacle fighters, Character action games and Musou. However, as usual, it's quite a broad category and they didn't exactly keep to the specifics of it with quite a lot that I really wouldn't consider fighting or melee included in it.</p>
<p>For the event, Valve put together two very different types of trailers:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="g38NWgjrdwE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/012c169b79a49b2999b9358ce15b39e0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/g38NWgjrdwE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I think we can all tell that Valve's Kaci Aitchison has way too much fun making these little promos.</p>
<p>Nice to see Valve do more stuff like this though, they really are a different company to only a few years ago when the most we usually got out of them was silence.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WGDWsQmpATQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ce1d2a63c9a4f0718531f0378ddde9a8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WGDWsQmpATQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>See the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/hack_and_slash" target="_blank">event page</a> for all of it.</p>
<p>If you spot a particularly good deal during the event, be sure to let people know in the comments. Personally, I'm considering grabbing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1007040/EARTH_DEFENSE_FORCE_5/" target="_blank">EARTH DEFENSE FORCE 5</a> (60% off) that is Steam Deck Playable and it looks like a ridiculous amount of fun.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck Q3 invites are all out early as Valve beats own production estimates (again)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Again and again Valve has managed to speed up production of the Steam Deck, so much so that for reservations the Q3 era is over. Valve said that everyone who was inside Q3, would have gotten their purchase invite email today and so they're now speeding onwards into the Q4 window.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3398551594416099573" target="_blank">full announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello, just a quick note about shipping today.<br/>
<br/>
As some folks on the internet have noticed (we see you Reddit!), we're speeding through reservations at an accelerated pace. This is due to increased production, and we've beaten our own estimates yet again. With today’s batch of emails we’ve now sent invitations for all reservations in the Q3 (July-September) bucket.<br/>
<br/>
Now that Q3 is done early, we're going to get a head start on the next set of reservations, and are fulfilling reservations that were scheduled for the Q4 window. We've updated the <a class="Link eventbbcodeparser_Link_3I3zk" href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck?snr=1_2108_9__2107" target="_blank">store page</a> to reflect this, with an updated bucket description: <strong>September-December</strong>.<br/>
<br/>
That's it for today, more to come soon!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a reminder, if you do manage to miss your email and Steam app notification somehow, you can still speak to Steam Support as you have a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/missed-your-steam-deck-email-valve-confirms-a-grace-period-to-still-get-one/" target="_blank">few days grace period</a> on it.</p>

      <title>Return to Monkey Island is out now, Linux version due soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's here at last. Terrible Toybox and Devolver Digital have today released Return to Monkey Island, and for fans of Native Linux ports one is on the way. For the Linux side, developer Ron Gilbert said on <a href="https://twitter.com/grumpygamer/status/1570852960024031233" target="_blank">Twitter</a>: "Works on Proton and a pure Linux version is coming soon after."</p>
<p>"Return to Monkey Island is an unexpected, thrilling return of series creator Ron Gilbert that continues the story of the legendary adventure games The Secret of Monkey Island and Monkey Island 2: LeChuck’s Revenge developed in collaboration with Lucasfilm Games."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lAlDNn43QQQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8f958408d5ffd2ee1ff2f6a26be8bd30.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lAlDNn43QQQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Return to Point &amp; Click Swashbuckling</strong> - Bringing classic point and click gameplay to the modern-day, intrepid pirates will solve puzzles and explore the islands with a clever evolution of classic adventure game controls. Context-sensitive interactions, reactive dialog trees, and an easy-to-use inventory system make pirating a breeze.</li>
<li><strong>Embark on Archipelago Adventures</strong> - Navigate the sometimes-friendly confines of Melee Island, a familiar place that finds itself under new management by leaders who have put the squeeze on old friends and new faces. Venture out into uncharted lands like the aptly named Terror Island and the chilling outposts of Brrr Muda to make allies and enemies alike.</li>
<li><strong>Created by a Legendary Crew</strong> - The new chapter in the Monkey Island series marks the return of the iconic series’ creator Ron Gilbert, joined by game co-writer Dave Grossman, art director Rex Crowle (Knights &amp; Bikes, Tearaway) and composers Peter McConnell, Michael Land, and Clint Bajakian (Monkey Island, Monkey Island 2: LeChuck’s Revenge).</li>
</ul>
<p>A long time coming for Monkey Island fans, hopefully it's been worth the wait. If you do pick it up, be sure to give some of your thoughts over in the comments.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060130/Return_to_Monkey_Island/" target="_blank">find it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Intel&#39;s Linux Vulkan Driver readying up a 60%+ speed boost &#34;in draw throughput&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In another nice win for open source graphics, the Vulkan Driver for Intel on Linux is looking set to get a nice speed boost. Coming from developer Mike Blumenkrantz, who only just recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/mesa-gets-a-big-csgo-speedup-plus-upcoming-amd-radv-performance-boost/" target="_blank">did another speedup</a> in the Mesa drivers.</p>
<p>Blumenkrantz <a href="https://www.supergoodcode.com/meatballs/" target="_blank">blogged</a> about it, in their usual funny way, going over some profiling they did on the Intel ANV driver using the <a href="https://github.com/zmike/vkoverhead" target="_blank">vkoverhead</a> tool. Thanks to their investigation the result is <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/18637" target="_blank">two small patches</a> that aren't yet merged into Mesa but once in, should provide a "60%+ improvement in draw throughput on ICL". The fun thing is that the patches only touch a few lines and yet provide such a boost.</p>
<p>What's the real world performance difference? Well, Blumenkrantz said at the end of their blog post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m just micro-optimizing for the benchmarks that I write, not saying <strong>this will double your Cyberpunk 2077 FPS</strong>.</p>
<p>I’m not saying it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Every little helps though right?</em></p>
<p>Really it just goes to show that having open source drivers is the way to go, as anyone can come along and find various ways to optimize them both big and small.</p>

      <title>Steam Mobile App continues adding new features to the Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve are continuing to roll out big changes to the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/valve-testing-new-mobile-steam-app-with-qr-codes-for-sign-ins/" target="_blank">brand new Steam Mobile App</a>, which is currently in Beta. This will eventually replace the older app, which has been left in the dust for too long.</p>
<p>New features just <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamMobileApp/announcements/detail/5129059852700948578" target="_blank">added</a> a few days ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Remote Downloads</strong> - Added support for remotely downloading items in your library to an active Steam client.</li>
<li><strong>Authorized Devices List</strong> - Added support for viewing your authorized devices and selectively revoking access.</li>
<li><strong>Tab customization</strong> - Added the ability to customize your main tabs via Settings. Note: with this update your "Home Screen" setting will be reset.</li>
<li><strong>Tablet view</strong> - Improvements to the UI across the app for devices with larger screens such as tablets.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus these other improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added new app splash screen.</li>
<li>Fixed some cases where web settings and preferences would be forgotten.</li>
<li>Fixed bug where tapping bottom tab item for a screen with web content would not correctly take you back to the root webpage for that screen.</li>
<li>Improved navigation upon tapping a wishlist or comment notification.</li>
<li>Performance and UX improvements for the notifications screen.</li>
<li>Fixed bug where the new notifications badge could be shown incorrectly.</li>
<li>Fixed bug where time formats were not always matching the user's preferred locale.</li>
<li>Fixed visual jitter in app header that would sometimes happen when switching screens.</li>
<li>Increased tappable area for the cart and back buttons in the store web header.</li>
<li>Performance improvements for areas of the app where we were displaying blurred content.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They just recently opened up more iOS slots too, so I was able to jump in and take a look so here's a few shots of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12481436661663591187gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12481436661663591187gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9784609561663591178gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9784609561663591178gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18622601061663591194gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18622601061663591194gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13603041241663591245gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13603041241663591245gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>So far it does seem like a big improvement over the original. It looks better, it's faster and it has most of what you need right there except Steam Chat.</p>

      <title>The Wandering Village is a clear hit with over 50K copies sold</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Wandering Village, the new city-builder from Stray Fawn Studio has clearly become something of a hit and for good reason. Announced in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1121640/view/5104290054750324789" target="_blank">Steam post</a>, the developer mentioned how "The Wandering Village has sold 50’000 copies in the first two days" and it also has a Very Positive user rating now too.</p>
<p>It has already become one of my absolute favourites of 2022. There's so much to love about it even in this early stage from the unique setting to just watching your people run around doing errands, it looks wonderful in motion. Dealing with poison has been interesting, since it's also a bit of a survival game. Sometimes you go through areas of the world that are poisoned causing your plants and trees to get infected, and it can spread pretty quickly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/417667031663589112gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/417667031663589112gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here's what they mentioned from their roadmap to expect in future updates:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>Confirmed features:</strong></div>
<ul>
<li>New biome - Water</li>
<li>New biome - Ruins</li>
<li>New locations and events</li>
<li>New buildings</li>
<li>Tameable birds</li>
<li>Flying merchants to trade with</li>
<li>An additional Onbu skin</li>
<li>Controller support</li>
<li>Steam Deck support</li>
<li>Xbox version</li>
</ul>
<div><strong>Things we want to improve:</strong></div>
<ul>
<li>More story content</li>
<li>New and improved Onbu interactions</li>
<li>More city building mechanics</li>
<li>Better villager AI</li>
<li>Better balancing of the difficulty</li>
<li>UI interactions/understandability</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>My Onbu took a break in a rather nice looking spot:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10613418481663590051gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10613418481663590051gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>I also love that this zoom-out mode still shows your villagers running around doing stuff.</em></p>
<p>Very keen to see how they keep expanding this one, going to be playing a lot of it.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1121640/The_Wandering_Village/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton installer ProtonUp-Qt adds support for the Steam Snap</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/DavidoTek/ProtonUp-Qt" target="_blank">ProtonUp-Qt</a> continues being an incredibly helpful GUI for installing the likes of GE-Proton, Wine-GE, Luxtorpeda and more with a new version out now.</p>
<p>This new version brings with it support for Canonical's new Snap version of Steam, so for those of you using it you're not going to be left out of an easy way to get extra compatibility layers. It also adds support for installing SteamTinkerLaunch, a big wrapper tool for use with the Steam client for custom launch options and 3rd party programs.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12346631871663584317gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12346631871663584317gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Really is useful. With only a few clicks, you can load up Steam, the Heroic Games Launcher or even the Bottles app with various different compatibility layers.</p>

      <title>Plasma 5.26 Beta brings on the bigscreen experience</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.25.90/" target="_blank">Plasma 5.26 Beta</a> is officially out now and it comes with plenty of massive improvements, especially when it comes to using it on the bigscreen. With this version in preview, it's a chance for users and developers to find and help fix any remaining bugs to make the full release on October 6th a great one.</p>
<p>One of the big new features is Plasma Bigscreen, a whole interface just for using Plasma on your TV.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20019782191663583536gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20019782191663583536gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>This also includes the Aura Browser for a "fully immersed Big Screen experience allowing you to navigate the world wide web using just your remote control" and Plank Player that's a "Multimedia Player for playing local files on Plasma Bigscreen".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16346219341663583598gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16346219341663583598gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5001809211663583598gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5001809211663583598gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Even more improvements come to the Discover software store too including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Discover now lets you choose the frequency with which it notifies you about new updates.</li>
<li>Discover now displays content ratings for apps.</li>
<li>Discover now lets you change the name used for submitting a review.</li>
<li>Discover now has a “Share” button on each app’s details page.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Wayland support gets boosted yet again too:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In the Plasma Wayland session, it’s now possible to adjust how a graphics tablet’s input area maps to your screen coordinates.</li>
<li>It’s possible to select if apps will be scaled by the compositor or by themselves to avoid having blurry apps on Wayland.</li>
<li>In the Plasma Wayland session, it’s now possible to disable middle-click paste.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus lots more improvements across the whole desktop.</p>

      <title>Valve had the official Steam Deck Docking Station at TGS, plus other TGS bits</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While they haven't yet released the official Steam Deck Dock and they haven't really talked about it since the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/valve-delay-the-steam-deck-docking-station/" target="_blank">indefinite delay</a>, it's clearly still a thing.</p>
<p>Thanks to people on Reddit (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/xesfln/the_official_dock_is_casually_being_shown_off_at/" target="_blank">#1</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/xesiwl/clear_look_at_the_back_of_the_official_steam_deck/" target="_blank">#2</a>) we got a really good close-up of what to expect from it in the current form (click pictures to enlarge them):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3826923691663576176gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3826923691663576176gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17053681871663576178gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17053681871663576178gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>No doubt some people are waiting on the official Docking Station for Steam Deck from Valve but you don't have to. JSAUX have a thoroughly <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/no-need-to-wait-on-valve-the-steam-deck-docking-station-from-jsaux-is-great/" target="_blank">great model already available</a>, with another on the way that has an <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/jsaux-announce-their-new-steam-deck-dock-with-an-m2-ssd-slot/" target="_blank">M.2 SSD slot</a> which they've sent along to GOL for review and should be with me sometime this week if we pray to the delivery gods.</p>
<p>As for the official Docking Station and when we might see it? Likely not until after <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/steamos-34-beta-to-update-the-arch-linux-base-new-steam-deck-updates-out-now/" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.4</a> is out with an upgraded KDE Plasma desktop which should help smooth-over some of the rough edges as the current version in SteamOS is rather old. This will also give them time to continue to improve the main Gaming Mode session for external screens too.</p>
<p>What was actually playable at TGS on the Steam Deck? Here's the list:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:inherit">ACE COMBAT™ 7: SKIES UNKNOWN</li>
<li style="text-align:inherit">Aperture Desk Job</li>
<li style="text-align:inherit">Apex Legends™</li>
<li style="text-align:inherit">Core Keeper</li>
<li style="text-align:inherit">Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair</li>
<li style="text-align:inherit">DEATH STRANDING DIRECTOR’S CUT</li>
<li style="text-align:inherit">Devil May Cry 5</li>
<li style="text-align:inherit">ELDEN RING</li>
<li style="text-align:inherit">FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE</li>
<li style="text-align:inherit">Hades</li>
<li style="text-align:inherit">Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Mega Mix+</li>
<li style="text-align:inherit">Lego® Star Wars™: The Skywalker Saga</li>
<li style="text-align:inherit">Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered</li>
<li style="text-align:inherit">MELTY BLOOD: TYPE LUMINA</li>
<li style="text-align:inherit">No Man's Sky</li>
<li style="text-align:inherit">Persona 4 Golden</li>
<li style="text-align:inherit">PowerWash Simulator</li>
<li style="text-align:inherit">SCARLET NEXUS</li>
<li style="text-align:inherit">Sonic Origins</li>
<li style="text-align:inherit">Stardew Valley</li>
<li style="text-align:inherit">Stray</li>
<li style="text-align:inherit">Tales of Arise</li>
<li style="text-align:inherit">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge</li>
<li style="text-align:inherit">Yakuza: Like a Dragon</li>
</ul>
<p>Seems like TGS 2022 was a big hit for Valve and the Steam Deck — even Hideo Kojima <a href="https://twitter.com/Kojima_Hideo/status/1570660603710296068" target="_blank">stopped by</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16518151511663576406gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16518151511663576406gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center">Valve developer Lawrence Yang also gave a brief overview of the experience on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/lawrenceyang/status/1570579515902160897" target="_blank">mentioning</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quick walkthrough of the Steam Deck booth experience at #TGS2022</p>
<p>- Walk in, get a swag bag<br/>
- Watch a quick video<br/>
- Grab a Steam Deck off the wall<br/>
- Find a seat, have fun!</p>

      <title>Vampire Survivors 1.0 coming soon along with a price increase</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/" target="_blank">Vampire Survivors</a>, a simple game that exploded in popularity is set for the big 1.0 release soon and so the price will be rising next week. This game works great on Linux with Proton and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Currently only £2.09 / $2.99 / €2.39, it's an absolute steal for what it is. They haven't said how much it will increase to but they did say it will happen on September 21st so you should really just go and buy it now. Seriously, buy it. You will thank me later for all that free time you no longer have as the hours disappear.</p>
<p>They also released a small update to keep you going before the 1.0 that includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>1 new achievement: Reach Level 99 with Poe.</li>
<li>The last Arcana: XXI - Blood Astronomia.</li>
<li>1 new "weapon" : this is more like a minor gameplay feature.</li>
<li>1 new SECRET.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Update trailer is below:</p>

      <title>Castle Game Engine building up towards a huge new release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's not only <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/godot-engine-4-hits-beta-with-absolutely-loads-new/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> that's building towards a big new release. We also have the free and open source <a href="https://castle-engine.io/" target="_blank">Castle Game Engine</a> you might want to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>"A cross-platform (desktop, mobile, console) 3D and 2D game engine. Powerful visual editor. Support for glTF, X3D, Spine and more. Fast clean code using modern Pascal. Free and open-source." — official site.</p>
<p><em>Fun fact: not only is the game engine and exports supported natively on Linux, it's mostly developed on Linux too.</em></p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3483880041663345899gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3483880041663345899gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of what's new coming to the 7.0 release which is now on it's second Alpha build includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integrated Sprite Sheet Editor.</li>
<li>New and improved Font handling.</li>
<li>New camera and navigation handling.</li>
<li>A new Fog system.</li>
<li>Debian Linux packaging and Free Desktop metadata support.</li>
<li>Delphi support.</li>
<li>glTF 2.0 full support and realistic rendering upgrades.</li>
<li>Android building upgrades.</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch full support.</li>
<li>Lots of performance improvements like dynamic batching, built-in profilers and more.</li>
<li>New screen effects API</li>
<li>+ the list goes on and on.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a look at almost everything planned for the 7.0 release, see <a href="https://castle-engine.io/new_features_in_castle_game_engine_7.0" target="_blank">this page</a>.</p>
<p>Great to see more and more free and open source tools available and improving for game development. Even better when they work nicely cross-platform for both developing and testing games. CGE might not be the most well-known game engine, but it deserves a bit of a spotlight to show there's more than one way to build a game with FOSS.</p>

      <title>Nintendo Switch emulator yuzu gets &#39;Local Wireless Multiplayer&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://yuzu-emu.org/entry/ldn-is-here/" target="_blank">Local Wireless Multiplayer</a> is the latest huge feature to be added to the quite amazing Nintendo Switch emulator project yuzu.</p>
<p>For the official Switch hardware, this feature would allow two (or more) devices to connect up and play together. The way it works with yuzu is different to how it works on the Switch directly though, with it not being compatible with the Switch or other emulators. Sounds like a pretty extensive feature for yuzu too, with a whole virtual room system much like multiplayer lobbies you would find in various PC games. It also means you don't need a Nintendo account and it doesn't touch their servers.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12112510461663344938gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12112510461663344938gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>With various public rooms available, and users who are fully Verified with yuzu directly will be able to host public rooms too. For people who don't want to do any verification, they will still be able to make rooms but they won't be listed publicly.</p>
<p>Sounds pretty great, giving you even more ways to play with others.</p>
<p>It's currently in their Early Access build until it's ready to be fully public.</p>

      <title>Rebel Galaxy Outlaw and some reflection on Steam Reviews</title>
      <author>anewson</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rebel Galaxy Outlaw is a fantastic open-world space game but Rebel Galaxy Outlaw has a terrible Steam reviews score. Are Steam reviews making us miss out on good games?</p>
<p>Linux gamers on Steam have a particularly close relationship with the Steam community. Before the days of <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> it was Steam reviews and discussion pages where we would find out how well the game ran on Linux (excepting, of course, this publication). We also may be the most outspoken minority on Steam. Think of the obligatory "Will this come to linux?" Steam discussion post. We should be proud that our feedback can be<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/10/58-sales-and-over-38-of-bug-reports-from-linux-said-one-dev-but-its-been-helpful/" target="_blank"> especially helpful to developers</a>.</p>
<p>There are tireless Linux gamers dedicated to producing Steam reviews with Linux in mind (check out <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198184897393/recommended/" target="_blank">cbones</a>, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Houtworm91/recommended/" target="_blank">Houtworm</a>, and the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux</a> Steam group). However, I have come to realize that my faith in Steam reviews may have come at a cost, and perhaps you will to. Think of a game that you love and believe most gamers should love, but which has an incomprehensibly poor rating on Steam. If you came up with one, we share something. If you can't think of one, sort your Steam library by Steam review and take a look near the bottom to see what you can find. This article is about Rebel Galaxy Outlaw, its 'Mixed' steam rating, and the system of Steam reviews upon which many of us rely.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/997564941663272824gol1142.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/997564941663272824gol1142.gif"/></a><br/>
<small>You can sort your Steam library by rating to find games you have played with poor ratings.</small></p>
<p>Rebel Galaxy Outlaw (RGO) is the sequel to the indie hit Rebel Galaxy and a spiritual successor to the Privateer franchise. It's an open world space game with light simulation elements and an old-school Western feel that plays great on my aging Geforce 1070 via Proton at 4K with maxed settings. There are <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/910830" target="_blank">some reports on ProtonDB</a> that you need to install mfc42 from <a href="https://github.com/Matoking/protontricks" target="_blank">Protontricks</a>, with GE-Proton7-30 I did not need to.</p>
<p>We play as Juno, a cynical spacer down on her luck, on a meandering adventure through Dodge Sector: a collection of stellar systems replete with various unsavoury characters, most of whom speak in a distinctly Deep South accent. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series)" target="_blank">Firefly</a> is clearly a source of inspiration. You can fly trade routes, mine asteroids, take mercenary contracts, bounty hunt, smuggle contraband, and rob traders blind at gunpoint. The visual aesthetic is a delightful oversaturated kaleidoscope. It's well optimized and runs buttery smooth. The combat is smooth and satisfying. The writing and voice acting bounces between well-done and superb. It has a simulated economy with random events and fluctuating prices.  It has an embedded GIMP-like application for custom ship paintjobs. It has space station bars where you can play full-fledged minigames of dice-poker, 8-ball, slots, and Asteroids. You can flip twin birds to your enemies from inside your cockpit. It has the<a href="https://rebel-galaxy.com/the-music-of-rebel-galaxy-outlaw/" target="_blank"> best licensed soundtrack</a> of any game I have ever played, spread over seven different radio stations.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7wvYguV2baI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3e0afe9157b5b4d647ec5fa292d4db2b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7wvYguV2baI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p style="text-align:center"><small> Content warning: Watch Juno rob innocent traders, destroy dastardly pirates, and sometimes both at once. Cringe as Juno fails at Asteroids on an arcade cabinet. One very mild story spoiler.</small></p>
<p>And yet despite all this, RGO has a resoundingly 'Mixed' rating from gamers on Steam. No review bombs, no political brigading, no glaring technical issues or mentions of Epic exclusivity, just gamers that don't recommend RGO to their peers. The complaints in negative reviews vary wildly; the game is too different from the original, the controls are poor, the game is repetitive, too difficult, or too simple. It's tough to pin down what gamers didn't like. The gaming press, on the other hand, liked RGO considerably more. On <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/8101/rebel-galaxy-outlaw" target="_blank">OpenCritic</a>, 84% of critics recommend the game, with an average score of 77%.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4596940941663272824gol1142.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4596940941663272824gol1142.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There are plenty of criticisms in the Steam reviews that I agree with. The mouse and keyboard controls are not great (I play with a Steam Controller). There isn't the same amount of content as games like Elite; I'm 20 hour in to the game and I'm starting to upgrade to what I suspect is the highest equipment tier. The main story, while good, is spread a little thin. But given the positives, none of these complaints should be death-knells to a 30$ USD game that regularly goes on sale for 6$ USD. The mismatch between RGO's Steam rating and its positive qualities simply doesn't make sense. And what if RGO is not a one-off case, but one of countless games unjustly ignored because of poor Steam reviews?</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19122069541663272823gol1142.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19122069541663272823gol1142.jpg"/></a><br/>
  Privateer fans will feel right at home in the cockpit view</p>
<p>The wisdom of crowds is the idea that the Law of Large Numbers from statistics can be applied to people's individual decisions. It roughly states that given a large number of independent assessments, the mean of those assessments will be correct. To the (albeit limited) extent that the quality of a game is objective, one is tempted to take Steam reviews very seriously indeed; after all, regular gamers are probably less likely than journalists to be influenced by each other (independence) and there are a lot of gamers writing steam reviews (large numbers).</p>
<p>For me, Steam reviews have been something close to gospel. An 'Overwhelmingly Positive' score is nearly an automatic wishlist. My brain translates a 'Mostly Positive' into 'Move Past', and a 'Mixed' into 'Melanoma'. There are benefits to this extreme faith in Steam reviews. If you play and browse through a lot of games it's difficult to investigate each game thoroughly, and a Steam review score offers a simple heuristic for whether to linger on a game's store page or move on. However, since discovering how fantastic RGO is, I'm haunted by the idea that I've been missing out.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><small><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11996878401663272826gol1142.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11996878401663272826gol1142.png"/></a>A user-created paintjob for one of the ships in RGO, turning their cargo hauler into a mobile whiskey distillery for the premier in-game whiskey brand.</small></p>
<p>Steam reviews are also<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-developers-think-of-steam-reviews" target="_blank"> a mixed bag for developers</a>. For better or worse, Steam reviews make developers more responsive to the reviewer feedback. As the average gamer has more conservative taste than your average journalist, the Steam review system may makes developers more cautious when experimenting. The Steam review system likely favours lower-spec gamers and smaller gamer communities (like ours) compared with mainstream gaming journalism. A positive rating can be especially useful with smaller titles that don't have a lot of attention from gamer press or content creators. There are also unambiguous drawbacks to Steam reviews: buyers are more likely to complain than praise, trolling/brigading, out-of-date Early Access reviews, and the high playtime negative reviews (for bad reasons), to name a few.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2303836831663272826gol1142.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2303836831663272826gol1142.png"/></a><br/>
<small>  A couple of Elite: Dangerous reviews. One complains about the entirely optional multiplayer gamemode, the other is too busy playing Elite to elaborate.</small></p>
<p>Well, what's the solution? How do we as gamers balance the tempting simplicity of the Steam reviews system with its drawbacks, and the possibility of missing out on gems? Perhaps as you have guessed, there is no simple answer. All we can do is be aware of the limitations of the Steam review system and adjust our own mental processes accordingly. Personally, I will keep using Steam reviews as a useful tool in deciding how much time to spend looking into a game, but finding RGO has left me humbled. Now my brain reads 'Mixed' as 'Maybe another Rebel Galaxy Outlaw'. Which isn't all that bad; if the cost to finding another RGO is moving a little slower through my discovery queue, I think it's a fair trade.</p>
<p>Addendum: The only other game I own with a 'Mixed' rating that I loved is Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, but there I at least understand the Mixed rating: people wanted a horror game and got a walking simulator. I'm curious to hear what other people come up with.</p>

      <title>343 working on Halo: The Master Chief Collection anti-cheat for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems the hope for Easy Anti-Cheat being fully hooked up for Halo: The Master Chief Collection on Steam Deck and Linux desktop with Proton is not lost.</p>
<p>343 are actually working on it, but it seems like certain other games it has not been a simple case of just flicking a button and putting the files in the right places. On Reddit in reply to someone saying it's just ticking a box a 343 employee <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/xe2vd9/comment/ioj7b7r/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank">replied</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's a bit more involved than that, but let me check with a few folks and try to get back to you with a status update.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then in a follow-up post they said this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here's something more official from the developer on my team working on it.</p>
<p><em>We continue to work with Valve and EAC to enable EAC support on Steam Deck for Master Chief Collection. The addition of the easyanticheat_x64.so file is one of the prerequisites to getting this working, but there are ongoing compatibility issues that our three teams are collectively working to resolve.</em></p>
<p>I would love to provide more specifics, but the ongoing compatibility issues mean we only have a few pieces to the overall puzzle as everyone's working through their side.</p>
<p>Can confirm we ticked the box.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there you have it. While it doesn't work right now, they are actually working on it. Once I hear any more on it, I'll be sure to let you know. You can play single-player offline though in Halo MCC, although you probably <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/halo-the-master-chief-collection-broke-on-linux-and-steam-deck-heres-a-quick-fix/" target="_blank">still need to do my fix</a>.</p>
<p>At least <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/proton-experimental-gets-halo-infinite-working-plus-airborne-kingdom/" target="_blank">Halo Infinite works</a> though right?</p>

      <title>Cities: Skylines - Plazas &amp; Promenades expansion is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Making the best city-builder even better, the Cities: Skylines - Plazas &amp; Promenades expansion is out now.</p>
<p>Introducing special zoned pedestrian areas, allowing you to create walkable cities and car-free areas around their ideal metropolis. This expansion also brings specialized districts and city service buildings to Cities: Skylines, deepening the city simulator's management gameplay.</p>

<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pedestrian Streets: </strong>let your citizens walk freely on pedestrian-only streets! Place them in your city like any other road and create new green city centers free of most vehicles and pollution.</li>
<li><strong>Pedestrian Areas and New Policies: </strong>activate three area-specific policies for your city, including Slow Driving: all roads in the pedestrian area, except highways, get a speed limit of 20 km/hour. Sugar Ban: increases the average lifespan of citizens in the pedestrian area but decreases their happiness. Street Music: increases happiness and noise pollution in pedestrian commercial areas.</li>
<li><strong>District Specialization: </strong>we added 3 new district specializations: offices, high-density residential areas, and high-density commercial areas. Setting a specialization on a district affects all area squares in that district that will spawn buildings with a different visual appearance and a gameplay effect. Each specialization features 24 new modern wall-to-wall buildings!</li>
<li><strong>City Service Buildings: </strong>service buildings are important, but how about awesome-looking service buildings? Connect them to pedestrian areas by matching their visual style and provide services that contribute to good happiness values.</li>

      <title>Mesa gets a big CS:GO speedup, plus upcoming AMD RADV performance boost</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mesa, the open source driver set for Linux, has two rather interesting bits of work done recently that gamers might want to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>Firstly, for those of you who are big fans of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/18484" target="_blank">a patch</a> from developer Pierre-Eric Pelloux-Prayer was merged recently that was noted to reduce the startup time from "150s to 10s". CS:GO has historically taken forever to load up on Linux, although Valve did release a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/counter-strike-global-offensive-improves-startup-time-steam-deck-steam-input-improvement/" target="_blank">patch</a> recently that helped a little. So for AMD / Intel gamers on Linux, that should be a nice boost for the next Mesa release.</p>
<p>Unrelated but still interesting is that developer Mike Blumenkrantz has been back to <a href="https://www.supergoodcode.com/spaghetti-recipes/" target="_blank">blogging</a> about their work to improve various parts of Mesa. The result is <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/18499" target="_blank">a patch</a> that's not yet merged, that brings with it a "40% improved indexed draw throughput" and "50% improved non-indexed draw throughput" (in short: better performance for the AMD Vulkan driver). No specific workload or games were mentioned to directly benefit but as with all improvements, every little helps.</p>
<p>Always nice to see performance improvements for Linux drivers.</p>

      <title>Broken Sword 2 gets a big upgrade along with Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>The absolute classic that is Broken Sword 2 from Revolution Software just got a big surprise update, which should make it work a lot better in modern systems and the Steam Deck too! Originally released in 1997 and then Remastered in 2010 and now they're back to improve it yet again.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17957438681663232795gol1.jpg"/></p>

<li>Improved display resolution.</li>

      <title>The Wandering Village is absolutely mesmerizing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Wandering Village from Stray Fawn Studio, a game about building a village on the back of a massive moving creature has just entered Early Access with Native Linux support. Note: key provided by the developer.</p>
<p>I'm not going to hold back on you for this one and just jump straight to the point — this is without a doubt one of my <em>favourites</em> of this year. Something about it just feels slightly magical. City and village builders are a pretty crowded genre nowadays, with many different forms of it and yet Stray Fawn Studio have hit a home run here as far as I'm concerned. Admittedly though, the graphical style mixture took a brief bit of getting used to but after that it's smooth sailing. Or in this case, slowly walking along.</p>
<p>Inspired by Hayao Miyazaki’s Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, this is as unique as it gets.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5Cgs-WWqadM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a5f915e05e99d7e3cee7fed82e27713f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5Cgs-WWqadM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The first time your great big creature friend Onbu gets up and starts moving, you never forget it. Honestly, that is already going high up in the list of things I won't ever forget. One of those great moments in gaming where you just sit back and go "wow!". It's really something. That's not the only thing I won't forget…there's me needing some stone, so I casually tell my people to go harvest what clearly looks like stone. After a while Onbu starts getting pretty grumpy and the game keeps telling me about their spikes being torn out and it took me far <em>too</em> long to realise I wasn't mining <em>normal</em> stone but Onbu's spikes. I felt quite bad after that. Please forgive me Onbu.</p>
<p>It reminds me of classic Settlers spiced with a little of RimWorld with an extra layer of survival. That is perhaps the best way I can think of to describe it right now. Not only are you building up your village and keeping your people fed, you've got this massive creature to worry about too. What path you should take next, will Onbu get sick, when will Onbu decide to have a nap and will it be a problematic area to sleep in? So much to think on.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Build a unique village on the back of a giant creature known as Onbu.</li>
<li>Farm various crops to feed your villagers.</li>
<li>Send out foraging missions to gather rare resources.</li>
<li>Survive a variety of different biomes and events.</li>
<li>Build a relationship with a giant beast and influence its actions.</li>
<li>Research and construct a variety of different buildings.</li>
<li>Ecology/Biology inspired gameplay.</li>
<li>Unique art style with a blend of 3D and hand-drawn, hand-animated 2D graphics.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>An easy recommendation to go and pick it up right now. The Linux version has been running great!</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1121640/The_Wandering_Village/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Heroes of Might and Magic II &amp; III open source game engines get new releases</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is a bit of a double event. Not only has the Heroes of Might and Magic II game engine <a href="https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2" target="_blank">fheroes2</a> seen a new release, but a surprise update of <a href="https://github.com/vcmi/vcmi" target="_blank">VCMI</a> for Heroes of Might and Magic III was also released.</p>
<p>For VCMI, it had been multiple <em>years</em> since the last release and they're calling this the big 1.0 meaning it should be fully playable. Both projects have an aim to keep the games going on modern platforms, along with a number of modern enhancement tweaks to get them working and feeling just a bit nicer.</p>
<p>The new VCMI 1.0 release adds in:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Spectator mode was implemented through command-line options.</li>
<li>Some main menu settings get saved after returning to main menu - last selected map, save etc.</li>
<li>Restart scenario button should work correctly now.</li>
<li>Skyship Grail works now immediately after capturing without battle.</li>
<li>Lodestar Grail implemented.</li>
<li>Fixed Gargoyles immunity.</li>
<li>Big multiplayer improvements including loading and saving, restarting and hotseat support.</li>
<li>Improved modding support.</li>
<li>Lots of AI improvements.</li>
<li>Improvements to the random map generator.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And there's loads more, it's a huge release!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/552317821663162802gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/552317821663162802gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>On the other side is fheroes2 version 0.9.19 adding in:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Polish rendering of objects on Adventure Map.</li>
<li>Introduce instant finishing of battles and enhanced army exchange mechanics.</li>
<li>Improve AI to avoid endlessly wandering on one place, correct start resources for them and artifact evaluation.</li>
<li>Add Campaign difficulty.</li>
<li>Over <em><strong>30</strong></em> bugs are fixed since 0.9.18 release.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Roadwarden, one of the best modern text-adventures around is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For anyone who considers themselves even a remote fan of text-adventures, you should definitely take a look at Roadwarden. Developed by Moral Anxiety Studio, a solo development operation from Poland, and published by Assemble Entertainment.</p>
<p>This is a fully illustrated text-based RPG where you explore a changing and often hostile realm. A beautiful modern take on a genre that not many developers dare to enter these days. It's entirely driven by various scenarios presented through the text, with you making decisions based on how you wish to play. Choices really do matter here and you get to choose to spec your character between a number of professions including warrior, mage, or scholar based on what abilities are upgraded and it will affect what you can do.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_yFp4opzdGA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e3f49b53ebbb30e698843c5d94fa6ea6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_yFp4opzdGA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explore &amp; Change the World: </strong>Discover the secrets and face the challenges of a hostile fantasy world — inevitably unveiling its uniquely sinister history.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Grow With the Challenge: </strong></strong>Create your own background story, personal abilities, beliefs, and personality to shape your very own future as a Roadwarden.</li>
<li><strong>Classical RPG Attitude: </strong>Prepare yourself for an epic journey, either as a warrior, mage or scholar, and define your character‘s traits; like friendly, playful or intimidating, during interactions with various NPCs.</li>
<li><strong>Mysteries Unfold: </strong>Use your savvy and wiles when investigating and drawing your conclusions to understand the true nature of this world. Immerse yourself in detailed dialogues and sidequests with dozens of NPCs to gain their trust and support.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Honestly this is a beautiful gem of a game that deserves to be played.</p>
<p>Available to buy with Native Linux support from <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/roadwarden" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/roadwarden?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://moral-anxiety.itch.io/roadwarden" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1155970/Roadwarden/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.

      <title>Isonzo is a new WW1 FPS from the dev of Verdun out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Isonzo is the latest in the WW1 FPS series from the creator of Verdun and Tannenberg. It's out now and available with Native Linux support.</p>
<p>The WW1 Game Series seeks to bring the Great War closer than ever before, and after prequels Verdun and Tannenberg, it is now Isonzo's turn to take the stage. Starting today, the Italian and Austro-Hungarian armies will clash in Isonzo river valleys and the Alps of the Southern Front. So far, it seems like a mostly quite improved version of the previous games in a new setting. The UI is also much cleaner than before.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LYmuhQmRb4M"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c14e7f7daa03abd9dbea9ca206e13b51.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LYmuhQmRb4M" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While the game seems to perform well in my testing, there do seem to be some issues. For example, it launched with scopes completely broken on Windows (which I believe they've now fixed) and for the Linux version, it looks like shadows aren't working properly so everything is a bit too bright. Initially I thought that was NVIDIA-specific, but some have seen it on AMD too. Checking it with Proton, it seems to work properly there, so it's an issue in the Native port.</p>
<p>I'll be checking back on it again sometime soon to video it and give more thorough thoughts, as my key only came in on release day.</p>
<p>From the press email: “We’ve worked on Isonzo for over three years now with a passionate development team and several historians. We’re all very excited to finally put this title out there for all to experience! But our Italian adventure doesn’t end here - as with our earlier games we have great plans for new content beyond launch. First up on the roadmap: German troops!” says Jos Hoebe, Creative Director and co-founder of the WW1 Game Series.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/isonzo?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1556790/Isonzo/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Valheim is getting crossplay with an update now in testing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Iron Gate have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/3398551594417384215" target="_blank">announced</a> that Valheim is set for crossplay, with an update now available in testing to ensure you can play with friends anywhere. This is great, as Valheim is coming to consoles next year.</p>
<p>They've been working with a team from Piktiv, to "make sure the game looks and feels the same regardless of what platform you’re using". For Steam players, nothing much changes but it does mean you will be able to play with others elsewhere when the time comes. For dedicated servers, the big change is that it will have an option to support crossplay but it remains optional and you will be able to use either an IP address or a special server-specific code.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6633860821663153676gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Main changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Crossplay support added.</li>
<li>‘Manage saves’ GUI added so that it’s easier for players to restore/remove saves &amp; backups.</li>
<li>Minor network optimization for in-game hosting (Less demanding for the host when other players are in the game at the same time).</li>
<li>‘Join Game’ tab has been updated. Players can now add favourite servers, and see if a server is running, and if they support crossplay or not.</li>
<li>Players can now use the parameter ‘-crossplay’ while running Dedicated servers to support crossplay. When using this parameter, the backend will be running Playfab instead of Steamworks. (A ‘Join code’ will appear when you join a Dedicated server supporting crossplay. Players can use this code to join the server).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The update is in the Public Test branch of Valheim, and may therefore be unstable. To access it you need a password which is in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/3398551594417384215" target="_blank">announcement</a>.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>EA has just recently given out more information on their upcoming EA AntiCheat (EAAC), not to be confused with Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC), because EA are apparently terribly at naming.</p>
<p>In their new <a href="https://www.ea.com/security/news/eaac-deep-dive" target="_blank">Deep Dive</a>, they went over various details about their new EAAC and how it will affect their games. The first big note is that it will be kernel-mode, which is usually something that doesn't play nicely (or at all) with Linux and so this could be some bad news for the Steam Deck too. Not only that, it's an anti-tamper tech too.</p>
<p>Take FIFA 22 for example, it's playable on Linux and has a "Playable" Steam Deck rating. However, FIFA 23 will be launching in October and guess what? It will have EA's new AntiCheat. So, this might mean it won't work at all.</p>
<p>It won't end up in every game from EA though, as they said in the post they will work with each studio to determine their needs. It also mentions for some titles they may only use "user-mode protections" (no kernel-level stuff) or just not have any at all.</p>
<p>A worrying trend though, with more and more anti-cheat going kernel-side which is almost always developed just for Windows. It's problematic for another reason though, like the <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/h/ransomware-actor-abuses-genshin-impact-anti-cheat-driver-to-kill-antivirus.html" target="_blank">recent issue</a> with Genshin Impact where the anti-cheat driver was abused to disable anti-virus.</p>
<p>What do you think to this news?</p>

      <title>Your Steam Deck deserves a DeckMate</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The creator of the <a href="https://deckmate.me/" target="_blank">DeckMate</a> system sent over a bundle of their accessories for me to try and I was instantly sold on the whole thing.</p>
<p>It's not one thing but rather a <em>collection</em> of accessories, that all hook into a bracket that you attach directly to the back of the Steam Deck. You can get a Wall Mount, a Stand, a VESA Mount, Universal Adapters that you can stick to anything and more. A system I had only heard of recently and when the creator got in touch, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to give it a go.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10197145431663075194gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10197145431663075194gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>I've seen a number of comments across the web mentioning how it would have been better if the Steam Deck had a built-in kickstand. While perhaps true in some ways, one you add-on after has a lot of benefits. You can remove it and replace it easily and the stand that you can get for the DeckMate is frankly brilliant. Sturdy, easy to clip on and easy to remove to put it away. The other accessories you can get are equally as good.</p>
<p>I'm a serious fan. The new home for one of my Steam Decks is now sat attached to my wall ready to clip it off whenever I need it — no longer will i worry about dropping a drink on it.</p>
<p>Check out my video demo of a few bits of the DeckMate system:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nl2o0mFkLzA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4addbdfd5d591374080bb47cc64e8957.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nl2o0mFkLzA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Ridiculously easy to use, good construction and an easy recommendation to go and pick up.</p>
<p>At some point I'm hoping to have a chat with the creator, as some form of interview so keep an eye out for that but I wanted to get this out first because it's just that good and fully deserves some more attention on it.</p>

      <title>W4 Games raised $8.5 million USD to support Godot Engine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://w4games.com" target="_blank">W4 Games</a> is a new company from the creator of <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> along with long-time contributors, and now they've managed to gain plenty of funding.</p>
<p>As a brief reminder, the idea of the new company was to provide commercial products and services like support plans and access to more restricted markets (like consoles) and generally support Godot Engine development. So all improvements made as part of W4 Games will go into Godot directly whenever possible.</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://w4games.com/2022/09/13/w4-games-raises-8-5-million-to-support-godot-engine-growth/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, they've announced $8.5 million dollars from a "seed funding investment round" (a first ever round of funding for a company) led by OSS Capita, which is so far the world's only investor platform targeting commercial open source and LUX Capital who specialize in funding science and technology ventures. They also had help from the founder of Red Hat and Sisu Game Ventures, an early-stage venture capital fund focused on games.</p>
<p>They said that the funds will "be used to expand W4 Games’ core team and accelerate the development of a suite of products and services for the Godot ecosystem, enabling all developers to create and publish games and applications on all major platforms" with a roadmap planned to be shown at GDC 2023.</p>
<p>For a free and open source game engine, this is hopefully very welcome news to help put it along side the much bigger teams from Unity, Unreal and others.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Iron Gate assure us it's coming but they're not quite ready to set a date for The Mistlands update to Valheim. So we don't have a date but we do have some <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/4649425839615258188" target="_blank">more info</a>, plus some extra screenshots.</p>
<p>They mentioned how they're tweaking progression for Mistlands, to ensure it feels rewarding. They've put plenty of work into making some creepy cave dungeons but they needed a real purpose. So now they've added a "special extractor item" that you will use to process a new Black Core but they won't say what it's for yet.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7975137431663072380gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7975137431663072380gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>If you make a new character, there's also going to be some new hairstyle options too:</p>

<p>And of course there's going to be some fancy new outfits to go along with it all too:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20129401351663072424gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20129401351663072424gol1.jpg"/></a></p>

      <title>This Vampire Survivors styled game has you defend against pigeons pooping on your house</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pigeons, they can be a menace flying around pooping everywhere and this developer decided to make a game styled like Vampire Survivors about it. It's called "Don't Shit On My #!$@&amp; Roof" and I don't think it needs much in the way of an explanation does it? Your clearly angry about the Pigeons and so you're taking matters into your own hands.</p>
<p>The gameplay is very much Vampire Survivors, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/a-genre-is-born-horde-games/" target="_blank">a horde shooter</a> where you don't directly control the weapons. Here you do actually aim some of them though, so it's a little more like a twin-stick shooter but with automatic weapon firing. When you level up you get to pick new abilities, and continue surviving against the flock of Pigeons for as long as you can.</p>
<p>As low-budget as it looks, just like all the others, it still has that comedy element here that might set it apart. I'll be giving it a go I think.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qgJf6eJWg9k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0ffc549008acda279d9862d3f0f1a453.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qgJf6eJWg9k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2143950/Dont_Shit_On_My__Roof/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>. It will release into Early Access with Native Linux support on September 27th.</p>

      <title>Valve dev shows more Steam Deck prototypes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to see what could have been? Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais has revealed some working prototype units and they look pretty interesting.</p>
<p>Writing on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1569404939864264704" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, Griffais mentioned "As part of the Asia launch press event, we made the design lab into a showroom of development history. My favorite are the playable prototypes: bootable Deck family tree from mid-2019 to now, from a couple of hand-built units onto gradual mass production."</p>
<p>Here's the pictures:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14121455861663055004gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14121455861663055004gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/632151151663055009gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/632151151663055009gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Must admit, the one with white corners does look pretty sweet. Fun to see the iteration they did on the design here but I think overall we got the best of it in the released model.</p>
<p>In a follow-up <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1569445637799956480" target="_blank">post</a>, Griffais mentioned "The best part is that they (mostly) all still boot, serving as an exciting reminder of how far things have come since.</p>
<p>This one has a Picasso APU, at about half of the GPU power of the final Deck. The flatter ergo was an interesting experiment and taught us a ton about comfort."</p>
<p>That post also came with a short video to show one of the older devices working:</p>
<div class="ckeditor-html5-video" style="text-align: center;">
<video controls="controls" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8930173391663055236gol1.mp4"> </video>
</div>
<p> </p>
<p>On top of that, the official OnDeck Twitter account has also been <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeckJP/status/1569506147635060737" target="_blank">showing off</a> a massive Steam Deck for the Tokyo Games Show and it looks pretty fun.</p>

<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-17-the-llama-master/" target="_blank">Part 17: The Llama Master</a></strong></p>
<p>In writing this series I have spent a great deal of time searching eBay for older Linux games to cover, and one night I came across a curious sight. Although being sold for Windows, I found a listing for a physical copy of the free game <em>Circus Linux!</em> as published by Alten8. At first I figured it would just be another keep case in my collection with "Linux" on the cover, but upon inspecting the contents of the disc, it soon became apparent just how cheap this retail release was.</p>
<p>All that Alten8 seems to have done was package the source directory with a Windows binary already built, with the install instructions urging you to "copy and paste the folder CIRCUS from the CD" and then click on the circuslinux.exe file. With the source code included I decided it would be trivial to also build the game for Linux, and in fact the included INSTALL.txt file even tells you how to compile and install the game on Linux with GNU Automake.</p>
<p>You do need the relevant SDL development libraries as packaged by your distribution, and unfortunately Alten8 did seem to strip away some of the game's documentation files, meaning that the build will fail at first. To get around this I just used the "touch AUTHORS.txt COPYING.txt CHANGES.txt README-SDL.txt" command to create blank placeholders, but you really are just better off grabbing the source code yourself online apart from the novelty.</p>
<p><em>Circus Linux!</em> itself is a remake of the older <em>Circus Atari</em>, which was itself a home console version of the even older <em>Circus</em> arcade cabinet by Taito. <em>Circus </em>was a block breaker game inspired by <em>Breakout</em>, with the main change being that the game is now simulating a teeterboard act, with the blocks becoming balloons and your paddle a seesaw. This does have a marked difference on the gameplay, as you need to ensure your clown lands on the correct end of the teeterboard.</p>
<p><em>Circus Linux!</em> goes all in on the theme in a way that the original Atari version never could, sporting bright colourful animated graphics and fun upbeat music and sound effects, showing off the power of the then still fresh Simple DirectMedia Layer. One aggravation is that the mouse can leave the window when not playing full screen, but the game does at least support a number of screen modes, including a lower graphics setting for less powerful computers.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6219288891662950103gol6.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6219288891662950103gol6.jpeg"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13407756201662955891gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13407756201662955891gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>Needless to say even on full the game did not cause my Pentium III 500 Mhz to break a sweat, but I appreciate the option. Beyond this the game features a number of gameplay modifiers: "Barriers" which can block your shots, "Bouncy Balloons" that can cause the clown to careen back down on contact, and "Clear All" that demands every balloon be popped on a stage before proceeding to the next screen.</p>
<p>Like most arcade games <em>Circus Linux!</em> is a test of both your dexterity and endurance, challenging you to hold on to your lives for as long as possible while racking up the highest possible score. The game also has support for local hot seat multiplayer, either in a cooperative mode where you both get the chance to help one another pop balloons, or an adversarial mode where you compete to earn the highest possible score. </p>
<p>Perhaps more compelling than <em>Circus Linux!</em> on its own is the legacy of its creator Bill Kendrick and his development house New Breed Software, a prolific figure in the free and open source gaming scene. He is most famous for starting work on the platformer S<em>uperTux</em> and crafting the drawing program<em> Tux Paint</em>, helping to popularize Tux as a gaming icon with others in the Tux4Kids initiative, all alongside the work of people like Steve Baker and Ingo Ruhnke.</p>
<p>Bill Kendrick has also created a number of other arcade conversions, edutainment, and experimental software toys which he ports to the widest possible range of platforms, all of which can still be found on the New Breed Software website. Five of them, <em>X-Bomber,</em> <em>Mad Bomber</em>,<em> 3D Pong</em>, <em>ICBM3D</em>, and <em>Gem Drop X,</em> were included on <em>100 Great Linux Games. </em>He even made a chat bot called <em>Virtual Kendrick</em>, inspired by a comment that he should port himself to the Zaurus handheld.</p>
<p>I have avoided it long enough, but I am feeling the itch to play a first person shooter again. As has already been made clear Linux has never had a shortage of them, but some are a lot harder to find today than others. The next game I am to cover is one of the rarest of them all, due to its limited physical distribution, and an attachment to a Belgian company now more known for maintaining an operating system than porting games.</p>

      <title>I hate to admit it but I like Disney Dreamlight Valley — works well on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well here's a game I didn't expect to like or actually be any good. It's Disney Dreamlight Valley from Gameloft, a game that's a mixture of Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley but for Disney fans.</p>
<p>Gameloft aren’t a particularly well-liked developer, especially on Steam where their previous releases were free to play with lots of micro-transactions. At least in this case though, they seem to be doing <em>much</em> better than usual. It's also currently a paid game but once it leaves Early Access it will be <em>free</em> to play.</p>
<p>So far it runs well on Steam Deck and Linux with Proton Experimental, although I found that the default Proton 7 now and then decided to crash, like during / after cut-scenes which has been smooth sailing with Experimental. I've been playing it with the screen locked to 45Hz from the performance menu with Graphics set to Medium, Shadows on Low and Distance Quality on Low which has given a mostly smooth experience. With that, you get between 2-3 hours, and when performance does dip down because we’re locking the screen to 45 you won’t feel it so much or even notice many of the smaller dips like you would if you were sat on 60Hz.</p>
<p>Here's some gameplay on Steam Deck and me talking about it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wuGoNdyzBRk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6e58e1d16a15c243e88a61edb7600f0f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wuGoNdyzBRk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On my Fedora Linux desktop, it has also been running very nicely on Ultra details which is not unexpected considering I'm running an NVIDIA 2080 Ti and an AMD Ryzen 5800x. Nice to see it running well across the board though!</p>
<p>A game I didn't expect to like but I definitely do. Originally a game I planned to have with music in the background, or some YouTube videos playing but honestly, it's started sucking away my actual proper attention because I want to keep going in and doing more quests. The game quite nicely mixes together a little adventuring, questing, exploration and tending to your little garden.</p>
<p>Gameloft mentioned that the full version will have a completed main storyline but they're not announcing a whole lot about it yet other than it having "memorable characters from Mickey &amp; Friends, Disney’s The Lion King, The Little Mermaid, and Moana, Disney and Pixar’s Toy Story, WALL•E, and more". There's already plenty of Disney characters to meet too so Disney fans can have plenty of fun and you can even take a snap of your character with them and share it across social networks.</p>
<p>You can find the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1401590/Disney_Dreamlight_Valley/" target="_blank">game on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Valve are still fixing up Left 4 Dead 2, over 10 years after release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve seem to be continuing to give some love to their older titles, with Left 4 Dead 2 recently getting a nice bug-fix release. This is one of their older Native Linux ports, that came to Linux officially back in 2013 and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/06/left-4-dead-2-updated-with-vulkan-support-thanks-to-dxvk/" target="_blank">back in 2021</a> they updated it with Vulkan support powered by DXVK.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10312908351663001977gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/550/view/3276953770279922618" target="_blank">latest update</a> went out Friday, September 9th that contained this improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a shader crash with Vulkan on Intel.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash on Linux at the main menu.</li>
<li>Fixed text corruption in the Mutations menu on Linux.</li>
<li>Return the model index from script precache calls.</li>
<li>Added script function "GetModelIndex"</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Great to see Linux in particular see improvements, although not surprising since they of course want to see it continue to run nicely on the Steam Deck since that runs SteamOS Linux.</p>
<p>In other news, Left 4 Dead 2 Mobile recently appeared but it turned out to be something of a scam and it honestly <a href="https://twitter.com/gabefollower/status/1566775780738211843" target="_blank">looked pretty hilarious</a> because it was so bad.</p>

      <title>Distrobox can open up the Steam Deck to a whole new world</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://distrobox.privatedns.org/" target="_blank">Distrobox</a> is a way to use pretty much any other Linux distribution in your terminal, along with full GUI apps and now it supports the Steam Deck with SteamOS too.</p>
<p>The update released a few days ago had some issues (<a href="https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/issues/401" target="_blank">#1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/issues/409" target="_blank">#2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/issues/403" target="_blank">#3</a>), which I reported to the developer and they've since fixed up the installers and the documentation for Steam Deck. So with that in mind, I took it for a spin to see how it works and I've been thoroughly impressed with how easy it is.</p>
<p>It gives you a container system to install other distributions. So for the likes of SteamOS on the Steam Deck, without messing with the root filesystem, you can install something like Ubuntu and access everything it has available. Useful for software not available via Flathub (Discover) or elsewhere.</p>
<p>Here's a short video overview of the basic setup and running some apps from Ubuntu on Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kkkyNA31KOA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c9fec03545acd687a8ff4e8c8a459b8f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kkkyNA31KOA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><strong>Guide</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/blob/main/docs/posts/install_rootless.md" target="_blank">official link</a>):</p>
<p>First up, run these install scripts one after the other in a terminal app (like <em>Konsole</em> on Steam Deck):</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/89luca89/distrobox/main/install | sh -s -- --prefix ~/.local</code></p>
<p><code class="inline-code">curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/89luca89/distrobox/main/extras/install-podman | sh -s -- --prefix ~/.local</code></p>
<p>Next up, we need to add the directories it uses into our .bashrc file, so we can run commands as normal in terminal. In your .bashrc file (found in your Home folder), open it in a text editor and add these to the bottom:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH</code></p>
<p><code class="inline-code">export PATH=$HOME/.local/podman/bin:$PATH</code></p>
<p>Now you can install a Linux distribution with Distrobox, with Ubuntu as the example (in terminal again):</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">distrobox create -i ubuntu:20.04</code></p>
<p>Then once done, you can enter it:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">distrobox enter ubuntu-20-04</code></p>
<p>This is where the fun begins. Now you can install or do whatever you like, inside Ubuntu. However, you also need to add this to your .bashrc file to run graphical applications / games on Steam Deck:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">xhost +si:localuser:$USER</code></p>

      <title>Defend humanity from an alien organism in puzzle game Xenospore</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A mixture of strategy and puzzling elements together, Xenospore is a currently free game about defending humanity by prevent a strange alien organism from spreading too far.</p>
<p>It's a tile-based game where you watch how the organism spreads, and try to prevent it. Each turn the alien spreads, and each turn you get to pick a tile to destroy or perhaps cleans as you desperately try to protect the housing. It has a wonderful dark atmosphere to it and the gameplay really does suck you right in.</p>
<p>Simple idea but styled wonderfully and the levels do make you think.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9163329811662980204gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9163329811662980204gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Quite a surprise to come across it on Twitter recently, as a game made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot</a> that I hadn't heard of before.</p>
<p>The developer is currently working on a big new update for it too including explosive chain-reaction tiles, a stronger type of Xenospore and various other gameplay enhancements to give you more to do. The update will also have some quality of life improvements too like a fast turn option.</p>
<p>You can grab it <a href="https://avivlevy.itch.io/xenospore" target="_blank">free from itch.io</a>. Play via the browser or scroll down the page for a download.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 7-33 and Wine-GE-Proton 7-28 are out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two very popular open source compatibility layer projects from developer 'GloriousEggroll' are out now, with updates to both GE-Proton and Wine-GE-Proton too.</p>
<p>GE-Proton is the popular community version of Valve's Proton translation layer, that includes extra fixes often before Valve have chance to test them fully and other fixes they can't perhaps legally do. Wine-GE on the other hand is for use outside of Steam, for projects like Lutris and Heroic.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton7-33" target="_blank">GE-Proton 7-33</a> brings these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>wine updated to latest bleeding edge, pulls in more fixes for gta v, rdr2, verified bioshock remastered 1/2 + infinite work with 2k launcher</li>
<li>dxvk updated to latest git</li>
<li>vkd3d updated to latest git</li>
<li>pulled in latest proton script changes from upstream</li>
<li>fixed issue with fall guys protonfix trying to replace incorrect command name (Thanks Corben78)</li>
<li>removed Divinity Original Sin 2 launcher protonfix as it's no longer needed<br/>
<strong>NOTE</strong>: for Divinity Original Sin 2 you will need to do the following to return the game files back to normal:
	<blockquote>
<p>Open the game folder<br/>
	delete the 'bin' symlink<br/>
	rename 'bin-bak' as 'bin'<br/>
	delete the 'Data' symlink<br/>
	rename 'Data-bak' as 'Data'<br/>
	Then in steam verify the integrity of the game files.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As for <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/wine-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton7-28" target="_blank">Wine-GE-Proton 7-28</a> here's what's new there:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="markdown-body my-3" data-pjax="true" data-test-selector="body-content" data-view-component="true">
<ul>
<li>wine updated to latest bleeding edge, pulls in more fixes for gta v, rdr2, verified bioshock remastered 1/2 + infinite work with 2k launcher</li>
<li>validated standalone RDR2 works -- lutris installers will be updated to use this version</li>
<li>validated GTA V was at least able to go online and in single player without any noticeable issues. Proton's patches are still in testing so the results may not be the same for everyone: <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/37#issuecomment-1242570089" target="_blank">https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/37#issuecomment-1242570089</a> -- lutris installers will be updated to use this version</li>
<li>validated BioShock 1/2 remastered + infinite work with 2k launcher</li>
</ul>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>How to install them?</p>
<p>For Wine-GE and the Heroic Games Launcher, it comes with a built in Wine Manager where you can download them and then you can adjust each game individually in their main settings:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3341212781662972384gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3341212781662972384gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19723196231662972383gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19723196231662972383gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For GE-Proton, you can simply use the ProtonUp-Qt tool that we've covered here numerous times now. See the previous <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/protonup-qt-got-upgraded-heres-how-to-use-it-on-steam-deck-and-linux/" target="_blank">GOL Guide on GE-Proton with ProtonUp</a>.</p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher version 2.4.3 is another critical bug-fix release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The open source <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> for running Epic Games and GOG has another important bug-fix release now available.</p>
<p>Version 2.4.3 continues the fixing from the last version, to deal with Epic Games changing things behind the scenes so this should get everything working again for Linux and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Here's what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed games from Epic games not downloading due to HTTP Error. It seems Epic broke something on their side again.</li>
<li>Fixed long issue with GOG games getting progress stuck while the game was being downloaded.</li>
<li>Fix some errors on Windows that was making Heroic to break on start on some machines.</li>
<li>Adds 7 new languages: Azerbaijani, Basque, Belarussian, Bosnian, Romanian, Norwergian Bokmål and Slovak.</li>
<li>Other minor fixes and improvements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2604674051662971576gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2604674051662971576gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Hopefully Epic won't continually change their API, as it will become quite a nuisance for both users and the Heroic developers to keep fixing it up. As mentioned previously though, it's a reminder that sticking to Steam (and legit Steam Key stores) is likely your best bet for Linux and the Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Windows compatibility layer Wine 7.17 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is the compatibility layer that allows you to run various Windows applications and games on Linux (and forms part of Steam Play Proton). Once a year or so, a new stable release is made but the development versions are usually fine to use.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.winehq.org/announce/7.17" target="_blank">Wine 7.17</a> is a quieter release than most with only two new main highlights, plus 18 bug fixes.</p>
<p>Here's what's new in Wine 7.17:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>High Unicode planes support in DirectWrite.</li>
<li>Some work towards Wow64 support in the Vulkan driver.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The bugs noted as solved include issues with: Earth 2150, Endless Online, Summoner, Battle Realms: Zen Edition, Riot Vanguard, Liar-soft Visual Novels, BioShock and various other miscellaneous bug fixes.</p>
<p>Be sure to try out <a href="https://usebottles.com/" target="_blank">Bottles</a>, it's what I use on desktop and Steam Deck and it keeps on getting better constantly. It's a great way to manage various apps and games with Wine.</p>

      <title>Voxel Doom brings voxel goodness to the original DOOM</title>
      <author>anewson</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I am ashamed to admit that I never played much of the original DOOM when it came out or in the decades since. When I saw the Voxel Doom project I downloaded it and decided to finally give the old classic an honest try.</p>
<p>Voxel Doom is a mod for GZDoom, the open source implementation of the DOOM engine, which runs natively on Linux. The mod replaces 2D characters and props from Doom with fully 3D voxel-based models, made possible by what I can only assume is witchcraft on the part of the mod developer, <a href="https://twitter.com/DanielWienerson" target="_blank">@cheelo</a>. Here's a quick video of me doing the famous first mission. If you want to backseat and tell me where the shotgun is I will appreciate it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5UcCGKkGP_I"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ea522412f43a8ca42734968e4335ce14.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5UcCGKkGP_I" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The effect is actually quite subtle and does an amazing job at preserving the original feel of DOOM (as far as I can tell). So far my favourite enemies are the Pinkies. I love their vacant faces, snorting noises, and how they waddle towards you with the sincere intent to do violence. I won't show the dead Pinkie model but it's truly something to behold.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2312412751662752780gol1142.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2312412751662752780gol1142.gif"/></a></p>
<p><br/>
To play Voxel Doom you will need the original DOOM WAD file, which you can get from purchasing the game on your platform of choice. A quick note for those without drag-and-drop file managers: you can launch the mod with the command <code class="inline-code">gzdoom -file /path/to/cheello_voxels.zip</code></p>
<p>You can download GZDoom <a href="https://zdoom.org/downloads" target="_blank">from their website</a> and the Voxel Doom project from <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/doom-voxel-project" target="_blank">moddb</a>.</p>

      <title>Valve opens official Steam Deck repair centers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need to get your Steam Deck fixed up? Well, you no longer have to do it yourself as Valve have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3398545888823804940" target="_blank">officially opened</a> up some repair centers. If you need to send off your Steam Deck for any reason, it will now go to one of their specialized repair shops.</p>
<p>If your issue is under warranty, Valve will continue fixing free of charge. However, you now have the option of getting out of warranty repairs done professionally with a charge depending on what the problem is, instead of having to wait for iFixit to have parts and doing it yourself.</p>
<p>As they explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If your unit begins to develop an intermittent button input issue (rare, but it sometimes happens), contact <a class="Link eventbbcodeparser_Link_3I3zk" href="https://help.steampowered.com/wizard/HelpWithSteamDeck" target="_blank">support</a>, who will help get your Steam Deck shipped to one of our repair centers. Our team will diagnose it, replace the button, test and calibrate the unit, then send the fixed unit back to you, free of charge – as this is covered by warranty.</li>
<li>If your dog gnaws on your thumbstick and breaks it, this is not covered by warranty. Previously your only option was DIY repair, but now you'll now be able to contact support, who will supply instructions to ship your Steam Deck to one of our repair centers. Our team will take a look and offer to replace and calibrate your thumbstick for a fee. This process will also be available once your warranty expires.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This just continues to show how all-in Valve are on the future of the Steam Deck, like the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/steam-deck-2-is-absolutely-coming-new-booklet-from-valve-confirms/" target="_blank">recent confirmation</a> that there will be future Steam Decks (like a Steam Deck 2?).</p>

      <title>Prison Architect is getting a &#39;Free for life&#39; update (and yes it&#39;s free)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Double Eleven and Paradox Interactive just announced a new free update coming to Prison Architect named 'Free for life'. The update will release on September 12th. Sounds like it's going to be quite a useful update too, although it doesn't really contain anything huge it's still a few welcome additions for this 7 year old game (yes it's really that old).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3728311111662725695gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3728311111662725695gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here's what they've said will be in the new update:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Prisoner Log and improved Scheduler</p>
<ul>
<li>Always be aware of what's happening in your prison with the new Prisoner Log. Check your inmates’ activities, uncover misconducts ahead of time and keep track of who gets released, reformed, or reoffended. We also improved the game’s Scheduler, adding new options and settings in the palm of your hand.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Save and Reuse</p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever you create a new prison, a new policy, or a quick build, you’ll be able to save them in your Preferences. Save time setting up your prison next time you wish to start afresh!</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Aging is caring</p>
<ul>
<li>Now inmates are divided into Young, Senior and Elderly. After spending an extended period of time in your prison, they will change both visually and functionally. They will also develop different needs compared to younger inmates.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">New Guards ranks</p>
<ul>
<li>Hired guards will now arrive at your prison unranked and will need to work hard to get promoted to Officer and Specialist Officer. Their commitment will be paid off though, as each increase in rank will provide additional perks.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Improved building and planning tools</p>
<ul>
<li>The planning menu is getting renewed with lots of new options for fences and walls. Moreover, when “drawing” your walls and using construction options, you’ll see a new cursor-based tooltip stating the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the room, along with the planned cost for the currently drawn selection.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see them continue to improve it after acquiring the rights from Introversion <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/01/paradox-interactive-have-purchased-the-rights-to-prison-architect-from-introversion/" target="_blank">back in early 2019</a>.</p>
<p>You can buy Prison Architect from <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/prison_architect?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/prison-architect?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/233450/Prison_Architect/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Fight against socks and sandals, grey suits and more in Fashion Police Squad</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What do people have against socks and sandals exactly? Fashion Police Squad is a funny new first-person shooter from Mopeful Games and No More Robots and might be one of my favourite games this year. Note: key provided by the publisher.</p>
<p><em>Runs perfectly on Steam Deck and desktop Linux with Proton 7 out of the box.</em></p>
<p>Some first-person shooters have you fight against demons, or just various types of people with guns. Fashion Police Squad is different. Instead, you're cleaning up the streets full of dull people in suits or people committing fashion crimes that just look <em>too</em> cool.</p>
<p>This is a comedy shooter that does not take itself - or anything - seriously. You can quite literally slap fashion sense into people with a glowing glove. It's absolutely hilarious and one of the few games to make me properly chuckle out loud to myself while playing it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lRN_tYlnGQU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/168be1f3beaa8a0709a01b59c8790f23.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lRN_tYlnGQU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While it is a shooter and you are firing weapons at people, it's also not violent because your guns don't exactly fire bullets. You're giving people what they need — a fancy new look, or sorting out whatever fashion crimes come your way. Different types of enemies require a different approach and it's just brilliant. Find someone in a suit that doesn't fit? Pull out a different gun to blast their clothes full of pins and needles and sort them out. You also get to whip things with a belt too and it's hilarious.</p>

      <title>Intel reveals Arc Graphics A-Series desktop GPU specifications</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As Intel ready up their dedicated desktop graphics, they have released fresh details on the specifications so here's what's about to arrive. Released in a short Q&amp;A video, I'll spare you diving in with the details right here but the video is below if you wish to listen in.</p>
<p>Just like their CPUs they will be split across different tiers including Intel Arc 3, 5, and 7 graphics. With 7 beiong "High Performance Gaming", 5 being "Advanced Gaming" and 3 being "Enhanced Gaming". Here's the specs:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17700339751662721273gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17700339751662721273gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>When it comes to the higher-end though, they're split between 8GB and 16GB. Intel said that partners will mostly ship with 8GB but their Limited Edition GPU doubles it to 16GB. That's about the only difference they've revealed in the line-up. They also said that each card is fully features with HDR, variable refresh XeSS, video encoding for AV1 and other popular codecs.</p>
<p>You can see their full video below:</p>

      <title>The new Library Mode in Wine manager Bottles looks awesome</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's an update I missed recently somehow. <a href="https://usebottles.com/" target="_blank">Bottles</a>, the application you can use for managing various Windows games and apps installed with Wine had a fresh update with a fancy new Library Mode. Where do these developers find the time to constantly improve Bottles? Amazing.</p>
<p>This new Library Mode was previously an experimental feature that's been promoted to stable for everyone. What is it? In short: it allows you to view <u>all</u> the games and apps installed across different Bottles (Bottles is the name of the app, and the name of the spaces you install things into).</p>
<p>Here's how it looks:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18206564991662713434gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18206564991662713434gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>So no more swapping between various Bottles to find where everything is, as it's all available in one fancy place. Nice.</p>
<p>The 2022.8.28 also solves numerous bugs, moves around some legacy options and upgrades a couple of the Wine versions used they call "Runners" like Soda, Caffe and Vaniglia with plenty of improvements based on newer versions of Vanilla Wine and Valve Proton.</p>

      <title>Crusader Kings III: Friends &amp; Foes out with free update and Free Weekend</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Crusader Kings III has a big free update out now, plus the Crusader Kings III: Friends &amp; Foes event pack is out now. You can also try the game free this weekend.</p>
<p>This event pack adds in over one hundred new events spread across the game, along with several new pieces added to the musical score. From what Paradox said about it: "Over one hundred new events and event chains which expand upon the relationships you have with your family, friends, rivals, best friends, and nemeses. Experience a much more varied pool of random events every year, as well as specific heart-wrenching (or heart-stabbing!) reactive content for when you, as an example, lie dying, or when someone close to you takes part in a foreign battle."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="jOFJ4TfJ1tg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b257bfbd5713a7b1fd9398625495cb0d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/jOFJ4TfJ1tg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's quite a lot new free for everyone too including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added an additional set of 12 new Childhood Personality Events, this will make certain personality trait combinations much more likely to appear, and also makes certain combinations possible that previously weren’t. The trait combinations are balanced in such a way that the choice for you as a guardian should be more interesting:
	<ul>
<li>diligent, gregarious, temperate</li>
<li>zealous, ambitious, sadistic</li>
<li>shy, paranoid, craven</li>
<li>lazy, gluttonous, compassionate</li>
<li>lustful, chaste</li>
<li>just, greedy, callous</li>
<li>humble, cynical, content</li>
<li>vengeful, deceitful, calm</li>
<li>generous, fickle, arrogant</li>
<li>forgiving, trusting, patient</li>
<li>honest, arbitrary, impatient</li>
<li>brave, stubborn, wrathful</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When a Friend, Best Friend, Rival, Nemesis, Lover, or Soulmate relation is formed, a reason will now be stated. For example: “Kaiser Heinrich and King Philippe shared an excellent feast in Aachen” or “Basileus Andreas swore to avenge the death of Aristarchos, who was slain in battle by Ulf Munk”. These reasons can be viewed for any character in the Relationships tab in the Character Window, presuming the relation is public.</li>
<li>Added relationship icons on character portraits so you can see who is your friend/rival/lover at a glance, along with an informative tooltip</li>
<li>Characters now have Memories of things happening in their lives (children born, battles won, rivals killed, etc etc.). These memories are used in events and other content. For example, if you are murdered your assassin might cite a grievance that your killer had against you. These memories might fade with time, and are usually lost on death. For certain characters memories are preserved longer or even forever (such as rulers the player has controlled, and high tier rulers).</li>
<li>Memories can be viewed by opening the Memory Viewer from the character window, via a button in the same place as the Kill List, Inventory, and Lifestyle.
	<ul>
<li>Memories are listed chronologically alongside the date they were added (you can flip direction with a toggle).</li>
<li>Private memories will not be visible unless it’s your own character, or you are in Observer mode. (private memories such as gaining a lover or murdering someone).</li>
<li>You can view the public memories of any character in the world.</li>
<li>Memory lists can be copied to the clipboard via a button and shared outside the game.</li>
<li>For convenience you can pin the Memory Viewer to one character, or browse through different characters while keeping the Memory Viewer open.</li>
<li>Memories are collected up during game play time, but some characters may start with some already in place.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added the Loyal/Disloyal Traits, which affect how likely a character is to join factions, cheat on their spouse, etc. These traits are integrated as Sins/Virtues, hooked into Cultural Traditions, and can be gained through new events.</li>
<li>Reworked Populist Factions in order to improve their functionality, especially in regards to how they interact with player vassals:
	<ul>
<li>Vassals directly affected by a Populist Revolt now get a letter from the revolt leader, asking the vassal how they will respond to their demand. The vassal may:
		<ul>
<li>Join the war and help their liege</li>
<li>Convert to the faction's culture and/or faith and join the war on the side of the rebels</li>
<li>Stay out of the war and do nothing (though still risk losing land if the liege loses the war)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AI vassals are most likely to join the war on the side of their liege, but can in rare cases pick either of the other two options</li>
<li>Made it so that AI lieges will never accept the faction demand if a player vassal is targeted by the faction (this will finally allow player vassals to intervene and help protect their own realm)</li>
<li>Greatly increased the military strength of Populist Factions, to compensate for the fact that vassals can join the war:
		<ul>
<li>Populist armies now spawn a few basic Men-at-Arms in addition to levies</li>
<li>Populist armies spawn Siege Weapons depending on their culture's innovations, allowing them to better scale into the late game</li>
<li>Populist factions now generate a few commanders to lead their troops</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The populist leader will now get some extra gold upon victory, to ensure that they can afford creating titles and Men-at-Arms</li>
<li>Reduced the rate at which factions gain discontent for being over the military power threshold. In practice, this will give rulers a longer time to react before factions press their ultimatum (especially when the faction is only slightly stronger than their target)</li>
<li>A successful Populist Faction will no longer usurp or create an existing title if they don't control at least 50% of its De Jure (this is to prevent titles from being usurped too easily)</li>
<li>Increased the restrictions for a successful Populist Faction to create custom kingdoms and duchies. They will primarily attempt to create a title without a holder or usurp an existing title</li>
<li>Rulers participating in a Populist Faction will now become independent if they have too high a rank to be vassalized by the populist leader, instead of remaining a vassal to their old liege</li>
<li>The leader of a successful Populist Faction should no longer steal counties from rulers joining the revolt</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added 14 new event illustrations
	<ul>
<li>Food Cellar</li>
<li>Crossroads with Inn</li>
<li>Hills</li>
<li>Plains</li>
<li>Bonfire</li>
<li>Kitchen (Western)</li>
<li>Jungle</li>
<li>Desert/Drylands</li>
<li>Docks (Tribal)</li>
<li>Castle Corridor Day/Night (Indian)</li>
<li>Courtyard (Indian)</li>
<li>Courtyard (MENA)</li>
<li>Relaxing Room</li>
<li>Wetlands</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>7 new character animations for events
	<ul>
<li>Assassination pose with raised knife</li>
<li>Eavesdropping</li>
<li>Eye Rolling</li>
<li>Laughing</li>
<li>Drinking from Goblet</li>
<li>Holding Lantern</li>
<li>Toast Using Tankard</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Never played it? Well it's currently on a Free Weekend on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158310/Crusader_Kings_III/" target="_blank">Steam</a> so you can download it and play free over the next three days.

Honestly, that's the best way to grab the game right now even if you only keep it for one month.</p>
<p>One of the best strategy games available supported on Linux, don't miss out on it!</p>
<p>Paradox also recently shared some fun stats for the game:</p>
<ul>
<li>225 million hours of <em>Crusader Kings III</em> playtime.</li>
<li>33 million successful murder schemes.</li>
<li>25 million wedding celebrations.</li>

      <title>Classic racer Re-Volt returned to Steam — here&#39;s how to work it on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Re-Volt is a retro delight from the year 1999 that originally came to GOG in 2013. Sadly it was pulled from sale when it was found to contain code written by the community, that the release did not have permission to use. Now it's back and on Steam too.</p>
<p>Here's how you can get this game running very nicely on a Steam Deck or a Linux desktop, with a Native Linux game engine called <a href="https://rvgl.org/" target="_blank">RVGL</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="m55toWU-_bM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f3dd51e61152748875ba3882efd5dde0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/m55toWU-_bM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Text guide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download <a href="https://davidotek.github.io/protonup-qt/" target="_blank">ProtonUp-Qt</a> either as an AppImage or Flatpak.</li>
<li>Inside ProtonUp-Qt install Luxtorpeda.</li>
<li>Find Re-Volt in your Steam Library.</li>
<li>Go to Properties -&gt; Compatibility -&gt; Tick the box and select Luxtorpeda from the dropdown box.</li>
<li>Play it and enjoy.</li>
</ul>
<p>A small process to get a classic to live again properly. You may need to tweak the deadzone a little, as with the Steam Deck specifically I found the default a bit too low to control the cars properly.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/287310/ReVolt/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/revolt" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>

      <title>AMD announces FidelityFX Super Resolution 2.1 upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AMD continue pushing ahead with improvements to their upscaling tech FidelityFX Super Resolution with version 2.1 already available now.</p>
<p>This is no small update either, with it containing some pretty significant changes. Exciting, as FSR 2.0 made playing <a href="https://youtu.be/-X0Bgy5Eabw" target="_blank">Dying Light 2 on Steam Deck</a> a very nice experience. Given how big the difference was there in visual quality while giving good performance, I'm very keen to see what happens with FSR 2.1 and future updates.</p>
<p>Some of the changes made include:</p>
<div class="scrolling-table">
<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" class="table-stripes-tbody">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Change</strong></td>
<td><strong>Impact</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Motion vector divergence used to diminish locked pixels</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>This should alleviate ghosting issues on geometry with motion vectors not matching underlying pixel colors.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Disocclusion logic is now able to detect disocclusions in areas with only small depth separation between objects.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>This should alleviate ghosting issues and improve upscaling quality on some disocclusion cases.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Improved upscaled output quality by turning some half-precision computations to full precision.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>This should improve overall color range and temporal stability of the upscaled image produced.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Reactive Mask updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dilation now based on input colors to avoid expanding of reactiveness into non-relevant areas of the upscaled output.
				<ul>
<li>The full data range <code>[0.0, 1.0]</code> is now used.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td>
<p>This should alleviate ghosting issues on transparent geometry such as particles.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Composition and Transparency Mask updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dilation now based on input colors to avoid expanding of lock diminishing into non-relevant areas of the upscaled output.</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td>
<p>This should alleviate ghosting issues on geometry with motion vectors not matching underlying pixel colors.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>Even with the changes, AMD claim upgrading for developers should be simple as the API has not changed.</p>
<p>In their <a href="https://gpuopen.com/meet-fidelityfx-super-resolution-2-1/" target="_blank">announcement</a> AMD showed off an example game with it hooked up in Farming Simulator 22:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lHFgsSYSN-c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/16ba7d77426ecae7b57f753b3c33021c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lHFgsSYSN-c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/GPUOpen-Effects/FidelityFX-FSR2" target="_blank">source code</a> is already up to date with FSR 2.1.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental fixes up Red Dead Redemption 2, gets more games working</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently Red Dead Redemption 2 had a big <a href="https://support.rockstargames.com/articles/9295354296595/RDR2-Title-Update-1-31-Notes-PS4-Xbox-One-PC" target="_blank">update</a> which amongst other things, added in FidelityX Super Resolution (FSR) 2.0. Sadly, it broke it on Linux and Steam Deck but Valve already have a fix out but you need to pick it manually for now.</p>
<p>Valve updated Proton Experimental with the fix needed to get it working again, showing how they're clearly paying attention to some of the bigger games.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Additionally the September 7th update of Proton Experimental also got these games working:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deathsmiles II</li>
<li>Primal Carnage: Extinction</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: for Proton Experimental on Desktop Linux, you now need at least Mesa 22 / Nvidia drivers 510.47 or newer. Changelog available <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a quick run over the changes and a quick-look at Red Dead Redemption 2 running again on Steam Deck:</p>

      <title>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive improves startup time, Steam Deck Steam Input improvement</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has put out an update for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/" target="_blank">Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</a> that not only makes it startup faster but improves Steam Input handling on Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>While competitive CSGO is likely not something you want to do on the Steam Deck, it still runs reasonably well. Although, this update might change your mind about playing it on Deck as they've updated Steam Input to support using mouse and keyboard input on Steam Deck!</p>
<p>They also improved game startup I/O to reduce launch time, improved the user interface flow when cycling through weapon case items in Agent View, fixed an incorrect inventory limit warning shown to users with many items in Storage Units and fixed an exploit that would allow the player’s camera to become detached from their eye position.</p>
<p>On top of that there's quite a few map adjustments you can see below:</p>
<blockquote>
<div id="blog_shadow">
<p>Anubis<br/>
– Added a hip cover on the plateau near B main.<br/>
– Clipped the large stone cover on CT mid for smoother movement.<br/>
– Added a scaffolding on A catwalk to prevent the boost through the window to T stair at the canal. (Thanks poseidonskiy rofls).<br/>
– Allowed players to silently drop down from A long.<br/>
– Fixed stones colliding with the tarp on A catwalk.<br/>
– Removed stone at A sewer.<br/>
– Aligned floating pillar on A with the floor.<br/>
– Removed left-over clips on A main. (Thanks Hentie!).<br/>
– Removed clips on the stairs that bounce off grenades (Thanks Guidetti &amp; dr!zzle).<br/>
– Clipping improvements (Thanks dr!zzle!).<br/>
– Cleaned up clipping under the bridge (Thanks Fnugz for your sacrifice).</p>
<p>Blagai<br/>
– Fixed pixelwalk on window frame (thanks Kerr).<br/>
– Increased C4 explosion radius.<br/>
– Fixed various visual bugs.</p>
<p>Cascade<br/>
– Added back a few visual details; ToOpenGL fix shouldn’t be affected; FPS sacrifice is minimal.<br/>
– Angled ladder in lower main; gives cover to Ts and worsens it as a camping spot for CTs.<br/>
– Clipping fixes.<br/>
– Removed self-boost in upper main near the bridge.</p>
<p>Ember<br/>
– Renamed Crater to Water Tower.<br/>
– A new water tower has been erected at Water Tower.<br/>
– Changed doors used throughout the map.<br/>
– Added sounds when doors are opened and closed.<br/>
– Gave cannons a new particle effect when firing.<br/>
– Fixed situation where cannonball may not damage players.<br/>
– Actually fixed cannons icon this time.<br/>
– Fixed weapon crate ammo spawning in floor near Apartments.<br/>
– Fixed lots of minor bugs (thanks Joaokaka1998).</p>

      <title>Paper Animal RPG takes inspiration from Paper Mario and Pokémon Mystery Dungeon </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paper Animal RPG is a rather cute looking upcoming game. Currently in development from Cuddling Raccoons Studio it's a mixture of exploration, dungeon crawling, combat and a little relaxation by the campfire too.</p>
<p>With inspiration taken from the likes of Paper Mario, Mario &amp; Luigi as well as the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon series it sure does look rather lovely. Each game is randomly generated and that includes a different map, items, skills, events and NPCs so it will be fresh(ish) each time. Featuring a rather interesting battle system that blends together tile-combat with real-time mechanics so it definitely has my attention there.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="s9Tr6YKyIkY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d895db7a5188169ba4dd4824160541bf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/s9Tr6YKyIkY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Procedurally generated maps</strong>!</li>
<li><strong>6 adorable characters</strong>, specializing in power, utility and defense!</li>
<li>A bunch of <strong>consumable items</strong>. Once you stole a cookpot from an enemy camp you can <strong>combine them and experiment with the results</strong>!</li>
<li><strong>Equip and upgrade skills</strong> suited to a character's role and customize your playstyle!</li>
<li><strong>Find stickers that grant passive abilities</strong> - if you get lucky you can even find more powerful, holographic ones!</li>
<li><strong>Defeat mean bosses</strong>, which have each an alterantive stronger version when you start a Rewind Run!</li>
<li>Classic Mode is too hard? Try <strong>Casual Mode</strong>, which features tweaked gameplay settings for an easier experience!</li>
<li>Compete against other players for a global online highscore who played with the same generation seed as you in <strong>Tournament Mode</strong>!</li>
<li><strong>Numerous unlockable achievements</strong>, which guide you to explore all aspects of the game!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/paperanimalrpg/paper-animal-rpg/description" target="_blank">crowdfunding on Kickstarter</a>, with the developer telling me clearly Linux will be supported. They've also now updated the campaign to note this in the FAQ:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does PC include Linux? What about Steam Deck?</p>
<p>Yes, and yes! Paper Animal RPG will be natively supported on Steam Deck.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems the campaign has been popular, with the €40,000 goal nearly hit with 28 days still to go so it's a clear winner.</p>

      <title>The Excavation of Hob&#39;s Barrow releases September 28th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Excavation of Hob's Barrow is an upcoming folk horror narrative-driven point and click adventure, with a really great mixture of animated pixel-art and Native Linux support. Coming from Cloak and Dagger Games and Wadjet Eye Games, nice to see more fully supported games like this.</p>
<p>"Antiquarian Thomasina Bateman is writing a book on the barrows of England, documenting the treasures she finds buried within. When an intriguing letter summons her to the small village of Bewlay, tucked away in the remote countryside, she sets off by train with her assistant a day behind. Upon her arrival, however, the mysterious man who summoned her is nowhere to be found. Her assistant never arrives. A stubborn landowner refuses access to the barrow, and the locals are wary of this woman who is traveling alone and (gasp!) wears trousers."</p>

      <title>NVIDIA are teasing something, likely their RTX 40 series GPU (updated)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems we're due the next-gen lot of GPUs from NVIDIA soon, as they've begun their teaser campaign for something big.</p>
<p>Posted on Twitter from the official NVIDIA GeForce <a href="https://twitter.com/NVIDIAGeForce/status/1567659030247575552" target="_blank">account</a> was a brief 9 second video, with a simple message of "#ProjectBeyond". It obviously doesn't take a computer scientist to work out what's coming but it's good to know if you're after a new NVIDIA GPU that you might want to now hold off to see what the specifications and pricing are on the imminent RTX 40 series.</p>
<p>When to expect it? Well, it won't be long at all.</p>
<p>The GTC conference takes place between September 19-22, 2022 and NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang mentioned during their recent Q2 2023 earnings call "I look forward to telling you more about it at GTC next month" so it's not exactly hard to imagine the initial announcement happening at GTC — so mark those calendars.</p>
<p>It won't be a full launch event of course, we're likely to only get a small slice of info on the next generation.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: another <a href="https://twitter.com/nvidiageforce/status/1567875534339674113" target="_blank">teaser</a> went up that seems to indicate something happening on September 20th.</p>

<p>That's all the big hits in the bundle but there's also a bunch of classics like Army Men RTS, Sid Meier's Railroads!, the classic X-COM games and more. Aside from some issues with 2K sticking launchers into things that you can workaround, this really is a good deal.</p>
