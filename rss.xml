      <title>Relaxing settlement builder with simulated citizens Folklands now has a demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love your city / village building sims? You should take a little look at Folklands, a relaxing settlement builder with simulated citizens that you need to take care of.</p>
<p>The developer, Bromantic Games, recently put up a new demo to get ready for Steam Next Fest. Their previous demo had a lot of placeholders with this new demo having a graphical update, plus tons of other improvements and content additions. Part of what has my interest is that you'll not only be able to play solo, but you'll also be able to play online with or against others. Nice to see more village builders have that in.</p>
<p>A recent trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DlpVomPJStc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4a55645af4f9467098d7fae54ac9b734.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DlpVomPJStc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Collect &amp; Refine Resources - Settle down in uncharted lands, and harvest its resources. Refine raw materials into processed goods to build and expand your settlement. Create production chains that enhance or combine materials to create even more advanced products as the needs of your settlement grows.</li>
<li>Trading &amp; Dimplomacy -  Establish trade routes with the nearby kingdoms to stock up on resources you don't have, or become a trade hub supplying goods and resources. Trade with one of the 3 kingdoms in singleplayer or with other players in multiplayer.</li>
<li>Overcome Adversity - Face different challenges as your settlement grows. Manage the production and distribution of necessary resources to combat and prevent the dangers of fire, sickness and crime.</li>
<li>Never the same twice - A procedurally generated world tuned to your liking, guarantees that you will never play the same game twice. Adapt to the surrounding terrain and the availability or scarcity of resources to ensure a growing and happy settlement!</li>
<li>Build a peaceful thriving settlement or enable the optional disasters or conflict mode for additional challenges.</li>
<li>Planned Steam workshop support will let you create or install new content or modify the game rules to your liking.</li>
<li>Please your citizens to attract different types of people and trade with the neighboring kingdoms.</li>
<li>Play with or against your friends or enjoy a relaxing settlement building experience alone.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Former dev on Stardew Valley reveals their life-sim Sunkissed City</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From developer Mr. Podunkian, who previously worked on Stardew Valley, a new life-sim is coming named Sunkissed City and it looks rather colourful and inviting. It's been teased for a while and only recently actually getting an official name, along with a Q4 2024 release date.</p>
<p>The inspiration from working on Stardew Valley is clear but hopefully it will be different enough to find an audience. The developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2175840/discussions/0/4138312860563712326/#c4138312860565004796" target="_blank">mentioned</a> on Steam they worked on SV from the 1.4 update onwards. There's no trailer yet for Sunkissed City but a few screenshots make it look rather nice.</p>
<p>"Welcome to your new life in Apollo City, a sun-kissed seaside metropolis that's pumping with funky vibes and quirky characters.</p>
<p>As a fresh hire for the monolithic Pico corporation's new "Peco Pioneer" pilot program, you've been tasked with fostering a relationship with Apollo's vibrant community and putting in a good word for Pico's new eco-focused initiatives.</p>
<p>But all is not well in these bustling streets. The local wildlife has begun to behave more aggressively, the waters are devoid of life, monsters are pouring out from the sewers, and that's not to mention the constant migraines everyone's been having lately." — Steam Blurb</p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10428277401706281996gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10428277401706281996gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Enjoy a fresh start in Apollo City! - The city is a big place packed with a myriad of opportunities to occupy the days and nights of your new city life! Tend to DIY gardens set up by a local band of "plant-punks", spend a quiet afternoon in the park soaking up a good book, or schmooze it up with the locals over coffee at the Weird Dog Cafe. Snap photos of the wildlife around the city and its surrounds. Try your hand at fishing up "the big one" at Marin Shores. Forage for delicious edibles on a hike at Pinnacle Peak. Or perhaps a daring dive into the city's monster infested sewers is more your speed? You could always take up a gig sorting out shipments at the Pico warehouse for some extra cash.</li>
<li>Reinvent yourself! - With endless, deep customization options, you can be whoever you want to be. Pop into Threads to scope out the next piece of your new favorite fit, or get a complete makeover at Salon Flamingo. Make your clothing items your own with hundreds of different colors, patterns and material combinations. Give your living spaces your personal touch with a variety of fun, functional furniture pieces, or liven up your walls and floors with dozens of wallpaper and flooring types.</li>
<li>Socialize with the cityfolk! - Apollo City is home to a host of kooky characters to get to know (and love!). Build up your relationships with the locals and they'll open up to you with their daily successes and hardships. Brighten their day by gifting them hand-crafted presents (or maybe even some things you found in the trash...), and help them navigate their sometimes-messy lives in Apollo. You never know when they'll repay the favor. And if you're on the market to find that special someone, perhaps you'll find others in the city looking for the same!</li>
<li>Take back Apollo! - Work with the Keby, mysterious, prank-loving forest creatures, to tackle the various maladies afflicting the city and take back Apollo from the forces draining it of its color!</li>
<li>Explore the city with friends! - Sunkissed City features both online and split-screen multiplayer cooperative modes for you to enjoy your new city life alongside friends and family. Customize your experience with per-player difficulty and accessibility options to tailor the experience to groups of any gaming ability!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Flathub now has over one million active users</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ah, Linux, you gotta love it right? There's numerous different ways to do the same thing. One of those that people like to argue about is packaging and how to install things on Linux. <a href="https://flathub.org" target="_blank">Flathub</a> with Flatpaks at least seem to be popular and it keeps growing. </p>
<p>Cassidy James Blaede just wrote up an official <a href="https://docs.flathub.org/blog/over-one-million-active-users-and-growing/" target="_blank">blog post</a> going over some numbers, and it's quite impressive to see. To date it shows that Flathub has served just about 1.6 billion downloads, has over 2,400 apps (850 of which are Verified by the author) and there's now over 1 million active users too. Their <a href="https://flathub.org/statistics" target="_blank">public dashboard</a> has some pretty fun stats.</p>
<p>One of the big reasons for the growth no doubt is the Steam Deck, which has a full KDE Plasma desktop mode in SteamOS, and has Flathub for all the extra apps and games you can install. A point that was touched on in the blog post noting that some of the most popular downloads on Flathub are emulators and game launchers.</p>
<p>It's not just Steam Deck though with Flathub being included out of the box across the likes of Clear Linux, Endless OS, KDE Neon, Linux Mint, Pop!_OS, and Zorin OS and Fedora 38.</p>
<p>I think Flathub is great personally, it's often made it far easier to tell people where to grab something that's actually up to date. Telling people "it's on Flathub, install via GNOME Software or KDE Discover" makes Linux a lot easier.</p>

      <title>THE FINALS freezing on Linux? Here&#39;s ways you can fix it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>THE FINALS has been working on Linux and Steam Deck for a couple of weeks now, and personally I've been having a fantastic time with it. It can crash a fair bit though but luckily here's some possible solutions I've tested working.</p>
<p>No matter the Proton version used, it seems on some Linux systems it will just completely freeze up. There's no specific point it will do it. Sometimes in the menu, sometimes in the middle of a game (annoying when you're doing well).</p>
<p><strong>Issue 1</strong></p>
<p>One way to stop it crashing is to increase your vm.max_map_count setting. For some distributions, it can be quite low by default. For example on Kubuntu 23.10 (upgraded from 23.04) mine was set by default to only <em>65530</em>. You can check your current setting with this terminal command:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">cat /proc/sys/vm/max_map_count</code></p>
<p>It's easy to test a new setting <em>without</em> doing a permanent system change simply by running this command in a terminal:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=2147483642</code></p>
<p><em>That number is just a very high suggestion <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/7317#issuecomment-1896238857" target="_blank">mentioned</a> on GitHub. It's what the Steam Deck has it set at. People playing Star Citizen, as an example, have been setting it to 16777216.</em></p>
<p>After that, you should hopefully no longer see it crashing. You'll need to do that on each reboot.</p>
<p>For a permanent change you can edit the "/etc/sysctl.conf" file, add "vm.max_map_count=2147483642" to the bottom and then run:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">sudo sysctl -p</code></p>
<p>Which should keep the change.</p>
<p><strong>Issue 2</strong></p>
<p>Another problem is that if your CPU supports AVX-512, it may crash for you too. A workaround there is to add "clearcpuid=304" to your kernel boot arguments. This will stop AVX-512 being used.</p>
<p>For systems that use Grub boot loader (Ubuntu / Arch and others): you'll need to edit Grub (usually found as "/etc/default/grub") with your favourite text editor for this. Find the "GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT" line and add clearcpuid=304 into it. Then to ensure it's updated:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg</code></p>
<p><em>Fedora seems to use "grub2-mkconfig".</em></p>
<p>And reboot, and it should then work.</p>
<p><strong>Proton Version</strong></p>
<p>You may also find Proton Hotfix works better, as <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/7317#issuecomment-1897318332" target="_blank">mentioned</a> on GitHub recently it has a fix for voice-chat crashing. To do so go into the Properties -&gt; Compatibility menu for the game in your Steam Library. <em>This is the only change that should needed on Steam Deck.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p>Hopefully that gives you somewhere to start seeing less freezing and crashing issues in THE FINALS on Linux.</p>
<p>I've also been <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">livestreaming it on Twitch</a> with the Movemaster, so give me a follow.</p>

<p>That said, for Steam Deck players, the first game was really tough on the Steam Deck, I will be very interested to see if this can get anywhere close to at least 30FPS. Desktop Linux players of course have a lot more options.</p>

      <title>Beginner-friendly factory sim shapez 2 now has a demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>shapez 2 is a huge expansion over the original 2D shape-cutting factory sim, now in full 3D with a lot more features and there's now a demo available to try it out.</p>
<p>A top-down factory-building game where you extract and process geometric shapes. Each shape is its own set of building-blocks that your factories can take apart, stack, paint and put back together in unique ways. Build and automate to produce distinct shapes and solve the production challenge of each goal. I must admit, it looks pretty great - love what they've done with the idea. Check out the recent trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0VO_52LJ268"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/95d1a2afb300507942c52c325258bf32.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0VO_52LJ268" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Unlike some other similar factory building games, there's no form of enemies. Just pure factory building and automation here. Designed to be beginner-friendly there's no time-limits and resources are unlimited so the limit is very much your imagination to design and redesign as much as you want.</p>
<p>Some of the features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi-Layer 3D Factories</strong>: Design and optimize your factories in a whole new dimension.</li>
<li><strong>Trains</strong>: Connect distant stations with a network of space trains.</li>
<li><strong>Research System</strong>: Unlock buildings, mechanics &amp; upgrades in the all-new tech tree.</li>
<li><strong>New Shape Mechanics</strong>: Discover new shapes types with unique properties and logic.</li>
<li><strong>Blueprint Library</strong>: Save, load, export and share factory design blueprints with anyone.</li>
<li><strong>All-new Visuals</strong>: Build factories and stations in a stunning immersive space environment.</li>
<li><strong>Fluids</strong>: Use different types of liquids to process shapes or boost production.</li>
<li><strong>Animated Open Buildings</strong>: See exactly what's happening inside buildings in your factory.</li>
<li><strong>Undo/Redo</strong>: Up to 50 undo/redo operations.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The Early Access release is planned for later this year.</p>

      <title>Enshrouded is the latest open-world hit on Steam - how it runs on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Enshrouded is another big Early Access open-world game to arrive on Steam, and it's already doing some big numbers. So how does it run on Steam Deck / Linux? Here's an initial starting report for you.</p>
<p>On both Steam Deck and Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 23.10) it works out of the box with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/proton-80-5-brings-more-hdr-gaming-to-linux-steam-deck-plus-lots-of-fixes/" target="_blank">Proton 8.0-5</a>, and all parts of the game I can tell so far work as expected. So the good news out of the way — yes it does run. This is great, because it's another popular game with currently close to 70,000 people playing it.</p>
<p>For Steam Deck (tested on the Steam Deck OLED), it runs and gamepad input works just fine and the character name input even brings up an on-screen keyboard. The developer also seems to have given it tweaked graphics settings, so it appears some testing was done prior to release. That's where the good news stops. The performance is just — poor. Even on the <em>lowest</em> possible settings, you're not going to get anywhere near a smooth 30FPS even at the basic start of the game with nothing going on. Add some buildings, more action and more players in co-op and it gets worse.</p>
<p>Here's my Steam Deck initial report video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7MU3H4wXndo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d78b7bc3e46b40d399682274084ee40f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7MU3H4wXndo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>For now, on Steam Deck, I simply won't recommend it at all.</em></p>
<p>As for Desktop Linux testing with an AMD Ryzen 5800X and an AMD Radeon 6800XT, testing on the "Balanced" graphics setting at 2560x1440 its performance seems to be reasonably okay. Ranging between 80FPS to 100FPS depending on what you're doing. Very much playable you would think.</p>
<p>Something still feels <em>off</em> with it though. Even though that should be enough to make it feel smooth, it doesn't feel like it's actually anywhere near that when running around. It's performance is just odd, which I've seen repeated by players on Windows too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12301958881706195062gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12301958881706195062gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11802062471706195063gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11802062471706195063gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's Early Access, so of course that means it's unfinished and will have plenty more time in the oven to fix up issues and add in new content. The developer plans for at least one year in Early Access, so hopefully plenty of performance improvements will come during that time.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203620/Enshrouded/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Roblox now helping fund Blender development</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.blender.org" target="_blank">Blender</a> continues to be a true massive success story for open source, pulling in funding from all sorts of big names and now even Roblox is helping to fund it.</p>
<p>As posted on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7156053005350428672/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> by Stefano Corazza, Head of Roblox Studio, who mentioned "So proud to announce that Roblox joined the Blender Foundation’s Development Fund as a corporate Silver member! Blender is one of the most commonly used tools by the Roblox creator community, and I personally love it. To make the use of Blender and Roblox Studio even more seamless we have released an open source plugin as well."</p>
<p>They also shared a press announcement with <a href="https://www.blendernation.com/2024/01/24/roblox-joins-blender-development-fund/" target="_blank">BlenderNation</a> where Corazza additionally said: "Blender is the most popular external tool used by Roblox’s creator community today. Every day, thousands of creators import vivid and detailed 3D content from tools like Blender into their Roblox experiences.</p>
<p>We are thrilled to be supporting the Blender Foundation’s work delivering world-class 3D tooling and are excited to see closer integration continue to drive high-quality creation on Roblox. Roblox also presents a fantastic opportunity for the Blender Community to find new opportunities for their creativity by creating and selling 3D avatar items for rich immersive 3D experiences."</p>
<p>As a Corporate Silver Member, Roblox will be paying at least €12K a year to Blender to support further development. Joining the ranks of Activision, Google, Adobe, Epic MegaGrants, AMD, AWS, Meta and plenty more also supporting Blender.</p>
<p>The open source plugin info is on the <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/reference-roblox-integration-for-blender/2546753" target="_blank">Roblox Dev forum</a>.</p>

      <title>Earl vs. the Mutants is basically Vampire Survivors with vehicles and it&#39;s hilarious</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you love quick-fire action and the randomised upgrade mechanics made popular by Vampire Survivors, you might want to try out the demo for Earl vs. the Mutants. Tested on Linux with Proton 8, it works great.</p>
<p>While a lot of games inspired by VS don't actually do a lot different — this clearly does. You get to drive and boost yourself around big open maps, mow-down hordes of mutants and gun them down with vehicle-mounted weapons. This is probably going to be quite popular.</p>
<p>"Create unique and powerful builds by combining vehicle-mounted weapons, attack and support drones, level-up based upgrades, and game-changing temporary powerups! If you can survive long enough, go head-to-head against bosses to earn their vehicles."</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>QUICK RUNS:</strong> Enjoy casual gameplay with runs averaging 10 minutes.</li>
<li><strong>DYNAMIC BUILDS:</strong> Each attempt is different, powered by an expanding list of in-run upgrades.</li>
<li><strong>PROGRESSION:</strong> Make progress across runs via unlocked vehicles and stat-based permanent upgrades.</li>
<li><strong>VEHICLE COMBAT:</strong> Move FAST and crash into mutants head on! Colliding with enemies is half the fun, not something to be avoided.</li>
<li><strong>3D ENVIRONMENTS:</strong> Navigate the 3D terrains strategically, using the elevation to jump over enemies and hide behind mountains.</li>
<li><strong>BOSS BATTLES:</strong> Survive an onslaught of mutant waves, then face off against their formidable bosses.</li>
</ul>

<p>Do you stick with the Stable Steam Client or like me do you live on the wild side and basically always stick with the Steam Beta? It's good to see Valve be so dedicated to constantly improving the Steam platform as a whole, they're always tweaking something to try and make it better for players.</p>

      <title>AYANEO NEXT LITE no longer ships with SteamOS-like HoloISO Linux - Windows 11 instead</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We were so close to seeing another gaming handheld ship with Linux out of the box that isn't the Steam Deck, but it seems AYANEO with the AYANEO NEXT LITE weren't convinced enough and so they've changed their minds.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/ayaneo-next-lite-handheld-announced-with-steamos-linux/" target="_blank">Originally announced</a> as shipping with SteamOS, but then clarified later it would be HoloISO, which is a Linux distribution that's pretty close to SteamOS. AYANEO aren't <em>entirely</em> dropping it though, as they will still be offering HoloISO Linux (it's like SteamOS), but the device will now instead ship with Windows 11.</p>
<p>Writing on X (Twitter) they put out a <a href="https://twitter.com/AYANEO__/status/1750393456789430320" target="_blank">statement</a> and here's the relevent bit copied out of the image:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Following the announcement of the operating system for AYANEO NEXT LITE, players and friends have shown great interest and engaged in lively discussions. Some players provided feedback indicating the continued preference for a Windows operating system. "Real Gamers, Know Gamers," and in response to this valuable feedback, we are pleased to announce that AYANEO NEXT LITE will come pre-installed with the genuine Windows 11 64-bit Home Edition operating system. Of course, players can still choose to install HoloISO on their own. AYANEO's official website provides HoloISO system images that are officially adapted and compatible for players to download and experience. The streamlined and efficient HololSO system aims to offer players a more convenient game management, smooth and stable gaming performance, lower overall power consumption, and native compatibility with both controllers and touchscreen operations. This approach aligns with the gaming habits of handheld device users, providing players with a richer selection of operating systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Real Gamers, Know Gamers huh? That's…a peculiar thing to say here.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8879924451706179026gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8879924451706179026gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>This is a shame to see, as this could have helped to continue the Linux push for gaming. At least they will still be offering it up for download, but as we long-timers know, most people don't generally change their operating system on any device. </p>
<p>Hopefully sometime soon Valve will finally properly release SteamOS 3 for other hardware vendors, as SteamOS carries more weight to it than community-rebuilds like HoloISO. A lot of it is in the name, as players and hardware vendors would likely be more confident with SteamOS directly.</p>

      <title>The Pokémon Company confirm investigation into Palworld</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this could be about to get interesting, as The Pokémon Company have actually released a statement in regards to all the speculation about Palworld amid many claims of copying Pokémon's homework.</p>
<p>So far, there's no really solid proof that I can see of any actual direct copying (or of any AI use that people keep claiming too). There's a good few similarities to a few Pokémon, but lots of the examples people keep sharing around don't have me overly convinced. </p>
<p>Here's what The Pokémon Company said (<a href="https://corporate.pokemon.co.jp/media/news/detail/335.html" target="_blank">source</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Inquiries Regarding Other Companies’ Games</strong></p>
<p>We have received many inquiries regarding another company’s game released in January 2024. We have not granted any permission for the use of Pokémon intellectual property or assets in that game. We intend to investigate and take appropriate measures to address any acts that infringe on intellectual property rights related to the Pokémon. We will continue to cherish and nurture each and every Pokémon and its world, and work to bring the world together through Pokémon in the future.</p>
<p>The Pokémon Company</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>They didn't name Palworld directly, likely as that might put them in hot water if nothing comes of it.</em></p>
<p>Really, this reads a bit like a "please stop emailing us" statement. It was obvious they were going to look into it. Nintendo and The Pokémon Company are notoriously tough on taking action and they already started <a href="https://twitter.com/ToastedShoes/status/1749711480050827433" target="_blank">wiping traces</a> of a Pokémon mod for Palworld. Even Nexus Mods have <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/14924" target="_blank">said</a> they will not be hosting any such mods.</p>
<p>Again, they cannot take action just because it's a game that has monster catching in it. Pokémon don't own that idea, they can't. They could only take action for actual plagiarism. And as a whole, Palworld is actually objectively a very different game to anything Pokémon has put out.</p>
<p>In other news, Palworld crossed <a href="https://twitter.com/Palworld_EN/status/1750350702000607389" target="_blank">8 million</a> copies sold now.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA 550.40.07 Beta driver released with fixes for VRR and Wayland</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 24/01/24 20:07 UTC</strong>: An NVIDIA developer messaged me to clarify the changelog oddness:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For this Beta release, we pulled a diff against the current Production release 535.154.05 since that captures everything from the previous production branch R535 to this new production branch R550 including the changes from R545. Enterprise customers are often not tracking the New Feature Branches like R545 so we do it this way to avoid our partners missing release highlights. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've given them feedback that it's not ideal for normal desktop consumers to do it like that, which they're hoping to improve in future. Ideally, giving us a simple way to see just the changes since the <em>last</em> release would suffice.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>NVIDIA has today launched the <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/Download/driverResults.aspx/218153/en-uk" target="_blank">550.40.07</a> Beta driver for Linux which includes numerous important fixes, so you might want to jump in and give this one a thorough gaming test.</p>
<p>I have to be careful checking over NVIDIA driver releases, as <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/nvidia-53515405-for-linux-brings-a-few-bug-fixes/" target="_blank">they keep</a> copy-pasting changelogs from previous versions. In this case, they've again copied over lots of the changes from previous driver releases. So keep that in mind. A fair few notes of what's listed were also in the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/nvidia-driver-5452902-out-for-linux-plus-other-releases-due-to-security-issues/" target="_blank">545.29.02</a> driver released back in October 2023. NVIDIA aren't really making it clear lately exactly what's new in each driver - which is frustrating. I have again tried to reach out to NVIDIA to find out what's happening with the changelogs lately.</p>
<p>Scanning over previous releases, it looks like <em>these</em> specifically <em>may</em> be actually <em>new</em> to this driver:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that sometimes caused Wayland applications to run at less than one frame per second on Maxwell, Volta, and Pascal series GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused an intermittent drop in desktop framerate.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused "Flip event timeout" messages to be printed to the system log when displays are hotplugged when nvidia-drm is loaded with the <code class="inline-code">fbdev=1</code> kernel module parameter.</li>
<li>Fixed intermittent Xid errors on Horizon Zero Dawn, Metro Exodus, Forza Horizon 5, and Halo Infinite.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which prevented the "NoMaxPClkCheck" mode validation token from working on single-link TMDS (e.g. DVI, HDMI) outputs.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that allowed VRR displays to be driven below their minimum refresh rate, resulting in a blank or flickering image.</li>
<li>Added an application profile to improve Kwin performance on hybrid GPU systems by setting OGL_DEDICATED_HW_STATE_PER_CONTEXT=ENABLE_ROBUST.</li>
<li>Updated the build process for NVIDIA kernel modules to honor the INSTALL_MOD_DIR Kbuild environment variable.</li>
<li>Added support for R8, GR88 and YCbCr GBM formats.</li>
<li>Optimized the X driver headless framerate limiter to more closely mimic upstream behavior and prevent it from activating in inconvenient situations. Added a new X config option "LimitFrameRateWhenHeadless" to disable the headless framerate limiter.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented Gamescope from running when using the NVIDIAOpen GPU Kernel modules.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented the installer package from being unpacked on systems where zstd is not installed, when /tmp is mounted noexec.</li>
<li>Use transparent huge pages when available for the .text section. This is done through madvise() calls, and requires CONFIG_READ_ONLY_THP_FOR_FS.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression that prevented setting backlight brightness levels.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could lead to UI corruption in nvidia-installer on systems with more than one initramfs file per kernel.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused games built on the Source 2 engine to hangwhen running under Xwayland.</li>
<li>Added beta-quality support for GeForce and Workstation GPUs to open kernel modules. Please see the "Open Linux Kernel Modules" chapter in the README for details.</li>
<li>Changed the name visible in /proc/devices of NVIDIA devices and the NVIDIA control device from "nvidia-frontend" to "nvidia" and "nvidiactl".Scripts which parse /proc/devices (such as udev rules) may need to be updated. Note that the conventional /dev device paths like /dev/nvidia0 and /dev/nvidiactl remain unchanged.</li>

<li>Fixed a bug that caused games built on the Source 2 engine to hang when running under Xwayland.</li>
<li>Added experimental HDMI 10 bits per component support; enable by loading nvidia-modeset with `hdmi_deepcolor=1`.</li>
<li>Added support for HDR signaling via the HDR_OUTPUT_METADATA and Colorspace per-connector DRM properties when nvidia-drm is loaded with the`modeset=1` parameter.</li>
<li>Added support for PRIME render offload to Vulkan Wayland WSI.</li>
<li>Added support for the CTM, DEGAMMA_LUT, and GAMMA_LUT DRM-KMS CRTCproperties. These are used by features such as the "Night Light"feature in GNOME and the "Night Color" feature in KDE, when they are used as Wayland compositors.</li>
<li>Added beta-quality support for GeForce and Workstation GPUs to open kernel modules. Please see the "Open Linux Kernel Modules" chapter in the README for details.</li>
<li>Added initial experimental support for runtime D3 (RTD3) power management on Desktop GPUs.  Please see the 'PCI-Express Runtime D3 (RTD3) Power Management' chapter in the README for more details.</li>
<li>Added support for the EGL_ANDROID_native_fence_sync EGL extension and the VK_EXTERNAL_SEMAPHORE_HANDLE_TYPE_SYNC_FD_BIT andVK_EXTERNAL_FENCE_HANDLE_TYPE_SYNC_FD_BIT Vulkan external handle typeswhen the nvidia-drm kernel module is loaded with the modeset=1 parameter.</li>
<li>Added experimental support for framebuffer consoles provided by nvidia-drm. On kernels that implement drm_fbdev_generic_setup anddrm_aperture_remove_conflicting_pci_framebuffers, nvidia-drm will install a framebuffer console when loaded with both `modeset=1` and `fbdev=1`kernel module parameters. This will replace the Linux boot console drivenby a system framebuffer driver such as efifb or vesafb.<br/>
<br/>
Note that when an nvidia-drm framebuffer console is enabled, unloading nvidia-drm will cause the screen to turn off.<br/>
 </li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to allow installing the driver while an existing NVIDIA driver is already loaded.</li>
<li>Added support for virtual reality displays, such as the SteamVR platform,on Wayland compositors that support DRM leasing. Support requires xwayland version 22.1.0 and wayland-protocols version 1.22, or later.Tested on sway, minimum version 1.7 with wlroots version 0.15, and also on Kwin, minimum version 5.24.<br/>
<br/>
Note: Before xwayland 23.2, there is a known issue with HDMI displays where the headset will fail to start a second time after closing SteamVR. This can be worked around by unplugging and replugging in the headset.<br/>
 </li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented VRR (Variable Refresh Rate) from working with Wayland.</li>
<li>Changed the name visible in /proc/devices of NVIDIA devices and the NVIDIA control device from "nvidia-frontend" to "nvidia" and "nvidiactl".Scripts which parse /proc/devices (such as udev rules) may need to be updated. Note that the conventional /dev device paths like /dev/nvidia0and /dev/nvidiactl remain unchanged.</li>
<li>Added support to the NVIDIA VDPAU driver for running in Xwayland. Please refer to the "Xwayland support in VDPAU" section of the README for further details.</li>
<li>Added libnvidia-gpucomp.so to the driver package. This is a helper library used for GPU shader compilation.</li>
<li>Removed libnvidia-vulkan-producer.so from the driver package. This helper library is no longer needed by the Wayland WSI.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 has a 64bit and Vulkan update for Linux in testing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve are still updating Team Fortress 2 (TF2), and a bigger technical update is currently in the works that will bring 64bit and Vulkan support to the Linux version.</p>
<p>Currently, TF2 on Linux uses ToGL, Valve's original DirectX to OpenGL translation layer. Like what Valve did with their other older games, this update will instead use the vastly newer DXVK, which translates DirectX to Vulkan. Together 64bit and Vulkan support should make the game run much smoother. <em>Eventually, the Windows version should be 64bit too.</em></p>
<p>Not only that, it's also bumping up TF2 to use the newer Steam Linux Runtime 3.0 "Sniper", making it work better on modern Linux distributions.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20344173191706099056gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20344173191706099056gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - TF2 on Linux</em></p>
<p>You can try it out right now under the "x64_linux_test" Beta branch on Steam, which is now public, but you will not be able to connect to public servers or do matchmaking. It's purely for local testing and benchmarking. On top of that the Team Fortress 2 Dedicated Server is also being updated to go along with it (Steam App ID: 232250).</p>
<p>Good to see more TF2 updates really are coming.</p>
<p>TF2 is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Palworld has continued to smash records, and it has now become the number 2 on Steam for the record of peak-players as it crosses 7 million sales. There's also now a fancy roadmap.</p>
<p>It only recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/palworld-overtakes-counter-strike-2-for-most-players-on-steam-and-hits-5-million-sales/" target="_blank">jumped over Counter-Strike 2</a> for currently online players, but now it has <em>also</em> rocketed past CS2 on the record of peak-players overall with 1,864,421 versus CS2's all-time peak of 1,818,773 giving it the true number 2 spot on Steam which you can see on <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/?sort=peak" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>. Absolutely incredible numbers for a brand new Early Access game.</p>

<p>There's also already a Steam Deck performance <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/palworld/mods/27" target="_blank">mod</a> available, although it does reduce the visual quality a <em>lot</em> and it's already not especially great visually on Steam Deck to get it around 30FPS. It currently has a Steam Deck Playable rating and works just fine on Desktop Linux with Proton.</p>
<p>Palworld is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Godot Engine gets a free Nintendo Switch port for game devs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's one less reason for game developers to skip over using the free and open source <a href="https://godotengine.org" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, as it now has a free port available to bring games over to the Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>You may remember recently that W4 Games, a company set-up by some of the Godot team, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/godot-43-dev-1-brings-major-rendering-changes-plus-w4-games-on-console-suppor/" target="_blank">announced</a> their own console port availability that has a cost attached to it which at a basic minimum would be $800 a year for a single console. Many felt the price was too much but, since it's all open source, anyone else could come up with a porting solution and now they have — for the Nintendo Switch at least.</p>
<p>RAWRLAB Games announced the free Godot Engine port for authorised Nintendo Switch developers, supporting projects made with Godot versions 3.5.x and 4.1.x. Features of the port:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>·<strong> Complimentary access</strong>: Available at no cost to all authorised Nintendo Switch developers.<br/>
· <strong>License</strong>: The source code is distributed under the MIT License, offering broad usage and modification rights.<br/>
· <strong>Software provisioning</strong>: The software is provided "as is," without any implied warranty or support of any kind.<br/>
· <strong>Basic functionality included</strong>: This port includes only basic functionality.<br/>
· <strong>No C# or GDNative/GDExtension</strong>: Only GDScript is supported. Native extensions are not supported, but you can try to convert them into internal modules.<br/>
· <strong>Optimization Level</strong>: It is important to note that the port is not highly optimized but is adequately efficient for most small to mid-sized game projects.<br/>
· <strong>Expandability</strong>: Having access to the source code, developers with C++ knowledge have the opportunity to add and integrate additional functionalities as needed.<br/>
· <strong>No support provided</strong>: This port is provided without support. Developers are encouraged to engage with the community on the Nintendo Developer Portal for collaboration and assistance. We recommend partnering with <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/platform/consoles.html#:~:text=need%20to%20know-,Third%2Dparty%20support,%C2%B6,-Console%20ports%20of" target="_blank">porting companies</a> for medium or large-sized projects.<br/>
· <strong>Access Procedure</strong>: Access can be requested through the Nintendo Developer Portal.</p>

      <title>Proposed Windows NT sync driver brings big Wine / Proton performance improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Zeb Figura of CodeWeavers <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240124004028.16826-1-zfigura@codeweavers.com/" target="_blank">has proposed</a> a Windows NT synchronization primitive driver to help performance of running games and applications designed for Windows on Linux with Wine / Proton.</p>
<p>As per the RFC (request for comments) posted onto the Linux kernel mailing list Figura notes: "This patch series introduces a new char misc driver, /dev/ntsync, which is used to implement Windows NT synchronization primitives."</p>
<p>Then giving some background on it: "The Wine project emulates the Windows API in user space. One particular part of<br/>
that API, namely the NT synchronization primitives, have historically been implemented via RPC to a dedicated "kernel" process. However, more recent applications use these APIs more strenuously, and the overhead of RPC has become a bottleneck.</p>
<p>The NT synchronization APIs are too complex to implement on top of existing primitives without sacrificing correctness. Certain operations, such as NtPulseEvent() or the "wait-for-all" mode of NtWaitForMultipleObjects(), require direct control over the underlying wait queue, and implementing a wait queue sufficiently robust for Wine in user space is not possible. This proposed driver, therefore, implements the problematic interfaces directly in the Linux kernel."</p>
<p>Figura did a presentation on it at the Linux Plumbers Conference in 2023 that you can see below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NjU4nyWyhU8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/77edce484c538b915ff3e93bddcf8d33.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NjU4nyWyhU8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What kind of performance difference might we see with something like this? The difference depends on your hardware and what you're trying to run but some FPS examples were given from multiple users including:</p>

<p><em>What hardware and software each was tested on was not noted.</em></p>
<p>Some impressive numbers but again it's hardware dependent, but even so any performance uplift would be welcome, so hopefully the patch series gets some good comments and approval after any tweaks are done that may be needed. Looks like we could end up seeing a nice future performance improvement for Linux and Steam Deck gaming with Wine and Proton.</p>

      <title>Railway network designer Rail Route releases February 22nd and over 100K copies sold</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rail Route from developer Bitrich is currently in Early Access and they just announced their plans for the big 1.0 release to happen on February 22nd. Rail Route has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Playable and a demo is available too if you wish to try it first.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1124180/view/3988567539067416013" target="_blank">announcement</a> they also mentioned they've crossed over 100,000 sales! It's been through some pretty huge improvements during Early Access across ~20 major updates. They've also confirmed more updates are planned to come after the 1.0 update.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12460610441706027310gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12460610441706027310gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>With its minimalist design it may look quite simple and inviting, but it's quite a complicated beast once it gets going. Having to manage and automate many different train-lines is no simple task to get right, and you can end up sinking dozens of ours at a time into it. A really interesting building sim overall.</p>
<p>You get a lot of freedom with it too building up from scratch as you gradually unlock new tech and resources to build the ultimate rail network across real-world city maps. There's a lot of different ways to play it too, the choice is yours from getting everything running perfectly on time and just endless tweaking or high-pressure, time-sensitive scenarios.</p>

      <title>The Universim god-game city-builder 1.0 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Universim from Crytivo has finally released, what they call a "new breed of God Game" where you guide a civilisation from nothing up to the stars. It comes with Native Linux support and it is rated Steam Deck Playable, although the Steam Deck rating is from 2022.</p>
<p>From a successful Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign in 2014, and then an Early Access on Steam in 2018, it's been a long time coming. A game I've played on and off over the years, always liking what I saw but it was far from complete. The big 1.0 release brings in an absolute <em>ton</em> of content including new buildings, space exploration, new planets, aliens, new quest lines and the list just keeps on going. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7212295931706026458gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7212295931706026458gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>This is a game that will truly suck away endless hours of your time, not just because there's now a lot to it, but even getting a basic civilization going will take quite a few hours. A joy to watch everything grow though, and it's quite a pretty game too. Nothing realistic looking, with Crytivo opting for a much more casual colourful style to it - although the planets themselves look pretty great.</p>
<p>If you want something resembling a city-builder, but you want something a bit different, The Universim is an interesting choice with all the god powers at your disposal. It's a pretty relaxing game, although there's times when it can be a bit intense when you're dealing with different disasters, the overall theme of the game keeps it remaining mostly calm. The narrator is a nice touch too which guides you through the game, giving you quests and hints. There's not really another game quite like it.</p>
<p>Release trailer viewable below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lyWUUHzGyJE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d72f4d80ab0c227f99d76cc6eafdf743.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lyWUUHzGyJE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>God-like Gameplay: Play as a deity guiding the Nuggets, a sentient species, through their evolution from the Stone Age to the Space Era.</li>
<li>Nuggets’ Civilization Dynamics: Observe the Nuggets' daily lives, from eating and drinking to mating and conflicts.</li>
<li>Technological and Era Advancement: Progress through a research tree with over 200 advancements.</li>
<li>Planetary Exploration and Management: Discover and colonize a vast array of procedurally generated planets. Each planet offers unique ecosystems and challenges.</li>
<li>God Powers and Influence: Wield 15 God Powers like tornadoes, earthquakes, lightning strikes, and more. Use these powers to guide, protect, or discipline the Nuggets.</li>
<li>Ecological Impact and Management: Manage the delicate balance of your planet's ecosystems. Your decisions, alongside the Nuggets' actions, have real environmental consequences, influencing global climates.</li>
<li>Mysterious and Humorous Narrative: Engage with a story-rich game narrated with humor. Unravel the layers of a deeper cosmic story that challenges your perception of being a deity, revealing unexpected twists about your true role.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Something I have noticed in the 1.0 release with the Linux version is that the main menu is a bit broken, with lots of ghosting and graphical issues with menus. The actual game itself is fine, just the main menu is graphically messed up and it appears to be the same on macOS. Hopefully they will fix that soon. Performance once actually in game seems pretty good though!</p>

      <title>SteamOS alternative Bazzite v2.2 out now with lots of enhancements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need something similar to SteamOS for your desktop or handhelds like the Steam Deck? The latest release of Bazzite with <a href="https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite/releases/tag/v2.2.0" target="_blank">version 2.2</a> sounds like it just keeps getting better.</p>
<p>Technically <em>not</em> a Linux distribution, and they don't call Bazzite a Linux distro. It's more of a community-rebuild based on Fedora Linux using <a href="https://github.com/ublue-os/main" target="_blank">ublue-os/main</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ublue-os/nvidia" target="_blank">ublue-os/nvidia</a> with <em>lots</em> of extras included. It's still not yet something for beginners, with their install experience gradually improving. But for people who love to tinker, this could be a bit of fun.</p>
<p>The 2.2 release includes some big changes like a new modified fsync kernel with enhanced hardware support, HDR and more. You also get Nintendo HID support, a Webapp Manager, Pods as a default feature which is great for managing distrobox/containers, improvements to Steam Deck support, patches to Gamescope pulled in from ChimeraOS and tons of tweaks to both the GNOME and KDE desktop environments available. Plus lots of bug fixes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4550993641706025228gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4550993641706025228gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>So why use this? As they explain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bazzite started as a project to resolve some of the issues that plague SteamOS, mainly out of date packages (despite an Arch base) and the lack of a functional package manager.</p>
<p>Despite this project also being image-based, you are able to install any Fedora package straight from the command line. These packages will persist across updates (So go ahead and install that obscure VPN software you spent an hour trying to get working in SteamOS). Additionally, Bazzite is updated multiple times a week with packages from upstream Fedora, giving you the best possible performance and latest features - all on a stable base.</p>
<p>Bazzite ships with the latest Linux kernel and SELinux enabled by default with full support for secure boot (Run ujust enroll-secure-boot-key and enter the password ublue-os if prompted to enroll our key) and disk encryption, making this a sensible solution for general computing. (Yes, you can print from Bazzite)</p>
</blockquote>

      <title>MONSTER HUNTER RISE gets patched to fix it on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/monster-hunter-rise-adds-new-drm-that-breaks-it-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">As reported previously</a>, Capcom recently updated MONSTER HUNTER RISE with new Enigma DRM and the update ended up breaking it on Steam Deck / Linux Desktop. But it should no longer be an issue no matter the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> version used.</p>
<p>Valve did <em>already</em> work around it, updating Proton Hotfix to enable the game to run again, and Valve has even set Proton Hotfix as the default for now. So even if Capcom didn't patch it, the game was still playable again thanks to quick work from the Proton developers.</p>
<p>Now though, Capcom has updated the game directly and the updated <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1446780/view/3970553140557253784?l=english" target="_blank">recent patch notes</a> on Steam have an addition at the top to now note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have released a patch that addresses the issue of the game not running on Steam Deck after installing update Ver.16.0.2.0.<br/>
We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Testing it myself today it does run just fine once again with Proton 8 and Proton Experimental without issues. <em>ICYMI: <a href="http://Proton 8.0-5 brings more HDR gaming to Linux / Steam Deck plus lots of fixes" target="_blank">Proton 8.0-5 was also just released</a>!</em></p>
<p>It's good to see Capcom actively work to fix up their mess, but it's a shame this happened in the first place. Perhaps in future they will be more careful to not break their Steam Deck Verified rated games. Clearly Capcom don't see the Steam Deck as an important enough platform yet if they're not testing updates before pushing them out.</p>

      <title>Surreal Engine is an open source reimplementation of Unreal Engine for classic games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Originally called UTEngine, <a href="https://github.com/dpjudas/SurrealEngine" target="_blank">Surreal Engine</a> is a community-made attempt to reimplement enough of the original Unreal Engine to get games like the original Unreal Tournament (99) working.</p>
<p>An interesting project that's been around for quite some time now, but it does appear to be progressing nicely. It can currently detect certain versions of Unreal Tournament, Unreal Gold, Deus Ex and Klingon Honor Guard. Although they say currently only Unreal Tournament v436 is in a "relatively playable state".</p>
<p>From the GitHub page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The engine can load and render the maps. The Unrealscript VM is almost feature complete - only arrays and network conditional execution are not implemented yet.</p>
<p>It will attempt to load all level actors and initialize the map. However, while the menus and the HUD will appear, there are still many native functions not implemented yet. It is also quite possible some events aren't firing as they should. You will therefore see exceptions shown if you interact with them and that is where the project is at.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/460247731706009514gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/460247731706009514gol1.jpg"/></a>Picture credit: Surreal Engine team.</em></p>
<p>There's also <a href="https://github.com/OldUnreal/UnrealTournamentPatches" target="_blank">OldUnreal</a> which patches up the original Unreal Tournament, but it's not open source as it uses the original from Epic whereas Surreal Engine is open source under the zlib license.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that Epic Games don't support their classic games in any way now, they even <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/epic-games-are-killing-off-a-bunch-of-classics-like-unreal-tournament/" target="_blank">entirely removed a whole bunch of them like Unreal Tournament</a> from all storefronts. Not even keeping them to their own store, just killing them off. Oh and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/fortnite-on-linux-steam-deck-not-until-tens-of-millions-of-users/" target="_blank">don't expect Fortnite to run on Linux / Steam Deck</a> any time soon.</p>

      <title>Riot Games cutting 11% of staff (about 530 people)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ouch. Yet another developer is getting rid of staff in a move to cut some costs and this time it's Riot Games, who will be waving goodbye to 11% of their people. That's 530 people who will lose their jobs and "the biggest impact to teams outside of core development".</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/2024-rioter-update" target="_blank">blog post</a> the Riot CEO, Dylan Jadeja, mentioned how they took on too many "big bets across the company" and they have "too many things underway" and some just aren't paying off causing costs to grow and become "unsustainable" leaving Riot "no room for experimentation or failure".</p>
<p>Riot will be supporting staff being cut with a minimum of 6 months salary, a cash bonus based on a performance target, health benefits, a personal laptop if they need one and more. Looks like they have a reasonable support system in place at least.</p>
<p>All of this doesn't mean much for Linux and Steam Deck gaming of course, since Riot Games don't actually support Linux. Still, it's interesting industry news to see just how many developers are cutting back. Because there has been a lot of this across the industry and it appears no one is safe.</p>
<p>Now I'll take this opportunity to remind you that Riot Games will be soon adding <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/league-of-legends-likely-unplayable-on-linux-steam-deck-soon-due-to-vanguard-anti-cheat/" target="_blank">Vanguard into League of Legends</a>, so it will be <em>broken</em> on Linux / Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Proton 8.0-5 brings more HDR gaming to Linux / Steam Deck plus lots of fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Proton 8.0-5 is here marking more games as playable, bringing HDR support to even more games and of course the usual bug fixes aplenty to Steam Deck / Desktop Linux.</p>
<p>Lots of these changes would have already been available in Proton Experimental or Proton Hotfix (which some games had by default), but those change often and can have regressions breaking things. You should stick with the stable Proton unless you have issues. Want to learn more about Proton? Check out the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton beginner's guide</a>.</p>

<li>Simon the Sorcerer: 25th Anniversary Edition.</li>
<li>Assassin's Creed Mirage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though Assassin's Creed Mirage is not available on Steam, people can still attempt to play it using external launchers so Valve will still fix up issues in Proton for such games from time to time.

      <title>Unified Linux Wine Game Launcher aims to improve Windows games on Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oh no! Another launcher! Well, not quite. In fact, Unified Linux Wine Game Launcher (ULWGL) is actually meant to be used by existing game launchers like Heroic Games, Lutris and others on Linux desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>So what does ULWGL actually do? This proof-of-concept idea was put up by Thomas "GloriousEggroll" Crider, who also maintains the popular GE-Proton compatibility layer. ULWGL is designed as a helper to properly run <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> outside of Steam, it's "essentially a copy of the Steam Linux Runtime/Steam Runtime Tools that Valve uses for proton, with some modifications made so that it can be used outside of Steam".</p>
<p>The idea is that other game launchers would use this so that all fixes and compatibility can be properly shared between them, thus making Windows gaming on Linux a whole lot easier with Wine/Proton. Protonfixes would be the same across launchers, anyone would be able to run games through Proton with no Steam required and basically it just unifies everything.</p>
<p>Sounds like a really great idea so all these launchers don't need to keep re-inventing a way to run games in Proton outside of Steam.</p>
<p>See more on <a href="https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/ULWGL-launcher" target="_blank">the GitHub page</a>. There's other parts to it that you can see on the <a href="https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components" target="_blank">GitHub list</a>. </p>

      <title>Palworld overtakes Counter-Strike 2 for most players on Steam and hits 5 million sales</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There seems to be absolutely no stopping Palworld. It just keeps on growing and pulling in more players with its enticing theme of Pokémon with guns and crafting.</p>
<p>Around two hours ago it hit a new record high of 1,582,482, making it jump above Counter-Strike 2 to take the <em>current</em> top spot for most-played on Steam right now. That's incredibly impressive! Thanks to it now hitting 5 million sales in 3 days, this concurrent player count is also the third highest on Steam <em>ever</em>!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14790538241705939634gol1.png"/>Picture credit: SteamDB</em></p>
<p>I wouldn't be surprised if it took second place on highest concurrent players ever in the next 24 hours. At the rate it has been increasing, it's pretty much a given at this point. But dethroning PUBG would take more than double what they have right now but never say never right? </p>
<p>The game was bound to be popular — but as much as this? I didn't have that on my 2024 bingo card.</p>
<p>My Steam Deck video on Palworld is below if you missed the update to the previous article:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UiP56BeG0sk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c371e68af4ddea1e2c9961977b800c04.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UiP56BeG0sk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Have you been playing it? What do you think to Palworld? Let me know in the article comments below. I'm really hoping they add in some UI and Text scaling, it's too small on Steam Deck but just fine on Linux desktop. On Steam Deck it uses Proton Experimental by default and is rated Playable. On Desktop Linux is also works great.</p>
<p>Additionally for people who want to run a Palworld server, the open source tool LinuxGSM (Linux Game Server Manager) just launched version <a href="https://linuxgsm.com/2024/01/release-v24-1-0/" target="_blank">24.1.0</a> with Palworld support.</p>

      <title>Last Epoch crosses 1 million Early Access sales, new trailer and pre-order bonuses</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Eleventh Hour Games are ramping up their plans for the 1.0 release of Last Epoch, the popular ARPG with a rather unique sounding item trading system. Now there's a new trailer and details of pre-order bonuses if you pick it up before February 21st.</p>
<p>A big milestone was also hit with an announcement shared with us that they've crossed over 1 million sales. “We’re honored and humbled that the Last Epoch community has grown to one million players,” said Judd Cobler, founder and CEO of EHG, and game director on Last Epoch. “Being fans of the genre first and foremost, we’ve always kept close to our community and tried to reflect the needs and wishes of the players as we craft an action RPG for the ages.”</p>
<p>They also announced three editions of the game for pre-order, but since it's in Early Access you can play right away but the new goodies arrive with the 1.0 release. Here's their new editions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard Edition - $34.99: offering the same outstanding value that has already attracted over 1 million players, the entry-level Standard Edition pre-order comes with the Golden Guppy exclusive pet.</li>
<li>Deluxe Edition - $49.99: As well as the cute Golden Guppy, the Deluxe Edition includes the full game soundtrack as a digital download*, and 50 Epoch Points. On February 21 it will unlock the Adolescent Chronowyrm cosmetic pet, the Fallen Ronin cosmetic armor set, and the Firefly’s Refuge cosmetic portal.</li>
<li>Ultimate Edition - $64.99: As well as the cosmetics and soundtrack* from the Deluxe Edition, the Ultimate Edition includes 100 Epoch Points and from February 21 unlocks the Temporal Guardian cosmetic armor set, the Twilight Fox cosmetic pet, the Adult Chronowyrm cosmetic pet, and the Celestial Way cosmetic portal</li>
</ul>
<p><em>(* May be delivered at a later date following the release of patch 1.0.)</em></p>
<p>Last Epoch also needed a new trailer for a while now, and they certainly delivered. Watch it below:</p>

<p>It has Native Linux support and is currently rated as Unsupported on Steam Deck, although it does work. Running it through Proton seems to be the best way to play though, as their Native Linux version has various graphical issues reported.</p>

      <title>Edge ISO available for Linux Mint 21.3 with newer Linux kernel</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Linux Mint team have announced the release of the Edge ISO for the latest Linux Mint 21.3, making it easier to use with newer hardware.</p>
<p>With Linux Mint sticking to an Ubuntu base, they generally go with whatever Linux kernel version is shipped in this case version 5.15. However, newer hardware often needs a newer Linux kernel. Sometimes you might not even be able to boot unless the kernel version is recent enough.</p>
<p>So this is why Linux Mint do EDGE ISOs which give you a newer Linux kernel out of the box and with Linux Mint 21.3 this gives you kernel version 6.5</p>
<p>They do say "The Edge ISO image is not as stable as the other ISOs and may not support as many proprietary drivers. Only use it if you cannot boot or install with the other ISOs", but that kernel is already a good while old being released back in August 2023 and in fact it's actually reached <a href="https://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/2311.3/04928.html" target="_blank">end-of-life</a> so it won't see any more point releases.</p>
<p>You can download it on <a href="https://linuxmint-user-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/edge.html" target="_blank">their website</a>.</p>

      <title>31% of devs already using AI and the PC platform looks strong from GDC Survey</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The annual GDC Survey is out now and it's an interesting look into what developers are up to and how the industry is changing, and some of the info this time around is pretty eyebrow raising.</p>
<p>Firstly, to note, this survey ran between Oct. 11 to Oct. 29, 2023 and contains answers polled from over 3,000 developers working in the games industry. As with all surveys, a pinch of salt is needed but it's a great overall look at the state of things.</p>
<p>Scanning through the PDF with my Mark I Eyeball, the first real interesting result is on what platform the developers are developing for with 66% of responses for PC. This is a good showing, and clearly PC gaming is stronger than it ever has been before when you take into account the growth of Steam as well. <em>Remember Valve even said<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/steam-had-83000-new-customers-every-day-in-2022/" target="_blank"> Steam had 83,000 new customers every day in 2022</a>, but we haven't seen a 2023 overview yet.</em></p>
<p>For Linux specifically, only 7% said they were developing for it. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3005878181705926042gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3005878181705926042gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Image credit: GDC, click to enlarge.</em></p>
<p>The really interesting bit though is when it comes to generative AI. The <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/valve-announces-new-rules-for-games-with-ai-content-on-steam/" target="_blank">AI flood gates have been opened by Valve for Steam</a> with their new rules, and no doubt many developers will be looking into using it, and some already are. According to the survey 49% of developers overall are using it or they have colleagues using it. That's split across many departments though from finance to programming and all sorts. But AI generation is <em>clearly</em> already popular.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11520891591705926432gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11520891591705926432gol1.jpg"/> </a><br/>

<em>Image credit: GDC, click to enlarge.</em></p>
<p>The survey also showed that indie developers were more likely to be the ones using AI at 37%, and not the bigger AAA lot at 21%. Although no doubt this will change over time as AI generation continues improving. When asked about how developers think the impact of generative AI will be only 21% were positive about it, with 57% feeling mixed and 18% having a negative opinion of it. Only 1% thought it would have no impact and another 3% didn't know.</p>

      <title>MONSTER HUNTER RISE adds new DRM that breaks it on Steam Deck (UPDATED)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 19:06 UTC</strong> - Valve have now fixed it in Proton Hotfix. To select it go into the game Properties -&gt; Compatibility, tick the box and select Proton Hotfix from the drop-down box. If you do not see Proton Hotfix in the drop-down box, search for Proton Hotfix in your Steam Library and install it. It <em>might</em> sometimes still crash on launch, just try again.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3492013371705955048gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3492013371705955048gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Capcom have rolled out an update to MONSTER HUNTER RISE, and sadly it has broken it on Steam Deck. As they continue attempting to change their DRM in older games.</p>
<p>They're swapping from Denuvo over to Enigma which seems to be the cause of the problems, and it's not the first title they've tried this with. In the patch notes for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1446780/view/3970553140557253784" target="_blank">Ver.16.0.2.0</a> Capcom updated it to note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There have been reports of the game not running on Steam Deck after updating to Ver.16.0.2.0.<br/>
The dev team is currently investigating this issue.<br/>
We will let you know as soon as we find out more, so please hold on for further information.<br/>
<br/>
We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the actual changes list, Capcom didn't even state the change to the DRM, they're clearly trying to keep it quiet. This bugs me. Any form of anti-cheat and DRM should be clearly noted not just on Steam pages - but in update notes too. Consumers should be <em>properly</em> informed.</p>
<p>Shame that Capcom didn't think to test their game considering it's Steam Deck Verified. Although, verification is done by Valve directly, it doesn't actually mean a game developer supports it.</p>
<p>Hopefully Capcom will reverse the change, or Valve will find a solution in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> to get it working again. From reports I've seen it affects Linux desktop too, not just Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Previously, Capcom added Enigma DRM to Resident Evil Revelations (released on Steam in 2013), which caused problems for players and Capcom ended up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/222480/view/3990818705013251073" target="_blank">reversing</a> the update (but said they would fix it and re-release it). This caused players to review-bomb the title with the most recent review score showing as Overwhelmingly Negative.</p>

      <title>Palworld is Steam Deck Playable and runs on Desktop Linux with Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Palworld is a new release on Steam in Early Access from Pocketpair. A fusion of Pokémon with monster catching, farming, building and much more. It is Steam Deck Playable and does work on Desktop Linux too. Note: personal purchase.</p>
<p>What has often been referred to as Pokémon with guns, it's already proving to be a <em>big</em> hit with a current peak player count of <s>250,553</s> <strong>294,826</strong> (it keeps going up every refresh) on Steam and a Very Positive user rating. So it seems like it might be the first big indie hit of 2024. So it's great news that it works right away!</p>
<p>Valve has already put it through Deck Verified and gave it a Steam Deck Playable rating, and Valve set Proton Experimental for it by default on Steam Deck, so for best experience on Desktop Linux make sure you set Proton Experimental in the Properties -&gt; Compatibility menu.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/153125261705670783gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/153125261705670783gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3959857031705670782gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3959857031705670782gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
Pictured: Palworld on Kubuntu 23.10. Click them to enlarge.</em></p>
<p>For Steam Deck the performance does have some issues and Valve noted various problems in their testing including: small text, graphics needing to be configured manually, you need to manually bring up the on-screen keyboard and some functionality may not be accessible with the default controller configuration.</p>
<p>It was designed as a multiplayer game clearly in many ways with support for 4 player co-op and 32 players on dedicated servers. You can play solo without issues though.</p>
<p>In my own testing on a Steam Deck OLED I've been using these settings:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18217485191705673122gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18217485191705673122gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>So far, this has given a somewhat acceptable performance level. It ranges from 25-45 FPS depending on what I am doing which is very playable - most of the time above 30FPS. Some spots in the open world I've seen bring it down to 25FPS, especially during bigger combat sections. However, one clear problem is the menu system. Some of the in-game menus bring the performance down pretty hard to around 20FPS but it will come back up when you close the menus.</p>
<p>Text is definitely small too, I've had to pull the Steam Deck closer to my face to actually read some of the on-screen details, so it's quite annoying. It's going to need some text scaling quite urgently as it's really <em>not</em> comfortable to read a lot of it. The icons are tiny too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16525324941705673400gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16525324941705673400gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13046520741705673720gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13046520741705673720gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Palworld on Steam Deck. Click them to enlarge.</em></p>
<p>For battery life on the Steam Deck OLED, you're looking at around ~2 hours from a full charge with a 60FPS frame limit.</p>
<p>Meanwhile on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 23.10) with an AMD Ryzen 5800X and Radeon 6800XT the experience has been overall pretty great. Testing on the highest possible graphics settings it's always been above 60FPS so far. Most of the time between 80-120FPS depending on where I am in the open world and what I'm doing. For a <em>big</em> open world game in Early Access running through Proton, that's actually pretty good.</p>
<p>This is only an early preliminary test as i haven't had too long with it, so keep that in mind. It's also Early Access, so everything is subject to change but it's an incredibly promising start for Palworld.</p>
<p>One thing I will address directly, since this always comes up in comments whenever there's a new monster catching game, the elephant in the room — Nintendo. They don't (and can't) own the rights to an entire genre, but Pokémon is obviously popular and so there's always comparisons but Nintendo can't just go after developers of other similar games. However, in <em>this</em> case, <em>plenty</em> of the creatures <em>do</em> have a striking similarity to various Pokémon designs and some even look like colour-flips with a few tweaks. So it will be very interesting to see what happens for this one specifically.</p>
<p>Something else that needs noting, is that the developer still has other games in Early Access while launching this also into Early Access. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1307550/Craftopia/" target="_blank">Craftopia</a>, for example, looks largely similar. Like they took their own game, and added these creatures into it to make it a different game.</p>
<p>To sum up what I've seen of it so far it feels very much like a blending of ARK Survival Evolved, Pokémon and Zelda: Breath of the Wild mechanically. One or two sounds even seemed like they were right out of Zelda (very close at least). It's <em>very</em> derivative. But then so are a lot of survival games. The small human of mine is going to <em>freak</em> when they see it. I can definitely see why people are enjoying it so much already and I fear it's going to take over my life for a while.</p>

<p>Update 21/01/24: the article originally said Palworld had an internet requirement for single-player, as <a href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5416795271705868918gol1.jpeg" target="_blank">Valve state it</a> on their Deck Verified rating. Valve's notice is incorrect so the article text was updated. Additionally here's a new Steam Deck video of the game and some quick thoughts:</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

      <title>Steam Beta adds explainers to Steam Deck performance menu - plus fixes for Desktop too</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released a new Beta for the Steam Deck and Steam Desktop that improved numerous bugs, and for Steam Deck makes the performance menu a little easier to understand.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3944657442696228020" target="_blank">Changes</a> for the Steam Deck:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated embedded Chromium build in Steam to 109.0.5414.120.</li>
<li>Updated the quick access performance menu with descriptions for each setting, including how they affect the system and the expected power/performance/visual quality tradeoffs.</li>
<li>Fixed a case where the sdcard was set as the default install location on reboot.</li>
<li>Fixed a case where the network status icon would fail to render for virtual networks.</li>
<li>Fixed store button on main menu remaining disabled in Family View even if store permissions were granted to the account.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed occasionally creating an extra virtual controller that is non-responsive.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's an example of the new performance menu descriptions:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6371681281705663639gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6371681281705663639gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>This is really great, because the option names by themselves are not easy for a lot of people to understand, and this should just help make the features more accessible. The menu itself also has fancy new icons:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10109357821705663644gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10109357821705663644gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>For Steam Desktop here's the Beta <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053/view/3966049540915750443" target="_blank">changes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated embedded Chromium build in Steam to 109.0.5414.120</li>
<li>Fixed issue where clicking on Voice Chat invitation notifications did not open chat</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Big Picture Mode</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved the display in the "Controller Configuration" tab when there are no controllers attached or the active controller is opted out of Steam Input</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remote Play</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Greatly improved performance when using hardware encoding with AMD video cards on Windows</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SteamVR</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improve layout and imagery for some of the dialogs that show up when launching VR games.</li>
<li>Clicking on items in the control bar (e.g. a download in progress) will correctly switch to the Steam tab</li>
<li>Show reloading message when SteamVR quits before reloading the Steam window</li>
<li>Steam now only reloads every fifth time that SteamVR quits</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Linux</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Known issue: when dismissing a dropdown menu, the steam client may incorrectly start blocking mouse input.</li>
</ul>

      <title>GPU Reshape is a fancy new open source tool for developers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A fresh announcement for developers today is GPU Reshape, a free and open source tool that could be really useful for game developers working with Vulkan and DirectX 12 to deal with potentially undefined behaviour. </p>
<p>According to the post it's a collaboration between AMD and Avalanche Studios Group, which then continued externally with Miguel Petersen of Striking Distance Studios (prev at Avalanche) who is the author of GPU Reshape with help from various other developers. Great to see AMD and more game developers value open source.</p>
<p>What is it actually for? If you're not a game developer, it's probably complicated to understand. It's not my expertise either, but I love seeing game developer toolkits like this release as open source. Petersen even clearly states in the post that Linux support is <em>planned</em> for it! For more games to support Linux / Steam Deck well — developers need the tools too. As per the blog post Petersen explained it as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A toolset that leverages on-the-fly instrumentation of GPU operations with instruction-level validation of potentially undefined behavior, supporting both DX12 and Vulkan. A standalone desktop application with no integration required, all open source (MIT), is now available in Beta.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17463430641705595383gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17463430641705595383gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured - GPU Reshape, credit to Miguel Petersen</em></p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GPU Reshape brings powerful features typical of CPU tooling to the GPU, providing validation of dynamic behaviour, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resource Bounds</strong> Validation of resource read / write coordinates against its bounds.</li>
<li><strong>Export Stability</strong> Numeric stability validation of floating point exports (UAV writes, render targets, vertex exports), e.g. NaN / Inf.</li>
<li><strong>Descriptor Validation</strong> Validation of descriptors, potentially dynamically indexed. This includes undefined, mismatched (compile-time to runtime), out of bounds descriptor indexing, and missing table bindings.</li>
<li><strong>Concurrency Validation</strong> Validation of resource concurrency, i.e. single-producer or multiple-consumer, between queues and events.</li>
<li><strong>Resource Initialization</strong> Validation of resource initialization, ensures any read was preceded by a write. (*1)</li>
<li><strong>Infinite Loops</strong> Detection of infinite loops. <em>Experimental</em>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a number of other planned additions, as they hope to see it evolve into a general purpose tool including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Shader debugging, providing the ability to inspect live data as the shader sees it.</li>
<li>Shader assertions, in source assertions typical of CPU code.</li>
<li>Branch hot spots, live hot spot profiling of all branches.</li>
<li>Branch coherence, live coherence analysis of all branches.</li>
<li>And more!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Deep survival game Vintage Story adds cave-ins, improved first-person, lots more animals</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vintage Story is a brutal deep survival game that I just love to watch expand, because it's so filled full of content it's spilling over the sides. The latest release, v1.19.0 Dejank Redux brings in even more content.</p>
<p>When it comes to content additions there's 11 new species of deer, 11 types of goats, you can now catch animals with a basket, antlers and horns you can mount on walls, a rework of ruins, new accessibility settings, snowballs, more character customization options, tule and sedge plants, an overhauled first-person mode, a cave-in system when digging and so much more.</p>
<p>This game is really quite something, and pretty darn challenging too.</p>

      <title>Tomb Raider I-III Remastered gets Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tomb Raider I-III Remastered is releasing from Aspyr and Crystal Dynamics on February 14th, and now Valve have given it the green tick of approval as it is now Steam Deck Verified. It was tested on the latest stable Proton 8 release, so as long as you use that across Steam Deck / Desktop Linux you should be good to go.</p>
<p>With this bundle you'll get Tomb Raider I + Unfinished Business, Tomb Raider II + Golden Mask and Tomb Raider III + The Lost Artifact. Aspyr say it has upgraded graphics, with the option to switch to the original polygon look at any time.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="68hISohBKmI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b5ec2a583843ecf225dac38e2674861b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/68hISohBKmI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can pre-order via:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/tomb_raider_i_to_iii_remastered" target="_blank">GOG</a> (you can use Lutris / Heroic)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/tomb-raider-iiii-remastered?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a></p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2478970/Tomb_Raider_IIII_Remastered_Starring_Lara_Croft/" target="_blank">Steam</a></p>
<p>Will you be picking it up to have a nostalgia blast? Worth pointing out the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/open-source-re-implementation-of-tomb-raider-1-1996-tr1x-gets-a-big-bug-fix-release/" target="_blank">open source re-implementation of Tomb Raider 1 (1996) TR1X</a> also exists. Remasters can be a pretty great thing to bring new audiences to older games, although they don't always hit, so hopefully Aspyr were careful with the Tomb Raider I-III Remastered collection.</p>

      <title>Exiled is a new compact puzzle thriller from the director of My Friendly Neighborhood</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Up for being puzzled and thrilled at the same time in a compact setting? John Szymanski, director of My Friendly Neighborhood, has released a standalone version of Exiled.</p>
<p>The developer said to expect an experience sort-of like Myst and The Room:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A note has been left on her desk talking of "the ancient evil" and "banishment to a different realm." The eldritch tome and an untranslated scrap she had been studying act as the only clues to her disappearance. Use clues found in the book to translate an ancient language, evade the lurking horrors, and solve the mystery of the strange objects around you!</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UNBYgBHS_e0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/82925969cbd0892222bffa3fea01d923.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UNBYgBHS_e0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The original was part of Dread X Collection 2 but now you can buy it standalone, and with Native Linux support too. It's had a few upgrades since then for this version including new voice acting, a re-written narrative, updated visuals, better scares and so on. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2741620/discussions/0/4139437492717265200/#c4139437492723453667" target="_blank">According to the dev</a> it's "significantly more engaging for a new player".</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Solve ancient puzzles, decode an eldritch language, and avoid the lurking horror all while sitting at a single desk.</li>
<li>Tense and foreboding atmosphere where the stillness of the library can be shattered at any moment.</li>
<li>High level of interactivity.</li>
<li>Multiple endings.</li>
<li>Good for a single play session.</li>
<li>Voiceover by Tom Schalk.</li>
</ul>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2741620/Exiled/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Popular mobile puzzle game classic Threes! is launching on PC for its 10th anniversary</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Threes! took the mobile world by storm back in 2014 winning the Apple Design Award, and finally for its 10th anniversary it will be coming to Steam so we can all get in on the fun. Releasing on February 6th, it appears it will have Native Linux support too!</p>
<p>It's been through a few upgrades it seems for the Steam version too with controller support and Steam Cloud support too. Might be a good one to chill out with in your coffee breaks at your desk, or on your Steam Deck too (if mobile is not your thing…). A puzzle game that just keeps on going and going until you get tired of it, ready to pick up again another day.</p>
<p>Original trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rgpJUj7GUFQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dc70115a16cb419fa8a9d7ba39980d84.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rgpJUj7GUFQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The Steam page is light on details, because not much is needed. You slide around numbers to make more numbers. Brilliant in its simplicity.</p>
<p>Much like the more recent hit Wordle, Threes! ended up with a huge amount of games just entirely copying the idea. One that went viral was 2048 (<a href="https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048" target="_blank">open source</a>) although technically a clone of another similar game (it gets complicated), which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22914955/threes-2048-ketchapp-copycats-clones-mobile-games" target="_blank">The Verge</a> wrote a bit of a round-up about back in 2022. This happens a <em>lot</em> on mobile though, as game-farms see an idea and copy it as quickly as they can. Somewhat reminds me of how Vampire Survivors made a few mechanics popular, and now it has a growing amount of similar games.</p>
<p>Have a look and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1818570/Threes/" target="_blank">wishlist Threes! on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Time Survivors is the most completely absurd Vampire Survivors-like yet</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Time Survivors just released on Steam and like many horde survival games it takes the idea of Vampire Survivors, and puts a few little different ideas into the mix and it's probably the most insane one yet. My time has been testing it with Proton 8 where it works great on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 23.10) and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Lunar Chili, the developer, say it is the "most historically inaccurate roguelike ever made", although they're stretching the term roguelike there. Apart from some odd wording (probably translation issues) and some balancing needing to be done, it's actually a whole lot of fun — and really quite challenging, more so than most in the VS knock-off genre. I say knock-off lovingly, because I do enjoy all these games very much, but VS clearly started a whole specific thing here.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10506505891705577572gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10506505891705577572gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The characters of course are completely ridiculous, as are some of their abilities. The enemies make absolutely <em>no</em> sense either. You'll be coming up against flying skulls, giant multi-headed fire-breathing dogs, dinosaurs, big flying golden gargoyles, massive flesh-eating plants and it seems <em>whatever</em> the hell they felt like putting in the game. Don't go into this one expecting anything to make sense, and that's what I love about this one. It's so ridiculous and stupid with the setting it just works, it's fun and that's the important thing.</p>
<p>Not many games you can say you played as Abraham Lincoln fighting off zombies and rats while throwing around a Yo-yo and a Flail. Oh and your special ability as Abe is to throw down some Cherry Blossom trees to block enemies, because yeah - that makes sense? Everything in the game is like that just pure absurdity.</p>
<p>Upgrades for days too, with quite an interesting system. You can upgrade each character, each weapon...and so on. And certain types of upgrades need different resources, so you'll be on the hunt on each map for more than just gold.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18257844401705579642gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18257844401705579642gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You even have map-based mini-events to do as well, like a Time Circle where you have to stay inside a blue zone while a big clock hand moves around it. However, invincible Time Guardians that look suspiciously like butterflies are flying around trying to hit you while you're in the zone. On top of that there's special challenges that you get by finding relics, that will give you a boost if you manage to purge their effects like killing 200 creatures, but each creature death shoots out a bunch of deadly petals. Or survive for 60 seconds while giant snakes made of skulls filling up the screen come after you.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1855596851705578623gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1855596851705578623gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p><em>Total madness.</em></p>
<p>At one point I turned into a giant. Giant Abe! Stomping all over everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7943437171705578479gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7943437171705578479gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Play as epic historic characters, each with their unique ability.</li>
<li>Historically inaccurate stages such as the Stone Age, the Dark Age, Ancient Egypt, and more full of enemies, secrets, mini bosses and end-stage boss.</li>
<li>Skill-tree based meta progression for all elements in the game.</li>
<li>Hundreds of different weapons, buffs, Cursed Relics, Powerups, and unlockables to choose from for a unique experience every run.</li>
<li>Casual quick 20 minute play sessions + plenty of quests and secrets to discover.</li>
<li>A Sandbox mode to test any overpowered build and train against any enemy.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you love these survivor-like horde survival games, it seems Time Survivors is one you need to try.</p>
<p>For desktop Linux everything worked as expected, but for Steam Deck (and gamepads) the experienced needs to be improved. The developers say they test it themselves, and on their Steam forum they <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2211390/discussions/0/3766732914510239086/" target="_blank">claim</a> "Yes, Time Survivors is compatible with Steam Deck." but it only has <em>partial</em> controller support with some parts like the unlock screen not working with gamepad at all. I had to switch Steam Input to keyboard+mouse for it to work well on Steam Deck and be playable. Which is fine, as the controls are incredibly simple. Apart from that though, on Steam Deck (OLED), the only time I saw performance drop was taking down a big enemy where <em>lots</em> of gold spawned, while there were <em>tons</em> of other enemies but that came back up quickly.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2211390/Time_Survivors/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA 535.154.05 for Linux brings a few bug fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update</strong>: it turns out, once again, NVIDIA released a new driver and copy-pasted the changelog from a previous version. This is <em>at least</em> the third time they've done this now. The changelog below is actually from the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/Download/driverResults.aspx/216728/en-uk/" target="_blank">535.146.02</a> driver, that was released in December. I've contacted NVIDIA to find out what's actually in the 535.154.05 driver. The only actual change that can be seen right now is this new driver notes it supports the new GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER in the Supported Products section, but the actual changelog <em>hasn't</em> changed.</p>
<hr/>
<p>NVIDIA released driver version 535.154.05 for Linux on January 16th bringing with it a few useful sounding bug fixes, so here's what's new for the first NVIDIA update of 2024. Quite a small one to start the year!</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/Download/driverResults.aspx/217862/en-uk" target="_blank">release page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause some multi-GPU systems to crash on suspend.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause the system to crash when an application is run with __NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which prevented application profiles from getting applied to PRIME Render Offloaded applications running via Wine.</li>
<li>Disabled PRIME Display Offload Sink support for virtual displays on datacenter GPUs. This prevents unusable desktop layouts from getting automatically configured on systems with a mix of physical and virtual displays.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused high CPU usage during system suspend, which could lead to the system not entering s2idle in some cases.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused the nvidia-settings control panel to crash when running on Wayland with newer versions of libwayland-client.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This release is from their "Production Branch", so anyone should be good to go on upgrading to it as it's a normal stable driver release.</p>
<p>Is there an NVIDIA driver bug that you're currently waiting on being solved? Does this driver cause issues for you? Let me know in the comments.</p>

      <title>Valve seeing increasing bug reports due to Steam Snap - other methods recommended</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Canonical announced some time ago their Steam Snap which was promoted as <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/ubuntu-2304-is-out-now-with-gnome-44-and-a-stable-steam-snap/" target="_blank">stable with Ubuntu 23.04</a>, as they continue to push their own packaging format with Snap but it seems this has been causing problems for Valve.</p>
<p>Writing on Mastodon, developer Timothee "TTimo" Besset, who works on various things for Valve <a href="https://mastodon.social/@TTimo/111772575146054328" target="_blank">posted</a> asking people to consider using the official Valve .deb package or at least consider using the <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/com.valvesoftware.Steam" target="_blank">Flatpak</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Valve is seeing an increasing number of bug reports for issues caused by Canonical's repackaging of the Steam client through snap.</p>
<p>The best way to install Steam on Debian and derivative operating systems is to follow the instructions at <a href="http://repo.steampowered.com/steam/" target="_blank" title="http://repo.steampowered.com/steam/">http://repo.steampowered.com/steam/</a> and use the official .deb</p>
<p>We are not involved with the snap repackaging. It has a lot of issues.</p>
<p>If you don't want the .deb, please at least consider the flatpak version.</p>
<cite>Timothee "TTimo" Besset</cite></blockquote>
<p>So if you've been having various problems with Steam on Ubuntu (or a derivative like Kubuntu), it may be because you've installed it as a Snap. Worth trying out the official .deb or Flatpak to see if it runs better for you. You can also give Canonical feedback in your issues on their <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/tag/gaming" target="_blank">Discourse Forum</a> and report issues to Valve on <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues" target="_blank">GitHub</a> (if you're using their official packages).</p>
<p><em>Hopefully Canonical can look into any issues.</em></p>

      <title>Against the Storm 1.1 (and later hotfixes) bring various Steam Deck improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Against the Storm is a dark fantasy city builder where you must rebuild civilization in the face of apocalyptic rains, and the recent 1.0 release came with it being Steam Deck Verified but the developer hasn't stopped making improvements for Steam Deck in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1336490/view/5797888151160865057" target="_blank">version 1.1</a> out now.</p>
<p>While version 1.1 did bring some new content like unique portraits for all traders, new decorations, new orders, new sound effects, notifications with auto-pause, UI improvements and more it's nice to see them also focus on Steam Deck too. For the v1.1 update the Steam Deck changes are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Changed the way the trackpad works in the Steam Deck version of the game when using the controller layout. Instead of acting like an analog stick, it now behaves like a real mouse trackpad.</li>
<li>When starting fresh on the Steam Deck, the game will now automatically load the medium graphics preset and have uncapped FPS by default for a smoother experience.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>However, they've also subsequently released a couple of hotfixes with more changes including in v1.1.2:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue with the Enter key not committing changes on the Steam Deck's virtual keyboard.</li>
<li>We temporarily reversed the recent changes to the default Steam Deck controller layout to avoid the cursor issues.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Here they also noted they were aware of an issue "that prevents Steam Deck players from starting a new settlement from the World Map" that they were looking into. Following that, version 1.1.4 was released and further noted these Steam Deck improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where the Right Trigger would stop working when using the trackpad (when playing with the official controller layout).</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the controller pointer would disappear in the embarkation panel and citadel.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Really nice to see the developer, Eremite Games, really pay attention to their Steam Deck support and fix issues as they get found. It's one thing to get Steam Deck Verification from Valve's own testing, it's another to directly support it like this.</p>

      <title>NonSteamLaunchers for other stores on Steam Deck adds automatic game shortcuts</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NonSteamLaunchers is an application <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/get-battlenet-ea-epic-games-and-more-on-steam-deck-the-easy-way/" target="_blank">I showed off a while ago</a>, that gives you a helping hand in installing other game stores and launchers on Steam Deck. The latest update, version 3.2, adds in some really useful helpful features.</p>
<p>There's a lot of stores and streaming services supported including Amazon Games, Battle.net, EA App, Epic Games, GOG Galaxy, Rockstar, Ubisoft, Minecraft and more.</p>
<p>In the latest update they added a feature to the app the automatically scans and adds your games installed via Epic Games and Ubisoft Connect, with more services planned to be supported on that soon. All you need to do is install a game via one of them, and then you can restart Steam to have them be picked up. They also added in proper artwork for launchers, games and supported streaming services so it all looks neat and tidy.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12094501301705502113gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12094501301705502113gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>They also said it should hopefully now support multiple Steam accounts, they fixed up the SD Card path for the SteamOS 3.5 update, plus various other small fixes and improvements.</p>
<p>Overall it sounds like a great update.</p>

      <title>THE FINALS big 1.5.0 update out with new mode - continues working on Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/the-finals-now-appears-to-work-on-steam-deck-and-desktop-linux/" target="_blank">I recently reported on THE FINALS</a> now working on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux, and it seems even with the latest major update just released with version 1.5.0 bringing a new game mode it continues working.</p>
<p>With it using Easy Anti-Cheat, it's still quite a surprise to see it actually working. Especially since there's been no official word from the developer, and they have not replied to my previous email about it. Easy Anti-Cheat does support Linux both Native Linux and Windows games in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a>, but developers need to enable it manually — so it seems they have. But it's still odd not to see any official word on it around 5 days later.</p>
<p>Screenshots of it on Kubuntu 23.10 with MangoHud, click shots to enlarge:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3237735761705499959gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3237735761705499959gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13597075261705499960gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13597075261705499960gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>On Linux Desktop / Steam Deck, just ensure you've set it to Proton Experimental in the Properties -&gt; Compatibility menu in your Steam Library to have it work. There's some issues though like with voice chat (turn it off) and certain graphical options that may cause crashes - but for me it's been smooth sailing.</p>
<p>One issue that has come up is if your CPU support AVX512, you will need to add "clearcpuid=304" to your GRUB boot menu (thanks <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/194yurj/comment/khkscq3/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank">Reddit</a>).</p>
<p>Version 1.5.0 brings with it a new limited-time solo mode "Solo Bank It":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today we are introducing our very first limited-time mode (LTM): Solo Bank It!<br/>
This experimental twist on Bank It pits contestants against each other in a fight for individual glory in a 12-player arena. Just like Bank It, the first to amass 40,000 and deposit in the cash-out station wins. Solo queuers, rejoice!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's plenty of other fixes and improvements you can see in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2073850/view/3963797741108613372" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>
<p>Latest update video is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="etpFbuVapb0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6edc56a5be5caf20ce77956a872bc758.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/etpFbuVapb0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Really great to see such a popular game like this working so well now!</p>

      <title>PlayStation Remote Play app for Steam Deck &#39;chiaki4deck&#39; can now put the system to sleep</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just recently the open source PlayStation Remote Play app for Steam Deck, chiaki4deck, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/open-source-playstation-remote-play-app-for-steam-deck-chiaki4deck-gets-a-big-upgrade/" target="_blank">got a big update</a> but it came with a few issues that needed solving and a new v1.6.1 is out now. Plus a fun new feature was added.</p>
<p>This is a great app for those of you who have either a PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5 and a Steam Deck, especially when you want to continue gaming but someone else wants the TV it's connected to. This is actually a fork of the original Chiaki, with enhancements to make it work better directly on the Steam Deck along with better documentation.</p>
<p>New features and fixes in v1.6.1:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixes console registration.</li>
<li>Fixes fullscreen double-click and F11 shortcuts.</li>
<li>Don't close main window when closing stream session on MacOS.</li>
<li>Adds option to sleep PlayStation when sleeping Steam Deck.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Ubisoft think gamers need to get comfortable with not owning games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-new-ubisoft-and-getting-gamers-comfortable-with-not-owning-their-games" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a> recently spoke to Ubisoft, and something said during the interview seems to have created some sparks across the industry about game ownership.</p>
<p>What was said is not all that surprising really. Ubisoft, like multiple others, run subscription services with theirs being Ubisoft+ that just had a bit of a change into multiple tiers. These services are everywhere now like Xbox Game Pass, EA Play and others. That, and GI.biz spoke to Philippe Tremblay, director of subscriptions at Ubisoft so obviously they're going to be somewhat biased on what they think — it's their job.</p>
<p>From the interview, the bit in question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the things we saw is that gamers are used to, a little bit like DVD, having and owning their games. That's the consumer shift that needs to happen. They got comfortable not owning their CD collection or DVD collection. That's a transformation that's been a bit slower to happen [in games]. As gamers grow comfortable in that aspect… you don't lose your progress. If you resume your game at another time, your progress file is still there. That's not been deleted. You don't lose what you've built in the game or your engagement with the game. So it's about feeling comfortable with not owning your game.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The GOG team certainly took notice, <a href="https://twitter.com/GOGcom/status/1747335663995818251" target="_blank">mentioning</a> on X (formerly Twitter): "You should feel extremely comfortable with owning your games on GOG (they're DRM-free) :)".</em></p>
<p>It's worth noting that clearly it's going well for Ubisoft, as Tremblay mentioned October 2023 was their biggest month in Ubisoft+ history. So people are clearly buying into game subscriptions more and more. And related, Microsoft said back in 2022 that Xbox Game Pass had 25 million subscribers. Subscriptions are clearly here to stay.</p>
<p>Also worth noting, to be clear, Ubisoft don't plan to force you into one way or another noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The point is not to force users to go down one route or another," he explains. "We offer purchase, we offer subscription, and it's the gamer's preference that is important here. We are seeing some people who buy choosing to subscribe now, but it all works."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given how services can just entirely remove your paid-for content, this whole issue of ownership is a concerning one. Like how Sony were going to just remove previously purchased Discovery content from users, although they've since <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/legal/psvideocontent/" target="_blank">backtracked</a> on that after public outcry.</p>
<p>The thing is, you have to remember, you don't actually own your games on Steam either. This has been well-known for a long time now. As per Steam's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/" target="_blank">Subscriber Agreement</a> under the "A. General Content and Services License" section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] The Content and Services are licensed, not sold. Your license confers no title or ownership in the Content and Services. To make use of the Content and Services, you must have a Steam Account and you may be required to be running the Steam client and maintaining a connection to the Internet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll admit, it's not <em>entirely</em> the same. Valve won't take away your games if you don't pay them every month, it's not a subscription in the same way, and plenty of games on Steam are actually <em>entirely</em> DRM-free and can be run outside of Steam. But still, it's something to remember, ownership has been on the decline for a long time.</p>
<p>A lot of it simply comes down to convenience though right? Plenty of us pay for Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime and so on and so on — so we can just quickly jump into a show or a movie they have available. But then the problem there is, again, everyone wants their own service. There's more popping up all the time, and rights on various shows end up split between them and you end up paying more and more (look at <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/animation/where-to-watch-pokemon-episodes-movies" target="_blank">the mess</a> of Pokémon streaming) and never owning a damn thing.</p>
<p>Over to you in the comments: what are your thoughts? </p>

      <title>Wine 9.0 brings much improved Windows app and game compatibility to Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's here! The official release of Wine 9.0 has now been made available, bringing the next-generation of Windows compatibility to Linux for apps and games. This is the tech that forms a major part of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a>.</p>
<p>This release has been a year in the making, with a new stable Wine release done once a year with many development releases in between bringing over 7,000 individual changes. There's some truly big stuff in this release too and some of the highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>An experimental Wayland graphics driver, not enabled by default yet.</li>
<li>Lots of WoW64 work including the completion of converting modules to PE format to "introduce a proper boundary between the Windows and Unix worlds". They say it's now possible to run 32-bit Windows applications on a purely 64-bit Unix installation but this new WoW64 mode is not yet enabled by default.</li>
<li>The completion of the PE/Unix separation means that it's possible to run existing Windows binaries on ARM64.</li>
<li>The Vulkan driver supports up to version 1.3.272 of the Vulkan spec.</li>
<li>Various optimizations have been made to core WineD3D and the Vulkan backend.</li>
<li>A number of GdiPlus functions are optimized for better graphics performance.</li>
<li>The Windows Media Video (WMV) decoder DirectX Media Object (DMO) is implemented.</li>
<li>DirectInput action maps are implemented, improving compatibility with many old games that use this to map controller inputs to in-game actions.</li>
<li>URL/URI protocol associations are exported as URL handlers to the Linux desktop.</li>
<li>Lots of Internationalization improvements including updates for Unicode and better support for native Windows IME implementations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The list goes on for a while, that's just some cherry-picked big additions.</p>
<p>As a result of all the changes many more applications and games designed for Windows will now run on Linux (and other platforms where Wine can run).</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/releases/wine-9.0" target="_blank">full release notes</a> for all the changes.</p>

      <title>Prison Architect 2 announced from Paradox Interactive and Double Eleven</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As soon as I saw a Prison Architect teaser recently, I knew this was about to come! Prison Architect 2 has now been formally announced from Paradox Interactive with Double Eleven on developer duty.</p>
<p>This was expected anyway, since <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/01/paradox-interactive-have-purchased-the-rights-to-prison-architect-from-introversion/" target="_blank">Paradox purchased the rights to Prison Architect</a> back in early 2019, and then in March 2023 <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/prison-architect-has-a-final-free-update-out-now/" target="_blank">the original had its final upgrade</a>. So of course Paradox weren't going to sit on it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LiymA3jw0fQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5dc737c78cfd0d25e41c759b22357956.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LiymA3jw0fQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>The World’s Greatest Prison Simulation Game - Now in 3D! </strong>Use your resources to build, manage, and control your prison in classic Prison Architect playstyle—now in 3 glorious dimensions! Design every corner of your prison and manage everything from daily schedules to policies, and ensure your prison is safe, self-sustaining, and secure.</li>
<li><strong>Build the Ultimate Penitentiary: </strong>Establish all of your prison infrastructure over multiple floors, and use tons of snazzy new tools that allow you to build a state-of-the-art correctional facility. The design of your prison will affect every aspect of your inmates’ lives, so make your schemes accordingly!</li>
<li><strong>The Smartest Inmates Ever: </strong>Unique inmates have schemes of their own – they now form distinct relationships that influence behavior, make decisions based on wants and needs, and plot their paths better than ever. Watch as they interact and attempt to navigate the daily trials of your prison. Remember that every choice you make might either help or hinder your inmates' correctional journey. What type of relationships will your inmates have with your prison?</li>
<li><strong>The Prison Magnate: </strong>Establish and run a true institution from the top, building up unique correctional facilities in a freshly upgraded Career Mode that will take you across a brand new world map. Will your prisons end up being monuments to rehabilitation or retribution? Most importantly, will they pay the bills?</li>
<li><strong>Every Action has a Reaction: </strong>Choices matter and yours will determine the fate of your prison. More control than ever—over inmates, prison policies, architecture and more—means more ways for things to go well… or not! Plan carefully or you may have to cope with escapes, gang wars, and all sorts of expensive and destructive problems.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From the press release: “In Prison Architect 2, our team set out to create the next level in management gameplay. A greater degree of player freedom, impactful choices, and inmate simulation come together to provide an enhanced presentation of prison management, in a 3D world. Much loved features make a return to help you manage your inmates, quell riots, prevent escapes and share your prisons, but now cross-platform! In addition to a new upgrade system, a new Career Mode, and more.” said Gareth Wright, Game Director at Double Eleven. “We look forward to seeing how players get creative with multiple floors and catwalks to finally construct and expand in 3D. And then optimize and balance their prison’s safety, security and self-betterment.”</p>
<p>Currently, it seems much like Cities: Skylines 2 that Paradox also publishes, that the Native Linux and macOS support has been dropped. I've reached out to Paradox PR to clarify. Hopefully (and quite likely) it will run with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a>, and if not, no doubt future Proton updates could get it running like we've seen with the tens of thousands of games that run on desktop Linux and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>It's due out on March 26th.</p>
<p>You can follow / pre-order on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1257610/Prison_Architect_2/" target="_blank">Steam</a> for $39.99 / £34.99 / €39.99.</p>

      <title>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl releases September 5th, 2024</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GSC Game World announced that S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl has moved from its Q1 2024 release plan, to have a final release date of September 5th, 2024. While we don't know yet how it will run on Steam Deck or desktop Linux with Proton, it's likely to be one of the most popular releases on PC this year so it's worth keeping an eye on.</p>
<p>Speaking about the delay, GSC said "While there is absolutely no way to make another delay sound less dim, we decided to be clear about our reasons to postpone the game for the sake of yet another wave of polishing". Continuing they mentioned showing it off at Gamescom 2023 to a small set of people, but it showed the game needed more time in the oven for technical issues to be solved.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6o6D_a3PAHw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0d7468dd999d2555e011eebbbf571c9d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6o6D_a3PAHw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can also see their previous trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="XNGbS0fY80s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/04af652b1c31e25e03abed950ef42f86.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/XNGbS0fY80s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl is available for pre-order via:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/stalker_2_heart_of_chornobyl_standard_edition" target="_blank">GOG</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a></p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/" target="_blank">Steam</a> </p>
<p>So if you've not played the originals, you've now got a bit of extra time to jump into them and they all work on Linux desktop with Proton. Some work okay on Steam Deck too. Although, for Call of Pripyat, you may get a better experience with OpenXRay.</p>
<p>It's worth noting also that recently the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/stalker-game-engine-openxray-gets-taken-down-on-github/" target="_blank">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game engine OpenXRay got taken down on GitHub</a>, but it was later reinstated since the DMCA was fraudulent and GSC actually gave it their blessing. Nice to see another company look after their players and understand projects like that are actually good for their older games.</p>

      <title>winesapOS, the portable SteamOS-like Linux distro gets improved hardware support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you have a system you wish to try out Linux on for gaming be it an Apple Mac, a PC with Windows or anything else - perhaps give winesapOS a little try as you might find this SteamOS-like distribution to your liking. It offers up a portable solution with persistent storage, so you can load it up on a USB drive and take it anywhere</p>
<p>The main developer, Luke Short, emailed in about some major changes and improvements that have arrived with winesapOS version 3.4.0.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17417539781705414006gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17417539781705414006gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - The KDE Plasma Desktop Mode in winesapOS, just like SteamOS</em></p>
<p>Highlights of some improvements in v3.4.0 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Game Mode (Gamescope session - Steam Big Picture) support for Steam and Open Gamepad UI.</li>
<li>Improved hardware support:
<ul>
<li>Lots of new hardware support: Intel Arc dGPUs, Lenovo Legion Go, GPD Win 4, iPhone tethering, racing wheels, Razer accessories, and improved support for older AMD dGPUs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Downloading the operating system has been simplified:
<ul>
<li>Instead of extracting 3 to 7 parts of a split-up zip file (due to GitHub Release hosting constraints), we now provide a single zip file for each image type. This has been the biggest complaint that they finally addressed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A Recovery console to help you fix boot problems.</li>
<li>+ much more in the <a href="https://github.com/LukeShortCloud/winesapOS/releases/tag/3.4.0" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Framework email customers for data breach from accounting partner getting phished</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>No one is safe from data breaches, and at times it won't even be the company you've directly interacted and purchased from but their partners, like what recently happened to Framework. <em>Framework are the company that make the modular Framework laptop, which is really cool!</em></p>
<p>From what I can tell, Framework have not announced this in public but sent it in an email to affected customers which one decided to copy and paste on to the Framework Forum <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/framework-data-breach/43408" target="_blank">in a post</a>.</p>
<p>The email notes how their accounting partner, Keating Consulting, had a staff member fall victim to a "phishing email that utilized social engineering tactics to obtain customer PII (Personal Identifiable Information) associated with outstanding balances for Framework purchases" and anyone getting the email was affected by it. For those hit their full name, email address and balance owed would have been gained by the attackers.</p>
<p>Framework said about the list that it was "primarily of a subset of open pre-orders, but some completed past orders with pending accounting syncs were also included in this list".</p>
<p>One thing that has confused multiple people, is that even people who <em>don't</em> have an outstanding balance were emailed, which was cleared up in a <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/framework-data-breach/43408/5" target="_blank">later post</a> by a moderator forwarding information from the Framework team. There may not be a customer-facing balance, but their system may have a slight difference due to changes in taxes since an order.</p>
<p>It's just another reminder to be seriously careful on clicking links to ensure they really go to where they say, especially in emails, and not entering any information into a form you're not 100% sure on. It can happen to anyone. Always check the full URL.</p>

<hr/>
<p>Something else interesting for you: the Steam Deck has been in Steam's global Top 5 sellers (based on revenue) for the last 10 weeks in a row now. Of those 10 weeks it's spent 6 of them as number 1! While we don't know exact numbers, since Valve don't give any out, it's nice to see it continue to do so well.</p>
<p>What have you been playing recently on Steam Deck or Linux Desktop? What are your latest recommendations that people pick up and play?</p>

      <title>X.Org and Xwayland get new releases due to security issues</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's another reminder that checking regularly for updates is always a good thing, because there's new releases available for both the X.Org X and Xwayland due to multiple reported security issues.</p>
<p>First up, here's the actual listed issues reported and fixed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>CVE-2023-6816 can be triggered by passing an invalid array index to DeviceFocusEvent or ProcXIQueryPointer.</li>
<li>CVE-2024-0229 can be triggered if a device has both a button and a key class and zero buttons.</li>
<li>CVE-2024-21885 can be triggered if a device with a given ID was removed and a new device with the same ID added both in the same operation.</li>
<li>CVE-2024-21886 can be triggered by disabling a master device with disabled slave devices.</li>
<li>CVE-2024-0409 can be triggered by enabling SELinux xserver_object_manager and running a client.</li>
<li>CVE-2024-0408 can be triggered by enabling SELinux xserver_object_manager and creating a GLX PBuffer.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This security advisory went public on the X.Org <a href="https://lists.x.org/archives/xorg/2024-January/061525.html" target="_blank">mailing list</a> this morning.</p>
<p>The issues are present in X.Org X server prior to 21.1.11 and Xwayland prior to 23.2.4, both of which were just announced and released. The <a href="https://lists.x.org/archives/xorg/2024-January/061526.html" target="_blank">xorg-server 21.1.11</a> release additionally "also contains a fix for XRandR to allow for multiple virtual monitors on a physical display" plus <a href="https://lists.x.org/archives/xorg/2024-January/061527.html" target="_blank">xwayland 23.2.4</a> additionally "also contains several other fixes for glamor, libEI support, and FreeBSD".</p>

      <title>Open source re-implementation of Tomb Raider 1 (1996) TR1X gets a big bug-fix release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After adding in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/open-source-re-implementation-of-tomb-raider-1-tr1x-gets-linux-builds/" target="_blank">Linux support in the 3.0 release</a>, the Open source re-implementation of Tomb Raider 1 (1996) project TR1X has a fresh release out with lots of bug fixes.</p>
<p>Offering a huge amount of improvements over the original game from UI improvements to modern adjustments of the gameplay mechanics to feel better, no doubt this is currently the best way to play through the original Tomb Raider. Well, at least until the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/tomb-raider-i-iii-remastered-heads-to-steam-from-aspyr/" target="_blank">remasters of Tomb Raider 1-3 release next month</a>, although we've seen before many remasters aren't particularly great.</p>

      <title>Huge fantasy city-builder Songs of Syx latest massive update is out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After being in Beta since mid-December, the latest big content update to the fantasy city-builder Songs of Syx is out now bringing some sweeping changes. Still in Early Access but it's getting closer to the big 1.0 release.</p>
<p>More about it: Songs of Syx is a fantasy city-builder where you start off as an insignificant colony and build, scheme, and fight your way towards a metropolis and empire. The mechanics are complex and true to life, where small events can spiral into the collapse of kingdoms. Easy to learn, but impossible to master. It's set in a low-fantasy world with graphics aimed at stimulating your imagination.</p>
<p>The latest release, v65 "the way of water", features a big overhaul to the water system. This includes sweet and salty water that have different uses and a new water pumping system. Overall it sounds like there's a lot you can do with water in the game now like making canals, certain buildings use sweet water to function better and the water system just seems to have more depth to it now. Plus there's 4 new music tracks, an improve day/night cycle, new lock and unlock mechanics, new icons everywhere, lots of modding improvements, a new quarter-speed option was added, there's new damage and armour types, lots of UI reworks and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1162750/view/3905247944461887535" target="_blank">the list just goes on and on</a> as you'll see some of in the below video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EKCzZpcLSvg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/adaa7637a7861353d6afe557c70bc82f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EKCzZpcLSvg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>My early time with the game showed that it had incredible potential, and I've seen that some players have put in 100s of hours into it. It has an Overwhelmingly Positive rating for both Overall and Recent reviews on Steam, so clearly the developer has been knocking it out of the park with the regular massive updates. Seriously, the review numbers are impressive with only 93 negative versus 3,122 positive.</p>
<p>I just continue to be impressed at the sheer scope of it, the game is huge and has so much to do in it so I'm not surprised to see such huge game time from some players. If you've skipped over it or not heard of it before, time to put it on your radar for sure.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/songs_of_syx?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://songsofsyx.itch.io/songs-of-syx" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1162750/Songs_of_Syx/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>SMITE 2 announced with Steam Deck support from Titan Forge and Hi-Rez Studios</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Powered by the latest Unreal Engine 5, Titan Forge Games and Hi-Rez Studios recently revealed their third-person action MOBA, SMITE 2 that will be coming with Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>If you've not played before think perhaps more like Dota 2 but third-person and plays a bit more like an ARPG with the gameplay match progress of a MOBA. Which is where you take down towers and push through the map to take territory from the opposing team. SMITE 2 is a complete sequel built from the ground-up in Unreal Engine 5 to bring "everything players love about <em>SMITE</em> and wraps it in state of the art visuals, animations and gameplay".</p>
<p>They said to expect "a refined user interface, updated audio, clearer spell effects and fresh physics-based abilities for Gods such as Ymir, everything in the game has been improved" and that the "move to a new backend technology also brings state of the art cross-play, a ranked rework that contains new tiers and structures, alongside improved matchmaking".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="o1PHxmPq5o4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0873efb61a76fb0f33cc783a1ceed637.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/o1PHxmPq5o4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In their <a href="https://www.smite2.com/faqs/" target="_blank">official FAQ</a> under the supported platforms they note "SMITE 2 is a next-gen native title, in development for PC (Steam and Epic Games Store), PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and SteamDeck.". The note of Steam Deck support was also included in their official press release too.</p>
<p>Since they're testing on Steam Deck, no doubt it will work just fine on desktop Linux too with Proton.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2437170/SMITE_2/" target="_blank">wishlist on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>THE FINALS now appears to work on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this quite a surprise. THE FINALS is one of the most popular new online FPS games that uses Easy Anti-Cheat from Epic Online Services, and as of a recent update — it works on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux.</p>
<p>So far, I haven't seen anything official from the developer to confirm it was actually enabled intentionally, and I purposefully held off on this initially but it's been a few days and it's continued working. I tend to err on the side of caution, since we've seen other games with EAC previously work without knowing why and then break again shortly after. Hopefully THE FINALS will continue working, since it's so popular with it regularly seeing over 90,000 people (peak count) playing on Steam each day.</p>
<p>It can be a little <em>unstable</em> though, with some reporting Voice Chat and a few graphics options can cause crashes. However, now it actually works, testing can be done and so Valve can fix up issues in Proton, and developers on the various Linux graphics drivers as they get reported.</p>
<p>Some shots taken on Kubuntu 23.10, click pics to enlarge them:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10311690711705329445gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10311690711705329445gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4287879931705329448gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4287879931705329448gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9417234591705329447gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9417234591705329447gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21457644431705329448gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/21457644431705329448gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>If you make sure you set it to use Proton Experimental in the game properties on Steam, you should be good to go for now. There's lots of reports filling up on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/2073850?device=any" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> now too from people playing it across Linux Desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>With my own testing on Kubuntu 23.10 with an AMD Radeon 6800 XT on Mesa 23.3.3 on Epic settings pictured above with FSR set to Quality it has been running really smoothly overall.</p>
<p>Today I reached out to Embark Studios for a statement, so hopefully their team will be able to let us all know what's happening with it officially.</p>
<p>THE FINALS can be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2073850/THE_FINALS/" target="_blank">found on Steam</a> free to play.</p>

      <title>Lutris game manager v0.5.15 brings lots of overall improvements for game installs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lutris is a game manager and helpful game installer for Steam Deck and Desktop Linux that brings together your game library from Steam, Humble Bundle, GOG, EA, Emulators and more. The latest release has improvements across the whole app to make it smoother.</p>
<p>The v0.5.15 release is not all about big headline features, but improvement the way most things inside it work. For instance, having it download components it needs while the app is open instead of displaying a basic "updating runtime" box makes the app starting and initial experience feel a whole lot cleaner and nicer overall.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17098571651705326236gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17098571651705326236gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Here's all the main new stuff:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Download runtime components from the main window, the "updating runtime" dialog appearing before Lutris opens has been removed.</li>
<li>Add the ability to open a location in your file browser from file picker widgets.</li>
<li>Add the ability to select, remove, or stop multiple games in the Lutris window.</li>
<li>Redesigned 'Uninstall Game' dialog now completely removes games by default.</li>
<li>Show an animation when a game is launched.</li>
<li>Add the ability to disable Wine auto-updates at the expense of losing support.</li>
<li>Add playtime editing in the game preferences.</li>
<li>Move game files, runners to the trash instead of deleting them they are uninstalled.</li>
<li>Add "Updates" tab in Preferences control and check for updates and correct missing media in the 'Games' view.</li>
<li>Add "Storage" tab in Preferences to control game and installer cache location.</li>
<li>Expand "System" tab in Preferences with more system information but less brown.</li>
<li>Add "Run Task Manager" command for Wine games.</li>
<li>Add two new, smaller banner sizes for itch.io games.</li>
<li>Sync Steam playtimes with the Lutris library.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Bug and crash fixes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fix the export / import feature.</li>
<li>Fix some crashes happening when using Wayland and a high DPI gaming mouse.</li>
<li>Fix crash when opening the system preferences tab for a game.</li>
<li>Reduced the locales list to a predefined one (let us know if you need yours added).</li>
<li>Fix Lutris not expanding "~" in paths.</li>
<li>Ignore Wine virtual desktop setting when using Wine-GE/Proton to avoid crash.</li>
<li>Ignore MangoHUD setting when launching Steam to avoid crash.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<hr/>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: a quick bug-fix release was put up shortly after with <a href="https://github.com/lutris/lutris/releases/tag/v0.5.16" target="_blank">v0.5.16</a> having these changes:</p>

      <title>Noxious Weeds takes Vampire Survivors and adds in angry veggies</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love horde-slaying reverse bullet-hell survival games like Vampire Survivors? Noxious Weeds is another that's now available in Early Access and it comes with Native Linux support. <u>Note</u>: the developer sent a key to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4218320-GamingOnLinux/" target="_blank">GOL Steam Curator</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HRrKqeqImo0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fe090bba7cf070601d766a18757ddcd3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HRrKqeqImo0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Basically, this is VS with very angry plants as enemies along with a day and night cycle, and during the day you get to rescue cute little veggies to help out. Nice and inviting, colourful and has a sweet farming setting. That's about as good a description as I can offer. <span style="background-color:var(--article-main-background); color:var(--font-color); font-size:16px">Currently though, there's not really a huge amount different to VS and other survivor-like games. </span></p>
<p>It has the fun factor but is that enough when there's just <em>oh-so-many</em> similar games? Tough to answer fully. Right now, it feels like it needs more time in the oven to really add in more of a <em>unique</em> pull of which there <em>isn't</em> really enough of one.</p>
<p>During Early Access they said clearly they plan to add in more "Characters, Tools, Harvest items, and Game modes" — so hopefully they manage to add in a proper unique pull for it.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resist waves of enemies through nights and days.</li>
<li>20 minutes play sessions.</li>
<li>A variety of upgradeable Tools to wipe out the swarm once and for all. Your belt can carry a maximum of 6; your choices will change the outcome.</li>
<li>Rescue and team up with the cutest companions. Some will heal you, while others will fight at your side.</li>
<li>Collect the perfect crop combination to achieve game-breaking builds.</li>
<li>Accessibility. Tweak monsters' health, speed, and damage to better suit your play style.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can buy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2429310/Noxious_Weeds/" target="_blank">Noxious Weeds on Steam</a>. There's also a free <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2398640/Noxious_Weeds_Prologue/" target="_blank">Noxious Weeds: Prologue</a> to try.</p>

      <title>GodotOS is a fun showcase of Godot Engine with a fake operating system interface</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>No GodotOS is not another Linux distribution or desktop environment, it's an open source fake operating system interface made in Godot Engine, designed to push the limits of UI design in Godot. It's also just really cool.</p>
<p>From the project page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Welcome to GodotOS, an operating system interface created entirely in Godot! Browse folders, edit text files, view images, play games, and more in one cohesive polished interface that can even be used on the web!</p>
<p>GodotOS is more of a toy than a serious project. It's meant to push the limits on UI design in Godot while creating a desktop that is minimalist, distraction-free, and aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p>Aside from that, GodotOS is also meant to be a hub for small games and experiences that can easily be bundled in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21393223381705324068gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21393223381705324068gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>If you have a small game / experience you want to add into it, they're also accepting contributions. I love crazy experimental stuff like this, especially when it's open source (AGPL-3.0 license), because it allows people to learn from it and UI design is something that can be tricky to get right in any game engine — so perhaps game devs from all over might want to take a look at this.</p>
<p><em>I just thought it was really cool and thought you might think so too.</em></p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://popcar2.itch.io/godotos" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and find the source code on <a href="https://github.com/popcar2/GodotOS" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Heck, it is even has a trailer:</p>

      <title>Old World - Wonders &amp; Dynasties is a content-filled DLC out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Old World is easily one of the best 4X games to be released in recent years, that is still quite largely overlooked compared to others in the genre and it only keeps getting better. A big new content DLC Wonders &amp; Dynasties has just been released.</p>
<p>The Old World - Wonders &amp; Dynasties brings with it over 100 new dynasty-related events and 21 character traits to augment the 30 new dynasty leaders. Each leader comes with unique starting modifiers and is supported by a cast of 120 new historical characters that can be recruited during the course of a session. Overall it sounds like a pretty essential addition to an already fantastic game.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3QIGe_ia6H0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4c6650b1a323d8b6f3ff798cada225a9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3QIGe_ia6H0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A big patch was also released along with the DLC to include extra map randomisation options, UI and AI improvements, they added heir name selection popup on birth of an heir and a whole lot of bug fixes and other general game improvements to keep it running smoothly.</p>
<p>On Steam, Old World has a Very Positive user rating with Native Linux support and a Steam Deck Playable rating.</p>
<p>You can buy Old World and the DLC via:</p>

      <title>AYANEO Next Lite with a customized SteamOS-like HoloISO fully revealed</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AYANEO has now revealed the specifications and pricing for the Linux powered AYANEO Next Lite, which will be using the SteamOS-like HoloISO, although customized by AYANEO for the handheld.</p>
<p>Initially AYANEO announced it as using SteamOS, and later <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/ayaneo-next-lite-handheld-announced-with-steamos-linux/" target="_blank">clarified to GamingOnLinux</a> that it was actually HoloISO customized. I did ask <em>what</em> they've tweaked but they simply said "we've made some changes to adapt the NEXT LITE hardware and drivers, and I'm very sorry I can't tell you exactly at this time". So it's not a plain HoloISO install of course, they have done their own tweaks for their hardware.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Specifications:</p>
<ul>

      <title>Last Epoch to get &#39;Item Factions&#39;, a unique item trading system for the ARPG</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Last Epoch is closing in on a full release and it's going to be a big one for ARPG fans, especially if you weren't fussed by the latest Diablo. Now they've revealed what they call Item Factions, a unique system to allow item trading between players.</p>
<p>"Balancing a trade system is one of the most difficult challenges in a loot-based game, because it significantly impacts the item hunt for all players,” said Judd Cobler, Founder and CEO of Eleventh Hour Games, and game director on Last Epoch. “Players are often split over an economy that can add value to their items and builds, and the thrill of the hunt that leads to uncovering unique items. But with crucial feedback from our community, we’ve implemented a solution we believe satisfies both sides of the debate, and is a truly unique take on the action RPG trade debate."</p>
<p>The idea of Item Factions is to give players a <em>choice</em> in how they play, and it ties directly into the lore of Last Epoch too with a fair amount of depth to the feature. You get to pick between joining one of two:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Merchants Guild</strong> - grants the ability to trade items with other players through the Bazaar, and player-to-player.</li>
<li><strong>Circle of Fortune</strong> - grants boosts to items you find yourself through Prophecies, and passive bonuses.</li>
</ul>
<p>So you get the best of both worlds available to players. Seems you won't be permanently locked into your choice either, but staying in one to rank up has various benefits.</p>
<p>Have a look at their explainer video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SOo0Ule6dNY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8eee34dcd706ba4be50f6ae34a1c43b7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SOo0Ule6dNY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Full <a href="https://forum.lastepoch.com/t/trade-item-factions/61722" target="_blank">update on it here</a>.</p>
<p>Last Epoch leaves Early Access on February 21st, 2024. It has Native Linux support and is currently rated as Unsupported on Steam Deck, although it does work. Running it through Proton seems to be the best way to play though, as their Native Linux version has various graphical issues reported.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/899770/Last_Epoch/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>ELDEN RING gets patched to fix up anti-cheat on Steam Deck SteamOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While no doubt many of you are waiting on more news about the upcoming ELDEN RING expansion, this is not it. Instead, a small update has rolled out to improve ELDEN RING on Steam Deck with SteamOS.</p>
<p>The one liner in the update <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1245620/view/6002801934196500690" target="_blank">notes</a>: "Easy Anti-Cheat update to support the Steam OS update". They say version 1.10.1 is required now for any online play, so make sure you're up to date. They also confirmed they will "continue to provide improvement updates in the future so you can enjoy ELDEN RING more comfortably".</p>
<p>At least we know From Software continue to see the Steam Deck as an important platform. Not surprising though, they've <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/07/armored-core-vi-will-be-fully-supported-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">previously</a> mentioned how happy they were seeing ELDEN RING run on Steam Deck and made sure Armored Core 6 worked as well. </p>

      <title>Challenging platformer VVVVVV gets a big upgrade and now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>VVVVVV is an indie classic from Terry Cavanagh that just got a nice juicy upgrade with version 2.4 now officially released that brings with it a Steam Deck Verified status.</p>
<p>Not only is VVVVVV now Steam Deck Verified but the update includes translations into 21 languages, improved custom level support, lots of bug fixes, an upgrade to the SDL version used, it's swapped over from SDL_mixer to FAudio for audio, performance improvements as it's moved from being mostly CPU-based to being mostly GPU-based (via SDL's 'render' subsystem) and much <a href="https://vsix.dev/wiki/Version_2.4" target="_blank">much more</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5210128731704980410gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5210128731704980410gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>A lot of this is thanks to the source code release on <a href="https://github.com/TerryCavanagh/VVVVVV" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, although it's not open source, and instead uses a custom license but that hasn't stopped people contributing to improve it.</p>
<p>More about the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Help! Everyone has been teleported away randomly! As the heroic Captain Viridian, it's up to you to find your friends, bring them back to safety, and save the universe!</p>
<p>VVVVVV is a platform game all about exploring one simple mechanical idea - what if you reversed gravity instead of jumping?</p>
<p>The game is designed not to artificially gate your progress. In VVVVVV there are no locks, no power-ups, no switches, nothing to stop you progressing except the challenges themselves.</p>

      <title>Multiple shoot &#39;em ups from Taito like G-Darius HD got fixed up for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Taito and M2 have been bringing some updated shoot 'em up classics to Steam with lots of enhancements, and players seem to love them. Now titles like G-Darius HD should work great on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>In release order they are the Darius Cozmic Collection Arcade (2021), G-Darius HD (2022) and Ray’z Arcade Chronology (2023) and technically each one is actually a bundle of multiple games. So that's a whole lot of shoot 'em up action you can grab. The developers noted that some SteamOS updates caused problems, so they updated all of them to get them working smoothly again!</p>
<p>You can see the trailer for G-Darius HD below:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Darius is one of the pioneers of arcade side-scrolling shoot 'em up games, first released in 1986 in a custom, 3 screen cabinet featuring in-seat bass speakers to deliver the impact of the game direct to the player! The aquatically themed, giant robotic fish bosses and Zuntata-composed soundscapes captured the hearts and minds of arcade goes everywhere, and now Darius Cozmic Collection Arcade brings 4 of those titles (total 7 versions) from the Darius arcade series, each with added features, some exclusive to Steam!</p>

<p>Taito's Darius series began with the titular arcade game, Darius, in 1986 and comprises numerous side-scrolling shooting games released in arcades, many of which were later ported to game consoles.<br/>
G-Darius is the 4th arcade game in the Darius series of horizontally-scrolling shooting games, which sees the Silver Hawks battling against huge, space-faring warships who resemble various aquatic life-forms.<br/>
G-Darius HD features 5 versions of G-Darius: arcade-perfect ports of G-Darius and G-Darius Ver.2 and an HD version of each, along with the console port of G-Darius, coupled with an Steam-exclusive widescreen bonus mode!</p>

      <title>Team Fortress: Source 2 fan project gets a DMCA from Valve</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Team Fortress: Source 2 project is now officially dead in the water after getting hit with a DMCA from Valve, although the creators were already stopping development.</p>
<p>For a quick bit of context — Team Fortress: Source 2 was a complete remake being done in <a href="https://sbox.facepunch.com/about/" target="_blank">s&amp;box</a>, which is a game creation toolkit from Facepunch, it's supposed to be a next-generation Garry's Mod. While it may be based on Source 2, it's quite different, and naturally under a specific license for Facepunch to use. That doesn't mean anyone can just use Valve's game assets inside s&amp;box.</p>
<p>You can see the DMCA on <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2024/01/2024-01-10-valve.md" target="_blank">GitHub</a> which notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The original copyrighted work is Valve's game Team Fortress ("TF2") <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/" target="_blank">https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/</a>. The TF2 assets have been ported to Source 2 without permission and are being redistributed by Amper Software in a game mode for Facepunch's S@box. Facepunch has not licensed any Valve assets for S@box. The unauthorized porting and redistributing of Valve's assets without a license violates Valve's IP.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For some reason they kept calling it S@box, but it's s&amp;box. Quite a few thought it might be someone pretending to be working for Valve to be malicious, like apparently has happened with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/stalker-game-engine-openxray-gets-taken-down-on-github/" target="_blank">take-down of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game engine OpenXRay recently</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking on X (formerly Twitter), the Team Fortress: Source 2 <a href="https://twitter.com/TeamFortressS2/status/1745157814295617767" target="_blank">mentioned</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While we were discussing the project's future internally recently, we already came to the conclusion to stop the development of the project due to the current state of the code being unusable anymore with s&amp;box's recent major engine changes, and that we overall moved on from it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in a follow-up, mentioning this is basically the final nail in the coffin. So regardless, they were stopping anyway and it would be broken.</p>
<p>This has caused quite the commotion on social media, with many (even a few bigger industry names I've seen), calling out Valve about taking it down forcefully in such a way. Many arguing this is "not the Valve of old", and that Valve are "going after modders" and plenty more. But, there's a difference between modding an existing game, and remaking them entirely in a different game engine. I've said this before when it comes to Nintendo, Rockstar and *insert big name*, if you use someone else's IP, they will eventually come knocking and take it down. And in this case, it was a remake of a game that is still online and still technically (debatable I know) supported and making Valve money.</p>
<p>Even Garry Newman of Facepunch has now <a href="https://twitter.com/garrynewman/status/1745317860363108527" target="_blank">commented</a> on the situation to make it clear too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think while it's maybe out of character for Valve to take down fan projects like this, it's hardly surprising when you have their entire game uploaded. I somehow don't think the "old Valve" would have let anyone port Half-Life to another engine and host it all publicly either.</p>
<p>S&amp;box doesn't have a license to use Valve's content, only the engine. It's not a mod, it's not gmod. We didn't want to commit a chunk of profit so early in development when we don't even know what the final product will look like.</p>
<p>Amper did a really great job porting and making this all work. Sadly it was going to all be broken next week with the Scene System update, so at least this saves them the job of updating to be compatible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Additionally, Valve also asked the creator of a recent Portal Nintendo 64 port to take it down (not a DMCA), as it used proprietary Nintendo tech.</em> </p>

      <title>Toaplan Arcade Shoot &#39;Em Up Collection Vol. 3 announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Even more classics are getting a new life on PC with the Toaplan Arcade Shoot 'Em Up Collection Vol. 3 announced for release on February 1st along with Linux and Steam Deck support just like the previous collections.</p>
<p>Games included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tiger-Heli: This is where it all started. Tiger-Heli, Toaplan's pioneering bomb-based vertical shooter set the stage for an entire genre back in 1985!</li>
<li>Vimana: Uncover the magic of Indian mythology, unique power-ups, and an enchanting soundtrack in this electrifying space showdown!</li>
<li>FixEight: Toaplan's thrilling vertical run-and-gun game features eight peerless warriors with cutting-edge weapons!</li>
<li>Batsugun: The epic conclusion of Toaplan's legendary shooter series. Play the original or Batsugun Special. Choose your favorite character and spaceship in this thrilling sci-fi adventure!</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2828064891704972060gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2828064891704972060gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>As usual, the updated releases come with a whole bunch of improvements thanks to the emulation involved. Some of the enhancements are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimal Input Lag: Emulation, input processing, and rendering all complete on the same frame.</li>
<li>Quick Save using F1-F10, Reload with Shift+ F1-F10.</li>
<li>Online leaderboards for Single Credit, No Assist, and Assisted plays.</li>
<li>Instrument panels with extra gameplay information and artwork.</li>
<li>Rewind the game between 10-18 minutes, depending on the action.</li>
<li>Capture sharable replays to immortalize your interstellar victories (or funny moments).</li>
<li>Assist Features such as auto-fire at multiple rates.</li>
<li>Very Easy Mode: Lower the difficulty to breeze through the adventure.</li>
<li>Pixel perfect or full-screen scaling in windowed or full-screen mode.</li>
<li>Rotate the gameplay in 90-degree increments.</li>
<li>Steam Achievements.</li>
<li>Hone your skills in the ultra customizable practice mode!</li>
</ul>
<p>My testing of the previous two collections was great, as they really did work exceptionally well on both Steam Deck and my Linux gaming desktop - so I expect more of the same goodness from this latest collection since they're clearly using the same software base for them all. It's just good to see more classic games get modernised like this, enabling them to be played easily.</p>
<p>You'll be able to buy the games from <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/games?developers=bitwave-games-toaplan" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/franchise/toaplan/list/116815" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>AYANEO NEXT LITE handheld announced with SteamOS Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 11/01/24 10:18 AM UTC</strong> - AYANEO replied to my email to give a tiny bit more info on their Linux OS use:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The SteamOS pre-installed on NEXT LITE is adapted and optimized by AYANEO based on HoloISO. Users also can install Windows system by themselves after purchasing NEXT LITE, and download Windows driver from AYANEO official website.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>HoloISO is <em>not</em> actually SteamOS, but very close. So this is <em>not</em> in any way a partnership being done with Valve. HoloISO for those not aware can be found on <a href="https://github.com/HoloISO/holoiso" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and <em>anyone</em> can use it. I've asked if they can share what changes they've made.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Finally we're seeing another handheld vendor jump in with Linux. The AYANEO NEXT LITE was announced today and much like the Steam Deck, they plan to ship it with SteamOS! AYANEO are one of the top brands when it comes to PC handhelds, so it's really interesting to see them be one of the first to jump in like this. If Linux is a success for them, no doubt they will do more and other vendors will follow along.</p>
<p>Don't go expecting some next-gen power-house though, this is a "value-for-money option" but with various great sounding features like Hall Effect Joysticks, a 7-inch 800p display, a 47Wh battery, X-axis linear motors "and other features".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, this forward-looking flagship handheld, AYANEO NEXT, returns in full force with the rejuvenated AYANEO NEXT LITE. Building upon the foundation of top-tier flagship design and texture, AYANEO NEXT LITE comes pre-installed with the SteamOS gaming system for the first time. AYANEO NEXT LITE integrates outstanding cost-effectiveness, lowering the entry barrier while further popularizing numerous flagship features, offering an upgraded experience to more players, and allowing them to enjoy the endless fun and convenience of gaming handhelds.</p>
<cite>AYANEO</cite></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8524630221704904563gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8524630221704904563gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>AYANEO say "subscriptions" will open 9:30 PM EST on January 11th EST / 2:30 AM January 12th UTC. They haven't revealed specifications or the pricing yet, so we assume that will be revealed then. The announcement post also showed off two different colour variations with a white shell and orange shoulder buttons like above, plus a black shell with grey shoulder buttons.</p>
<p>Currently it's not clear how they're using SteamOS. As Valve have not announced any kind of partnership, and there's no official public SteamOS 3 release yet. We know Valve wanted to get SteamOS on other devices, and all those discussions would have of course been behind closed doors until an announcement. So maybe Valve will say something soon. I've reached out to both Valve and AYANEO for an answer anyway.</p>
<p>Interestingly, they were previously working on their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/ayaneo-confirm-their-linux-based-ayaneo-os-arrives-this-year/" target="_blank">Linux-based AYANEO OS</a> that was due in 2023, but perhaps that was shelved in favour of SteamOS directly to prevent fragmentation.</p>
<p>What do we think, AMD still like most others or Intel this time like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/msi-officially-announced-the-claw-a1m-handheld-with-intel/" target="_blank">the MSI Claw</a>?</p>

      <title>League of Legends likely unplayable on Linux / Steam Deck soon due to Vanguard anti-cheat</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A day we expected to come but now Riot Games have formally announced that their Vanguard kernel-level anti-cheat is coming to League of Legends, and so it will make it unplayable on Linux. This is the same tech they use in VALORANT, which is also unplayable on Linux due to it.</p>
<p>This news was confirmed in their recent developer video below at about 12:43, mentioning it will happen in either late February or early March:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="9U_jEzKf0_0?rel=0&amp;start=763"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6b41ba871fa4517d31a8352ef0d60374.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/9U_jEzKf0_0?rel=0&amp;start=763" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking on Reddit, one of their team <a href="https://sh.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/18za7o7/comment/kggm0yu/" target="_blank">mentioned</a> "We'll get some more info about Linux for you all soon, it's not something i know the answer to off the top of my head and I want to make sure I talk with the team and get you the right info.", and in a previous comment they <a href="https://sh.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/18za7o7/comment/kggda9u/" target="_blank">mentioned</a> Vanguard won't be used in the macOS version.</p>
<p>However, a different Riot staff member seemed to make it clear Linux support won't be happening in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/18za7o7/comment/kgh17uo/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank">reply</a> to a user asking about playing it in Wine: "No unfortunately not. From a security point of view supporting WINE would be like having a bank vault at the top of Nakatomi Tower then installing a doggy door in it.".</p>
<p>Considering that to play it on Linux you need to run the Windows version through Wine, there's no way they're going to roll out Vanguard into the Windows client and just let Linux get off without it. So I fully expect it to become unplayable in the next couple of months.</p>
<p>Seems like it's time for League of Legends players on Linux to finally swap over to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/570/Dota_2/" target="_blank">Valve's Dota 2</a>, which has full Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Usurper turns Chess into a deck-building roguelike</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you love strategy games, board games, deck-builders and roguelikes you may want to keep a little eye on Usurper, an upcoming game from Rogue Brain Studios that releases later this year. Currently aiming for a "Q2" release.</p>
<p>Offering the classic with a modern twist you start off with only a King, and then work your way up to a full army by purchasing pieces from your deck. Sounds like an interesting spin! The developer mentions it will have a full single-player mode against the AI, along with local and online multiplayer.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="doh3p7Zrnbg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/341e76f7c87741e8cd152f9d9fe148df.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/doh3p7Zrnbg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>At release it will have Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Go <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2347280/Usurper/" target="_blank">check it out on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Palworld is Pokémon with guns, farming, survival and building - I&#39;m quite excited</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After growing up playing Pokémon, I will jump at the chance to try pretty much anything that involves some form of monster collection. It's just my jam and Palworld looks and sounds kind of hilarious that I need to play it. </p>
<p>It's basically taking the initial idea of Pokémon and expanding it with guns, farming, survival, building and apparently quite a lot more. It's actually sprinkling in game mechanics from all sorts of popular games. Even if a bit janky, which I expect since it will be in Early Access on January 19th, it's quite likely to be the <em>next big thing</em>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="tOatviGVCTs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/48b0c8f8d85e7f228b22ede407d07163.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/tOatviGVCTs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Survival</u></strong></li>
<li>In a harsh environment where food is scarce and vicious poachers roam, danger waits around every corner. To survive, you must tread carefully and make difficult choices...even if that means eating your own Pals when the time comes.</li>
<li><strong><u>Mounts &amp; Exploration</u></strong></li>
<li>Pals can be mounted to traverse the land, sea and sky—allowing you to traverse all kinds of environment as you explore the world.</li>
<li><strong><u>Building Structures</u></strong></li>
<li>Want to build a pyramid? Put an army of Pals on the job. Don't worry; there are no labor laws for Pals.</li>
<li><strong><u>Production</u></strong></li>
<li>Make use of Pals and their skills to make fire, generate electricity, or mine ore so that you can live a life of comfort.</li>
<li><strong><u>Farming</u></strong></li>
<li>Some Pals are good at planting seeds, while others are skilled at watering or harvesting crops. Work together with your Pals to create an idyllic farmstead.</li>
<li><strong><u>Factories &amp; Automation</u></strong></li>
<li>Letting Pals do the work is the key to automation. Build a factory, place a Pal in it, and they'll keep working as long as they're fed—until they're dead, that is.</li>
<li><strong><u>Dungeon Exploration</u></strong></li>
<li>With Pals on your side you can tackle even the most dangerous areas. When the time comes, you might have to sacrifice one to save your skin. They'll protect your life—even if it costs their own.</li>
<li><strong><u>Breeding &amp; Genetics</u></strong></li>
<li>Breed a Pal and it will inherit the characteristics of its parents. Combine rare pals to create the strongest Pal of them all!</li>
<li><strong><u>Poaching &amp; Crime</u></strong></li>
<li>Endangered Pals live in wildlife sanctuaries. Sneak in and capture rare Pals to get rich quick! It's not a crime if you don't get caught, after all.</li>
<li><strong><u>Multiplayer</u></strong></li>
<li>Multiplayer is supported, so invite a friend and go on an adventure together! And of course you can battle your friends and trade Pals, too.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll be testing this one out on Steam Deck and my Kubuntu Linux desktop with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a> for sure, so expect a report on how it runs some time shortly after release. The game is made with Unreal Engine 5, so it will be real interesting to see how the Steam Deck handles it, although graphically it doesn't look too demanding but graphics and style are of course only one part of the performance puzzle. Stay tuned.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/" target="_blank">find it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Valve announces new rules for games with AI Content on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have now confirmed their rules for game developers using AI generated content on Steam, and while they're not banning AI they are going to ensure it's clearly stated for players. Like it or not, "AI" use is only going to increase in the games industry and so Valve had to do something and what they've announced sounds reasonable enough.</p>
<p>When developers fill out a survey for Valve to get their game on Steam, it now includes AI disclosures developers have to fill out and they separate it into two categories:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Pre-Generated: Any kind of content (art/code/sound/etc) created with the help of AI tools during development. Under the Steam Distribution Agreement, you promise Valve that your game will not include illegal or infringing content, and that your game will be consistent with your marketing materials. In our pre-release review, we will evaluate the output of AI generated content in your game the same way we evaluate all non-AI content - including a check that your game meets those promises.</li>
<li>Live-Generated: Any kind of content created with the help of AI tools while the game is running. In addition to following the same rules as Pre-Generated AI content, this comes with an additional requirement: in the Content Survey, you'll need to tell us what kind of guardrails you're putting on your AI to ensure it's not generating illegal content.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Valve said they will also "include much of your disclosure on the Steam store page for your game, so customers can also understand how the game uses AI". So with that, if you plan to avoid AI games, at least Valve will give you a clear way to spot them.</p>
<p>On top of that Valve said they're implementing a new system to allow players to "report illegal content inside games that contain Live-Generated AI content", which you'll do via the Steam Overlay.</p>
<p>Together these rules and features allow Valve to be "much more open to releasing games using AI technology on Steam" but Valve said clearly that Adult Only Sexual Content created with Live-Generated AI is not currently allowed on Steam. That one feels like an obvious one to not allow, for reasons I'm sure I don't need to go into.</p>

      <title>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game engine OpenXRay gets taken down on GitHub</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update - 11/01/2024, 11:55 AM UTC</strong>: The GitHub repository has been restored now. Hopefully this won't happen in future, considering as noted below, GSC Game World actually gave it their blessing to be used. And thanks to the take-down, <em>even mor</em>e people now know about it. From the reversal <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2024/01/2024-01-10-xray-16-reversal.md" target="_blank">notice</a>, GitHub stated clearly after a review it was a fraudulent take-down.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>OpenXRay is an improved cross-platform version of the X-Ray Engine, which is the original game engine used in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game series by GSC Game World. However, it seems a bad actor got it taken down from GitHub.</p>
<p>Currently the <a href="https://github.com/OpenXRay/xray-16" target="_blank">GitHub page</a> notes "Repository unavailable due to DMCA takedown" and the DMCA can be <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2024/01/2024-01-08-xray-16.md" target="_blank">read here</a>, which is claimed to be from "Anti-Piracy Protection" on behalf of GSC Game World. </p>
<p>However, on X (formerly Twitter), the official GSC Game World <a href="https://twitter.com/GSC_GW/status/1744528469013237813" target="_blank">account noted</a> it wasn't their doing, and that "Open X-Ray is totally allowed to be used as a modbase" and that they're dealing with "a wave of false claims caused by our position recently":</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15061962711704823083gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15061962711704823083gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>So with that in mind, hopefully GitHub will reinstate it and prevent this from happening again from the same people trying to cause issues for them. It's also nice to see, at least according to who is posting on their social account, that they have no problems with people using OpenXRay considering it's based on leaked code.</p>
<p>The code has been out so long now, and used by so many for such old games, it would have been pretty strange to only now go after it. Especially since it requires data files from the original games to run, so people still need to buy the games to use OpenXRay.</p>

      <title>MSI officially announced the Claw A1M handheld with Intel</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well there it is! MSI Claw A1M is the official name of the next big vendor to jump into the handheld gaming space to take on the likes of the Steam Deck, ROG Ally and the Lenovo Legion Go. Unlike the Steam Deck which runs SteamOS Linux, once again we have a vendor going with Windows 11.</p>
<p>From the press release: "In our commitment to enhancing the gaming experience for our users, we aim to address market pain points and dedicate efforts to the handheld space,” said Eric Kuo, the Executive Vice President&amp; NB BU GM of MSI. “We have fine-tuned specific designs tailored exclusively for gamers, debuting our very first handheld, Claw, which redefines the standards in the handheld market."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8964253901704808019gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8964253901704808019gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p></p>
<p>MSI say it offers MSI Cooler Boost Hyperflow technology, featuring dual fans and heat pipes that efficiently dissipate heat, and that the intraflow thermal design optimizes airflow to cool internal components "ensuring top gaming performance". They're also bringing their "MSI Center M UI" to it giving quick-access to various features and settings like a game launcher. So once again, it's another UI being slapped on top of Windows.</p>
<p>The official specs sheet is below:</p>

<p>I'm always happy to see more competition for the Steam Deck, but it remains to be seen just how it will perform. And it will come in multiple different configurations with different storage. In terms of performance, from what I've seen from YouTube videos like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxoxXbc0Ros" target="_blank">Dave2D</a> it's quite limited as they weren't allowed to do much yet on benchmarking but it's somewhat comparable to the ROG Ally. Again though, it seems another case of it needing to draw more power for better performance.</p>
<p>The MSI Claw releases sometime in the first half of 2024.</p>

      <title>Cross-distribution support improvements coming for Canonical&#39;s Snap packages</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, 2024 should be interesting for Linux packaging! While many distributions use different packaging formats like deb, rpm and others there's also Flatpak for cross-distro support. But we also have Canonical's Snap - which is going to get <em>improved</em> cross-distro support.</p>
<p>Writing on Mastodon, developer Zygmunt Krynicki <a href="https://mastodon.social/@zygoon@fosstodon.org/111703074889722934" target="_blank">mentioned</a> "I will be returning as a snap developer later this month. My main focus will be cross-distribution support. Unlike in the past this will be my full time job. I'm very excited for what is ahead for snaps.". It's interesting to see Canonical paying developers to work on this (and it's a good thing too)!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2274750401704805502gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2274750401704805502gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - <a href="https://snapcraft.io/store" target="_blank">The Snap Store</a></em></p>
<p>Packaging is always a real sore spot for Linux, and it leads to a fair amount of confusion. Just like with how many Linux distributions there are there's upsides and downsides to it though of course. You don't get innovation and improvements by always sticking to one single thing, and the power of open source is people can often just work on whatever they want.</p>
<p>Still, it would be nice no matter what distribution of Linux you pick, if we can just tell people to "go here" to get whatever app it is they're after rather than having to do a support-dance to find out their specific distribution and version to see what's available to find out how they can grab something.</p>

      <title>OpenAI say it would be &#39;impossible&#39; to train AI without pinching copyrighted works</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I really fear for the internet and what it will become in even just another year, with the rise of AI writing and AI art being used in place of real people. And now OpenAI openly state they need to use copyrighted works for training material.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/08/ai-tools-chatgpt-copyrighted-material-openai" target="_blank">The Guardian</a>, the New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft over copyright infringement and just recently OpenAI sent a <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/126981/pdf/" target="_blank">submission</a> to the UK House of Lords Communications and Digital Select Committee where OpenAI said pretty clearly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because copyright today covers virtually every sort of human expression– including blog posts, photographs, forum posts, scraps of software code, and government documents–it would be impossible to train today’s leading AI models without using copyrighted materials. Limiting training data to public domain books and drawings created more than a century ago might yield an interesting experiment, but would not provide AI systems that meet the needs of today’s citizens.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Worth noting OpenAI put up their own news post "<a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-and-journalism" target="_blank">OpenAI and journalism</a>" on January 8th.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Why am I writing about this here? Well, the reasoning is pretty simple. AI writing is (on top of other things) increasing the race to the bottom of content for clicks. Search engines have quickly become a mess to find what you actually want, and it's only going to continue getting <em>far worse</em> thanks to all these SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) bait content farms, with more popping up all the time, and we've already seen some bigger websites trial AI writing. The internet is a <em>mess</em>.</p>
<p>As time goes on, and as more people use AI to pinch content and write entire articles, we're going to hand off profitable writing to a select few big names only who can weather the storm and handle it. A lot of smaller scale websites are just going to die off. Any time you search for something, it will be those big names sprinkled in between the vast AI website farms all with very similar robotic plain writing styles.</p>
<p>Many (most?) websites make content for search engines, <em>not</em> for people. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/23998379/google-search-seo-algorithm-webpage-optimization" target="_blank">The Verge</a> recently did a rather fascinating piece on this showing how websites are designed around Google, and it really is something worth scrolling through and reading.</p>
<p>One thing you can count on: my perfectly <em>imperfect</em> writing full of <em>terrible</em> grammar continuing without the use of AI. At least it's <em>natural</em> right? I write as I speak, for better or worse. By humans, for humans — a tagline I plan to stick with until AI truly takes over and I have to go find a job flipping burgers or something. But then again, there will be robots for that too. <em>I think I need to learn how to fish…</em></p>

      <title>Unity cutting 25% of staff (about 1,800 people) as part of restructuring</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ouch. We're only just into week 2 of 2024 and Unity Software are cutting away a huge amount of their staff, as things aren't looking great for the Unity game engine.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/unity-software-cutting-25-staff-company-reset-continuation-2024-01-08/" target="_blank">Reuters</a> who picked up the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1810806/000181080624000006/unity-20240108.htm" target="_blank">filing</a>, Unity announced "it plans to reduce approximately 1,800 employee roles, or approximately 25% of its current workforce, as it restructures and refocuses on its core business, and to position itself for long-term and profitable growth".</p>
<p>According to the interim CEO Jim Whitehurst: "We are reducing the number of things we are doing in order to focus on our core business and drive our long-term success and profitability".</p>
<p>Plenty of this is still from the ongoing fallout of the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-attempt-to-clarify-new-install-fees-as-developers-revolt/" target="_blank">absolute mess</a> that was runtime fee, that caused <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/unity-ceo-john-riccitiello-is-leaving-effective-immediately/" target="_blank">John Riccitiello to leave as CEO</a>. </p>
<hr/>
<p>Unity is used by some of the most popular games around and according to SteamDB over 40,000 games on Steam use Unity. This includes hits like Vampire Survivors, Lethal Company, Hollow Knight, Valheim, Rust, Cities: Skylines, RimWorld and the list just goes on and on to name only a semi-recent popular few that you likely know of.</p>
<p>Hopefully Unity will stabilise soon, because I can't imagine what the atmosphere is like to work there right now, imagine having all this like a black cloud over your head? With a probability of more to come as the restructuring continues. Game developers need things to calm down too, since many thousands rely on it for upcoming and existing games still being supported.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 8-26 and 8-27 released with various game fixes for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GE-Proton has received two new versions with GE-Proton 8-26 and GE-Proton 8-27 shortly after, mostly focusing on fixing up issues in some games and pulling in new versions of various parts of Proton like Wine and DXVK.</p>
<p>This is the community-made compatibility layer, so it's not supported by Valve, and should be used only really when you need it for specific games.</p>
<p>The changes for GE-Proton 8-26 are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>updated wine to bleeding edge</li>
<li>updated dxvk to git</li>
<li>updated vkd3d-proton to git</li>
<li>updated dxvk-nvapi to latest upstream proton</li>
<li>pulled in latest upstream proton bleeding edge changes</li>
<li>added farlight 84 patch update</li>
<li>VR fix for Beam.NG.Drive added (<a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/pull/106" target="_blank">#106</a> thanks gamingdoom)</li>
<li>NVIDIA Reflex implemented (<a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/pull/104" target="_blank">#104</a> thanks loathingKernel)</li>
</ul>
<p>protonfixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>unified fix for cpu topology workaround (<a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/protonfixes/pull/167" target="_blank">GloriousEggroll/protonfixes#167</a> thanks Root-Core)</li>
<li>unified fix for protonaudioconv workaround (<a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/protonfixes/pull/168" target="_blank">GloriousEggroll/protonfixes#168</a> thanks R1kaB3rN)</li>
<li>unified fix for xliveless xlive workaround added (<a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/protonfixes/pull/170" target="_blank">GloriousEggroll/protonfixes#170</a> thanks Root-Core)</li>
<li>unified fix for esync/fsync enable/disable added (<a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/protonfixes/pull/169" target="_blank">GloriousEggroll/protonfixes#169</a> thanks R1kaB3rN)</li>
<li>cutscene audio in BlazBlue Centralfiction workaround added (thanks spifferoo)</li>
<li>game fix added for Renegade Ops (thanks Root-Core)</li>
<li>cleanup of deprecated LAA, dxvk-async, and win32 helper functions (thanks R1kaB3rN)</li>
<li>cutscene audio fix for The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles workaround added (thanks eagleflo)</li>
<li>game fix added for The Forest (thanks Root-Core)</li>
<li>updated fix for Super Naughty Maid 2 (thanks R1kaB3rN)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And then for GE-Proton 8-27:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Disabled Nvidia Latency Reflex patches. After discussion with dxvk devs they are currently deemed problematic and need more work, and are known to currently cause stutters in games even when the feature is disabled. We will re-enable the patches when they are ready.</li>
<li>Fixed Farlight 84 patch that was missing a lock causing problems in SDL games</li>
<li>Backported a fix for HID devices with more than 8 axis <a href="https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=55660" target="_blank">https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=55660</a></li>

      <title>Celebrate Economic Strategy with the Steam Capitalism and Economy Fest</title>
      <author>Smellbringer</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Economy simulation and city management may not be the first thing most people think of when they think about video games. But it is one of the most longstanding genres in gaming, going all the way back to the 1980's. And if you've been looking to get into the genre or just check something new out, now's a great time with an entire sale highlighting some of the most noteworthy modern simulation games.</p>
<p>From the beloved Cities: Skylines to obscure stuff like Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale, there's a little something for everyone in this sale. As my expertise in game genres is more blowing stuff up than planning economies; I'll instead be going through a sampler platter and determining the best games in the sale based on reviews, how interesting it looks to me, and how good a deal it is.</p>
<p>It should be noted these aren't games that optimally fit into the Steam Deck's normal control format, but we'll list Deck support anyway.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/255710/Cities_Skylines/" target="_blank">Cities Skylines</a> ($<s>29.99</s> $8.99) <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Steam Deck Playable / Native Linux Support</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/285310/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_Deluxe/" target="_blank">RollerCoaster Tycoon: Deluxe</a> ($<s>5.99</s> $2.99) <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Steam Deck Playable / ProtonDB Gold</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1139980/Travellers_Rest/" target="_blank">Travellers Rest - EARLY ACCESS</a> ($<s>14.99</s> $11.24) <img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Steam Deck Verified / ProtonDB Platinum</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/70400/Recettear_An_Item_Shops_Tale/" target="_blank">Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale</a> ($<s>19.99</s> $3.99)  <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Steam Deck Unsupported/ ProtonDB Gold</p>

<p>Like I've said, my economy simulator knowledge isn't great. So I welcome any additional game suggestions in the comments I might have missed that you love. You can check out the sale <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/capitalism_economy" target="_blank">here </a>and keep in mind that it runs until January 15 at 10 AM PST / 6PM UTC.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA reveal Half-Life 2 RTX, plus GeForce RTX 40 SUPER Series GPUs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Much like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/amd-announces-radeon-rx-7600-xt-ryzen-8000g-series-and-new-ryzen-5000-series-cpus/" target="_blank">AMD did today for CES 2024</a>, much of NVIDIA's event was also all about AI but there's a few bits in there for normal consumers like the announcement of Half-Life 2 RTX, plus GeForce RTX 40 SUPER Series GPUs.</p>
<p>Half-Life 2 RTX is using RTX Remix, just like Portal with RTX and Portal: Prelude RTX, and it's community-made by "four of Half-Life 2’s top mod teams, now working together under the banner of Orbifold Studios" who are "rebuilding materials with Physically Based Rendering (PBR) properties, adding extra geometric detail via Valve’s Hammer editor, and leveraging NVIDIA technologies including full ray tracing, DLSS 3, Reflex, and RTX IO to deliver a fantastic experience for GeForce RTX gamers".</p>
<p>First look video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aM_gzfAMdNs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1e56751632013bf42dd4b7a5800a3a35.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aM_gzfAMdNs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>NVIDIA have announced that RTX Remix will hit Open Beta on January 22nd.</p>
<p>As for the new GPUs coming they are they GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER, GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER and GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER which NVIDIA say "supercharge the latest games and form the core of AI-powered PCs":</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A 4K Monster: The GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER</strong><br/>
The GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER powers fully ray-traced games in 4K resolution. At 1.4x faster than the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti without DLSS Frame Generation, the RTX 4080 SUPER delivers blistering performance with traditional rasterization. With 836 AI TOPS, DLSS Frame Generation delivers an extra performance boost, making the RTX 4080 SUPER twice as fast as the RTX 3080 Ti. The RTX 4080 SUPER features more cores and faster memory for a performance edge. It will be available starting Jan. 31 from $999.</p>
<p><strong>Precision Gaming: The GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER</strong><br/>
The RTX 4070 Ti SUPER is the ideal GPU for maxing out games at super-high frame rates at 1440p, and up to 4K. Compared to the RTX 4070 Ti, it has more cores, an increased frame buffer to 16GB, and a 256-bit memory bus, providing a significant memory bandwidth increase to 672 GB/sec. It is 1.6x faster than a RTX 3070 Ti and 2.5x with DLSS 3. The GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER will be available starting Jan. 24 at $799.</p>
<p><strong>Perfectly Balanced: The GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER</strong><br/>
The RTX 4070 SUPER arrives with 20% more cores than the RTX 4070, making it faster than an RTX 3090 at a fraction of the power. With DLSS 3, its lead stretches to 1.5x faster. It will be available starting Jan. 17 at $599.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Something else they did a demo of during the event was NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine (<a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/ace" target="_blank">ACE</a>), a "suite of technologies that help developers bring digital avatars to life with generative AI", and showed off a scene of two characters giving entirely dynamic chat (although pretty robotic sounding). No doubt over the next few years we're going to see a lot more AI like this implemented into games to have randomly generated conversations with voice over and lip syncing all together.</p>
<p>See all on <a href="https://www.nvidia.com" target="_blank">NVIDIA.com</a>. </p>

      <title>AMD announces Radeon RX 7600 XT, Ryzen 8000G series and new Ryzen 5000 series CPUs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Amongst a whole lot of technobabble about AI AI and more AI, AMD today announced the Radeon RX 7600 XT, Ryzen 8000G series and new Ryzen 5000 series CPUs. For any normal consumer, their event was a hard boring watch with business people patting each-other on the back about AI advancements but here's the gist of what was actually revealed today.</p>
<p>Firstly of all they announced the Radeon RX 7600 XT GPU with 16GB GDDR6 for 1080p gaming, starting at $329 releasing January 24th. Nothing really special here, it's a slight bump over the RX 7600 with more RAM, slightly boosted clock speeds and a higher typical board power at 190 W.</p>
<p>Now onto the processors, starting with the new AMD Ryzen 8000G Series desktop processors for the AM5 platform, which bring forth AMD's new dedicated AI neural processing unit (NPU) to desktop PC processors, built on top of Zen 4. All of the 8000G Series processors include a Radeon 700M series graphics too.</p>
<p>Here's the models available starting January 31st for SI partners and for OEMs in "Q2 2024":</p>
