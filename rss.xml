      <title>Discord Overlay for Linux v0.7.0 should improve idling and on battery power </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Discover, not to be confused with the KDE Discover software store, is a Discord overlay for Linux and the first update in a while is out now with version 0.7.0.</p>
<p>What does it actually do? It allows you to easily have a configurable on-screen Discord overlay to show who is currently talking, or to display text and images from selected channels.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://github.com/trigg/Discover/releases/tag/v0.7.0" target="_blank">release notes</a> for 0.7.0 the developers mentioned: "This update brings in a bunch of changes which remove our previous reliance on timeouts. For most users this will seem to do absolutely nothing, but for users where this program is idling and on battery power it will allow the OS to scale down battery usage much further than previously able."</p>
<p>Here's all the changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fix rendering title with incorrect font.</li>
<li>Fix accidentally using None in dud voice data.</li>
<li>Included a lot of RPC documentation to README.</li>
<li>Differentiate Text &amp; Notification window titles for better catching by window managers.</li>
<li>Catch monitors layout change and monitor resolution change and re-render overlays.</li>
<li>Reduce reconnect rate when local discord goes away.</li>
<li>Cache user access token and attempt to reconnect quicker using it.</li>
<li>Changed connection origin to localhost.</li>
<li>Rewrote entire connection handler core to remove timeouts that never stopped.
<ul>
<li>Removed 60hz tick for reading local connection to discord.</li>
<li>Removed 1hz tick for re-rendering voice overlay even if data remained the same.</li>
<li>Removed 1hz tick for re-rendering notification overlay even if data remained the same.</li>
<li>Add a one-off timeout after render where data is expected to auto-hide itself.</li>
<li>Implemented socket read and reconnect login in GLib main loop.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a community made project, not affiliated with Discord, made due to "the shortcomings in support on Linux by the official discord client".</p>

      <title>Palworld has now sold over 15 million copies on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Palworld continues to be an insane success, as Pocketpair just <a href="https://twitter.com/Palworld_EN/status/1760682105171062876" target="_blank">revealed</a> it has now seen over 25 million players for their Early Access game. 15 million of those copies were on Steam, with another 10 million on Xbox.</p>
<p>As we saw from the recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/steam-users-redeemed-over-80-million-in-physical-wallet-cards-in-december-2023/" target="_blank">Steam 2023 Overview</a>, a lot of games are managing to find success. It has slipped down the Steam charts a bit now though thanks to the recent releases of Helldivers 2, Last Epoch, Pacific Drive and others. And it was only natural it would calm down after the initial rush and hype period but no doubt it will rank back up again on the first major content update.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10584836511708711592gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10584836511708711592gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's funny really when you see Ubisoft makes <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-ceo-defends-skull-and-bones-70-price-despite-its-live-service-leanings-calls-it-quadruple-a/" target="_blank">claims</a> about their Skull and Bones being a "quadruple-A game", when for the price of that one game you could almost afford <em>both</em> Palworld and Helldivers 2, which have seen glowing reviews and huge player numbers.</p>
<p>Have you been playing Palworld? What are your thoughts on it now after many hours?</p>
<p>Also, in case you missed it, some <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/palworld-is-getting-external-anti-cheat-but-it-will-be-mostly-optional/" target="_blank">anti-cheat for Palworld is on the way</a>.</p>
<p>Palworld is currently rated Steam Deck Playable and works great on Desktop Linux thanks to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a>.

      <title>NVIDIA 550.54.14 driver released as stable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA today launched the 550.54.14 Linux driver as stable coming with a whole bunch of fixes and improvements, so here's all that's changed.</p>
<p>Seems NVIDIA took on what I said to them about their recent changelogs being confusing for end-users (noted in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/nvidia-550-40-07-beta-driver-released-with-fixes-for-vrr-and-wayland/" target="_blank">the previous NVIDIA Beta article</a>), so now they're including a note on changes between this version and the last in the same series. </p>
<p>So the changes from the previous 550.40.07 Beta to this stable version are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused HDMI FRL displays to flicker or blank when enabling VRR with 8 bits per color channel.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression introduced with the 550.40.07 beta driver which caused corrupted window decorations in some applications when running on GNOME.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where vkAcquireNextImageKHR() was not returning VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR when it should with WSI X11 swapchains.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where fences passed to VkSwapchainPresentFenceInfoEXT could signal earlier than expected when a WSI X11 swap chain becomes out of date.</li>
<li>Fixed Xid errors on Hogwarts Legacy and Forza Horizon 4.</li>
<li>Added support for the VK_KHR_video_encode_queue, VK_KHR_video_encode_h264, VK_KHR_video_encode_h265 and VK_KHR_video_maintenance1 extensions.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression which prevented some Vulkan applications from receiving VK_DEVICE_LOST upon a VT switch, which could lead to the application hanging or behaving incorrectly.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented nvidia-installer from honoring the --gbm-backend-dir command line option.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile the changes on top of that when going from the 545.29.06 driver to this version are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that sometimes caused Wayland applications to run at less than one frame per second on Maxwell, Volta, and Pascal series GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused an intermittent drop in desktop framerate.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused “Flip event timeout” messages to be printed to the system log when displays are hotplugged when nvidia-drm is loaded with the <code class="inline-code">fbdev=1</code> kernel module parameter.</li>
<li>Fixed intermittent Xid errors on Horizon Zero Dawn, Metro Exodus, Forza Horizon 5, and Halo Infinite.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which prevented the “NoMaxPClkCheck” mode validation token from working on single-link TMDS (e.g. DVI, HDMI) outputs.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that allowed VRR displays to be driven below their minimum refresh rate, resulting in a blank or flickering image.</li>
<li>Added an application profile to improve Kwin performance on hybrid GPU systems by setting <code class="inline-code">OGL_DEDICATED_HW_STATE_PER_CONTEXT=ENABLE_ROBUST</code>.</li>
<li>Updated the build process for NVIDIA kernel modules to honor the <code class="inline-code">INSTALL_MOD_DIR</code> Kbuild environment variable.</li>
<li>Added support for R8, GR88 and YCbCr GBM formats.</li>
<li>Optimized the X driver headless framerate limiter to more closely mimic upstream behavior and prevent it from activating in inconvenient situations. Added a new X config option <code class="inline-code">LimitFrameRateWhenHeadless</code> to disable the headless framerate limiter.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented Gamescope from running when using the NVIDIA Open GPU Kernel modules.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented the installer package from being unpacked on systems where zstd is not installed, when /tmp is mounted noexec.</li>
<li>Use transparent huge pages when available for the .text section. This is done through <code class="inline-code">madvise()</code> calls, and requires <code class="inline-code">CONFIG_READ_ONLY_THP_FOR_FS</code>.</li>
<li>Changed the name visible in /proc/devices of NVIDIA devices and the NVIDIA control device from “nvidia-frontend” to “nvidia” and “nvidiactl”. Scripts which parse /proc/devices (such as udev rules) may need to be updated. Note that the conventional /dev device paths like /dev/nvidia0 and /dev/nvidiactl remain unchanged.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause some multi-GPU systems to crash on suspend.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause the system to crash when an application is run with <code class="inline-code">__NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1</code>.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which prevented application profiles from getting applied to PRIME Render Offloaded applications running via Wine.</li>
<li>Disabled PRIME Display Offload Sink support for virtual displays on datacenter GPUs. This prevents unusable desktop layouts from getting automatically configured on systems with a mix of physical and virtual displays.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused high CPU usage during system suspend, which could lead to the system not entering s2idle in some cases.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused the nvidia-settings control panel to crash when running on Wayland with newer versions of libwayland-client.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's <em>more</em> listed on the official changelog, but a bunch of those were available in older NVIDIA driver releases, as NVIDIA list all changes since the previous Production release.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA open source driver to use NVK + Zink for OpenGL on newer GPUs</title>
      <author>nwildner</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/27628" target="_blank">recent merge</a> request on the Mesa Git repository added the initial support for allowing drivers to chose Zink as the translation layer for handling OpenGL. This basically does an OpenGL-on-Vulkan implementation making it easier for newer cards to support OpenGL through a generic implementation, reducing duplicate code and making it easier to keep OpenGL around since while not yet deprecated it is being less used on modern games.</p>
<p>The merge allows owners of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 20xx series GPUs and newer to opt to use Zink instead of relying on the default NVC0 Gallium3D implementation to handle OpenGL requests. Those who want to give it a try, it should be as simple as setting the <code class="inline-code">NOUVEAU_USE_ZINK=1</code> environment variable after updating Mesa 24.1 when your distribution receives the update that is currently only on the main branch of Mesa repository.</p>
<p>Since the merge from branch <code class="inline-code">airlied/zink-driver-choice</code> to <code class="inline-code">main</code> was merged <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/27628#note_null" target="_blank">2 days ago</a>, most distros might not be distributing those patches yet. For those who use source-based distros or any source-base package building system like AUR, the package <code class="inline-code">mesa-git</code> is <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mesa-git" target="_blank">available</a> as a means of tracking the main branch and testing these bleeding-edge features.</p>
<p>While NVK as a technology is still in-development with plenty left to do, there has been lots of improvements being implemented on the last year. Related articles:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/mesa-240-out-now-with-amd-radv-ray-tracing-improvements-more-nvidia-nvk-improvements/" target="_blank">Mesa 24.0 out now with AMD RADV ray-tracing improvements, more NVIDIA NVK improvements</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Additionally, developer Mike Blumenkrantz recently put up another <a href="https://www.supergoodcode.com/woof/" target="_blank">blog post</a> about NVK work and thanks to some recent changes mentioned that "As a result, all GL games now work on NVK. No hyperbole. They just work".</p>

      <title>Snap store from Canonical (Ubuntu) hit with another crypto scam app</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/snap-store-from-canonical-hit-with-malicious-apps/" target="_blank">Not the first time</a> this has happened, but recently the Snap store from Canonical hosted a scam bitcoin app that claimed to be "Exodus wallet" that caused a user to lose money.</p>
<p>Posting on the Snapcraft <a href="https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/exodus-movement-exod/38904" target="_blank">forum</a> an unfortunate user noted their wallet has been emptied after using it, and a day later a Canonical staffer <a href="https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/exodus-movement-exod/38904/5" target="_blank">mentioned</a> it had now been removed and they were investigating the incident.</p>
<p>Mark Shuttleworth, CEO of Canonical, has now jumped into the discussion in another <a href="https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/should-unverified-cryptocurrency-apps-be-banned/38919/4" target="_blank">forum post</a> to note that while "cryptocurrency is largely a cesspit of ignoble intentions even if the mathematics are interesting", Shuttleworth doesn't think that "banning cryptocurrency apps helps" as "If anything, it would make using Linux much worse.".</p>
<p>Additionally, Shuttleworth also opened an additional <a href="https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/stronger-identity-verification-for-all-publishers/39061" target="_blank">forum post</a> to discuss requiring "more comprehensive proof of publisher identity for every publisher" for Snaps. So if you have good ideas for them to implement, to make Snap publishing more secure - drop a reply in the linked post.</p>
<p>Hopefully Canonical come up with a good solution, because repeating issues like this reflect pretty poorly on Snap, Canonical and Ubuntu.</p>
<p>Alan Pope (formerly of Canonical, now Axiom) wrote up two blog posts on it "<a href="https://popey.com/blog/2024/02/exodus-bitcoin-wallet-490k-swindle/" target="_blank">Exodus Bitcoin Wallet: $490K Swindle</a>" and the follow-up "<a href="https://popey.com/blog/2024/02/exodus-bitcoin-wallet-follow-up/" target="_blank">Exodus Bitcoin Wallet: Follow up 2.0</a>" that you may want to read for a little more background.</p>

      <title>Cross-platform development library SDL3 gets a Vulkan Renderer and camera API</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With development work ongoing for SDL3, some recent exciting improvements include a Vulkan Render backend and a camera API.</p>
<p>What is SDL? Simple DirectMedia Layer is an open source cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, graphics hardware and more. It's popular and used by quite a lot of games, even Valve use it. See more on the <a href="https://www.libsdl.org" target="_blank">official site</a>.</p>
<p>SDL3 is going to be a pretty <em>big</em> release and just recently Valve developer Dan Ginsburg had their Vulkan Renderer merged into the project. From the <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/pull/9114" target="_blank">pull request</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This pull request adds an implementation of a Vulkan Render backend to SDL. I have so far tested this primarily on Windows, but also smoke tested on Linux and macOS (MoltenVK). I have not tried it yet on Android, but it should be usable there as well (sans any bugs I missed). This began as a port of the SDL Direct3D12 Renderer, which is the closest thing to Vulkan as existed in the SDL codebase. The shaders are more or less identical (with the only differences being in descriptor bindings vs root descriptors). The shaders are built using the HLSL frontend of glslang.</p>
<p>Everything in the code is pure Vulkan 1.0 (no extensions), with the exception of HDR support which requires the Vulkan instance extension VK_EXT_swapchain_colorspace. The code could have been simplified considerably if I used dynamic rendering, push descriptors, extended dynamic state, and other modern Vulkan-isms, but I felt it was more important to make the code as vanilla Vulkan as possible so that it would run on any Vulkan implementation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On top of that developer Ryan Gordon also posted on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/project-sdl3-api-98889512" target="_blank">Patreon</a> about the new camera API, which enables SDL3 to access cameras across many platforms and a quick rough video was shown of it in action on Linux below:</p>

      <title>CrossOver 24 released with Wine 9.0 - plus CodeWeavers still hiring developers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>CodeWeavers have announced the release of CrossOver 24, their application for managing games and applications designed for Windows installed with Wine on Linux and macOS. CodeWeavers support development on Wine and they also work with Valve on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a>!</p>
<p>CrossOver 24 includes these big improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/releases/wine-9.0" target="_blank">Wine 9.0</a>, <em>bringing with it over 7,000 changes that offer improvements to a variety of applications</em></li>
<li>Wine Mono 8.1.0</li>
<li>vkd3d 1.10</li>
<li>MoltenVK 1.2.5</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus they've also upgraded the CrossOver UI to include some much requested additions like the ability to drag and drop files onto the app to install and run them, which includes a new ability to create a launcher for it at the same time too. On top of that there's also the inclusion of a feature to change the directory of where your bottles are stored.</p>
<p>Additionally for Linux they also noted the new Office 365 installers now work and they fixed crashes with PowerPoint 2016/365 but they noted "only the 32-bit online Office installers work". See more in the <a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/blog/mjohnson/2024/2/22/crossover-24-with-wine-9-in-record-time" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>They're also still hiring developers with multiple positions open. This includes a General Wine Developer, Web Developer and an Administrative Operations Associate that you can see on their <a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/about/jobs" target="_blank">jobs page</a>.</p>
<p>Check it out on the <a href="https://www.codeweavers.com" target="_blank">CodeWeavers website</a>. They're also offering a discount of 24% off the price of CrossOver+ and renewals until March 2, 2024 with the code <a href="http://www.codeweavers.com/store?deal=WineNine" target="_blank">WineNine</a>.</p>

      <title>Lies of P recently removed Denuvo and it&#39;s on sale - good time for soulslike fans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For those of you who skip over games that have Denuvo, you might want to go and check in with the rather good soulslike game Lies of P as it's been removed from the game.</p>
<p>The developers didn't actually announce it, and even the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1627720/view/4195735657914862794" target="_blank">patch notes</a> don't mention the removal of Denuvo. It seems odd, but often when we see Denuvo removed, developers seem to try and keep it quiet. I always find that weird. But you can see clearly via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1627720/history/?changeid=U:45465881" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> that it's gone and so is any mention of it on the Steam store page.</p>
<p>It is rated Steam Deck Playable (due to some small text) and Platinum on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1627720?device=any" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a>, and overall thanks to Valve's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> it really does work quite nicely and is one of the best games released in 2023. Well, best if you like this sort of game, with some pretty brutal combat difficulty especially during the boss fights. </p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are a puppet created by Geppetto who’s caught in a web of lies with unimaginable monsters and untrustworthy figures standing between you and the events that have befallen the world of Lies of P.</p>
<p>You are awakened by a mysterious voice that guides you through the plagued city of Krat - a once lively place that has been poisoned by madness and bloodlust. In our soulslike, you must adapt yourself and your weapons to face untold horrors, untangle the unfathomable secrets of the city's elites and choose whether to confront predicaments with the truth or weave lies to overcome them on the journey to find yourself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can buy Lies of P on:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/lies-of-p?ref=gol" target="_blank">Fanatical</a> (on sale 25% off)</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1627720/Lies_of_P?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a> (on sale 25% off)</p>

      <title>The Force Engine for classic Star Wars: Dark Forces now on Flathub</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want an easy way to get The Force Engine on Linux to play Star Wars: Dark Forces (and eventually Outlaws too)? Well, now it's available on Flathub. No more needing to manually compile it from source like we're back in the dark ages, making it much easier to do on Steam Deck too!</p>
<p>Current features of The Force Engine:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Full Dark Forces support, including mods. Outlaws support is coming in version 2.0.</li>
<li>Mod Loader - simply place your mods in the Mods/ directory as zip files or directories.</li>
<li>High Resolution and Widescreen support - when using 320x200 you get the original software renderer. TFE also includes a floating-point software renderer which supports widescreen, including ultrawide, and much higher resolutions.</li>
<li>GPU Renderer with perspective correct pitch - play at much higher resolutions with improved performance.</li>
<li>Extended Limits - TFE, by default, will support much higher limits than the original game which removes most of the HOM (Hall of Mirrors) issues in advanced mods.</li>
<li>Full input binding, mouse sensitivity adjustment, and controller support. Note, however, that menus currently require the mouse.</li>
<li>Optional Quality of Life improvements, such as full mouselook, aiming reticle, improved Boba Fett AI, autorun, and more.</li>
<li>A new save system that works seamlessly with the existing checkpoint and lives system. You can ignore it entirely, use it just as an exit save so you don’t have to play long user levels in one sitting, or full save and load with quicksaves like Doom or Duke Nukem 3D.</li>
<li>OPL3 emulation and Sound Font 2 midi synthesis support.</li>
<li>Optional and quality of life features, even mouselook, can be disabled if you want the original experience. Play in 320x200, turn the mouse mode (Input menu) to Menus only or horizontal, and enable the Classic (software) renderer - and it will look and play just like DOS, but with a higher framerate and without needing to adjust cycles in DosBox.</li>
</ul>

<p>There's also the Nightdive Studios remaster on the way which releases February 28th, that the developer of The Force Engine <a href="https://the-force-engine.freeforums.net/thread/253/nightdive-dark-forces-remaster" target="_blank">mentioned</a> they were helping on in a "technical advisory role". But that hasn't stopped future plans to keep on improving The Force Engine.</p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/io.github.theforceengine.tfe" target="_blank">Flathub</a>. You do need to own the original which you can buy easily <a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/star_wars_dark_forces?as=1636858786" target="_blank">on GOG</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/32400/STAR_WARS__Dark_Forces/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Geometry Survivor is wonderful nostalgia bait updated for the survivor-like era</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I have some ridiculously fond memories of playing Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved, to the point of having a mini-party with lots of us sat around an Xbox 360 blasting through high-scores. To see Geometry Survivor appear is quite a highlight. <em>Note: key provided by Evolve.</em></p>
<p>Taking the visual style of the classic, but putting a spin on it with mechanics that have now been made popular by Vampire Survivors, Geometry Survivor brings the best of both worlds together. Giving you some glorious neon explosions and chaos the classics are known for, but giving you the extra itch of needing another run to unlock some permanent upgrades. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20778267091708610415gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20778267091708610415gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here, unlike its inspiration, your weapons fire automatically. So all you need to worry about, like most survivor-likes, is your movement with fast reactions often being needed when you're getting completely swarmed. Well, not just movement, you also need to carefully craft your run through all the in-run upgrades you can pick. As you destroy enemies, and collect little experience orbs, you then get to pick weapons and upgrade them each level.</p>
<p>It's definitely challenging too, much more so than some other survivor games I've played which I appreciated with it. I've found numerous of them too easy, but this feels just about right. </p>
<p>I only wish there was a lot more of it! Overall it's a little on the basic side of things but that's not really a complaint, more an observation. It's good, and you can have a lot of fun with it if you enjoy arcade smashers. With the different ship types to buy that each come with a unique power like health regeneration or 30% increased game speed, on top of all the permanent upgrades to unlock and each run being a count down from 20 minutes you'll get quite a few happy hours out of it.</p>
<p>Some compatibility notes: on Steam Deck, it works just fine out of the box with Proton 8. On Desktop Linux though, you'll need <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/ge-proton-8-31-and-8-32-bring-fixes-for-helldivers-2-dark-and-darker-agarest/" target="_blank">GE-Proton</a>, otherwise the main menu background is <a href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5998778131708608751gol1.jpg" target="_blank">broken</a> as it's a video file Proton doesn't support directly. But Valve recode various videos for Steam Deck. Additionally, sometimes it would fail to launch, but clicking again and all is fine — odd. Performance not an issue at all, top quality on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux as expected.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ogtemkrXtqw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9f45a26f1c385c71a576746b8b2459ff.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ogtemkrXtqw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>One hand gameplay: Use just one hand to control the direction of your ship.</li>
<li>Auto-Shooter: Your weapons fire automatically, letting you concentrate on staying alive.</li>
<li>Weapons: Each run allows you to get a unique combination of weapons.</li>
<li>Credits: Earn credits and permanently unlock new upgrades.</li>
<li>Enemies: Enjoy the multitude of enemies each with their own AI.</li>
<li>20 minutes of intense gameplay.</li>
<li>Retro visuals and music straight from the 80s.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Fantastic price for what it is too at only £4.29 when not on sale. Gets a full thumbs up from me if you love retro-looking arcade action with plenty of chaos.</p>

      <title>Move over Diablo 4 and Path of Exile as Last Epoch 1.0 is here</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for your next action RPG? Diablo and Path of Exile fans may want to take a look at Last Epoch, which has finally left Early Access with the 1.0 update and there's plenty to love about it. <em>Truthfully, I can't even remember how I got my copy it's been so many years. </em></p>
<p>The <a href="https://forum.lastepoch.com/t/last-epoch-1-0-patch-notes/62536" target="_blank">1.0 patch notes</a> are pretty long but the gist of it is full controller support, an offline mode, new cinematics, various graphical improvements, the Item Factions system, new skills and absolutely loads more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ddvY964TCoQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6aa044d4234a0a7f5d8e77b94686ea5e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ddvY964TCoQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“I want to sincerely thank all of our fans from the bottom of our hearts,” said Judd Cobler, Founder and CEO of Eleventh Hour Games, and Game Director for Last Epoch. “We are a team formed from the ARPG community, and to be able to make it this far with Last Epoch and share this creation with you is a dream come true. We cannot wait for you to experience the full release and the awesome plans we have for the future.”</p>
<p>Last Epoch has Native Linux support and it does work on Steam Deck, although Valve note it as Unsupported on Steam Deck that rating was from May 2022 so they need to update it. There are some issues in the default OpenGL version though like the map being blank, which you can get around simply with "-force-vulkan" as a launch option in Steam. Go into the Properties and put that in the Launch Options text box.</p>
<p>I also had no sound by default on Kubuntu which was solved using the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/no-sound-in-war-thunder-on-linux-heres-a-potential-solution/" target="_blank">same method as War Thunder</a> using this Steam launch option:</p>

<p>So far it's proven to be popular with it hitting a peak player count on Steam of over 150,000 players which has clearly beaten Diablo 4 and it's closing in on Path of Exile's all-time Steam record quickly. It currently has a Very Positive overall user rating on Steam too, although the recent reviews are only Mostly Positive which seems to be due to server issues so it will probably bounce-back once they're fully sorted.</p>

      <title>There&#39;s no end to Vampire Survivor-likes with Temtem: Swarm announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Remember the days when every developer seemed to be announcing some kind of Battle Royale game or mode for an existing game? Well now it's very much Vampire Survivor-likes. Even the monster catching Temtem is being turned into one with Temtem: Swarm.</p>
<p>I continue to be a sucker for all of them too, and Temtem: Swarm looks quite delightful actually. Seems like a fun blending of monster catchers and survivor-likes with evolving creatures, lots of abilities and upgrades, overpowered strategies, chaos and big boss battles. You can even play it online in co-op with others.</p>
<p>Check out the new announcement trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HuUVIBDONEA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9ff46e1d5a3909f3c90d44cfd7b1aecb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HuUVIBDONEA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>No doubt it will work just fine with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a>, and I will absolutely be diving into this one to see what it's like. Will you be checking it out as well?</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2510960/Temtem_Swarm/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>. It's due out in Q3 2024.</p>

      <title>Steam users redeemed over $80 million in physical wallet cards in December 2023</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve continues to pretty much print money, and they've released their latest yearly review and 2023 seems to be another great year for Steam.</p>
<p>This time around, they didn't give all that many details on Steam's overall growth. We didn't get notes on monthly or daily active users like we've seen in the past. And most of the post is simply going over features they added for users and developers during 2023. Still, they did give a <em>few</em> details on that and what they showed was still really surprising.</p>
<p>One of those surprising marks is physical wallet cards, which Valve said during December 20th to December 31st, 2023 that "players redeemed more than $80 million in physical wallet cards". That's a whole lot of gifting going on! Valve also said these physical cards are "some of the most expensive payment methods we support" but the benefits are clear for both developers and Steam users.</p>
<p>Valve also showed one element of their growth with a comparison of the Steam Autumn Sale between 2022 and 2023 showing many developers managing to find success. With a 21% increase in the amount of games earning over $1M in revenue.</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" class="table-stripes-tbody">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Steam Autumn Sale</strong></td>
<td><strong>Increase from 2022 to 2023</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Games over $1K Revenue</td>
<td>+19%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Games over $10K Revenue</td>
<td>+17%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Games over $100K Revenue</td>
<td>+17%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Games over $500K Revenue</td>
<td>+19%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Games over $1M Revenue</td>
<td>+21%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Another big note is that 2023 was the first year in the entire history of Steam where over 500 games earned more than $3 million in gross revenue in one year, Valve said this was more than double the number of games hitting it versus 2018.</p>
<p>It's not just existing and well-known developers doing well though. As Valve notes with their Top 20 game releases each month by revenue that in 2023 more than a quarter of them were from studios releasing on Steam for the very first time.</p>
<p>2023 was also the year that Steam crossed over 33 million concurrent users for the first time!</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>System76 makers of Pop!_OS, various laptops and the stylish Thelio desktop line have announced a big refresh for their line of laptops. Featuring newer 14th Gen Intel CPUs, this is coming as part of their new "Ambition Unfolds" campaign. </p>
<p>They recently refreshed the Bonobo WS and Serval WS models, which are their most powerful and expensive offerings and they will soon be giving the same treatment to their cheaper Oryx Pro and Adder WS models too with the newer 14th Gen Intel i9 14900HX.</p>
<p>“Providing customers with a fast, hassle-free, and long-lasting computer minimizes obstacles for these users while accelerating progress.” says Sam Mondlick, VP Sales of System76. “For this reason, System76 dedicates themselves to empowering users to elevate their work on well-engineered systems.”</p>
<p>The main changes they noted are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adder WS</strong> - 14th Gen update, 15” only, new chassis design and up to 12 TB storage option - coming March 5th.</li>
<li><strong>Oryx Pro</strong> - 14th Gen update, upgrade from H-class to HX-class CPU (now 24 cores vs 14 cores) - coming "soon".</li>
<li><strong>Bonobo WS - </strong>14th Gen update, now with options to choose between a 2K (240Hz) or 4K (144Hz) 17” display - available now.</li>

      <title>Halls of Torment the retro Diablo styled Vampire Survivors-like &#39;closing in on the finale&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer studio Chasing Carrots say they're "closing in on the finale" for the fantastic Halls of Torment, which blends a classic Diablo style with Vampire Survivors-like gameplay for a great mix.</p>
<p>The latest update is out now adding in plenty of performance improvements, so it should run better than before. But there's also a bunch of new content added for people who have played for a while. This includes the Chambers of Dissonance, the next stage that can be unlocked by defeating the Twisted Construct in Frozen Depths that comes with its own quest board and music track.</p>
<p>On top of that there's also a new projectile focused character named Landsknecht that has an arquebus and magic grenades, who can be unlocked in the new Chambers of Dissonance. Another new character was added, Sage, whose main weapon is the first ability you choose at the beginning of a run.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16401738091708514740gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16401738091708514740gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's also new abilities like the Morning Star, a physical projectile/melee ability that gets a damage buff with force and Spectral Fists ability which is a directly attacking summon ability. Lots of smaller changes too like new quest icons, the HUD shows if you have auto attack and/or auto aim enabled or not, bug fixes and so on.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2218750/Halls_of_Torment/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified. It gets a firm recommendation from me.</p>

      <title>Free Stars: The Ur-Quan Masters (open source Star Control 2) now available on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Free Stars: The Ur-Quan Masters, which is an open source version of the classic Star Control 2, has managed to get a Steam release from Pistol Shrimp Games. The developer team includes both of the original designers Paul Reiche and Fred Ford and they're currently working on The Ur-Quan Masters 2.</p>
<p>The Steam release sadly only comes with the Windows version, even though the <a href="https://sc2.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">main project</a> fully supports Linux and macOS too. According to the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2645580/discussions/0/4203616172207532738/" target="_blank">FAQ</a> post: "This release includes a few things which are not default settings in other releases, like voice over, 3DO music, and other minor changes. No source code has been modified. We also wanted to bring the game to Steam to reach the millions of players who use it as their game library of choice."</p>
<p>It will no doubt run just fine in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> though for those who want an easy click and play experience.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2QYlWNdx5FE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/441b4a4d1dc8cc87023d8ad9112a0b75.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2QYlWNdx5FE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Experience an open-world adventure, venturing through space to defeat the invading Ur-Quan and its hierarchy of battle thralls.</li>
<li>Travel through extra-dimensional HyperSpace and discover nearly 500 unknown star systems filled with alien worlds.</li>
<li>Fight enemies in fast-paced space battles with 25 different starships, each with its own unique attacks and powers.</li>
<li>Befriend, threaten, or fight a diverse cast of aliens with unique personalities, from scary, to funny, to just plain weird.</li>
<li>Explore thousands of planets, collecting resources and technology to upgrade your flagship and grow your fleet.</li>
<li>Play standalone Super Melee to practice space combat against AI opponents or to duel against a friend.</li>
<li>Mod and tinker with freely available, open-source code and content.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice bit of gaming history there that inspired designers on all sorts of games like Fallout, Mass Effect, Stellaris and the list goes on. It also gives the developers another way to advertise their new game, whenever it appears.</p>
<p>Check it out on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2645580/Free_Stars_The_UrQuan_Masters/" target="_blank">Steam store page</a>. It's free of course still.</p>

      <title>Check out ChipWits, an upcoming remake of one of the first programming puzzle games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Originally released back in 1984, ChipWits is a programming puzzle game and it's getting a modern remake in Unity that will be released on Steam. According to the Steam page, it will have Native Linux support too.</p>
<p>"ChipWits is a robot coding game with no prior programming experience required. In this game, you use an icon-based language to guide your robot to solve open-ended puzzles and rescue the crew of a space station taken over by a rogue AI, Dr. Droog."</p>
<p>The team working on ChipWits even includes one of the original co-creators, Doug Sharp. Sadly the other co-creator Mike Johnston died back in 2018 and a portion of the proceeds from the new game will go towards the <a href="http://oif.org/" target="_blank">Osteogenesis Imperfecta Foundation</a> in Johnston's memory (from their <a href="https://chipwits.com/2023/02/12/who-are-we/" target="_blank">Team page</a>). You can check the first trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="d9ACRpytwGo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/62b256ac67c00625a733c5ed882441e2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/d9ACRpytwGo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Like any good programming puzzler, there's no one-size-fits-all, with there being multiple solutions. It's easy to learn, but you can go back and improve to maximise your score if you wish much like Zachtronics games.</p>

      <title>Which Way Up: Space Olympics is anti-gravity party game chaos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Turtle Flip Studio plan to launch their physics-based anti-gravity party game Which Way Up: Space Olympics sometime in Q1 2025 but there's a demo up on Steam you can try with Linux support.</p>
<p>Which Way Up: Space Olympics is designed to be easy to pickup and play, allowing players of all ages to join in on the fun through a wide range of gravity-themed multiplayer minigames. In the demo, players can go hands-on with six Space Olympics events, which can be played with up to four players for maximum chaos. The game gives you unique freedom of movement by allowing you to run on walls and ceilings, orbit around planets, or fall across entire levels by manoeuvring through gravity fields and genuinely looks like a riot.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="jjYRBbgw4NA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/95684eeabab63a2ee5754e5b1e9be483.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/jjYRBbgw4NA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>If you enjoy chaos and need more casual laughs with a new party game it's one to keep an eye on. Be sure to try out the demo too, which they've said is now staying after initially appearing during Remote Play Together Fest 2024.</p>
<p>"After receiving such fantastic and constructive feedback from those who played the demo over the last week, we've decided to make our demo permanently available!" lead developer Nick Cellini said, "That way, anyone can grab their friends, jump in, have fun and contribute their ideas to the final release of the game."</p>

      <title>Valve open sourced Steam Audio including the SDK and Plugins</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Steam Audio is a full-featured audio solution for game developers, and now anyone can pretty much do anything with it as Valve has made it entirely open source. Valve continues to show to others how it's done, with lots of their developers and contracts with others (like CodeWeavers for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a>) working on various open source projects.</p>
<p>Writing in an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/596420/announcements/detail/7745698166044243233" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam, Valve said "With this release, our goal is to provide more control to developers, which will lead to better experiences for their users, and hopefully valuable contributions back to the wider community of developers using Steam Audio". It's available under the Apache 2.0 license, as Valve say it allows "developers to use Steam Audio in commercial products, and to modify or redistribute it under their own licensing terms without having to include source code". Obviously though they hope people contribute back to it.</p>
<p>Part of why they've open sourced it is because development is driven by their own internal projects, which might not line up with what external developers need so they did this to remove roadblocks for developers to pick it up and do what they want.</p>
<p>Steam Audio works on Linux, macOS, Windows, Android with integrations for Unity, Unreal Engine 4, a C API and FMOD Studio.</p>

      <title>Palworld is getting external anti-cheat but it will be mostly optional</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Palworld continues to be an incredible success seeing a 24 hour peak player count of 527,994 but cheating is causing problems, so the developers plan to address it with new anti-cheat.</p>
<p>Writing in a fresh <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/6090625297485741627" target="_blank">update on Steam</a> they said a player list will be coming at the end of this month for servers, to help people better deal with nuisances. Additionally though, they will also be adding "an external anti-cheat solution to take measures against particularly frequent fraudulent activities and cheating". However, fear not Linux / Steam Deck players, as it will be optional for community servers, single player, and co-op. Seems like it will just be for official servers.</p>
<p>So hopefully that means there will be no unexpected issues with it suddenly being unplayable like we've seen when other games have added anti-cheat in the past, and like the upcoming breaking update for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/plants-vs-zombies-garden-warfare-2-adding-ea-anticheat-breaking-it-on-steam-deck-linux/" target="_blank">Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2 with EA Anti-Cheat</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18957662301708350306gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18957662301708350306gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The game has, as games do, dropped down from it's ridiculously high release player count which peaked overall at 2,101,867. The drop caused some other gaming news sites to run articles about the drop in players. This caused the Community Manager at Pocketpair, Bucky, to write a long <a href="https://twitter.com/Bucky_cm/status/1757796446739558795" target="_blank">post on X</a> (formerly Twitter) calling such articles "lazy". A snippet from the post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>This emerging "Palworld has lost X% of its player base" discourse is lazy, but it's probably also a good time to step in and reassure those of you capable of reading past a headline that it is fine to take breaks from games. You don't need to feel bad about that. Palworld, like many games before it, isn't in a position to pump out massive amounts of new content on a weekly basis. New content will come, and it's going to be awesome, but these things take a little bit of time. There are so many amazing games out there to play; you don't need to feel guilty about hopping from game to game.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Some wise words there.</em></p>
<p>Palworld is currently rated Steam Deck Playable and works great on Desktop Linux thanks to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a>. You can find it in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/" target="_blank">Early Access on Steam</a>.</p>

<p>"Tiger-Heli marked a revolutionary moment in 1985 as Toaplan's pioneering bomb-based vertical shooter, a true innovator of its time. Despite its unassuming appearance, its lifelike gameplay resonated with fans, earning widespread acclaim in Japan and around the globe. Its legacy lived on through Twin Cobra, released just two years later, and even today it remains a cherished gem among retro gaming enthusiasts worldwide."</p>

<p>While all three of the collections may be quite a niche thing, it's still great to see many classics given a new life like this. Bitwave Games / Toaplan clearly love what they do and it shows. What you're getting here is basically a third helping of a gaming time machine, to go back in time and see some true classics. They can be quite difficult too, but thanks to all the quality of life additions, you can play them how you want making them more accessible than ever.</p>
<p>There were a few issues at release, but like with the previous collections, their team have been quick to put out patches to address them so they're supporting them well. Another worthy set of retro games to add to your desktop, Steam Deck or perhaps you have some fancy arcade cabinet?</p>
<p>You can find the full list of their games included in all packs on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/franchise/toaplan" target="_blank">Steam</a>. There's some of them on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/games?developers=bitwave-games-toaplan" target="_blank">GOG</a> too but only Steam has the Linux / Steam Deck support.</p>

      <title>There&#39;s a new Godot Engine addon to simplify testing on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For game developers using or looking at using <a href="https://godotengine.org" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, you may want to check out the <a href="https://github.com/LauraWebdev/Godot4-DeployToSteamOS" target="_blank">Godot 4 DeployToSteamOS addon</a> which gives you a one-click method to test your games on Steam Deck. <em>Be sure to also check out the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/the-latest-godot-engine-2023-showreel-shows-an-impressive-variety-of-games/" target="_blank">Godot Engine 2023 showreel</a>.</em></p>
<p>This is really cool! With the popularity of the Steam Deck, which has been in the Top 10 of the Global Weekly Top Sellers list on Steam every week so far this year, it can make repeat testing a whole lot easier to do from within Godot directly and save game devs some time.</p>
<p>Currently it only supports Godot 4 C# as it "uses external libraries for establishing SSH connections and scanning for devices on your network that aren't accessible through GDScript only." It does also need you to have the SteamOS devkit installed (<a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/steamdeck/loadgames" target="_blank">more info</a>) as it needs you to connect with it at least once for the pairing to work. No special hardware is required, the devkit runs on any normal Steam Deck and the devkit software runs on both Linux and Windows.</p>

      <title>Inflexion Games give update on Steam Deck &amp; Linux support for Nightingale</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nightingale is an upcoming open world survival and crafting game from Inflexion Games, it looks quite magnificent and will no doubt be another early 2024 hit and the developers put up a blog post on Steam Deck / Linux support status.</p>
<p>Much like Palworld and Enshrouded it will be in Early Access, but given how people are clearly always in the mood for more of these open world games, I fully expect it to do well. Especially so with the rather wild looking "Victorian gaslamp fantasy" setting with the ability to portal-hop through to entirely new locations using special Realm Cards and each realm features new "dangers, discoveries, and surprises, you have the power to influence its design, including prevalence of hostiles, abundance of resources, and even the environment itself".</p>
<p>Be sure to check out their gameplay overview:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="PtyK4EQxK0o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cd20ccdb0daad6869528efd4827aba68.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/PtyK4EQxK0o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Writing in the <a href="https://playnightingale.com/news/pre-launch-updates" target="_blank">update blog post</a> the developers noted on the subject on Steam Deck / Linux:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve been getting a lot of questions in regards to whether Steam Deck will be supported at launch.</p>
<p>Technically, Nightingale can launch and be played on Steam Deck with the caveats to controller support listed above*, but we’re not considering it officially supported at launch. This means we will not be providing customer support for Steam Deck issues at launch as it’s considered an unofficial platform at this time.</p>
<p>We are working on full Steam Deck support and will provide an update once that status is confirmed.</p>
<p>If you have a Steam Deck, you’re welcome to play Nightingale on it and provide feedback or bug reports (more details on how to do that coming soon), but please disclose that you’re playing on Steam Deck so it’s easier for our team to recreate it internally.</p>
<p>Other versions of Linux are also not officially supported at this time, but we’re happy for you to report your bugs with details on what version you’re experiencing issues on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>*Their controller support notes you may occasionally need a Keyboard or Mouse input but they will fix full controller support "as soon as possible in a near future update". With Steam Input though, hopefully that won't be too much trouble since you can bind whatever buttons you wish yourself until they sort it.</p>
<p>It's nice to see Linux normally mentioned too, we don't see that too often and the developer actually being open to reported issue with it. More like this please.</p>
<p>You can follow <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1928980/Nightingale/" target="_blank">Nightingale on Steam</a>. It hits Early Access on February 20th.</p>

      <title>EmulationStation Desktop Edition (ES-DE) gets new default look and different font sizes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>EmulationStation Desktop Edition 3.0 is out now and it's gone through a rebrand to simply ES-DE, plus a whole bunch of improvements come with this release.</p>
<p>What is it: ES-DE is a frontend for browsing and launching games from your multi-platform game collection. It comes preconfigured for use with RetroArch and a large selection of standalone emulators. It's also fully customizable so you can easily expand it to include emulators or applications not covered by the bundled configuration.</p>
<p>Firstly, in 3.0 there is a <em>breaking</em> change. The configuration folder was originally hidden in your home as "./emulationstation" but now it's simply named "ES-DE". So you'll need to rename it yourself. You can unhide folders in your File Manager usually using CTRL+H on keyboard or in Dolphin for KDE Plasma / Steam Deck from the hamburger menu:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17847078701708341780gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17847078701708341780gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Simply rename it without the dot to just ES-DE.</p>
<p>For those of you (like me) who prefer bigger fonts, there's more options for that now too with Medium and Large font size options now available for the Slate and Modern themes. For different controller layouts, like say Nintendo, you can also now swap the menu ABXY buttons. There's lots more, including some specific additions for Linux like support for the AppImage release of Vita3K and the Flatpak release of puNES and lots more. </p>
<p>If you love emulating games, this is a top quality app to try out on Desktop Linux and Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Metro Exodus hits 10 million sales - and there&#39;s more to come</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>4A Games announced that Metro Exodus has now crossed over 10 million sales, and the good news is they have plans for more games to come. Writing in a <a href="https://twitter.com/MetroVideoGame/status/1758138117704618340" target="_blank">post</a> on X (formerly Twitter) the official Metro account noted the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/time-to-blow-the-dust-off-your-vr-headset-metro-awakening-is-coming/" target="_blank">recently announced Metro VR game</a>, and also that the next mainline Metro game will come from 4A Games "when it's ready".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="Metro Exodus turns 5 years old today, and has now sold over 10 Million copies.  Metro will return in VR with Metro Awakening from @vertigogames  in 2024 - and the next mainline Metro from @4AGames …  When it’s ready  Thank you for coming on the journey so far with us." src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1816195541708091255gol1.png"/></p>
<p>We definitely need more high-quality story-shooters like this, so it's really great to see them tease a proper mainline addition to the series is on the way don't you think?</p>
<p>Metro Exodus has a Native Linux version and it's rated Steam Deck Playable.</p>
<p>I have to confess, I still haven't actually gone through and finished Metro Exodus yet. Really enjoyed the gameplay and story in the first two though, so I really should do Exodus at some point. I remember first trying it out on Stadia (R.I.P) and being quite impressed there, and then later the Linux version when it appeared with the Steam release.</p>

      <title>More details on the Manjaro Orange Pi Neo gaming handheld</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/orange-pi-neo-gaming-handheld-to-come-with-manjaro-linux/" target="_blank">Announced earlier this month</a>, the Orange Pi Neo is a gaming handheld coming out a bit like the Steam Deck but it will be running Manjaro Linux. Recently the Manjaro team gave out a bit more info that was all in a Q&amp;A post on the official Manjaro forum.</p>
<p>This isn't something that was rushed as Manjaro project lead Phillip Müller noted they've worked with Orange Pi on this since May 2023, and the Neo will be released with the first version of Manjaro that's immutable (just like SteamOS on the Steam Deck) named Manjaro Gaming Edition. This will come with special patched versions of <a href="https://github.com/ChimeraOS/gamescope" target="_blank">gamescope</a>, <a href="https://github.com/philmmanjaro/HandyGCCS/tree/neo" target="_blank">handygccs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ShadowBlip/OpenGamepadUI" target="_blank">OpenGamepadUI</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hhd-dev/hhd/tree/neo" target="_blank">hhd</a> and it will have a focus on Flatpaks for extras. It will also ship with the KDE Plasma desktop mode, just like the Steam Deck again. So overall how it will work should be very close to SteamOS.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15458384641708089072gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15458384641708089072gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Something many people have been asking for: more handhelds that match up to the software experience on the Steam Deck and not just sticking something on top of Windows to make it slightly less terrible. The thumbpads and an extra USB port are also very welcome.</p>
<p>What they're currently working on getting working:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>RGB control still needs to be added to hhd or a dedicated application.</li>
<li>TDP control might work via OpenGamepadUI overlay mode.</li>
<li>controller support still needs to be added to OpenGamepadUI.</li>
<li>fan curves and battery control needs to be optimized.</li>
<li>Audio Equalizer might still need some work to improve audio quality.</li>
<li>Standby and Sleep needs some work in software and firmware to properly work.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They even noted the gyroscope model as a BOSCH 260, which is already supported.</p>
<p>Most importantly: what about pricing and release date? Well the good news on both is that it's not far away with a Q2 2024 target (April - June), and they say the price is aiming for the lower-end of Steam Deck pricing so it sounds like it's going to be really competitive there.</p>

      <title>Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition gets performance improvements, HDR-bloom, bug fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition is still amazingly being updated, although not directly by Beamdog with the community now helping out for fun.</p>
<p>The latest update to this classic RPG was "developed for personal enjoyment and out of goodwill for our fellow players and creators by unpaid software engineers from the NWN community" Beamdog said. Nice to see they're being open to letting others help improve it even further, especially given the age it probably doesn't exactly pull in many sales to continue paying a dedicated team.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14236043081708082634gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14236043081708082634gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here's the highlights of what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New HDR-bloom postprocessing effect accumulates overlapping effects more naturally and makes intense colors bleed into the surrounding pixels.</li>
<li>Improvements to the gameplay UI, such as toggling object highlight by double-pressing TAB.</li>
<li>Significant performance improvements across the board, both on servers and clients.</li>
<li>Many new and improved scripting functions, including support for synchronised audio playback and improvements to the scriptable UI.</li>
<li>Over a hundred bugfixes, including several notorious 20-year-old bugs, such as area objects sometimes showing up too late.</li>
<li>Script compiler is now open source and available as a standalone tool at <a href="https://github.com/niv/neverwinter.nim" target="_blank">https://github.com/niv/neverwinter.nim</a>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>More open source is always nice to see too!</p>
<p>Full changelog on the <a href="https://nwn.beamdog.net/docs/" target="_blank">Beamdog website</a>.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/neverwinter-nights-enhanced-edition?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/neverwinter_nights_enhanced_edition_pack?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/704450/Neverwinter_Nights_Enhanced_Edition/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Even though Hello games are now working on their open-world survival game <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/cautiously-hyped-for-light-no-fire-from-the-no-mans-sky-team-at-hello-games/" target="_blank">Light No Fire</a>, they're not quite done with No Man's Sky just yet with the Omega Update.

      <title>Apple M1 gets OpenGL 4.6 and OpenGL ES 3.2 support on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Alyssa Rosenzweig announced in a <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/conformant-gl46-on-the-m1.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> that support for the Apple M1 has been improved, with the latest updates bringing full conformant OpenGL 4.6 on the M1. This includes OpenGL ES 3.2 support too, bumping it up from OpenGL 4.1.</p>
<p>Poking a bit of fun at Apple, Rosenzweig noted "Unlike the vendor’s non-conformant 4.1 drivers, our <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/asahi/mesa" target="_blank">open source</a> Linux drivers are <strong>conformant</strong> to the latest OpenGL versions, finally promising broad compatibility with modern OpenGL workloads, like <a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">Blender</a>, <a href="https://ryujinx.org/" target="_blank">Ryujinx</a>, and <a href="https://citra-emu.org/" target="_blank">Citra</a>."</p>
<p>So for all of you who have a device with the M1, you should hopefully now be able to run even more games and software. OpenGL 4.6 brings with it the likes of compute shaders, SPIR-V, upgraded transform feedback and more.</p>
<p>More from the blog post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While the vendor doesn’t yet support graphics standards like modern OpenGL, we do. For this Valentine’s Day, we want to profess our love for interoperable open standards. We want to free users and developers from lock-in, enabling applications to run anywhere the heart wants without special ports. For that, we need standards conformance. Six months ago, we became the <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/first-conformant-m1-gpu-driver.html" target="_blank">first conformant driver for any standard graphics API for the M1</a> with the release of OpenGL ES 3.1 drivers. Today, we’ve finished OpenGL with the full 4.6… and we’re well on the road to Vulkan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The power of Linux and open source at play here once again. The full post is worth a read if you're into learning more behind the scenes on the driver development.</p>

      <title>Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2 adding EA AntiCheat, breaking it on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's only a matter of time before more and more EA published games move over to EA Anti-Cheat, and now Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2 is set to get it.</p>
<p>Currently rated as Playable on Steam Deck and Gold on ProtonDB, an update planned for March 2024 will entirely break it on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux. Announced on the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/plants-vs-zombies/plants-vs-zombies-garden-warfare-2/news/pvzgw2-anticheat-update" target="_blank">EA website</a>, they said they've "identified an issue affecting our Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2 PC players" and so "to create a safe and fair experience for all players, we will be rolling out an update in March 2024 that will transition PVZGW2 for PC over to EA Anticheat".</p>
<p>In the post they clearly say "With this update, we will be ending support for Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2 for PC on Windows 7, 8, 8.1 operating systems. Additionally, Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2 will not run on the native Steam OS for Steamdeck with this update."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13305881121708002003gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13305881121708002003gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>So players on Steam Deck / Linux will be left with a broken game. Concerning for many reasons, because once again it shows developers can and will just break their games on certain platforms - even when put through Steam Deck Verified by Valve, it's not a guarantee that the games will continue working unless the developers support the platforms directly.</p>
<p>EA Anti-Cheat is the cause of other games not working too including EA SPORTS FC 24. How long before they include it in other games, like Apex Legends, which is currently Steam Deck Verified?</p>

      <title>Helldivers 2 rated Playable for Steam Deck by Valve</title>
      <author>Smellbringer</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Helldivers 2 is the bug-squashing sensation that's sweeping the nation. Skyrocketing to popularity in a way that the first Helldivers could only dream of. And in a way that caught me off guard if I'm gonna be honest, I barely gave it much thought when it was shown off. Despite that, Helldivers 2 has already surpassed God of War as Playstation's biggest launch on Steam and has easily eclipsed its top-down predecessor in terms of popularity.</p>
<p>The best surprise of Helldivers 2 was that despite its kernel-level anti-cheat system, something that normally kills Linux support, the game ran on Steam Deck. Though not without issues initially with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/helldivers-2-is-out-heres-how-to-run-it-on-steam-deck-linux/" target="_blank">running it on the Decks Game Mode</a> due to said anti-cheat affecting Game Mode but Valve quickly put out a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/proton-hotfix-updated-to-support-helldivers-2-on-steam-deck-linux/" target="_blank">Proton Hotfix to solve it</a>.</p>
<p>As a result of this change Valve has now rated Helldivers 2 as <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable on Steam Deck. The reasons for the playable rating being due to small text that may be difficult to read and the need to manually configure graphics to get good performance on Deck. As for those settings I don't own the game myself so I had to rely on the word of ProtonDB, where Helldivers 2 is rated as Gold for Linux support.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/553850" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> it appears that a mix of Low to Medium settings with FSR set to Ultra Quality can get a mostly solid 30FPS performance. Which is pretty good for a handheld like the Steam Deck. I have no idea if this is for OLED Deck or LCD Deck however so you may have to experiment on your own to figure out the settings that work best for you.</p>

      <title>Cultist Simulator gets much improved Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cultist Simulator was already Steam Deck Verified with Native Linux support but Weather Factory have put out a brand new update, which aims to improve it even further. Always great to see attention to the details!</p>
<p><em>Be sure to check out contributor <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2018/05/we-review-cultist-simulator-a-game-from-the-creative-talent-behind-sunless-seas/" target="_blank">Scaine's original review of the game</a>.</em></p>
<p>In the update released February 13th the developers <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/718670/view/4052745736467364177" target="_blank">noted</a> they added (amongst a bunch of bug fixes):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Steam Deck support! A nice excuse to add a QoL/accessibility feature here and there.</li>
<li>Added 150% UI scale.</li>
<li>Added a Font Size setting. May lead to stranger looks on higher ends.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8192695101707918612gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8192695101707918612gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Cultist Simulator</em> is a game of apocalypse and yearning from Alexis Kennedy, creator of <em>Fallen London</em> and <em>Sunless Sea</em>. Play as a seeker after unholy mysteries, in a 1920s-themed setting of hidden gods and secret histories. Perhaps you're looking for knowledge, or power, or beauty, or revenge. Perhaps you just want the colours beneath the skin of the world.<br/>
<br/>
In this roguelike narrative card game, what you find may transform you forever. Every choice you make, from moment to moment, doesn't just advance the narrative - it also shapes it.</p>

      <title>Paradox confirm no Linux support for Prison Architect 2 but investigating Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Prison Architect 2 from Double Eleven and Paradox Interactive was recently revealed with an entirely new look, and while the original has full Native Linux support, the sequel will not.</p>
<p>Apart from their main grand strategy games developed directly by Paradox, it seems they continue to move away from direct Linux support with all the other games now. Just like we saw with Cities Skylines 2, Star Trek: Infinite, The Lamplighters League and Age of Wonders 4.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18524169401707917681gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18524169401707917681gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Writing in an <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/faq.1624027/#post-29404949" target="_blank">FAQ post</a> on their official forum a Paradox staffer noted:</p>

<p><strong><strong><u>Will the game have Linux support? Will it be playable on the Steam Deck?</u></strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Prison Architect 2 is not supported for Linux. We are currently investigating Steam Deck Verification.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if you want to play it on Linux or Steam Deck, you'll need <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a>. Thankfully, Proton does run almost anything you throw at it nowadays, especially single-player games like this. Still, it's somewhat amusing for developers to not support Linux, but support (or look at supporting) the Steam Deck — which uses SteamOS Linux. But the Steam Deck is a dedicated known platform of course, compared to the many different desktop configurations of Linux. But again, Proton should run it just as well on Desktop Linux if it runs on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Prison Architect 2 is due out on March 26th, and according to the FAQ it will be a "full-fledged game, with old and new features such as the Career mode, the Sandbox mode, and modding tools" and in regards to DLC which Paradox games are pretty notorious to have lots they said "post-launch content and DLCs are not our focus right now".</p>

      <title>DOSBox Staging 0.81.0 out now with new CRT shaders and lots of graphics improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>DOSBox Staging is a modern continuation of DOSBox with advanced features and modern development practices, giving you the great compatibility of classic games with plenty of extras. A new release is available with DOSBox Staging 0.81.0 and it brings with it quite a number of changes to improve a whole lot of games.</p>
<p>The first major change is the removal of their original CRT shaders, with them being replaced by a much better set of 24 CRT shaders they say are "tweaked to perfection to emulate the glorious CRT monitors of the past, including authentic recreations of Hercules, CGA, monochrome CGA, composite CGA, EGA, and VGA monitors". They say you don't need to know much, and no configuration is required at all, as DOSBox Staging will automatically pick the best one based on the current DOS video mode and viewport resolution but you can turn them off if you wish.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19894163151707911238gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19894163151707911238gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Gods — 320×200 VGA</p>
<p>Some of the other additions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accurate VGA emulation.</li>
<li>3dfx Voodoo 1 emulation.</li>
<li>New integer scaling modes.</li>
<li>Aspect ratio correct image captures.</li>
<li>Supercharged image and video capturing.</li>
<li>Aspect ratio and viewport enhancements.</li>
<li>A fix for the “black vertical bars” video corruption issue.</li>
<li>New deinterlacing shader for FMV games.</li>
<li>+ much more graphical improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p>See more in their <a href="https://dosbox-staging.github.io/releases/release-notes/0.81.0/" target="_blank">release notes</a> for the full explanation of each change.</p>

      <title>Celebrate Valentine&#39;s Day with this Bloody Sale</title>
      <author>Smellbringer</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Whether we're celebrating with loved ones or just staying home alone, Valentines Day is a special day. And what better way to celebrate than by ripping out someones spine or mowing down folks with a shotgun. Well at least that's how I celebrate, and if you wanna celebrate in that way then look no further with Warner Brothers' <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/developer/WBGames/sale/bloodyvalentines" target="_blank">Bloody Valentines Day sale.</a></p>

<p>Steam Deck compatibility will also be listed for convenience. Though it should be noted that, despite being listed as Unsupported, Mortal Kombat 11 runs just fine on Steam Deck according to <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/976310" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a>.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>If you're a fighting game fan I don't think you can get a better deal than the combo pack of injustice 2 and MK11. Even if you already own one of the two like I do with MK11, I still think it's an amazing deal. However, if you just wanna dip your toes in the waters of Mortal Kombat then I recommend the MKX deal. It's a shame MK1 isn't included in this sale, that'd be nice if it was.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="l2wGGWWKWpo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bb7697359b88f0b6264cd24903ca33b0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/l2wGGWWKWpo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p style="text-align:center"><em>Really wanted to find a MK11+Injustice 2 bundle trailer. Oh well.</em></p>
<p>As an FPS fan though I've heard great things about F.E.A.R. so this might be a good time for me to snag the collection. Especially as it's the only way to buy the first F.E.A.R. game on Steam for some bizarre reason. I can't speak to Back 4 Blood though, I'd rather play Left 4 Dead 2.</p>
<p>The Bloody Valentine sale can be checked out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/developer/WBGames/sale/bloodyvalentines" target="_blank">on Steam</a> and runs until February 19th at 10AM PST / 6PM UTC, just in case you're waiting on payday to check out these deals.</p>

      <title>Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 hits over half a million Steam user reviews - ranked 19th most popular</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Baldur's Gate 3 from Larian Studios has managed to hit a mark not many games do, as it's crossed over the half a million mark on Steam for user reviews with an Overwhelmingly Positive rating overall.</p>
<p>Going by <a href="https://steam250.com/reviews" target="_blank">Steam Top 250</a>, this gives Baldur's Gate 3 the 25th place for most user reviews ever on Steam. There's over 560,000 in total, but only just over 500,000 are counted in the main Steam user rating since Steam only counts direct purchases in that.</p>
<p>And it's also made it to 19th place for the best reviewed game on Steam <a href="https://steam250.com/top250" target="_blank">of all time</a>. Some seriously impressive numbers, especially given that it's less than a year old. Not exactly a big surprise though is it? The game won the GOTY award in the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/baldurs-gate-3-wins-game-of-the-year-in-the-2023-steam-awards/" target="_blank">2023 Steam Awards</a> and it seems for good reason — a proper quality full and complete experience at release without lots of micro-transactions and DLC.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9337266221707840017gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Larian is currently <a href="https://twitter.com/baldursgate3/status/1755980870664466761" target="_blank">working on</a> Patch 6, which will include quite a number of improvements again like improved romancing, various gameplay improvements and more bug fixes.</p>
<p>How many hours have you put into Baldur's Gate 3? What's your opinion on it? Do you have a favourite moment in the game you want to share? Let us know in the comments.</p>
<p>I really do love it! Works really great on Desktop Linux with Proton. Easily one of the best games I've played in a long time. Even with some issues here and there, they've been really active on fixing it up and improving it across some huge updates.</p>
<p>You can buy Baldur's Gate 3 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/baldurs_gate_iii?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>

      <title>The latest Godot Engine 2023 showreel shows an impressive variety of games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://godotengine.org" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> continues to grow in popularity, and the quality of the games being made with it year after year just keep improving. The latest official Godot showreel is out now.</p>
<p>This year we see a really impressive variety in the art styles and game genre, so even if you're not specifically interested in Godot directly, it's still a really fun look at a whole bunch of upcoming games and apps. A few of which are planning Native Linux support, which is interesting to see considering Godot has some of the best Linux support around for developers.</p>

      <title>Geometry Survivor is a little Geometry Wars and a bit Vampire Survivors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Yes, it continues. The survivor-like bullet-heaven mashup has gained another. Geometry Survivor releases February 21st and should be on the radar of anyone who loved the classic Geometry Wars.</p>
<p>The developer Brain Seal Ltd has seemingly combined the best of both worlds here with lots of upgrades like the survivor games, with the style and chaos of Geometry Wars. In a way, it feels a bit like we've come full circle here. Geometry Wars and various spin-offs and clones were hugely popular some years ago, then developers focused elsewhere, now we have all the Vampire Survivor-likes and here we're going back and blending it all.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ogtemkrXtqw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9f45a26f1c385c71a576746b8b2459ff.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ogtemkrXtqw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>One hand gameplay: Use just one hand to control the direction of your ship.</li>
<li>Auto-Shooter: Your weapons fire automatically, letting you concentrate on staying alive.</li>
<li>Weapons: Each run allows you to get a unique combination of weapons.</li>
<li>Credits: Earn credits and permanently unlock new upgrades.</li>
<li>Enemies: Enjoy the multitude of enemies each with their own AI.</li>
<li>20 minutes of intense gameplay.</li>
<li>Retro visuals and music straight from the 80s.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I have a key request in for this one, so I'm hoping to take a look at release to see how it runs on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux. I have no doubts thanks to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> that it will work well. Even if it works well, will it be any good? Will it be more than a bit of nostalgia bait? I'm keen to find out.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2489010/Geometry_Survivor/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Pesticide Not Required blends Vampire Survivors with Atomicrops</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's clearly no stopping the rise of games designed like Vampire Survivors, and as usual they keep hooking their teeth into me. The latest is Pesticide Not Required, combining  Vampire Survivors with Atomicrops.</p>
<p>Here it is actually a little bit different, as it also pulls in a little inspiration from Brotato too. It's based on waves, which you deal with through the day and night and right at the end a shop opens to spend your coins gathered from downed enemies. In the shop you buy seeds, which you plant and cultivate and these seeds are also where you get your additional weapons.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13465914731707822602gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13465914731707822602gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Pesticide Not Required on Linux</em></p>
<p>There's mining, fishing, pets to help you out, lots of upgrades and the ability to make some really insane character builds to watch the screen fill up with your attacks. I have a feeling this is going to be pretty popular at release, if it manages to cut through the noise of thousands of games releasing on Steam all the time. It has the right idea and the blending of genres like this is done quite well. The mechanics are all simple though, to not overwhelm you so it remains quite accessible.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Season-themed map variations with multiple difficulty levels.</li>
<li>Many unlockable characters with special traits.</li>
<li>Persistent skill tree upgrades.</li>
<li>Quick ~20-minute play sessions.</li>
<li>Tons of achievements to unlock.</li>
<li>Full gamepad and keyboard support.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The full game is due out later in Q1 2024. It's gone right to the top of my wishlist - really fun idea.</p>
<p>There's a demo <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2479320/Pesticide_Not_Required/" target="_blank">available on Steam</a> that worked perfectly with Proton 8.</p>

      <title>Funday Games plan to get Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor bumped to Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor launches in Early Access tomorrow (February 14th) and it has now been given a Steam Deck Playable rating. The good news is the developer, Funday Games, plan to improve on that.</p>
<p>An off-shoot of one of my favourite co-op games, Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor spins it into a Vampire Survivors like game and the early demos were a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Why is it only Playable and not Verified? Valve noted it has some text that's too small for the Steam Deck screen. In an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2321470/view/4034731337943272264" target="_blank">update post</a> on Steam the developer said clearly "We will be working on getting officially Verified soon after launch." but all other parts of the game work just fine with Valve's verification being done on the latest stable Proton 8.</p>
<p>Thankfully, for Desktop Linux players, that small text won't be an issue on bigger screens.</p>
<p>Release date trailer is below:</p>

      <title>Steam Deck SteamOS 3.5.16 Preview improves Persona 3 Reload performance</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SteamOS 3.5.16 Preview is available now for testing on Steam Deck, as Valve continue improving performance for the recently released Persona 3 Reload.</p>
<p>This is on top of the improved performance of ray-traced reflections in Persona 3 Reload from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/steam-deck-steamos-3514-preview-persona-3-reload-improvements-and-more/" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.5.14 Preview</a>, and a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/proton-hotfix-gets-persona-3-reload-performance-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" target="_blank">recent Proton Hotfix update</a> also improving performance overall.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10215677771707820218gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>SteamOS 3.5.16 Preview simply has a one-liner <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/4064004735526102920?snr=2___" target="_blank">changelog</a> that notes "Further improved performance in Persona 3 Reload". Confusingly, updating to it in Preview didn't actually change the SteamOS version from the recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/steam-deck-steamos-3-5-15-preview-hdr-improvement-gpu-crash-improvements/" target="_blank">3.5.15 Preview</a>. I was already on 3.5.15, and it gave me the update. So it's possible Valve forgot to update the actual version string.</p>
<p>To test it out go into Settings &gt; System &gt; System Update Channel and pick Preview from the drop-down box.</p>
<p>You can buy Persona 3 Reload from:</p>

      <title>Steam Remote Play Together 2024 Fest is live to celebrate gaming together anywhere</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Celebrating the ability to play games together wherever you are, Valve has launched the Steam Remote Play Together 2024 Fest. Giving you plenty of discounts on games you might want to pick up.</p>
<p>Remote Play is one of the sweetest features of Steam, although it doesn't always quite work right, when it <em>does</em> it opens up a lot more options. Streaming from one device to another for solo play, or the <em>together</em> part of it where you share  games with friends so they can join in from anywhere, which is especially good for co-op / multiplayer games that usually only support local play (and only the host needs to own the game!).</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Xia-MsSgfMM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/346abbe667a98bcd9750b866ba1f8407.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Xia-MsSgfMM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's a lot that's discounted during this event, a bit of everything from AAA to tiny indies and everything in between. I don't actually play a lot of co-op games myself, but some fun titles to guarantee a good time with discounts include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/728880/Overcooked_2/" target="_blank">Overcooked! 2</a> - 75% off - Deck Verified / Native Linux</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/512900/Streets_of_Rogue/" target="_blank">Streets of Rogue</a> - 75% off - Deck Playable / Native Linux</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/238460/BattleBlock_Theater/" target="_blank">BattleBlock Theater</a> - 70% off - Deck Verified / Native Linux</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/252110/Lovers_in_a_Dangerous_Spacetime/" style="outline-width:0px !important; user-select:auto !important" target="_blank">Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime</a> - 50% off - Deck Verified / Native Linux</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/763890/Wildermyth/" target="_blank">Wildermyth</a> - 30% off - Deck Verified / Native Linux</li>
</ul>
<p><em>All of those are especially great games!</em></p>
<p>Are you going to be picking up anything? Let me know your best picks in the comments!</p>
<p>The event runs until February 19th at 10 AM PT / 6PM UTC. There's also some new entries in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/points/shop/app/2831890" target="_blank">Steam Points Shop</a>.</p>

      <title>Bazzite Linux adds support for the Lenovo Legion Go handheld</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to get Linux on your Lenovo Legion Go? Bazzite Linux was recently updated and now should be feature complete for the Legion Go so you can get a more SteamOS-like experience for it just like the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Bazzite also recently gained a rather <a href="https://bazzite.gg" target="_blank">fancy looking website</a> dedicated to it. Making it much easier and clearer to see exactly what it is: the next generation of Linux Gaming, well they think so anyway.</p>
<p>What exactly is it? As they explain: Bazzite is a custom image built on Fedora Atomic technology that brings the best of Linux gaming to all of your devices (yep, even your favorite handheld). Featuring a rock-solid base with automatic updates and ninety days of rollbacks.". It's some really clever stuff, and includes plenty of added extras for gaming.</p>
<p>Posting on the official forum, one of the Bazzite team <a href="https://universal-blue.discourse.group/t/lenovo-legion-go-support/584" target="_blank">mentioned</a>: "the Lenovo Legion Go is now <strong>feature complete</strong> as of the latest update" and that "assuming you’ve followed the <a href="https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite#alternative-handhelds" target="_blank">alternative handheld section of our readme</a> that you can now enjoy full feature-parity with the Steam Deck on your Lenovo Legion Go".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="Lenovo Legion Go" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17026334041707752295gol1.png"/></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em>Pictured - Lenovo Legion Go</em></p>
<p>Valve really did light a fire under various hardware vendors with the Steam Deck didn't they! Nice to see more of them now having easyish ways to get Linux on them too for a more open experience.</p>

      <title>Dead Cells will be finished with the upcoming Update 35</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Motion Twin have announced that the upcoming Update 35 for Dead Cells will be the end, so it will be actually finished and complete with no more content updates.</p>
<p>They shared the news in a post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/588650/view/4020094639145168178" target="_blank">Steam</a> saying that "Update 35 for Dead Cells marks the end of our creative journey on the game. After an incredible 5-year collaboration in bringing additional content to Dead Cells' live-ops, Evil Empire will be pursuing new adventures and we can't wait to see what they come up next.".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6760930921707750920gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>One of the issues noted is they didn't want to fall into the "more of the same" trap, as they didn't want to "overextend and risk diminishing the unique charm that makes Dead Cells special to us all". This is part of why things have been quieter around Dead Cells recently, as they said "concluding such a partnership required careful planning to ensure a smooth process for everyone, including the community" as Evil Empire and Motion Twin both move onto new things.</p>
<p>Probably the right move. Dead Cells as it is right now, with the multiple DLC released, is excellent and packed full of content to explore and fight through. Not everything needs to be expanded upon forever. There's currently no date for the final update yet though.</p>
<p>You can buy Dead Cells from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/dead-cells?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/dead_cells?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/588650/Dead_Cells/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified with the Native Linux version too.</p>

      <title>Craftomation 101 combines crafting, programming and tiny robots to unfreeze a planet</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hitting Early Access on February 19th, Craftomation 101 is a spiritual successor to Luden.io's previous game "while True: learn()" and it sounds like a really fun combination of ideas.</p>
<p>You've played various survival games, crafting games, automation sims and all that but have you played one where you're trying to bring a planet back to life? Apparently it's going to take over 9,000 years! Well, good job you can do some visual programming to get tiny robots to do your bidding huh? Sounds like a really fun idea for a programming automation sandbox game.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NQv6b22HTeE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6cfc8cb7b6029a9b517059f016cdb8d5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NQv6b22HTeE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer kindly sent over a key, so I'll be checking it out. Just like their previous games it has Native Linux support.</p>
<p>They said the plan for Early Access is for at least one year of extra development to include various extras like debug tools, an educational mode, fishing, a trading factory, additional functions to the programming and so on. You <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1724140/Craftomation_101_Programming__Craft/" target="_blank">can follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Puzzle game Sokobond Express releases February 22nd</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sokobond Express is a beautifully minimalist puzzle game that combines chemical bonds and puzzling pathfinding in novel ways. The developers say it's a bit of a mashup of the ideas from Sokobond and Cosmic Express.</p>
<p>Developed by Jose Hernandez, from Venezuela, this is their first commercial release. Based upon a free game called <a href="https://josehzz.itch.io/subatomic-wire" target="_blank">Subatomic Wire</a>, which was developed over six weeks and launched on itch.io. Draknek &amp; Friends noticed the game and "immediately loved its deep and perplexing mechanics as well as how it integrated Cosmic Express and the original Sokobond game in such an engaging and innovative way" and so decided to pick it up for publishing.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8RNkbEBczag"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2c4c87b8263a4e46dc7006f338cb2f22.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8RNkbEBczag" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>The minimalist mashup sequel to award-winning puzzle games Sokobond and Cosmic Express.</li>
<li>Ambient and relaxing soundtrack to provide zen-vibes while puzzle solving.</li>
<li>Created by up-and-coming puzzle designer Jose Hernandez, and published by renowned puzzle experts Draknek &amp; Friends (A Monster's Expedition, Bonfire Peaks).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you love puzzle games it looks like a rather nice one with Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 8-31 and 8-32 bring fixes for Helldivers 2, Dark and Darker, Agarest</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two new versions of GE-Proton have been released pulling in some extra fixes for various games for Steam Deck / Linux, so here's what's new and improved. Since there's so many different versions of Proton be sure to check <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">my beginner's guide</a> if you're confused. This is the community-maintained version, not affiliated with Valve.</p>
<p>For GE-Proton 8.31 the changes are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Proton:</p>
<ul>
<li>updated wine to latest bleeding edge, allows helldivers to run</li>
<li>updated vkd3d-proton to latest git</li>
<li>updated dxvk to latest git</li>
</ul>
<p>ULWGL:</p>
<ul>
<li>added fix for older games to properly set CWD (current working directory) if executable is not inside the wine prefix</li>
</ul>
<p>GStreamer:</p>
<ul>
<li>fixed this annoying ass unclosable wayland window from popping up when a game uses gstreamer:<br/>
<a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/803296011707744729gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/803296011707744729gol1.png"/></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Original upstream bugs + fix:<br/>
<a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/issues/2997" target="_blank">https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/issues/2997</a><br/>
<a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/merge_requests/5511" target="_blank">https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/merge_requests/5511</a><br/>
<a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/merge_requests/5509" target="_blank">https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/merge_requests/5509</a></p>
<p>Protonfixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>added fixes for Dark and Darker (thanks nmlynch94)</li>
<li>updated BDO fixes to work with standalone</li>
<li>updated yakuza 5 cutscenes fixes to work on non-steam versions</li>
</ul>
<p>General:</p>
<ul>
<li>cleaned up various no longer required patches (either upstreamed or already fixed)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In the above quoted changelog, they specifically meant the newly released <strong>Helldivers 2</strong>, not the original which already worked fine. You <em>don't</em> need GE-Proton for Helldivers 2 though as it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/proton-hotfix-updated-to-support-helldivers-2-on-steam-deck-linux/" target="_blank">works with Proton Hotfix</a>. And ULWGL refers to the new <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/unified-linux-wine-game-launcher-aims-to-improve-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Unified Linux Wine Game Launcher</a>.</p>
<p>And then the follow-up release GE-Proton 8-32:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HOTFIX:</p>
<ul>
<li>fix wine subcommands not working using ulwgl (winecfg, console, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>Protonfixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add video playback fixes for all Agarest games (Generations of War/Zero/2/Mariage)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you want to grab games from GOG on Linux and Steam Deck (or even macOS and Windows), there's some good news for you. The Heroic Games Launcher just released version 2.13 which brings with it their overhaul to GOG support.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4614937821707734100gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4614937821707734100gol1.jpg"/></a></p>

<li>Faster way of downloading and updating Linux native games.</li>
<li>Beta channels support for Windows and Mac builds (it's now possible to access Metro Exodus: Enhanced Edition).</li>
<li>Support for password-protected beta channels (potentially useful for game devs who want to try out GOG build in Heroic).</li>
<li>Version rollback for Windows and Mac builds.</li>
<li>Ability to view changelogs on the game page.</li>
<li>Ability to change game language at any point (Windows and Mac builds).</li>
<li>Ability to install and uninstall DLCs at any point (Windows and Mac builds).</li>
<li>REDMod integration for Cyberpunk 2077.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Other changes:</p>
<blockquote>

      <title>Proton Hotfix updated to support HELLDIVERS 2 on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>HELLDIVERS 2 is currently doing really well on Steam with a ton of players, and initially it was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/helldivers-2-is-out-heres-how-to-run-it-on-steam-deck-linux/" target="_blank">quite a nuisance to get working on Steam Deck / Desktop Linux</a>, but now it should run much better.</p>
<p>Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1756048372090499281" target="_blank">mentioned</a> on X (formerly Twitter), that Proton Hotfix was updated to work around the launch issues. So all you'll need to do now is go into the Properties -&gt; Compatibility, tick the box and select Proton Hotfix for HELLDIVERS 2 to get it working properly!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="A Proton Hotfix has just been deployed for a Helldivers 2 launch failure." src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1657120111707574512gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Nice to see once again Valve spring into action to improve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> to get popular games working! Especially interesting that it uses nProtect GameGuard, which is supposed to be Windows kernel-level, so it's surprising it works so easily on Linux systems now.</p>
<p>At time of writing HELLDIVERS 2 has 100,768 players online just on Steam, so it's clearly another big early hit for 2024. And it seems the most popular Sony PlayStation release on Steam so far.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

      <title>Check out Abalon Arena - bringing together turn-based tactics and strategic card play</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From D20Studios, who also made Abalon (formerly Summoners Fate), they're planning to release their next game with Abalon Arena. A fusion of turn-based tactics and strategic card play inspired by Dungeons and Dragons and Magic: The Gathering.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bETaHg8x3Cg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/396d9ade066e111ac9e8b386ba2fa55d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bETaHg8x3Cg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It has a rather long list of features, that should excite any fans of the genre with 20 heroes to choose from like a squirrel hurling druid, which sounds hilarious. Who also wouldn't want to try playing as a psychic lizard wizard? There's also over 400 cards to build up your dream team with.</p>
<p>This isn't just a single-player experience though. While it has a fully featured solo-play system, with a challenging AI, it also has full online play with PvP ranked matches, 2v2 ranked battles, a casual mode, instant replay for showing off, support for asynchronous turn-based multiplayer for those who don't have a lot of time and normal turn-based multiplayer with matches that should only last around 7 minutes. Sounds like a little something for everyone who enjoys turn-based action and deck-building.</p>
<p>There's a demo available with Native Linux <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2352400/Abalon_Arena/" target="_blank">support on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Noir-influenced detective RPG &#39;Pixel Noir&#39; is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Noir-influenced detective mystery RPG? Sounds thoroughly interesting! Pixel Noir has now left Early Access.</p>
<p>Another that was funded on Kickstarter where the developer pulled in $61,212 back in 2015. It took a while to get here, and sadly they lost one of their artists, Shane Stevens, to cancer back in 2020 so this was the last project Stevens worked on which Dave Gilbert of Wadjet Eye Games <a href="https://twitter.com/WadjetEyeGames/status/1755625855882023291" target="_blank">mentioned</a> on X (formerly Twitter).</p>
<p>More about the game: Pixel Noir is a hard-boiled detective RPG set inside a sprawling metropolis, where gangs roam free and coffee cures all. Uncover the truth--recover your sanity as you unravel Pinnacle City’s darkest secrets.</p>
<p>Something happened that night in the hospital, something that cost you your career as a police detective, your sanity, and the life of your partner. Ten years later, you have a chance to set things right. Are the hallucinations that haunt you a clue to what happened that fateful night?</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Uko0zgpbTwk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2ed568967a791ad08ceaa214bc67111a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Uko0zgpbTwk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Solve mysteries as Pinnacle City’s cheapest Private Eye! From missing pets to murder investigations, your detective skills will earn you either fortune or face punches.</li>
<li>Explore Pinnacle City, a wretched hive of scum and villainy, littered with black market trade, grifters, and players of all kinds.</li>
<li>Fight enemies in turn-based combat and unleash devastating combo attacks by teaming up with others in your entourage!</li>
<li>Tune up your gear! Upgrade weapons with modifications to fit your play style.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified!</p>

      <title>I&#39;m terrible at Poker but a deck-building poker roguelike? Balatro has me hooked</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Balatro is releasing on February 20th and if you love card games and deck-builders, you're probably going to need to check this one out. It also has a demo available for Steam Next Fest 2024.</p>
<p>A Poker-inspired roguelike, because while the basics are Poker, you do get plenty of tricks up your sleeve to win big with various special cards. It's weirdly hooked its teeth right into me and the demo thankfully plays just fine on Linux with Proton 8. Absolutely no issues found in my time trying out the demo.</p>

<p>Like any good deck-builder it has special cards, and a card shop to keep changing your deck. What really makes it interesting are the Joker cards, there's 150 of them, each with their own special ability to change how your run goes and you can have multiple of them equipped at once. Like Odd Todd above, which gives me +30 chips for odd ranked cards when played.</p>
<p>There's a lot more to it like special Tarot cards, which can enhanced and change your current cards if you're trying to get a particular hand. These cards, along with the Jokers, can really end up massively changing how your run goes and can suddenly dump a whole lot of chips your way.</p>
<p>Now, this is not Traditional Poker by any sense. It has the basics of it, and you play your hands like it's a Poker game as you aim for a Full House, a Flush and so on but rather than playing other players or bots, you're trying to beat the Blind with the score required getting ever-higher so you need to work on those synergies from your hand with your other special cards to score big.</p>

      <title>Swordhaven: Iron Conspiracy is a party-based RPG from the ATOM RPG team</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AtomTeam are moving on from their Fallout and Wasteland inspired titles ATOM RPG and ATOM RPG Trudograd, onto their next game they just announced with Swordhaven: Iron Conspiracy.</p>
<p>They're channelling a bit of Baldur's Gate here, so perhaps if you're eager for more this might be worth keeping an eye on. In fact, they even say it's directly inspired by the likes of Baldur’s Gate 1, Icewind Dale and other classics.</p>
<p>"You take up the mantle of a lonely adventurer on their way to the barely explored land of Nova Drakonia. During your voyage, you are met by a dying man who trusts you with a peculiar artefact that will involve you in an adventure of a lifetime, and a plot that threatens everything you’ve ever known and loved."</p>
<p>There's no trailer yet as it's still in development but we do have some early shots of it (click them to see bigger):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3067006231707475275gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3067006231707475275gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13411789171707475277gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13411789171707475277gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11638438361707475277gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11638438361707475277gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7763206201707475278gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7763206201707475278gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the planned features include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A flexible combat engine. Experience battle as a tactician in turn-based combat, or hasten the pace with the real-time with pause (RTwP) mode.</li>
<li>A classless roleplaying system: each stat combination provides a unique gaming experience, distinctive dialogues, and novel ways to solve quests.</li>
<li>A classics-inspired yet modern User Interface with large customization possibilities.</li>
<li>A vast, nonlinear world filled with unique NPCs and multi-solution quests that reward exploration, always offering alternative approaches to satisfy any character build.</li>
<li>Dozens of hours of exploration, from quiet village hamlets to hidden temples of the ancients, horrid crypts, bizarre dungeons, and otherworldly locales…</li>
</ul>

      <title>Humble Bundle raised $14 million for charity in 2023 - over $250 million overall</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Bundle</a> announced some new numbers recently, and it's quite impressive to see how much they're actually doing for various charities thanks to all their bundles.</p>
<p>Starting off from very simple beginnings back in 2010 from the crew at Wolfire Games, then being spun into its own company and eventually being acquired by Ziff Davis through IGN it's been through a lot of changes. Initially just running the Humble Indie Bundles, giving various cross-platform games all DRM free — they've since expanded rather a lot with a full store (although it's largely keys for other stores). They also now bundle up basically everything including games, software, music kits, assets for game developers, ebooks and more.</p>
<p>Their new report highlights that through 2023 they managed to raise over $14.4 million USD for over 7,500 charities, thanks to everyone buying from them. This includes the likes of <a href="https://www.preventcancer.org" target="_blank">The Prevent Cancer Foundation</a>, <a href="https://www.charitywater.org" target="_blank">charity: water</a>, <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org" target="_blank">The Trevor Project</a>, <a href="https://www.specialeffect.org.uk" target="_blank">SpecialEffect</a> and many other great causes. Overall they've now raised over $250 million for charities.</p>

      <title>You&#39;re going to need to take mining-shooter BORE BLASTERS away from me</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>BORE BLASTERS is a mining-shooter from Scottish studio 8BitSkull, the same developer that also made Void Scrappers and Fates of Ort, two other games I also quite liked. It seems they're onto something again here!</p>
<p>This could easily end up replacing all those horde survival games I've been playing like Vampire Survivors, Brotato and all the others. It gives a similar sort-of feeling with repeated runs, as you gather upgrades and watch lots of numbers go up but in a rather different setting. Here you're given a gyrocopter with a machine-gun drill to mine underground across various random islands, many with different biomes and creatures and special item blocks to blast through. It's simply delicious and with full Native Linux and Steam Deck support — you need to try it out.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HH-QHeuJBj0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/13997febf9ae7d2488363f0878e09bcb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HH-QHeuJBj0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I like that it's not particularly punishing either. While the fuel mechanic may need some tweaks, if you fail a run you at least get to keep your rewards to continue unlocking more permanent upgrades to just dive in and try some more mining. Nice and accessible.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fast-paced mining action</strong> - Mining has never been so intense and rewarding; the satisfaction of blasting through the depths would make any dwarf grin with delight.</li>
<li><strong>Bite-sized runs</strong> - Runs can be over quickly or last longer, if you’re able to survive. Play for a few minutes or up to 10-15 if you’re an experienced player.</li>
<li><strong>Un-punishing progress</strong> - If you fail a run or need to cancel early for whatever reason, you keep your rewards and resources to spend on upgrades and abilities.</li>
<li><strong>Unlockable characters</strong> - Dive into the narrative of this dwarven steampunk world to complete quests and unlock playable characters with new and unique abilities.</li>
<li><strong>Upgrade your gyrocopter</strong> - Visit the Techsmith and spend your earnings on permanent upgrades to make mining faster, safer, and more satisfying, or discover temporary upgrades buried in the mines to help you out in a pinch.</li>
<li><strong>Endless replayability</strong> - No two runs will be the same, a diverse range of biomes and procedurally generated mineshafts mean you’ll never know what’s ahead.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Try out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2398170/BORE_BLASTERS/" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a> as part of Steam Next Fest.</p>

      <title>Linux gaming performance display MangoHud v0.7.1 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>MangoHud is the fantastic tool you can use to display various amounts of performance information while gaming on Linux, it's also what the Steam Deck uses for the HUD too. A new version 0.7.1 is out now!</p>
<p>For reference, it can look a little like this at the top:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8778636231707412724gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8778636231707412724gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>If you like my horizontal layout you can find it on my <a href="https://gist.github.com/LiamDawe/199a3341f0d91d2f306375a76ab4e7f3" target="_blank">GitHub Gist</a>, just copy it into a text file and name it "MangoHud.conf" and place it into "~/.config/MangoHud/".</p>
<p>In the new release these parameters have been changed:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">gamepad_battery</code> has been reworked to <code class="inline-code">device_battery</code>. This parameter currently supports the values <code class="inline-code">gamepad</code> and <code class="inline-code">mouse</code>.</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">time</code> now has a title.</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">fps_metrics</code> takes a decimal value or "avg". e.g <code class="inline-code">avg,0.001</code> and displays the metrics.</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">winesync</code> shows the current implementation of synchronization primitives. E.g ESYNC/FSYNC etc.</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">present_mode</code> shows the current Vulkan present mode or vsync status in OpenGL.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other changes and fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for gpu load on Adreno GPUs.</li>
<li>Added cpu temp for zenpower3 module.</li>
<li>Meson option: mangoplot.</li>
<li>xnvctrl: fix an issue that could cause crashing when accessing GPU fan speed.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where no config present wouldn't use default mangohud presets.</li>
<li>Fixed a crashing issue with CS2.</li>
<li>Reworked intel code. Should resolve some issues where mangohud didn't shut down properly when using an Intel GPU.</li>
<li>Fix OpenGL runtime on musl libc systems <a href="https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud/pull/1133" target="_blank">#1133</a>.</li>
<li>Fixed <code class="inline-code">text_outline_color</code> incorrectly using BGR instead of RGB.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Heroes of Might and Magic II game engine fheroes2 v1.0.12 released</title>
      <author>fheroes2</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dear fans of Heroes of Might and Magic 2 and fheroes2 project supporters! The team is excited to announce a new version of the <em><strong>fheroes2</strong></em> project - <strong><a href="https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2/releases/tag/1.0.12" target="_blank">1.0.12</a></strong> as the first update of this year! The team have made many changes in several aspects of the engine since the last release, and we are happy to share the details with you.</p>
<p>One of the biggest areas where the team has made huge improvements is the <em><strong>AI</strong></em>.</p>
<p>First of all, we have made important adjustments to the AI's performance according to the difficulty level. This is especially noticeable on Easy and Normal difficulties, and this will help players who are struggling with these difficulty levels.</p>
<p>Secondly, the behaviour of the AI heroes has been updated for several Adventure Map objects: for most objects the information available to the AI is now much more fair. Additionally, the AI will now expand its territory much more efficiently.</p>
<p>Lastly, the team made significant improvements concerning the AI's defensive battle tactics and surrender logic. The AI will apply more sophisticated tactics during battles, increasing the challenge for players. Also, now the AI will decide between surrendering or retreating from battles, just like human players do.</p>
<p>All of these changes will make the AI a more formidable opponent for many players.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1390172451707405646gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1390172451707405646gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>The second biggest area of progress is of course the <em><strong>Editor</strong></em>. The team has finished adding all of the objects present within the game into the Editor. We have also updated the new map format to accommodate for future changes and to expand it with new features. Most of the work is now done, but there are several tasks remaining before releasing the brand-new reworked Editor to players and map makers. The fheroes2 Editor is being built with the aim to be much more accessible and easier to work with compared to the original Editor.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12204111821707405667gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12204111821707405667gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>On top of this, the team spent time polishing multiple <em><strong>UI dialogs</strong></em>, improving <em><strong>performance </strong></em>of image and resource loading, fixing <em><strong>logic issues</strong></em> of Adventure Map objects, and updating several <em><strong>translations</strong></em>. In total, more than <strong>50</strong> issues have been fixed in this release.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your invaluable support, and we hope you will enjoy this release!</p>

      <title>Driving survival game Pacific Drive is very cool - here&#39;s the fix for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pacific Drive is a first-person driving-survival game with a demo now available, it's really interesting and nice to see something different but for Steam Deck and Desktop Linux it needs a fix to get working.</p>
<p>More about the game: "Pacific Drive is a first-person driving survival game with your car as your only companion. Navigate a surreal reimagining of the Pacific Northwest, and face supernatural dangers as you venture into the Olympic Exclusion Zone. Each excursion into the wilderness brings unique and strange challenges as you restore and upgrade your car from an abandoned garage that acts as your home base. Gather precious resources and investigate what’s been left behind in the Zone; unravel a long-forgotten mystery while learning exactly what it takes to survive in this unpredictable, hostile environment."</p>
<p>When you try to launch it will give you an error about Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime, but it's easy to install using Protontricks. The method is the same across Steam Deck and Desktop Linux.</p>
<p>For Steam Deck, make sure you're in Desktop Mode. Steam Button -&gt; Power - Switch to Desktop.</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Steam Deck</u> / <u>KDE Plasma</u> - Open the Discover store, in the search box (top left) type in "Protontricks", click it and hit Install (top right). </li>
<li><u>Manual install</u> / <u>GNOME</u> - available via <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/com.github.Matoking.protontricks" target="_blank">Flathub</a>. On GNOME desktops, you can also download via GNOME Software.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then go through these steps once you've loaded it. First, select the game in the list:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11546786881707402762gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11546786881707402762gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>In the next menu just select the default:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1087961421707402796gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1087961421707402796gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>After that select to install a Windows DLL or component:</p>

<p>Then finally on the next screen scroll down to vcrun2019 or vcrun2022 (either should work fine):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5325736261707402893gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5325736261707402893gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It will bring up an extra installer window for vcrun, just go through it and once finished you can close it all and then the game will run just fine.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1458140/Pacific_Drive/" target="_blank">Pacific Drive on Steam</a>. The demo is well-worth a go and the full game launches February 22nd, and apart from the above issue the demo works really well with the current stable Proton 8.</p>

      <title>HELLDIVERS 2 is out - here&#39;s how to run it on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>HELLDIVERS 2 from Arrowhead Game Studios and PlayStation PC has arrived, and it's causing issues for players on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux. Here's some ways you may be able to get it to work.</p>
<p>What's the issue? It's using kernel-level nProtect GameGuard anti-cheat, which seems to be the cause of the problems. It's also causing issues for people on Windows too it seems going by some of the Steam forum posts on it. The developer has even had to put up a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/553850/discussions/2/4206994023681287288/" target="_blank">statement</a> on it and open a dedicated Steam forum for it.</p>
<p>On my Desktop Linux install with Kubuntu 23.10, it actually <em>worked</em> right out of the box with Proton 8.0-5. However, others have been reporting issues with it not launching. While on Steam Deck (current latest Preview), my testing there showed it simply <em>wouldn't</em> launch with Proton 8, Proton 7 or Proton Experimental.</p>
<p>Going by the Proton <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/7486" target="_blank">GitHub report</a> that's open for it, a user <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/7486#issuecomment-1933869055" target="_blank">mentioned</a> they got it to work on their Desktop Linux install with GE-Proton 7-55. So, even though for my desktop it works on Proton 8, trying out GE-Proton 7-55 on Steam Deck and — yep, it works!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10950898721707399746gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The big <u>caveat</u>: you <em>need</em> to launch it with this GE-Proton 7-55 in <u>Desktop Mode</u>, something about nProtect GameGuard doesn't run in Gaming Mode. You also need to tap the screen to get controls on Steam Deck to actually work.</p>
<p>So regardless of being on Desktop Linux or Steam Deck, if you try out GE-Proton 7-55 you <em>should</em> be able to get in-game.</p>
<p><em>I have not tested online play with a group yet, only solo play.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p>How to install GE-Proton:</p>
<p><strong>Download ProtonUp-Qt</strong></p>
<p>For Steam Deck, make sure you're in Desktop Mode. Steam Button -&gt; Power - Switch to Desktop.</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Steam Deck</u> / <u>KDE Plasma</u> - Open the Discover store, in the search box (top left) type in "ProtonUp-Qt", click it and hit Install (top right). Alternatively on Steam Deck if you have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/decky-loader-makes-steam-deck-plugins-even-easier-with-new-installer/" target="_blank">Decky Loader</a>, you can also try the "Wine Cellar" plugin.</li>
<li><u>Manual install</u> / <u>GNOME</u> - head to the <a href="https://davidotek.github.io/protonup-qt/" target="_blank">official website</a>, scroll down and pick your favourite download option either AppImage or <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/net.davidotek.pupgui2" target="_blank">Flathub</a>. On GNOME desktops, you can also download via GNOME Software.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Using ProtonUp-Qt:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Launch ProtonUp-Qt.</li>
<li>Make sure it's set to Steam at the top, click Add version and scroll down to select to install GE-Proton7-55.</li>
<li>Reload Steam to update the compatibility layer list.</li>
<li>In Steam:
<ul>
<li><u>Desktop</u>: right click a game and go to Properties.</li>
<li><u>Steam Deck</u> / <u>Big Picture Mode</u>: find the game in your library, go to the little cog on the right and then select Properties.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Compatibility menu -&gt; Tick the box, select GE-Proton from the drop-down menu.</li>
</ul>
<p>My original video of how to do it on Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6doaQNnHR60"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/37b4fc871ab3188f385a1c60a2e0949c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6doaQNnHR60" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<hr/>
<p>Given how much effort it is to get working, and with absolutely no guarantee it will continue working due to this kernel-level anti-cheat that could update and break it any time (as really, it shouldn't work at all), it's <strong>not</strong> something I will actually recommend anyone purchase. I would consider going for a different game for sure.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental gets improvements for The Finals, TEKKEN 8, Black Desert Online</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a new update to Proton Experimental for Steam Deck and Desktop Linux, bringing in some fixes for various games. Here's what you need to know. There's a few different versions of Proton so if you're confused check the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton beginner's guide</a>.</p>
<p>First of all, Valve are noting that <strong>Black Desert Online</strong> (although now it's just called <strong>Black Desert</strong>) is now playable as of this release.</p>
<p>On top of that both <strong>The Finals</strong> and <strong>TEKKEN 8</strong> have some fixes that were previously <em>only</em> available via Proton Hotfix, so they're now in Proton Experimental too.</p>
<p>A few Proton Experimental regressions were also fixed including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Space Enginners</strong> is again able to connect to a server.</li>
<li><strong>Diablo IV</strong> no longer has window focus issues after opening a browser on a Steam Deck.</li>
<li><strong>Disgaea 5</strong> no longer crashes during intro cinematic if MovieType was set to 2.</li>
<li><strong>Resident Evil 2</strong> no longer behaves weirdly when the window dragged around in windowed mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this release Valve also improved support for input devices with 8+ axes.</p>
<p>There's also an improvement in compatibility noted for <strong>OpenComposite</strong>, something I hadn't heard of before but the <a href="https://gitlab.com/znixian/OpenOVR" target="_blank">project page</a> describes it as: "OpenComposite OpenXR (previously known as OpenOVR - OpenVR for OculusVR - but renamed due to confusion with OpenVR) is an implementation of SteamVR's API - OpenVR, forwarding calls directly to the OpenXR runtime. Think of it as a backwards version of ReVive, for the OpenXR compatible headsets."</p>
<p>Full changelog for Proton can <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">seen on GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Beta now lets you actually close controller info panels with controllers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A bit of an oversight in the Steam Client is that their newer Controller info panels that appear before a game launches couldn't be dismissed with a controller - but now they can. </p>
<p>Valve updated both Steam Desktop and Steam Deck with the new Beta, but to be clear, you could always dismiss panels on the Steam Deck (Gaming Mode) and Big Picture Mode - this is mainly for Steam Desktop (and when in Desktop Mode on Steam Deck). Specifically, panels like this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/842988271707327220gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/842988271707327220gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Kick back! Huh? When you plugged a controller in, you still needed to wrestle your mouse to click okay. But not any more. It can now be dismissed properly via controller. <em>The above screen was added back in the stable <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/valve-gives-steam-a-nice-upgrade-for-controller-friendly-games/" target="_blank">November 2023 update</a>.</em></p>
<p>Main Steam Client Beta (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053/view/4047116236901935091" target="_blank">changelog</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed double notifications when friends go online or in-game</li>
<li>Fixed collapse state of friends list and chat group sections not being properly remembered.</li>
</ul>
<p>Big Picture Mode</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issues with popup menus and other popup dialogs</li>
</ul>
<p>Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Controllers can be used to dismiss/continue when controller support information panels appear before a game's launch.</li>
<li>Fix for Gyro enable button not being respected.</li>
<li>QoL Gyro Calibration button available in Controller Config Quick settings, and in the Gyro section of the Controller Layout Editor.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a fresh problem though that's been around for a few weeks in the Steam Beta on Linux, where Big Picture Mode just doesn't seem to actually grab controller input for some people. It was <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/10406" target="_blank">reported on GitHub</a>, and testing today with my Xbox controller only the Xbox button works - no other button does. So BPM is a bit broken right now. Hopefully Valve will fix that soon.</p>
<p>Steam Deck got an extra fix for some broken pop-up menus like in the game Properties menu (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4064004735504576851" target="_blank">changelog</a>):</p>

      <title>Crusader Kings III is about to get a lot of extra exciting content</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox Interactive have announced Chapter III of Crusader Kings III, a set of expansions that will bring in some rather exciting sounding additions to the popular grand strategy game.</p>
<p>Chapter III comes in the form of a cosmetic pack, two main expansions and an event pack that will be released across 2024. The first part, Couture of the Capets, is available <em>now</em> that adds in new fashions and styles inspired by French royal culture in the High Middle Ages (13th century).</p>
<p>What else is coming:</p>
<ul>
<li>Legends of the Dead - Turn yourself into a figure of legend in this Core Expansion, where great feats and effective propaganda can enhance the power of your bloodline through the centuries. Direct the course of your dynastic legend through Court Chroniclers, and use your growing reputation to build a lasting material legacy. But beware of the growing threat from distant lands as the Black Death builds a legendary legacy of its own. This will be arriving on March 4th.</li>
</ul>
<p>Trailer for the expansion is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vWUlPnbXUW4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/afa33680c44dc2fb3b9b733cad77d547.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vWUlPnbXUW4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>And more…</p>
<ul>
<li>Roads to Power - The majesty of the Byzantine Empire takes center stage in this Major Expansion. Rule from Constantinople through a new Administrative Government form and experience various Byzantine-themed events and flavors. Or, be truly daring and live a life where your noble reputation is not tied to the land, roaming the map as an adventurer for hire. </li>
<li>Wandering Nobles - Building on the travel system introduced with Tours &amp; Tournaments, this event pack introduces a new Travel Lifestyle and new ways and reasons to travel - incidents and stories related to roaming far from the safety of your court.</li>
</ul>
<p>“It’s very exciting to be able to talk about our plans for 2024,” says Crusader Kings III Game Director Alex Oltner. “We’ve been working hard on trying to find ways to introduce major historical content like the Black Death and the Byzantine Empire’s distinct form of government into CKIII, and we know that our fans have been wanting these as well. Chapter III promises to be one of the biggest phases in the game’s history.”</p>
<p>Looks like you can't buy them individually, as they're all bundled together as Chapter III. It's going to cost you a bit too with it set at $43.98 / £38.48 / €43.98 for the full bundle.</p>
<p>You can buy Crusader Kings III from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/crusader-kings-iii?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158310/Crusader_Kings_III/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

<p>See more on the <a href="https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>. But you do need to buy a copy of Diablo to run the full game with it - which you can <a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/diablo?as=1636858786" target="_blank">purchase from GOG.com</a>. For Linux you can install the game engine via <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/org.diasurgical.DevilutionX" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.</p>
<p>Is it now the best way to play the original Diablo? Let me know what you think in the comments.</p>

      <title>Arms Race returns to Counter-Strike 2, custom sticker placement, Zeus skin and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve finally put out a big update to Counter-Strike 2, bringing with it a much needed boost with a new game mode, new types of skins and more.</p>
<p>Arms Race has officially returned! The quick-fire mode where you get two kills to progress onto a new weapon, or steal opponents progress with a knife kill (and now the Zeus too) and eventually get to the final knife to get that winning kill. Good fun so it's nice to see it back.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5637588211707312048gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5637588211707312048gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - CS2 Arms Race on Linux</em></p>
<p>On top of that there's a new weapon sticker system, allowing you to place stickers by dragging and dropping them around the weapon to get your perfect placement. Plus you can add up to five stickers to a weapon now too.</p>
<p>There's more. The first CS2 case has arrived, The Kilowatt Case, adding 17 community-designed weapon finishes and the all-new Kukri knife. No dobut that knife will excite a lot of CS2 fans! Heck, even the Zeus now has its first weapon finish, something players have been begging for. Additionally the Zeus now recharges in 30 seconds in all game modes.</p>
<p>What else? Oh there's a new Ambush Sticker Capsule (featuring 21 community-created stickers), the NIGHTMODE Music Kit Box (featuring six new Music Kits), an XP Overload icon next to player names if they have earned all their normal weekly XP and Agents with unique end-of-match animations now do their thing during victory and defeat.</p>
<p>According to developer Timothee "TTimo" Besset on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@TTimo/111890512855786311" target="_blank">Mastodon</a> "the update also ships with continued performance improvements to the vulkan render path", so that's great too!</p>
<p>See all on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/armsrace" target="_blank">special update page</a>.</p>
<p>What do you think to this update? Let me know in the comments! Personally, I'm looking forward to the next-generation Danger Zone, I really hope they bring it back. With all the updates to the base game of CS2, they could do a lot more with Danger Zone now.</p>

      <title>Half-Life remake Black Mesa hits over 100,000 Steam reviews to Overwhelmingly Positive</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Quite an impressive milestone for an incredible game overall! The Half-Life remake Black Mesa has managed to cross over 100,000 user reviews on Steam. It's rated Overwhelmingly Positive thanks to everyone leaving their thoughts. And going by the <a href="https://steam250.com/top250" target="_blank">Steam Top 250</a> list it's currently number 155 of the most highly rated games on Steam ever.</p>
<p>Not exactly surprising though, given how loved Half-Life is and Black Mesa is a pretty incredible remake all-around with some fantastic attention to detail.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5885837401707309954gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5885837401707309954gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Black Mesa is rated Steam Deck Playable, and it has a Native Linux version - but you're better off using Proton as it's been left with numerous bugs.</p>
<p>Would you say people first starting off in Half-Life should jump into Black Mesa? Or are you a die-hard for the actual original which recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/half-life-25th-anniversary-update-brings-half-life-uplink-steam-deck-support/" target="_blank">had its own big 25th Anniversary Update</a>? I'm still amazed Valve actually allowed Crowbar Collective to do a remake like this.</p>

      <title>Open source simulation game OpenTTD has a big new v14 update coming </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>OpenTTD, an open source simulation games based on Transport Tycoon Deluxe is getting close to a big new release, with version 14 bringing many new features and improvements. <em>The second Beta was released on February 4th.</em></p>
<p>While it was originally based on Transport Tycoon Deluxe and retains the familiar feel of the classics, it's very much expanded into its own game. It's also entirely standalone, so you don't need anything extra to play it. Just grab OpenTTD and away you go.</p>

      <title>From Glory To Goo is a new base-building RTS where you defend against gooey aliens</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From Glory To Goo is a new upcoming real-time strategy game from Stratagem Blue that has me a little excited, and so far the demo seems to work quite well on Linux. Specifically, you'll need <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/ge-proton-8-29-and-ge-proton-8-30-released-with-eac-fix-and-tekken-8-fix/" target="_blank">GE-Proton</a>, because otherwise the tutorial videos don't work.</p>
<p>I'm a huge sucker for these types of RTS games! You start off on a random world with nothing but your starting building that drops down from space, and then continue to expand across the map for resources. Eventually waves of little Goo enemies will appear, so you have to encase your base in walls and turrets to keep them at bay, while you build up an army to take the fight to the Goo directly.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OlMu4XIrGJ0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e7cc5a2583eb94ec397bb1de5c31dc26.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OlMu4XIrGJ0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While the UI could use a little work, the basics are all there and it seems like a great idea.</p>
<p>As you expand across the map you can find wreckage from previous planetary expeditions, native Aliens you can ally with or destroy and various other secrets. Not only that but there's plenty of feature additions outside of just the planetary building an exploration. There's an upgrade system where you need to send resources back up to your colony ship to eventually unlock more to build, there's different captains to pick with various buffs, multiple factions to choose with different units and buildings and more.</p>
<p>Definitely worth keeping an eye on and trying out the demo, which the developer keeps improving based on feedback from various players.</p>
<p><em>The developer plans to launch into Early Access sometime early this year.</em></p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2607060/From_Glory_To_Goo/" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>World War Z disables Vulkan on Steam Deck (but you can get it back)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Saber Interactive have updated the co-op zombie shooter World War Z, and now they've disabled being able to pick the Vulkan API on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>It seems some users were reporting crashing issues with the game, as noted on the Steam <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/699130/discussions/0/4032476411664147690/" target="_blank">forum post</a>. A user emailed into GamingOnLinux to note they noticed that just recently after this forum post that now they can no longer pick Vulkan. And after contacting Saber Interactive support they said it was "disabled to improve the stability of the game".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4518233931707221235gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4518233931707221235gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>So somewhere along the lines either an update to the game, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> or the Mesa graphics drivers introduced issues for the game. For now out of the box, Vulkan just can't be picked on Steam Deck. This also means you <em>can't</em> use the in-game FSR 2.2 either, because it's only available with Vulkan in World War Z. Well, until you <em>disable</em> the Steam Deck check that is. Like you <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/skyrim-special-edition-updated-with-steam-deck-support-ultrawide-res-bug-fixes/" target="_blank">can do with Skyrim</a>, you can set this launch option in the game Properties to get it all back:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">SteamDeck=0 %command%</code></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15877342631707222009gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15877342631707222009gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>As for some people, it seems Vulkan <em>is</em> actually more stable.</p>
<p>This change only affects Steam Deck. Testing it myself on Desktop Linux and you can still pick Vulkan normally with the default being DirectX 11.</p>
<p>World War Z is available from:</p>

      <title>Apple&#39;s 2014 Game of the Year puzzler Threes! now on Steam with Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another great game to add to your collection is here with Threes!, originally a mobile game now upgraded an enhanced for the PC and it's available now on Steam.</p>
<p>This was Apple's 2014 Game of the Year, and it won a Apple Design Award too. It was quite a big thing back when it released. It was so popular in fact, that like a lot of mobile games, there was a bit of Attack of the Clones that went on. The developers even wrote their own <a href="https://asherv.com/threes/threemails/#letter" target="_blank">blog post</a> to address it. If you've heard of 2048 — it cloned this. This is the <em>original</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20910090771707219956gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20910090771707219956gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's a number swiping game that just keeps on going, as you move number blocks around you try to make multiples of three (see what they did there?). It just gets bigger and bigger, a game for calming the mind and you can spend as much or as little time with it as you want. No timers or any nonsense.</p>
<p>Coming with full Steam Deck support too which the developer <a href="https://twitter.com/AsherVo/status/1752782105678070101" target="_blank">mentioned</a> on X (formerly Twitter):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="Whew, Threes for Steam is DONE!  It's got: + Full Controller/Keyboard Support + Full Steam Deck Compatibility + Cloud Saving + Achievements + New Night Mode Music" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15964431231707219571gol1.png"/></p>
<p>So we can expect it to run great on desktop Linux too with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1818570/Threes/" target="_blank">out on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Proton Hotfix gets Persona 3 Reload performance improvements for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you find the performance of Persona 3 Reload to be a little lacking, perhaps try out the latest Proton Hotfix update that Valve just released. For Steam Deck players, you may also want to be on the Preview update branch which also <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/steam-deck-steamos-3514-preview-persona-3-reload-improvements-and-more/" target="_blank">recently had a performance fix too</a>.</p>
<p>Valve's Pierre-Loup Griffais <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1754673249399767359" target="_blank">posted</a> on X (formerly Twitter):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19706842071707218690gol1.png"/></p>

      <title>Life by You the Sims-like from Paradox delayed until June</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Life by You from Paradox Tectonic / Paradox Interactive has suffered a fresh delay and will now not hit Early Access until June. Originally planned to launch in September last year, it moved to March this year and now moved again to June 4th.</p>
<p>What actually is it: very much a The Sims like game but designed for a fully open-world and highly moddable. The full open-world with no loading screens and real-language conversations set it quite apart from EA's long-running series.</p>
<p>Paradox Tectonic's General Manager, Rod Humble, announced it in a video below</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QQLu09M_YGY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b2dfb6dc5eda42e56960b46d1e086a8a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QQLu09M_YGY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can see their previous Let's Play below for an early look:</p>

<p>Like a lot of recent Paradox games, it will only be officially available for Windows. Hopefully it will run nicely with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> so we can get some Life by You on Linux / Steam Deck without too much fuss. Although since it will be Early Access, rough edges are to be expected.</p>
<p>Will it dethrone The Sims 4 though? It still sees regular content updates and on Steam it sees well over 40,000 players peak each day but I'm sure plenty of The Sims fans will be checking it out eager for something different.</p>
<p>Is it something you'll be trying?</p>

      <title>The new Skate from EA will be coming to Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The next-generation Skate is now confirmed to getting a PC release on Steam, so thankfully you won't have to deal with the EA App directly. It was already <a href="https://twitter.com/skate/status/1430938091834023941" target="_blank">confirmed</a> some time ago to be coming to PC (a first for the series), but confirmation that it will be on Steam means it should be nice and smooth to get running on Desktop Linux and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>News about it coming to Steam though only appeared recently in the below video from December 21st, which it seems went largely unnoticed until recently when the team also <a href="https://twitter.com/skate/status/1753116400061682070" target="_blank">posted</a> about it on X (formerly Twitter) to confirm it there as well with a clip from the longer video.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="iXdQp0fmhCE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/37cde28076dd2e2bbe22ef459dbd42fe.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/iXdQp0fmhCE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Also announced in the video is that it will have cross-platform and cross-progression play, good news for players (or if you have friends) across multiple platforms.</p>
<p>Technically Skate 4, it's just going to be called <em>Skate</em>. (the dot is included). It will be free to play at release, so I'll likely give it a go and report back on what compatibility to expect for Linux / Steam Deck.</p>
<p>We do have a few skating games on PC nowadays including Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2, Session: Skate Sim, Skater XL but no doubt many will be looking forward to <em>skate</em>.</p>

      <title>NonSteamLaunchers for Steam Deck expands automatic game shortcuts for more stores</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NonSteamLaunchers is a project to help you easily install various external launchers / game stores on Steam Deck like EA App, Battle.net, Amazon, GOG Galaxy, Ubisoft and more. Recent releases have much improved automatic shortcut creation in your Steam Library.</p>
<p>It can be a bit of a nuisance to set up all these extra stores, and remembering what games you actually have available so NonSteamLaunchers can make it all just that little bit easier.</p>
<p>The feature first <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/nonsteamlaunchers-for-other-stores-on-steam-deck-adds-automatic-game-shortcuts/" target="_blank">introduced in January</a>, NonSteamLaunchers now has a scanning system to automatically add game shortcuts into your Steam Library from all these launchers. Initially quite limited, the last few releases have expanded what launchers / stores it's able to do it for. As of version 3.8 released a couple of days ago it can now scan and add shortcuts for Epic Games, Ubisoft Connect, EA App, Gog Galaxy, Battle.net and Amazon Games.</p>

      <title>Super Pocket Taito Edition Review - Licensed Linux Retro-gaming on a Budget</title>
      <author>Pengling</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Blaze Entertainment's latest Evercade-compatible device makes for an excellent entry to licensed emulation on Linux. <em><strong>NOTE:</strong> Personal purchase.</em></p>
<p>Originally launched in 2020, the <a href="https://evercade.co.uk/" target="_blank">Evercade</a> line is seemingly not often mentioned in Linux-gaming circles, even though the consoles are Linux-based - I find this curious, since in my experience Linux gamers generally tend to be supportive of projects that make use of our software of choice. With a focus on (usually multi-game) cartridge releases instead of digital ones, specifically covering retro and retro-style titles, the platform has seen steady support over the last few years, and now has a sister-brand called <a href="https://www.hypermegatech.com/" target="_blank">Hyper Mega Tech!</a>. This new offshoot offers a line of lower-priced Evercade-compatible handhelds that contain a selection of officially-licensed pre-loaded games, under the name of Super Pocket. I discovered these devices whilst perusing videos about interesting and unusual handhelds recently, and when I saw that they're Evercade-compatible I was intrigued - and, of course, I ended up getting one. I couldn't resist - I might just have an addiction to portables...</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9589767191707132506gol12971.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9589767191707132506gol12971.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>The iconic Space Invaders monster looms forth!</em></p>
<p>At the time of writing there are two versions of the Super Pocket - the Capcom Edition (containing 12 games) and the Taito Edition (containing 18). Though both versions of the Super Pocket offer excellent game-collections, for me the Taito one has more titles overall that are my sort of thing - and the fact that it includes both Bubble Bobble and The NewZealand Story on the same device is a <em>big</em> selling-point for me. Reason being, for Brits who grew up during the 1980s and 1990s home-microcomputer boom, these two Taito titles occupy the same cultural-space that Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros. 3 do for gamers in North America and Japan, except they were available on just about every system going. With the exception of Space Invaders '91, the included titles are all the original arcade versions, not any of the later home-console conversions that so often appear in licensed collections like this, which is really nice to see!</p>
<p>The Taito handheld includes <em>Bubble Bobble</em>, <em>Cadash</em>, <em>Chack'n Pop</em>, <em>Don Doko Don</em>, <em>Elevator Action</em>, <em>Football Champ</em>, <em>Growl</em>, <em>KiKi KaiKai</em>, <em>The Legend of Kage</em>, <em>Liquid Kids</em>, <em>Operation Wolf</em>, <em>Puzzle Bobble</em>, <em>Rastan</em>, <em>Space Invaders</em>, <em>Space Invaders '91</em>, <em>The Fairyland Story</em>, <em>The NewZealand Story</em>, and <em>Volfied</em> (all arcade games, except for Space Invaders '91, which is a Mega Drive title). Meanwhile, the Capcom device includes <em>1942</em>, <em>1943</em>, <em>1944: The Loop Master</em>, <em>Bionic Commando</em>, <em>Captain Commando</em>, <em>Final Fight</em>, <em>Forgotten Worlds</em>, <em>Ghouls 'n' Ghosts</em>, <em>Mega Man</em>, <em>Street Fighter II': Hyper Fighting</em>, <em>Strider</em>, and <em>Wolf of the Battlefield: MERCS</em> (also all arcade games, except for Mega Man, which was originally released for the NES).</p>
<p>Compared to the pricing of the other currently-available Evercade machines (£130 for the Evercade EXP handheld which offers TATE mode for vertical games, and £90 for the Evercade VS home-console which supports up to four players), the Super Pocket at £50 makes for the cheapest way <em>by far</em> to get into much of the Evercade library if you're interested in doing so. The Super Pocket is compatible with most Evercade cartridges (which cost £18 each), though at the time of writing, the game Cathedral, on the Alwa's Awakening/Cathedral twin-pack does not work on these machines, and Future Wars on the Delphine Collection 1 cartridge has been reported not to work on at least some units, as well. Even with those caveats, you still get access to the vast majority of the library.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13968035391707132507gol12971.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13968035391707132507gol12971.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>The console itself.</em></p>
<p>The machine is made from a nice-feeling matte-plastic with a black front panel and a green back, with the buttons on the front and back contrasting in line with this colour-scheme. I'm not quite sure why they went with black-and-green for the Taito machine - it looks more like something that I would associate with Gremlin Graphics' Zool than with Taito, whose classic logo typically used red, yellow, or orange with a splash of white, and whose later iconic triangular logo was blue-and-white. Still, it looks really nice, and evokes a strong 1980s/1990s feel, which is clearly what they're going for considering the release-years of the included games. It's compact but feels good in the hand, and the controls are mostly excellent; The d-pad is superb and feels very definite when you push a direction, and the buttons are somewhat clicky and rather reminiscent of those of the Game Boy Advance SP.</p>
<p>The only real issue is with the L1/L2 and R1/R2 "shoulder" buttons on the back, which are incredibly awkward to press, and would be much better if they stuck out a little more and were less firm and clicky than the buttons on the front of the unit - however, as far as the built-in games go, you're not likely to be using the shoulder-buttons, so it's only a potential issue when using certain Evercade cartridges (and, indeed, on the Super Pocket Capcom Edition, which I'm told does use the rear buttons for some of its games). That said, these buttons are bad, and not fit for purpose if you're planning for this to be your only Evercade-compatible device and intend to pick up games that use them. This is quite surprising considering how good the rest of the controls are, which makes this particular element feel like an afterthought. Since the Super Pocket handhelds are numbered, implying more to come, hopefully future revisions can fix these buttons in some way.</p>
<p>The battery lasts for 4 hours, which is about the baseline for most handhelds today. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it lives up to the claimed time exactly! It's always nice to see a company not exaggerating this - well done, Blaze.</p>
<p>The screen is pretty good for a device that only costs £50. It's not top-of-the-line or anything (there's a tiny bit of light-bleed at the top-left edge on my unit, but this sort of thing doesn't tremendously bother me for a device in this price-bracket, and I never notice it during gameplay and barely notice it in the menus), but it doesn't need to be considering that the hardware is intended for very old games that were made for displays that weren't perfect themselves. The only feature, or rather lack thereof, that makes it stand out is that there's no way to change the brightness, which is something I've never seen before on any backlit display. Luckily, it's not set either too bright or too dim - it's perfectly fine for the task at hand. Games look nice on it, although even if you use the system's "Pixel Perfect" display option, there are always some soft-edged scaling artifacts (which is particularly noticeable on the vertical titles that are included) and "shimmering" when scrolling, which I presume is because the Super Pocket's 320x240 resolution is lower than any of the other Evercade consoles out there; Again, though, for £50 I'm much more willing to let it slide than I would be if a more expensive device did this.</p>
<p>It's worth pointing out that the price-point of the Super Pocket also means that there's no multiplayer or TV-out functionality, as other Evercade consoles have - this is purely a single-player console.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4396064371707132507gol12971.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4396064371707132507gol12971.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Remember these games? They're back, in cartridge form!</em></p>
<p>I picked up a handful of cartridges with my device, some of which (particularly the arcade-game collections) include titles that have not seen a re-release on current PC-gaming platforms at the time of writing, and they're an ideal fit for a device like this, especially since most Evercade cartridges include multiple games. Unlike the retro systems that inspired the Evercade line, you can hot-swap cartridges while the system is powered on, as long as a game isn't running at the time, which is very convenient and something that I became accustomed to back in the days of the Nintendo 3DS. However, it's probably worth being somewhat cautious after saving and exiting a game, just to be on the safe side, as, much like the cartridges of the NeoGeo Pocket Colour, Nintendo 3DS, and Nintendo Switch, they're flash-based rather than using mask-ROMs.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6930365091707132508gol12971.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6930365091707132508gol12971.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Retro presentation for retro games.</em></p>
<p>For those who remember Ocean Software's famous home-microcomputer budget tape range, The Hit Squad, the way that the cartridges are packaged is something of a callback to that - they come in cute little boxes with co-ordinating artwork and collectible numbering, to hook you if you're inclined towards collecting and displaying them all. They're also colour-coded, with red boxes representing retro console/handheld and native titles, purple representing arcade games, and blue representing software originally made for home computers. And, unlike full-priced releases for major platforms, you also get a full-colour manual as well, which contains details about the games and those behind them. (Note that, though Evercade cartridges on the standard consoles display an information-page replicating the relevant part of the manual before you jump into a game, this does not happen on the Super Pocket machines - on those, your chosen game loads immediately without showing anything else first.)</p>
<p>Just like those curated collections of tapes, so too are the Evercade's cartridges curated, and this is one of their great strengths. You'll typically select a cartridge on the basis of a few games that interest you, and end up discovering other games you like along the way. This has happened to me with every single cartridge I've picked up so far. Moreover, not only do the collections sometimes include games that were never released in English before, or finished versions of "lost" titles that weren't released at all during their time, sometimes they'll also come with little bonus surprises like art-cards and posters (I've also heard that some offer stickers too, though I haven't come across any of those myself yet), which I was absolutely delighted by - it reminded me of when older games would include these little goodies, which of course is the intent. I'll definitely be displaying these!</p>
<p>When you load up a cartridge, the menus are well-presented, displaying the games using either their original key-art or arcade-flyer in a scrolling horizontal format; This reminded me of the likes of EmulationStation, though it's not quite as snappy and responsive (it feels like there's some room for improvement here, but it's not a huge issue). It's easy to switch between the Super Pocket's selection of built-in games and those on a cartridge by pressing the Menu button located just under the screen, which will let you access either one of the gaming options, as well as the system's Settings menu.</p>
<p>The emulation is, as anyone who's familiar with <a href="https://evercade.co.uk/credits/" target="_blank">the usual suspects from the Linux emulation scene</a> will already know, pretty much spot-on. I'm actually pickier about this than most, because even though I'm an emulation enthusiast, at one point I was also a major real-hardware-only stickler whilst waiting for the emulation of certain systems I knew well to improve (I'm the sort who wouldn't put up with inaccurate SNES audio emulation or incorrect Z-fighting in PlayStation emulators); Those improvements became reality before too long, and what's presented by the Super Pocket (and by extension the wider Evercade line) is more than good enough for me. I suspect that folks without specialised emulation knowledge would never notice any difference compared to their memories of the real thing. The only downside I found is that you can't remap the controls on this device, though given the price, size, and form-factor this didn't bother me like it otherwise would - they're aiming for a no-fuss console experience, after all.</p>
<p>The Super Pocket (and its Evercade kin) won't be for everyone, especially in a world where it's competing against low-cost emulation handhelds that seem to multiply by the month and don't require cartridges, but if you're looking for a simple Linux-based way to get into retro-gaming (plus some modern indies made in the retro style), where some of the money goes back to the rights-holders for the games and you get some neat little artifacts to use and display, then this is a damn fine place to start. Even with the awful shoulder-buttons, I've been left very impressed by the entire experience and its presentation, inside and out.</p>
<p>If you're interested in picking one up, Blaze Entertainment lists their worldwide retailers for the Evercade and Super Pocket lines <a href="https://evercade.co.uk/retailers/" target="_blank">here (Evercade)</a> and <a href="https://www.hypermegatech.com/retailers/" target="_blank">here (Super Pocket)</a>.</p>

      <title>Orange Pi Neo gaming handheld to come with Manjaro Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Shown off during the recent FOSDEM 2024 event, it seems the Manjaro Linux team have buddied up with hardware vendor Orange Pi for the Orange Pi Neo gaming handheld.</p>
<p>The system has not been fully announced by Orange Pi directly as of yet, but the Manjaro Linux team put <a href="https://twitter.com/ManjaroLinux/status/1753619695800844579" target="_blank">various</a> <small>(1)</small> <a href="https://twitter.com/ManjaroLinux/status/1754381527385817545" target="_blank">posts</a> <small>(2)</small> on X (formerly Twitter) and they have a <a href="https://neo.manjaro.org" target="_blank">dedicated page</a> on their website for the Orange Pi Neo that goes over the specifications.</p>

<p>We haven't seen many jump into Linux for handhelds like this yet aside from the Steam Deck. We would've had the AYANEO Next Lite, which was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/ayaneo-next-lite-with-a-customized-steamos-like-holoiso-fully-revealed/" target="_blank">announced with HoloISO</a>, but they <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/ayaneo-next-lite-no-longer-ships-with-steamos-like-holoiso-linux-windows-11-instead/" target="_blank">reversed course back to Windows</a>. So it's good to see another that will be coming to market to further push Linux in the gaming space!</p>

<p>The decision to go with Manjaro isn't that unexpected either, considering it's the Linux distribution Valve still <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/steamdeck/testing" target="_blank">suggest</a> right now for developing specifically for the Steam Deck without having one (as SteamOS and Manjaro are both Arch Linux based).</p>
<p>Seems like it could be quite an interesting device, definitely worth keeping an eye on! Curious to see more on it, especially since it's an all-in-one device with Orange Pi usually being known for their small boards.</p>
