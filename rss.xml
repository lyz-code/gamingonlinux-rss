      <title>Steam Next Fest - October 2025 is now live with a great many demos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here we go again, you've got a week to check out a bunch of games having their first or updated demos now in Steam Next Fest - October 2025.</p>
<p>Many demos will only be up for this event, but plenty will keep their demo up longer too. More demos than any one person can handle! The official trailer provided by Valve is below:</p>

<p>I've already been highlighting a number of games with demos so be sure to look at <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/demo/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our demo tag</a> for previous stuff.

      <title>One of the most promising deck-building roguelikes ever, Moonsigil Atlas gets a big demo upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Moonsigil Atlas is by far one of the most interesting and promising upcoming games I've played in a while, taking deck-building roguelikes in a fun direction.</p>
<p>Instead of a mana or energy system, you use physical space. Each card you have creates a certain shape to activate and place down, so it's all about making use of the space that's available to piece things together. You can manipulate the shapes of each individual card as you progress and upgrade too, and eventually get some really interesting overpowered combos going thanks to bonuses for overlap and adjacency.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Azqo-cQaaPk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0541d8bfe71ca6e63c865f8fc207f248.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Azqo-cQaaPk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Since it's all about physical space, there's no real right way to play through or build up your deck. It gives you an interesting type of freedom to experiment during a run.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the email sent to GamingOnLinux, here's some of what's included in the big demo upgrade for Steam Next Fest:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Localization - The upcoming Next Fest Demo will be fully playable in Simplified Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Russian (localization is currently work-in-progress and may have minor inaccuracies)</li>
<li>Second Act - A preview of the game's entire second act will be available to all players in the Demo</li>
<li>Forbidden Cards - New rare cards with powerful effects that can be acquired during a run</li>
<li>Artifacts (Items) - Rare and powerful artifacts that grant the player passive abilities that can be acquired during a run</li>
<li>A Ton of New Encounters - Shape Swapping (allows the player to swap the shape between two cards), Card Duplication, and more</li>
<li>Even Better Visuals - We've added a ton of new visual effects, flair, and QOL visual features to the game</li>
<li>Greatly Improved Tutorial - We've rebuilt the tutorial from the ground up to be interactive and spread out over the course of normal gameplay</li>
<li>Additional "Character Mastery" Unlocks - There is more content to be unlocked over time while playing the Demo</li>
<li>Steam Achievements - A selection of Steam achievements from the full game will be available in the demo.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I absolutely adore it. Definitely one you simply have to check out. The demo and full game have Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown gets a first demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Clearly still a work in progress but a taste of things to come, Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown now has a public demo available. <em>Your crew. Your ship. Your command.</em></p>
<p>What is it? "Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown is a story-driven survival strategy game in which the fate of the iconic starship is in your hands. Take the helm, manage the ship and resources, and make difficult decisions. Will you be able to bring home the ship and its crew?"</p>
<p>The new demo trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Toj1LgFvoUk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b1fc3572ee6d82efb13b29a8f21bfecb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Toj1LgFvoUk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>So far in my early testing of it, the game works great in Proton 9 on Linux! However, the developer pretty clearly has a lot of work to do on this one.</p>
<p>The biggest problem for the game is the lack of voice over, there's seemingly none at all. That honestly felt a bit jarring when first going into it, with my brain trying to make up for it by hearing their voices inside my head as I read the subtitles. I think this is going to <em>really</em> work against it. Even if they can't get the original people to do it, some quality voice over would really help bring it to life.</p>
<p>Another surprise is that even though it's a licensed game, the familiar Star Trek music isn't there either. It all sounds a bit hollow and generic. A work in progress of course, so hopefully they'll improve the atmosphere as it goes on. The atmosphere is just severely lacking.</p>
<p>But, thankfully, other than that - it's about how I imagined it would be. A space strategy game blended with elements of a choose your own adventure (and plenty of resource management) with the Star Trek Voyager setting. The planet scanning and exploration side of it actually reminded me just a little of Mass Effect, with perhaps a little XCOM 2 vibes for the ship management but the rest is very much interactive fiction with you making constant choices to progress through it. I think they've done a good job on the interface though, it does feel very Voyager-like.</p>
<p>I do look forward to more of it, as I can certainly appreciate what they're going for here. As an avid Star Trek fan, I can see that there's some serious potential here but they have plenty of work to do on that atmosphere and game feel. Really, the outcome will ultimately rest on exactly what choices you're allowed to make throughout the full game and how wildly it will change things. I'm keen to see.</p>

      <title>From the creator of Sally Face, horror deckbuilding roguelike The House of Hamelin has a demo up</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Enter the frightful world of The House of Hamelin and take control of Perdita, a young woman tasked with finding her missing cat, Paige. In development by Wither Studios founded in 2009 by Steve Gabry (Sally Face) and John Cobb it's a horror-themed deck-builder set in a house where ghastly creatures and ever-changing hallways make each step a horrific fight for survival.</p>
<p>More about it — build up a collection of unusual cards and use them against the creatures that stalk Perdita from the darkness. Engage in terrifying turn-based card combat where lurid abominations demonstrate shockingly intelligent strategies. Build two different card decks, a main spell deck and a more powerful, but limited-use ritual deck to crush the creatures preventing Perdita’s progress through the house. Battle the gang of gruesome foes in long, foreboding hallways, where clever use of stamina makes all the difference between survival or being caught by monsters. </p>
<p>Check out the teaser below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8PcjGeVrqyg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7cfd9cf158c53de01568c57eb9fa3792.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8PcjGeVrqyg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Each new playthrough brings new layouts, enemies, and cards, giving Perdita frightening new encounters and challenges as she desperately battles her way to her feline friend. </p>
<p>From the press release emailed to GamingOnLinux: “The House of Hamelin is a terrifying mix of deckbuilding gameplay and point-and-click adventure,” said Steve Gabry, founder of Wither Studios. “Our team aimed to create a combination of roguelike deck building and horrifying creatures that haunt your every move. We’re excited to bring this fresh take on horror games to players looking for engaging gameplay and spine-chilling thrills. Plus, cats!”</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support with the demo out now.</p>

      <title>Build a living city on rails in Steel Artery: Train City Builder</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Set in a steampunk fantasy world with many different races, Steel Artery: Train City Builder is an interesting looking take on a city-builder. Based on rails, your city will be constantly moving which comes with its own challenges.</p>
<p>It's not just the constant movement that makes it a challenge, Steel Artery doesn’t give you direct control over citizens either. They act on their own economy-driven needs—choosing jobs, resting, spending money, forming families, and shaping their own stories, you're just there to provide the opportunities they take.</p>
<p>More about it: "Once a symbol of the Empire’s technological dominance, the legendary Steelpolis has been revived in desperate times. As its newly appointed mayor, you must turn this colossal train into a living city, ensuring prosperity for your citizens while keeping the Empire alive."</p>
<p>Developer SoulAge23 recently announced they've partnered up with publisher Crytivo to help with it. And, the first official trailer has been released to get a good look at it:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Expand a train-city wagon by wagon with unique tetris-like construction.</li>
<li>Hundreds of autonomous citizens live their own lives, choosing how to work, rest, and survive.</li>
<li>Humans, orcs, elves, and others bring unique needs and values, leading to cooperation, conflict, or even extremes.</li>
<li>Economy and logistics drive survival as every building uses or produces resources within limited space.</li>
<li>Explore new lands to gather resources and unlock expansion.</li>
<li>Detailed pixel art brings a vibrant steampunk world to life.</li>
<li>Replay every run differently, from a compact express to a massive titan with thousands aboard.</li>
</ul>

      <title>A Pinball Game That Makes You Mad is certainly an appropriate name for this game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>A Pinball Game That Makes You Mad is an upcoming release from Azimuth Studios, and you don't really need to guess what the game is about with that name. Dare I say it? I'm going to do it — Is this the souls-like of pinball games? Or perhaps it's Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy but pinball? Either way, this is sure to make you rage a bit.</p>
<p>With a demo now available on Steam ready for Steam Next Fest, you too can try out the infuriating one-button ball-basher and see if you have what it takes to make some progress in it.</p>

<p>More about it: "Imagine a version of Pinball 2000 that actively wanted you dead, and you’d be on the way to understanding A Pinball Game That Makes You Mad. Use one button (or even one finger!) to flip the titular Pinball until you feel the titular Mad, in this titular Game inspired by the maddening genius of Bennet Foddy’s Getting Over It. </p>
<p>Ascend a maze of bespoke flipper-powered puzzles, learning from every fumble and fall. Use timing, wits and patience. When that fails, get mad. Become a Pinball Wizard and claim your awesome gift at the summit. There are optional checkpoints for those who like their glory cheap, and unlockable themes for those who like their pinballs cat shaped (?)."</p>
<p>It has a Native Linux version for the demo and will support Linux for the release too.</p>

      <title>1998 arcade-style aircraft racer Plane Crazy gets a Championship Edition upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Originally released in 1998, Plane Crazy from Inner Workings returns with the newer Plane Crazy Championship Edition from ZOOM Platform. At the original release it had a pretty mixed rating, partly due to the high difficulty of it. ZOOM Platform have been updating a getting refreshed releases out for a bunch of retro games like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/1994-retro-shooter-the-fortress-of-dr-radiaki-gets-a-fancy-edition-re-release-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Fortress of Dr. Radiaki back in May</a>.</p>
<p>See the release trailer below:</p>

<p>New in this edition:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Support for high resolutions.</li>
<li>Modern gamepad support.</li>
<li>Additional quality of life configuration options:
	<ul>
<li>Auto-skip all intros.</li>
<li>Invertible Y-Axis when using gamepads.</li>
<li>Permanent first person cockpit view option.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Modern system compatibility and crash fixes, ensuring the game runs smoothly on today’s hardware and operating systems.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Over an email to GamingOnLinux a ZOOM Platform rep mentioned they aimed to ensure it worked smoothly on Linux via Wine / Proton and they noted: "To get technical for a bit, the last thing we were waiting for was figuring out the best way to force the native version of a dll we use that wraps the controller API to map the analog controls to modern controllers.<br/>
For Steam, we asked Valve to update Proton. It's live already via experimental and our Steam app is <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/commit/49877a230275968cfa8945cdfe8a0c9fa9fa4307" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">pinned to that version</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://zoom-platform.sh" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">zoom-platform.sh</a> will just use that same fix through Proton by utilizing the UMU database to link our ID with the Steam appid."</p>

      <title>Unique RTS game Moduwar fixes the oversized cursor on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Moduwar is an adaptive organic RTS where you control an alien creature, it's quite unique and looks really interesting.</p>
<p>More about it: "Moduwar is a Real-Time Strategy game that redefines the genre with its unique modular gameplay. Instead of commanding traditional units, you control the Modu, a highly adaptable native species of water-dwelling creature capable of growing, merging, and splitting their organic structures in real time. By strategically evolving different organs, you create custom units that adapt to any battle scenario."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lpMH1R5WhFA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d6f24a5a9f0cf9a5a202287e6b1c5e23.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lpMH1R5WhFA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It entered Early Access in June 2025, and came with a Native Linux version. However, it's taken them until <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/923100/view/529858829083477982" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">October 8th</a> to fix a really annoying problem with it. The Linux version had a hilariously oversized cursor, a problem I see a fair bit in Unity games. Nice to <em>finally</em> see it solved. Shame it took far too long to solve such a bug though.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Organic Modular Gameplay – Evolve a wide range of combat organs to build units tailored to your tactical needs.</li>
<li>Split &amp; Merge Mechanics – Scout with split tiles, ambush with stealth units, or recombine for heavy offense.</li>
<li>Single-Player Campaign – Lead the Modu through a story of rebellion against their oppressors on a hostile alien planet.</li>
<li>Stylized FMV-Style Cinematics: Experience Arkadia’s story through live-action sequences with a retro-futuristic aesthetic.</li>
<li>Multiplayer Modes – Test your build against others in PvP, co-op, Survival, and Arena modes.</li>
<li>Living Ecosystem – Fight across a lush and dangerous world teeming with biomechanical life.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 Classic scrap their open beta and new Valve rules likely mean they have to change the name</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Team Fortress 2 Classic is an upcoming Source Engine mod based on Valve's Team Fortress 2, it was due to hold an open beta but they've had to scrap it.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3545060/view/525355229451913256" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> posted October 6th they noted: "In the final stages of the review process, we were informed that an app on Steam cannot be both a Mod and a Demo at the same time. Unfortunately, this was not caught by anyone at EMINOMA or at Valve until last Saturday, after initial reviews hadn't flagged it as an issue and gave us the mistaken belief that we were clear to ship."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7296621931760114095gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Later in the announcement they mentioned some other concerns from Valve, in a heavily redacted section (as a bit of a joke). Turns out, Valve updated the rules noted on the Steamworks Documentation about shipping Source Engine Games / Mods. It now includes a section on the name of the games / mods that reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Clear Communication</h4>
Your mod should have a distinct identity, and should not suggest that it was created or endorsed by Valve. This extends to all places where you talk about your mod, including its title. We may deny titles that imply a mod being an official prequel, sequel or remake of a Valve title.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Bad titles:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Ricochet 2</li>
<li>Ricochet Classic</li>
<li>Ricochet: Source</li>
</ul>
<strong>Better titles:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Deflection – A Ricochet Mod</li>
<li>Collider – A Ricochet Story</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Spotted the <a href="http://github.com/SteamDatabase/SteamworksDocumentation/commit/a72284c1e0cbe8bb86e0ff088b575e33478ea6f7#diff-6d4c839c12c1fe885be1dde8bc5d5ce52a916ea7f97888b99a6545d93e18c08a" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">change</a> thanks to the work SteamDB do tracking everything. Oh wow, Ricochet 2 huh?</em></p>
<p>Overall, it seems fair enough, Valve provide a lot to developers to mess with their code in the Source SDK and so they don't want Steam customers to be confused thinking mods like this are in any way official.</p>
<p>At some point then, I expect Team Fortress 2 Classic to go through a rebrand with a newer name.</p>

      <title>Take on the role of a curious baby boar in the demo for Adorable Adventures</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Adorable Adventures is a cozy third-person exploration adventure where you're Boris, a curious baby boar on a mission to find their family.</p>
<p>Covered initially <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/adorable-adventures-is-a-gorgeous-upcoming-adventure-featuring-a-mischievous-baby-boar/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here on GamingOnLinux back in July</a>, I was instantly pulled in by the super cute setting and the wonderful looking visuals to match. From peaceful forest meadows to rocky highlands, dark caves and sun-dappled paths you have to use your nose to follow trails, uncover secrets, make friends and expand your library of smells.</p>
<p>Developer Wild Sheep Studio have just released the first demo, and it's as sweet as I imagined it would be. Boris is absolutely adorable, and the animations they've created for your movement are pretty great too. Watching Boris slip and slide all over the place — and the running, it's so funny. As is the sound of Boris sniffing away at all the things you get to discover.</p>
<p>A new demo trailer is also live:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Play as a mischievous baby boar</li>
<li>A deep and innovative scent-tracking mechanic</li>
<li>An interactive herbarium to complete</li>
<li>Interact with your brothers and sisters and other wildlife</li>
<li>A collection of playful activities to compete in</li>
<li>An adaptive story told in voice-over </li>
<li>Playful blend of exploration, light platforming and discovery</li>
<li>Made with care by a small, passionate indie team</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer also previously posted in a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3840230/view/539991928250303008" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> about how they were testing it on Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>Worked great on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 25.10) with Proton 9. I wasn't a fan of the camera controls though, that will take a bit more getting used to with it zooming in and out along with rotating with the same stick but other than that I really need a whole lot more of this.</p>

      <title>Effulgence RPG has some of the slickest animated 3D ASCII art I&#39;ve ever seen</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is a very fun surprise, Effulgence RPG is an upcoming party-based sci-fi role-playing game rendered entirely from text symbols arranged in 3D space. It looks like nothing else I've seen before, it really is quite impressively made.</p>
<p>A demo is live ready for Steam Next Fest, so you can try it out and see for yourself just how cool it is. A fun idea for a game visual style but the gameplay mechanics are interesting too. In Effulgence RPG, enemies are more than obstacles - they're also raw materials you need. Destroying them breaks them down into particles allowing you to forge weapons and gear using a signature matter printer system, all while exploring a world built from shimmering text characters for a unique, high-contrast 3D ASCII visual identity.</p>

<p>In the press email they noted: "Effulgence RPG runs great on Steam Deck via Proton, with a controller-first UI, readable 3D ASCII rendering on the handheld display, and no platform-specific blockers. That same Proton compatibility also means the game runs on Linux desktops (e.g., Steam on Ubuntu/Arch) with gamepad, mouse, or keyboard. We welcome Linux coverage and feedback from Deck users."</p>
<p>Nice to see! And I can confirm it works beautifully on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 25.10) with Proton 9.</p>
<p>Definitely a demo you need to try.</p>

      <title>Cyberpunk roguelike deckbuilder and dungeon crawler Into The Grid arrives November 10</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Into The Grid from Flatline Studios is an incredibly promising blend of a cyberpunk roguelike deckbuilder and dungeon crawler and it's arriving November 10th. Featuring full Native Linux support, with a demo still live right now for you to try.</p>
<p>Set in a Cyberpunk world in the year 2112, the game mixes strategic and immersive card battles with tactical map exploration and resource management. Become a master hacker, make your way to the Mainframe buried deep within the Grid, and access the corporation's dirtiest secrets.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DmT2jYhE114"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b6945a1ad68a5a58ad6d31e8a74d394c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DmT2jYhE114" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Really love the style in this one, especially the way enemies are animated during the battles. Really helps sell the whole cyberpunk thing. Looking forward to the release of this one, although this is only the beginning. The story and lore is a work in progress since it will be in Early Access, which they estimate will last at least one year. During Early Access they plan to add two more characters, new cards, new enemies and so on.</p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>An exciting blend of Deckbuilding, Card Battler and Dungeon Crawler - </strong>Ever wondered what the love child of a Roguelike Deckbuilder and a Tabletop Boardgame would look like? Here’s the answer: <em>Into The Grid</em> features action-packed card battles and deeply tactical map exploration with resource management.</li>
<li><strong>Death to dead draws</strong> - <em>Into The Grid</em> has a unique dual-resource system where each card is played for its effect while simultaneously generating Virtual Memory (VIM), which allows the player to take advantage of even the most suboptimal hands. Use VIM to activate your Commands during battle and obliterate your enemies’ defences!</li>
<li><strong>Exploit the Commands</strong> - Commands are powerful unlockable skills that can be the difference between victory and defeat. Choose them wisely, sync them with your deck, and strategically deploy them for knockout wins.</li>
<li><strong>Tactical Dungeon Crawler-like navigation</strong> - The Grid is the infinite digital landscape where information lives. Full of riches and dangers, it’s a place where only the sharpest minds can thrive. Experience a layer of depth never seen before in the genre; consider every move as if it were your last... because it might be. Fight or flee? Visit this area now or later? Cash in a reward immediately, or hold on to it for an even bigger payoff? The choice is yours, as well as the punishment and the profit.</li>
<li><strong>Unveil the stories behind the Hackers</strong>- <em>Into The Grid</em> will include four* distinct characters, each with their own story arc, gameplay mechanics, art, and much more. Every playable hacker belongs to a different Faction that determines the hacker’s ethos and their reasons to be outlaws.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Around 70,000 users affected in Discord related breach which includes some government ID images</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ouch. This whole ongoing online safety thing is going well isn't it? Who could have guessed that some personal data would end up leaking? Everyone with a brain that even remotely understands the internet and technology.</p>
<p>Discord recently <a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/update-on-security-incident-involving-third-party-customer-service" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> on October 3rd that a partner they were using for third-party customer service had been compromised. The attackers managed to swipe the likes of contact details, limited billing info, IP addresses, messages with customer service agents, limited corporate data and a "small number of government‑ID images".</p>
<p>Originally the article did not name the company involved, or how many were affected, but it was updated on October 9th to clarify after some misinformation spread online and named "5CA" as the company that was compromised. That and they also now note more clearly that "approximately 70,000" had their government ID photos exposed".</p>
<p>This is all to do with Discord's requirement to verify the age of people in some countries, but this is specifically to do with those who went through customer service for age-related appeals. So to be clear, Discord itself was <em>not</em> compromised, the third-party 5CA were the issue.</p>
<p>A thoroughly frustrating issue. One not just localised to the UK with the Online Safety Act, as more countries and US states have been slowly pushing out age verification requirements to various platforms. This issue of security and privacy is only going to get worse as time goes on. These laws have just added an extra burden to everyone, and made an even bigger target for bad actors to grab even more sensitive personal data from people.</p>

      <title>Battlefield 6 releases today and it will not be playable on any Linux / SteamOS system</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just a reminder that thanks to EA's latest anti-cheat, the launch of Battlefield 6 today will be unplayable on any Linux system. This is because of EA Javelin anticheat, which was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/ea-rebrand-and-refresh-their-anti-cheat-into-ea-javelin-anticheat-still-blocks-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously just called EA anticheat before being rebranded</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it's the same for the likes of the recent release of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/full-circle-ea-confirm-again-that-skate-will-not-support-linux-steam-deck-or-macos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">skate.</a>, various other Battlefield titles, EA Sports FC, EA Sports Madden, EA Sports WRC and any other modern game that has an online mode from EA will remain unplayable thanks to EA Javelin anticheat. As <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">listed on our dedicated ant-cheat page</a>, there's simply no workaround for it and no solution until the day Linux / SteamOS gain enough market share that it cannot be ignored.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18053512911760092469gol1.jpg"/><br/>

<p>You can get <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-get-battlefield-3-and-battlefield-4-online-working-on-linux-steamos-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4 working though with our guide</a>, since they use older tech. We also have a dedicated ongoing <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/alternatives-to-popular-games-that-dont-work-on-linux-steam-deck-and-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">guide of game alternatives for Linux platforms</a> that might help.</p>
<p>Another alternative is NVIDIA GeForce NOW, which can be played in the browser on Linux (lower quality) and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-get-geforce-now-on-steam-deck-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a dedicated Steam Deck application</a>. NVIDIA recently <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-battlefield-6/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> GeForce NOW is ready for Battlefield 6 and it will have the newer GeForce RTX 5080 servers compatibility too for even better quality overall.</p>
<p>Perhaps one day we might see Valve introduce a newer and more improved anti-cheat themselves with full Linux support, that could end up being another solution. Although, it would need to be cross-platform for it to pull in more developers too.</p>

      <title>Blue Protocol: Star Resonance is out now and does work on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Despite <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/blue-protocol-star-resonance-to-be-playable-on-steam-deck-but-probably-not-desktop-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the previous report</a> that it likely wouldn't work on Desktop Linux, Blue Protocol: Star Resonance is out now and does work. Now you too can enjoy the anime gacha on your preferred platform be it Desktop Linux or Steam Deck with SteamOS.</p>
<p>It's supposedly using Anti-Cheat Expert (ACE), but it's <em>not</em> actually listed on the Steam page, which <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-games-will-now-need-to-fully-disclose-kernel-level-anti-cheat-on-store-pages/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">as per Valve's rules it's supposed to be</a>. Currently this is a little unclear on what exactly it's using since there's no proper statement now from the developer. Either way, it works.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8051602021760091579gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8051602021760091579gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>However, there are some issues so it's not completely playable yet.</p>
<p>A bunch of the videos don't play by default in Proton, and you just get a black screen. I've tried Proton 9, Experimental and the latest GE-Proton and they all have the same issue. They're somewhat minor with the videos for picking a class and area introductions but it still detracts from the experience. Aside from that, everything else does appear to work and quite nicely too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WDWHZeWa9kE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c36d5718813528999dfb9d3658743b8c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WDWHZeWa9kE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>If you do like these free to play anime styled MMOs, then at least it's another choice for you on Linux right now. From what they said it has a "mega-server", so there's only one server that everyone is one in a shared world.</p>
<p>Highlights from the press email:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deep Character Customization:</strong> Players become the stars of their own anime with an extensive creation suite <em>featuring 127 adjustable parameters and a global dye system covering over 250 parts — allowing them to shape virtually any anime-inspired character they can imagine.</em>. They design every detail of their unique hero, from their appearance and fashion to their evolving combat styles and builds.</li>
<li><strong>A Vast Open World to Explore: </strong>Players will journey through the stunning, vibrant landscapes of Regnus. They discover hidden dungeons, scale majestic peaks, and uncover the secrets of a world teeming with life and mystery.</li>
<li><strong>Thrilling &amp; Dynamic Combat: </strong>Players choose from eight distinct classes, each with a deeply unique playstyle and ability set, from swift melee strikers to powerful ranged spellcasters. They team up to unleash spectacular combos and take down massive, screen-filling bosses, each featuring unique mechanics and phases that require strategy and teamwork to overcome.</li>
<li><strong>Your Community Awaits: </strong>Connect with friends through guilds, housing, and diverse social events. In Regnus, every playstyle is celebrated. Whether you live for combat, master life skills, or just enjoy the mini-games, you will find your home here. The greatest adventures are shared!</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do plan to try it and want to give feedback, they're currently only looking for issues that broke between Proton 10.0-2 and 10.0-3.</p>
<p>How to try it? You need to have Proton 10 installed in your Steam Library, and then opt into the Beta on Proton 10.</p>

      <title>Retro Brazilian RTS game Outlive returns with Outlive 25</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Outlive 25 is a remaster of the classic 2000 RTS game rebuilt by the original developers, and a demo is just about to drop too.</p>
<p>I truly love base-building RTS games, so this is going high up on my list as I had honestly never heard of it until the news dropped into the GamingOnLinux inbox. Then again, I was only 12 when it originally released (and probably busy playing Total Annihilation). This is why I love remasters, bringing a new audience to games like this for fans of the genre.</p>
<p>In the full game you choose between Humans or Robots, while you decide the fate of the earth across three story campaigns. A future where machines have risen to wage war against their creators and natural resources are scarce.  Hmm, sounds familiar doesn't it.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Tqms5Lo-qS0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4d09848bd4fc44880b5ae4c9000a3a50.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Tqms5Lo-qS0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Research Tree:</strong> Upgrade your units and make your buildings more efficient during matches, making each battle unique.</li>
<li><strong>Espionage &amp; Counterespionage:</strong> Scout enemy bases, intercept incoming missiles, and carry out other covert actions.</li>
<li><strong>Pathing System: </strong>Automate unit behaviors so you can focus entirely on your strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Diplomacy:</strong> Forge alliances with other armies to take down your opponents.</li>
<li><strong>Online Multiplayer: </strong>Play against other players to claim the top spot as the ultimate war strategist!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>“Outlive was among the first Brazilian games to gain global recognition and success, yet it’s not been easily accessible for several years as technology has advanced in the past quarter century,” said Rodrigo Dal’Asta, co-founder of Continuum Entertainment. “That said, we didn’t simply want to port the original Outlive to modern hardware, as there was so much potential for improvement. We plan to add ranking boards, even more customization options, and enhanced presentation. Outlive 25 takes everything that was great about retro RTS games and infuses it with a jolt of contemporary polish and accessibility for the ultimate fusion of old and new!” </p>
<p>A demo will be live tomorrow, October 10th, so it's ready for Steam Next Fest. Interestingly, the demo is its own standalone thing. The demo itself is a remake of the original demo, with a standalone campaign that serves as a prologue to the events of the three main campaigns. Pretty fun idea.</p>

      <title>Intel details Panther Lake architecture expected to start shipping January 2026</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Intel have now revealed a whole lot more on Panther Lake, their next-generation chip architecture with RibbonFET and PowerVia.</p>
<p>Using their new Intel 18A 2-nanometer class node they said it delivers "up to 15% better performance per watt and 30% improved chip density compared to Intel 3.5". The big new changes include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>RibbonFET:</strong> Intel’s first new transistor architecture in over a decade, enabling greater scaling and more efficient switching for improved performance and energy efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>PowerVia:</strong> A groundbreaking backside power delivery system, enhancing power flow and signal delivery.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They also mentioned Foveros, their advanced packaging and 3D chip stacking technology that "enables the stacking and integration of multiple chiplets into advanced SoC designs, delivering flexibility, scalability and performance at the system level". Intel 18A will form the foundation for three upcoming generations of products both client (like gamers) and servers.</p>
<p>From the press release, Intel said the Intel Core Ultra series 3 processors will be the first client chips built on Intel 18A, which should see "broad market availability starting January 2026".</p>
<p>Some highlights they included:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Lunar Lake-level power efficiency and Arrow Lake-class performance.</li>
<li>Up to 16 new performance-cores (P-cores) and efficient-cores (E-cores) delivering more than 50% faster CPU performance vs. previous generation.</li>
<li>New Intel Arc GPU with up to 12 Xe cores delivering more than 50% faster graphics performance vs. previous generation.</li>
<li>Balanced XPU design for next-level AI acceleration with up to 180 Platform TOPS (trillions of operations per second).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be especially interesting with the new Xe3 GPU architecture, and with the overall efficiency perhaps we might see more Intel gaming handheld PCs as they look to take back the market from AMD.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="Intel Panther Lake held with a white glove" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6373071051760016817gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Intel Panther Lake</em></p>
<p>We'll have to wait until closer to January for when they actually reveal the list of processors coming, which as far as I can see they haven't done so yet, this announcement was much more about all the tech behind it and not specific models of anything. It's all about being more modular, allowing for them to scale it better across different industries.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7106354361760017183gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="Intel Panther Lake configurations table across 8 and 16 core configs" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7106354361760017183gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>XeSS 3 with multi-frame generation was also revealed, to compete with NVIDIA DLSS more. So future Intel GPUs will see a nice performance boost, and it should be supported on their older Intel Arc GPUs too. Games that support XeSS 2 will also support XeSS 3 when it launches.</p>
<p>You can read more in their <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/client-computing/intel-unveils-panther-lake-architecture-first-ai-pc-platform-built-on-18a" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">public post</a>.</p>
<p>And in case you missed the other big news recently: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/nvidia-are-investing-5-billion-in-intel-to-develop-new-chips-together/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NVIDIA are investing $5 billion in Intel to develop new chips together</a>.</p>

      <title>Physics-based delivery adventure Truckful gets a first demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From developer MythicOwl and Pocketpair Publishing (Palworld), Truckful is a wacky and mysterious physics-based delivery adventure. Just today they released the first demo for you to try (Native Linux) and it has a brand new demo trailer too giving you more of a look at the game.</p>
<p>You'll be tasked with taking your reliable old truck to deliver a range of goods across the countryside. You'll be dealing with various challenging tasks during your deliveries, and there's something a little strange going on. From the developer's description they note the "seemingly idyllic countryside hides its fair share of mysteries" and that the "ancient forest on the outskirts whispers through local legends and folklore, its dense canopy creating an unsettling atmosphere, with something lurking in the shadows…". Sounds like it might get a little spooky.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>

      <title>Check out the demo for the physics-driven co-op action-RPG Cloudheim</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Coming from Noodle Cat Games, Cloudheim is shaping up to be an impressive physics-driven co-op action-RPG.</p>
<p>What is it? A rather vibrant action-RPG built for co-op chaos and based around creative physics-based combat. You can play solo or with up to 4 total players online. It has a destructible world, which makes the combat in it quite explosive and fun with you able to tear down pillars on top of enemies, throw them into tornadoes or just kick an exploding barrel their way.</p>
<p>The fresh Cloudheim demo offers access to the game's tutorial, your airborne base of operations (Odin Shell, which is literally the back of a flying turtle), and Acts I &amp; II of the story. This includes most of the island of Arcadia and the first few dungeons. Seems like quite a generous amount of content for the demo.</p>
<p>A new trailer has also been launched for the demo:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="fZd4mntX5XI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/76902f6fdb37bee3d6639ca1aef4205e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/fZd4mntX5XI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Physics-Driven Combat: Lasso, launch, and juggle enemies into fire pits, each other, or the scenery—anything goes. Longer air time = more damage.</li>
<li>Real-Time Crafting &amp; Fusion: Grab and toss materials directly into crafting stations in the world. No menus, no inventory clutter—just pure, visible teamwork.</li>
<li>Drop-In 4-Player Co-Op: Tame creatures, fight bosses, and explore mythic dungeons with friends. All loot is shared; your progression is not.</li>
<li>Evolving Base &amp; Shop System: Return from adventures to upgrade your base, sell loot, and unlock new features.</li>
<li>Stylized Fantasy World: Built by a team of experienced artists, Cloudheim is rich with visual flair, character, and discovery.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From the press release: "Cloudheim is a game all about physics-systems combining in unexpected ways as teams of differently built characters combine their powers in hectic battles," said David Hunt, CEO and Founder of Noodle Cat Games. "It’s like Smash Bros. had a baby with Zelda, as you explore a sprawling fantasy kingdom full of danger, wonder, and surprises around every corner! This demo will give players a taste of the exciting adventures that await them when Cloudheim launches on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S"</p>
<p>It should work nicely with the latest Proton on Linux.</p>
<p>However, just to be clear they do make use of generative AI in the production of the game. As noted on the Steam page down at the bottom it states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the development process, we may use procedural- and AI-based tools to assist with content creation. In all such cases, the final product reflects the creativity and expression of our own development team.</p>

      <title>HELLREAPER from the devs of Fury Unleashed looks incredible</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From the studio that gave us Fury Unleashed and Yet Another Zombie Survivors, their next game is a dark action roguelike HELLREAPER and it looks amazing.</p>
<p>The details they shared: "HELLREAPER is a roguelite action-platformer where you play as a former angel, sacrificed and reborn as the Hellreaper, a mystical executioner bound to eternal combat against the legions of the damned. Traverse shifting infernal realms, master cursed powers, and battle grotesque abominations in a desperate fight against eternal damnation.</p>
<p>Balance is at risk; Heaven must strike back, and you're their last line of defense to restore order. With the aid of a mysterious entity known as The Three Sisters, you will uncover the secrets of Hell’s corruption - and more. There will also be cats. Probably… with cats, you can never be sure."</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer below:</p>

      <title>WinBoat for containerised Windows apps on Linux adds custom install path, home folder sharing and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>WinBoat is a very interesting tool in development to run Windows apps on Linux in a full containerised environment and it just got even better. Covered on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/winboat-is-a-new-linux-app-to-run-windows-apps-with-seamless-integration/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux back in early September</a>, it can really help for those few apps you can't be without.</p>
<p>As a reminder on how it works - instead of using Wine / Proton, WinBoat uses an actual copy of Windows to run the apps in a special environment and helps do all the configuration for you. It's pretty slick! Some really impressive work has been going into this.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18992659281760001507gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18992659281760001507gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4346116811760001508gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4346116811760001508gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The developer released a few new versions since last covering it, some highlights of what's been added recently:</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom install path.</li>
<li>The ability to share your /home folder.</li>
<li>It will remember where it was when you close the app.</li>
<li>Multi-monitor support with MultiMon.</li>
<li>An option to auto-start a container.</li>
<li>A warning on disk space if you're getting full.</li>
<li>Some improvements to the general flow and user help for the app itself.</li>
<li>Added noVNC as a preset app if you want to access WinBoat from the browser.</li>
<li>Experimental Dynamic USB pass-through.</li>
<li>And lots more improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar in idea to WinApps but as the developer says in comparison:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With WinApps you do the bulk of the setup manually, and there's no cohesive interface to bring it all together. There's a basic TUI, a taskbar widget, and some CLI commands for you to play with.<br/>
<br/>
WinBoat does all the setup once you have the pre-requisites installed, displays everything worth seeing in a neat interface for you, and acts like a complete experience. No need to mess with configuration files, no need to memorize a dozen CLI commands, it just works.</p>

      <title>Jump back into Winnie’s Hole with a fresh and expanded demo for this unique genre-blending roguelite</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oh bother! The virus has returned in the refreshed and expanded demo for the roguelite Winnie’s Hole the viral dungeon crawling roguelite. Yes, it's a name you can make many crude jokes about but I'll try not to.</p>
<p>What exactly is it? You control a virus inside poor Winnie. Explore cells and influence Winnie's adventure as you spread a virus through his randomly generated innards. And, enter Winnie's brain for combo-driven combat and watch as Winnie mutates over time into something horrific. It's definitely different, I'll give 'em that. </p>
<p>There's a new trailer too:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bZvNefMjHwM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0b5bf44ba02578017c9b4ab866cae890.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bZvNefMjHwM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For the upgraded demo they've included new mutations and perks, level generation improvements, an overhaul of the progression, controller support, improved visuals and much more.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Evolve with each run - Unlock new Perks, Mutations and Virus Strains.</li>
<li>Mutate your host as a symbiotic virus.</li>
<li>Bodybuilding in the worst way.</li>
<li>A storybook narrative which reimagines Winnie in a world of dark science.</li>
<li>A fresh take on exploration, replacing the typical roguelite node map with strategic, turn-based building using a set of tetromino-like virus blocks which you can evolve and reshape.</li>
<li>Dynamic battle system where each turn is an action combo for fast-paced gameplay.</li>
<li>Holesome horror comedy with gritty art inspired by old school Nickelodeon and Brothers' Grimm fairytales.</li>
</ul>

      <title>UK gov has &#34;no plans to intervene&#34; with payment processors pressuring stores to remove games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the ongoing drama from the likes of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/valve-gets-pressured-by-payment-processors-with-a-new-rule-for-game-devs-and-various-adult-games-removed/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/game-store-itch-io-has-deindexed-adult-content-due-to-payment-processor-scrutiny/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">itch.io</a> getting hit by payment processors for hosting certain adult games, the UK government say pretty clearly they will not get involved.</p>
<p>In the UK we have a dedicated government petitions website, where any UK citizen can ask the government to do something. When a petition hits at least 10,000 verified signatures, the government has to respond. If it hits 100,000 then it gets considered for a debate in parliament.</p>
<p>There's an <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/734441" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ongoing petition</a> titled "Ban payment processors stopping services based on objections to legal content", which notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are reports that payment processing companies have recently placed pressure on companies that rely on their services, pressuring them to remove legitimate content.</p>
<p>Because there are a small number of major payment processing companies, we believe this poses an unacceptable threat to small businesses and private individuals, and undermines democratic free speech through censorship from unaccountable companies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At some point recently that petition managed to reach over the 10K threshold (12,362 at time of writing), and so the UK government responded on October 6th:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Government recognises the important role payments plays in supporting a resilient, diverse and growing economy. The Government is committed to ensuring that the UK’s payment system works for all, allowing businesses and customers to transact with confidence.</p>
<p>The Government recognises that it is important for businesses to have greater choice in the forms of payment that they can accept. The National Payments Vision, published in November 2024, set out the Government’s ambition for a world-leading payments ecosystem, where consumers and businesses have a choice of payment methods to meet their needs. A key part of this ambition is the continued development of Open Banking, which enables consumers to make purchases using a wider range of payment methods, including account-to-account payments, thereby increasing competition in the payments sector. HM Treasury is working closely with the financial services regulators to deliver these outcomes.</p>
<p>Decisions regarding which businesses payment processors contract with are a commercial matter, taking into account the relevant requirements on the firm. These decisions will be influenced by a variety of factors, and the Government has no plans to intervene in those commercial decisions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The petition ends 26th February, 2026.</p>
<p>Seems there's going to be no easy solution to this, aside from finding some alternative payment processors that won't kick up a fuss about certain adult content. Complaining directly to the payment processors might help too.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>From the press release: "All Under Heaven fulfils one of our great ambitions," says Crusader Kings III Game Director Alexander Oltner. "We've always seen Crusader Kings as the story of the entire medieval world, and you can't fully tell that story without East Asia. This vision for the series predates my leadership, and it is exciting to bring it to fruition. This is the largest expansion in Crusader Kings history, and that posed a lot of new challenges for us. We hope that our players find a lot to learn and love in All Under Heaven."</p>
<p>Hopefully it will do better than the recent expansions to Stellaris, which all have pretty mixed ratings. The last DLC for Crusader Kings III with Coronations also has a Overwhelmingly Negative rating, and the previous DLC with Khans of the Steppe is also on Mixed. Paradox just don't seem to be hitting the mark at all lately.</p>

      <title>Zelda fused with GTA vibes? Vice: Magic City Mayhem certainly sounds unique</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vice: Magic City Mayhem is a supremely odd blend but it looks like it works. A Zelda-like with some GTA elements thrown in because why not.</p>
<p>More about it: Vice: Magic City Mayhem is a top-down 8-bit retro action/adventure game inspired by Zelda with a GTA: Vice City theme. You play as Dutch, one of Magic City’s top enforcers on a quest to save your one true love, Sophie. Make your way through bustling nightclubs, scenic beaches, and raptor-infested yachts to defeat 8 epic bosses and uncover the secrets of Magic City and save your one true love. At least it's a retro Zelda-like that's aiming to be just a <em>bit</em> different.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="B-5ffMNhhjw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cda690b7320c5f9c8e53ab9249fc999a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/B-5ffMNhhjw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's a demo available on the Steam page (works with Proton 9) and they have a crowdfunding campaign going on right now. The <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jurassicsunsetgames/vice-magic-city-mayhem-a-zelda-like-fused-with-gta-vibes" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> for it lasts until October 30th with their team hoping to hit at least $10,000. At time of writing it has just about $7,000 pledged. It's only a small goal, as the game is about 80% complete according to the developer.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore &amp; Discover: Secrets, treasures, and lore across six unique environments.</li>
<li>Challenging Dungeons: Solve intricate puzzles and traps in eight distinct dungeons.</li>
<li>Dynamic Combat: Use a katana, magical items, and ranged weapons to defeat enemies.</li>
<li>Epic Boss Battles: Confront eight unique district rulers with bold personalities.</li>
<li>Retro Vibes: 80s-inspired visuals and a chiptune soundtrack for a nostalgic feel.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Co-op puzzler PICO PARK: Classic Edition is now permanently free</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Thanks to a bit of a woops, PICO PARK:Classic Edition from TECOPARK is now staying free to play, permanently.</p>
<p>What is it? PICO PARK:Classic Edition is a local/online multiplayer action puzzle platformer game for 2-10 players. Originally released in 2016 it had a big upgrade in September 2025 to refresh the visuals, add online play, add Steam Input support and add support for monitors running at 60Hz or higher.</p>
<p>It was paid before, then temporarily made free during 2021 and then back to a paid game. This time was only supposed to be free for about a week but it has to stick now.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14649789471759925812gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Writing in a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/461040/view/527607029268743823" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> the developer said: "I was planning to switch to a paid plan after updating the online support. but I forgot that once you switch from paid to free, I can never go back to paid! :) If you enjoy playing this free version, be sure to try the series (PICO PARK , PICO PARK 2) too". They also mentioned in a <a href="https://x.com/teco_park/status/1974686893934870679" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X (translated) that Steam told them they could not make it paid again due to going free multiple times.</p>
<p>So now it's basically a nice intro game to the full PICO PARK and PICO PARK 2, both of which have an overall Very Positive rating on Steam. Great co-op fun if you're in need of another to add to your list.</p>

      <title>System Shock 2 (1999) is getting delisted and bundled with the 25th Anniversary Remaster</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nightdive Studios / Atari have announced that the classic System Shock 2 (1999) is getting delisted from stores on October 10th. This means you won't be able to buy it, but existing purchases will remain so you can still download and play it.</p>
<p>It's not all bad news though, as the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/238210/view/503964319779651936" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam noted it's going to be bundled with the newer System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster. Although, the remaster is a fair bit pricier at £23.99 compared with £6.99 for the original.</p>
<p>One interesting point about this is that it's part of the GOG Preservation Program, and so far GOG don't seem to have announced a change for their store but it's likely it will happen at some point. GOG did <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/blizzard-are-delisting-warcraft-i-and-ii-from-gog-so-gog-adds-a-special-discount-and-will-keep-them-updated/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announce late last year</a> when Warcraft I and II were removed that they've extended their compatibility promise to keep delisted games updated as well. In this case though it shouldn't matter too much especially if GOG gets them bundled together, it's at least not being completely removed like we've seen with other games in the past.</p>

      <title>The cross-platform Nexus Mods app brings a fancy new mod downloads page</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The newer in-development cross-platform open source Nexus Mods app has improved again, bringing with it a proper built-in downloads page.</p>
<p>With this, it makes it much easier to download mods directly from the Nexus Mods website and manage the downloads across different games. Allowing you to pause, resume or cancel mod downloads. A necessary step towards supporting bigger mods for some of the bigger games.</p>
<p>You can also now make an editable copy of a Nexus Mods Collection, there's a new early version of a Conflict Viewer to ensure you have mods that work properly together and a few bug fixes too.</p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8272985671759917049gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8272985671759917049gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Currently the app has full support for Stardew Valley and Cyberpunk, with work ongoing towards Baldur's Gate 3, Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord, Skyrim and Fallout 4. Really keen to see this app expand to make modding easier on Linux platforms like SteamOS / Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>PowerWash Simulator 2 release date confirmed for October</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Time to get your rubber gloves on again, as PowerWash Simulator 2 is going to officially arrive later this month with a discount if you have the original.</p>
<p>A game that likely needs no introduction. The name alone gives it away, and the original was pretty popular. It's all about making various locations squeaky clean. This time you'll be able to do it with friends in split-screen co-op in addition to online play.<em> Even though you should probably be cleaning your own house right?</em></p>
<p>Developer FuturLab confirmed it arrives on October 23rd priced at $24.99 / €24.99 / £19.99 / JP¥2970. You'll get a 15% launch discount if you own the original PowerWash Simulator.</p>
<p>A new trailer was also provided you can watch below:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Split-Screen &amp; Online Multiplayer</strong> – Clean solo, with a friend on the couch, or with up to four players online – all with shared progression.</li>
<li><strong>Abseiling &amp; Scissor Lift</strong> – Scale buildings, hover over rooftops, and clean from every angle. Don’t worry – fall damage doesn’t exist here.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Stage Jobs</strong> – Just when you think you’ve finished, surprise: there’s more to clean. Some jobs expand mid-wash, unlocking new areas on the fly.</li>
<li><strong>Home Base Customisation</strong> – Restore furniture, decorate your HQ, and keep your base clean(ish). You earned it.</li>
<li><strong>Career Mode</strong> – Take on 38 jobs across increasingly strange, sprawling, and oddly satisfying locations.</li>
<li><strong>Soap, Nozzles &amp; Tools</strong> – Upgrade your washer loadout with adaptable nozzles, surface cleaners, and yes, foamy soap.</li>
<li><strong>Cat Companions</strong> – Ulysses and her kittens are back, following you on jobs and expecting to be petted. Often.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's also a demo available which appeared to work quite nicely with Proton on Linux.</p>

      <title>Vampire Survivors online co-op due out before the end of the year and more announcements are coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer poncle has confirmed that Vampire Survivors much anticipated online co-op update will fully release before the end of the year.</p>
<p>On their official <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vampire.poncle.games/post/3m2m6unial32o" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> account they said "Online co-op is coming to Vampire Survivors on PC and consoles THIS Autumn! (yeah it's autumn right now shh)" and with Autumn ending December 21st - it won't be too long to wait. And on PC you can already try it out in the opt-in Beta on Steam <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/vampire-survivors-latest-beta-adds-online-play-and-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">as covered on GamingOnLinux</a> at the end of August.</p>
<p>They're also teasing more announcements of extra features are to come and said to stay tuned for next week. They also gave the online mode its own trailer, which makes a joke of the "add online button" some developers make about how some gamers expect adding online play to be easy.</p>

      <title>Dying Breed could end up being a real gem for RTS fans - once it&#39;s a bit further along</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Welcome back, commander. Dying Breed is a new retro-inspired real time strategy game from Sarnayer / MicroProse Software out now in Early Access.</p>
<p>Set in a timeline where during World War 2 a whole lot of nukes were fired making the northern part of the world uninhabitable, a new war is brewing — and something about mutants? All hell is about to break loose. Dying Breed is very much inspired by the classic Command &amp; Conquer / Red Alert series from Westwood (now EA), complete with a FMV (Full-motion video) intro along with FMV mission briefings, and it features two completely different story campaigns to play through.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5655413051759841873gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5655413051759841873gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Neither the publisher nor their separate press team replied to a key request from GamingOnLinux, so I went ahead of picked up a personal copy as for me it was too good to pass up. I adore these types of classic base-building strategy games, since I grew up playing the likes of Command &amp; Conquer (amongst many others at the time). Additionally, it seems shortly before release the mentions of Linux and macOS support were actually silently <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2088550/history/?changeid=31349635" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">removed</a> - so you'll need Proton to play it on Linux systems. (<strong>Update</strong>: their PR team sent a key over right after this was published)</p>
<p>My initial thought is that it's like playing a weird mirror-universe version of the classics. The FMV cut-scenes are incredibly cheesy, to the point they're actually a little on the charming side. They're campy and stupid but anyone who likes the classic will probably appreciate them as I did. They've also sprinkled in some short animated scenes too, although they're a fair bit on the rough side they still nicely add to the experience, and in fact reminded me a little of the animated scenes between missions in the 1997 RTS game Dark Colony. With a little flavour of the 1997 RTS game KKND for the mutant side of things too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/762287111759841871gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/762287111759841871gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Taking all the elements together, it's a clear labour of love for classic games from the developer pulling in elements from many different strategy games into a strange but inviting RTS. Very challenging though, some of the missions can feel a little bit too punishing even early on. Seems like the missions are nice and varied though, so it's an interesting challenge but it clearly needs some balancing for the first few missions at the very least to ease players in a bit more.</p>
<p>The pathfinding seriously needs some big improvements though, units get stuck quite often on everything which is quite a nuisance and often just decide to walk across the ore you're gathering (which kills you) instead of walking around it. Fixing up the pathfinding should probably be the first thing they fix up during Early Access as it really harms the experience here. Unit movement overall just needs to be smarter, like medics running out constantly in front of the rest of your group - but then I assume you're supposed to use control groups to manage the separate infantry types on a micro-management level. <em>That certainly would be more like the classic C&amp;C games.</em></p>
<p>Since it's in Early Access and not finished, I'll refrain from giving any true opinion on it, but thankfully for now it does appear to work very nicely with Proton 9.0-4 tested on Kubuntu 25.04. No issues at all in terms of stability or Linux-specific bugs so far.</p>
<p>In the current version it offers:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>2 playable factions, each with unique units and structures.</li>
<li>22 story missions (38 maps total).</li>
<li>43 FMV and 3D videos (25 minutes of cinematics, including intro).</li>
<li>70+ units and 58 structures, from fortifications to hero units.</li>
<li>23 live actors, 75 3D models, 19 original music tracks (83 minutes total), and 1000+ voice lines.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They have a clear <a href="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images//43693320/758c9881f7786dca23e338d74cb859c805c2c41b.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">roadmap</a> on what's planned to come to the game including 12 new missions, modding support, performance improvements, an AI overhaul and more.</p>
<p>Very keen to see more from it as it continues through Early Access.</p>

      <title>CloverPit hits the jackpot on Steam grabbing 500,000 sales</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Much like with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/megabonk-is-a-mega-success-selling-1-million-in-2-weeks-after-being-repeatedly-told-to-delay-it/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Megabonk being a success</a>, we have another good one here with CloverPit managing to be quite the hit on Steam. <em>A horrific fusion of Balatro and Buckshot Roulette.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11770754381759837873gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Announced on their <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/panikarcade.bsky.social/post/3m2ezsk5owj2v" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, the developers said it's hit 500,000 sales in only 8 days since the launch. Made by a small team too, although with publishing help from Future Friends Games, it goes to show that anything can happen but success is still never a guarantee.</p>
<p>In the case of CloverPit, they did manage to hook in some big YouTubers like Blitz, RTGame, Northernlion and more I've never heard of before with multiple millions of followers that covered it. Not a really big surprise though, considering the gambling theme of the game it was bound to be a hit for people doing videos on it. Goes to show that YouTube is still a huge driver of sales for game developers. Developer Panik Arcade has clearly hit their own jackpot here.</p>
<p>Nice to see some more smaller developers keep hitting gold.</p>
<p>You can see some of my own thoughts on it in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/pull-the-lever-to-gamble-and-break-the-machine-in-cloverpit-a-slot-machine-with-horror-vibes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the previous GamingOnLinux article</a>. The game works great on Linux Desktop PCs with Proton and Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Tears of Metal is pretty much a co-op Scottish Dynasty Warriors with fun upgrades and a demo worth trying</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A roguelike Scottish Dynasty Warriors? Sort of. Tears of Metal has a demo out now on Steam and if you love a good hack and slash, this is one to try out. Developed by Paper Cult, who previously released Bloodroots back in 2021. </p>
<p>Tears of Metal is a medieval hack-and-slash co-op roguelike. Carve through hordes of enemies to reclaim your island with the help of your formidable Scottish battalion. As you advance deeper into the trenches, uncover more about the mysterious Dragon Meteor and the treacherous enemy invasion. You go through slaying hordes of enemies using various different types of attacks and specials, and once each battle is completed you'll be able to pick a special upgrade to buff up your character.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5621696531759836778gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>It's all about the replay value here. Each run through will be different, giving you a chance to try out all sorts of powerful builds. Not just for you though, you have your own little army of Scottish soldiers who you can upgrade and improve throughout your campaign too. And, between campaigns, there's also a little settlement you can upgrade to access shops and permanent upgrades.</p>
<p>You can even play it in online co-op for up to 4 players, so looks like another one to add to our growing list of fun co-op games.</p>
<p>The game works great on Desktop Linux PCs with Proton and it should work quite well on Steam Deck too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kdt4o55qMG0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/501cf4283716c2ccdeafe3a5d2cd0089.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kdt4o55qMG0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The demo was refreshed for the upcoming Steam Next Fest giving you these highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>March through the first act, culminating in a clash with Gilles the Hog.</li>
<li>Fight solo or side-by-side in 4-player co-op.</li>
<li>Harness power from 4 clans of Emblems (more await in the full campaign).</li>
<li>Unlock 30+ Charms earned through challenges.</li>
<li>Strengthen your army and hero with weapons, trinkets, skins, and more.</li>
<li>Brave the Challenge System for higher difficulty and replayability.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Death Road to Canada gets a major free update with new game modes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>9 years after the original release, Death Road to Canada is still going with a major update released with fun new game modes. The game has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified too!</p>
<p>What is it? Built to be replayed. It's a randomly generated road trip simulator, set in a zombie apocalypse. You build up a team of survivors to explore cities and face big swarms.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5180991171759835470gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>With the QUADRICEPS update now live it adds in these game modes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>INFECTION
	<ul>
<li>Time is ticking until you all turn into zombies. Every zombie you kill increases the timer, but only once you leave the mission to rest!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SEVERE WEATHER MODE
	<ul>
<li>Less zombies, but now it's you versus the elements. New, dangerous weather patterns. And all this inclement weather makes everyone more hungry.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>RPG Mode
	<ul>
<li>Classes and powerups, in my Death Road? TRIPLE the zombies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>4 Jerks SCEPTER Mode
	<ul>
<li>Start with 4 people, all with strange new powers. ALSO TRIPLE the zombies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a lot more than just that though. There's also multiple new locations, new special characters, new weapons, new hats, new perks and various bug fixes.</p>
<p>In regards to the future of the game, even though they're working on their next game, Death Road to Canada is still going to get even more big updates. They're "about halfway done" with the next update and it sounds like even more gameplay modes will be added.</p>

      <title>Megabonk is a mega success selling 1 million in 2 weeks, after being repeatedly told to delay it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Even though they were told constantly to delay the release, developer vedinad who made Megabonk has clearly cut through the noise with it now a mega success. <em>I really love it, you can see some thoughts in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/megabonk-is-risk-of-rain-2-fused-with-vampire-survivors-and-its-glorious/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the previous GamingOnLinux article</a>.</em></p>
<p>Just as the game was releasing the developer put up a short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QehSvrRwvPY" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">video</a> to note how "Everyone has been warning me not to release my game today. Because my game launches in the middle of other massive games." (with the video showing the likes of Hades II, Silksong and Borderlands 4). The developer continues to say "Basically, I have to delay my game — is what I would say if I was a little ***. I don't care. Boom. Megabonk is out now".</p>
<p>Clearly, they were a little <em>insane</em>. Then again, so is every game developer. Nothing is a guaranteed success, it doesn't matter if you're a huge publisher or a solo developer, sometimes it's just pure luck. In this case, they were just onto something great. As the developer posted on X, in two weeks they've made a million sales.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4124974421759833913gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Just to put it into some wider perspective for you. It's had an all-time player peak of 117,336 which it hit on October 5th, which is a little bit more than Hades II has ever seen. And not far off half of the all-time peak for Borderlands 4, which was a massively anticipated game from a huge publisher with lots of marketing.</p>
<p>It's just seriously impressive that we keep seeing these smaller games come along with a tweak on a popular idea, and hit it big like this.</p>
<p>Anyway, Megabonk is cool. Go play it.</p>

      <title>Luanti (formerly Minetest) v5.14 brings an improved minimap, particle improvements and UI tweaks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Luanti (formerly Minetest) has a fresh small release out with v5.14 bringing a couple of gameplay tweaks and various other improvements. What is Luanti? An open source voxel game engine. You can play many different games made with it, like the popular <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/the-minecraft-like-free-and-open-source-game-voxelibre-v0-90-brings-dynamic-settings-and-new-fire-spreading/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VoxeLibre</a> pictured below.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4626810671759832437gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - VoxeLibre in Luanti</em></p>
<p>This Luanti release makes a tweak to the main menu to help prevent player confusion, removing world-related options when no world is selected. They've also made it easier to select text in the menu and game text fields, and nametags can now scale by distance to help you see who is nearby and who aren't. Some other changes to the game include an update to particles like the when you're digging, with these now shown to all players, not just you.</p>
<p>My favourite little change from this release is the upgrade to how the minimap works. Now it actually shows the correct tiles on top of land, like grass, so you know exactly what's around you. Small thing but looks much better.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/469638001759831915gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Grass on minimap in Devtest before and after</em></p>
<p>There's also been some optimizations to how certain mapblocks are stored, plus textures should now load faster with paths being cached and more.</p>
<p>Lots to come in future release with some of their plans to include inventory image animations, a dark mode theme for the main menu, more accessibility settings and the list goes on.</p>

      <title>Dino society is about to fall apart in the pre-apocalyptic action adventure GNAW</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dinosaurs were able to suppress their cannibalistic urges and build a society, where of course it all goes to hell in GNAW. An action platformer metroidvania that will release sometime in 2026, and it really does look impressive. You'll have to take a bite out of this one.</p>
<p>What an interesting spin on dinosaur life and an apocalypse this one is. A "MEATeor" (see what they did there?) crashed into New Dino City, sending its residents into a feral state they had suppressed for millions of years. You'll be running, jumping and spinning through a vast network of interconnected regions as you gradually acquire new powers all while trying to save the city from total collapse.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0eUScZrYfVk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f895a74bce4d12162e0b8dfcb5e8eaf6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0eUScZrYfVk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“GNAW combines strong and dynamic combat encounters reminiscent of classic ‘90s mainstays with a lore-rich world full of societal unrest,” says Jon Lawitts, Developer, Redstart Interactive. “This deinonychus will traverse 7 different regions, each with its own distinct landscapes and platforming challenges, while fending off feral critters and vengeful scientific experiments.”</p>
<p>From the press release it's confirmed to have full Native Linux support, and a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3833390/GNAW_Demo/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">demo</a> is live now too.</p>

      <title>Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror - Reforged announced from Revolution Software</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Revolution Software just revealed Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror - Reforged, a faithful reimagining of the the classic 1997 adventure game. This will follow up on their success with Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars: Reforged that was released last year.</p>
<p>"The Smoking Mirror has always been one of our most loved games, and with Reforged we were able to enhance it in ways that respect the original while making it shine for modern audiences". says Charles Cecil, founder and CEO of Revolution Software. "Just as with the first game, we can't wait for players old and new to experience it again".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hCqq6ngj6Yc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8ef948b859c716b40e21c61350823203.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hCqq6ngj6Yc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><strong>Broken Sword - The Smoking Mirror: Reforged will include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Step into the shoes of American tourist George Stobbart and sharp-witted French journalist Nico Collard as they unravel a deadly Mayan conspiracy steeped in ancient artifacts and dark magic.</li>
<li>Travel across Europe, the Carribean, and Central America, solving puzzles, outsmarting enemies, and piecing together the mystery behind the terrifying “Smoking Mirror”.</li>
<li>Experience the game’s iconic locations, illustrated in beautiful high definition, coupled with crisp audio for the first time.</li>
<li>Switch between the original 1997 version of the game and the new reforged visuals at the click of a button.</li>
<li>Play the game the way that you want to - choose between a ‘traditional mode’ for people who enjoy adventures the way they used to be, and a ‘story mode’ for those who want subtle hints to ensure they never get frustrated.</li>
</ul>
<p>They confirmed in the press release it will have full Linux support.</p>
<p>It's not a set deal yet though for the game to actually properly be complete, as they'll be launching a Kickstarter crowd funding campaign to get it over the finishing line.</p>

      <title>Crysis Remastered Trilogy gets a GOG release with the original Crysis now in the GOG Preservation Program</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GOG have once again expanded their store with the release of the <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/crysis_remastered_trilogy" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Crysis Remastered Trilogy</a>, along with their promise of keeping the original Crysis working.<em> Be sure to also check out the official <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-play-games-from-gog-and-epic-games-on-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux Guide to get GOG games on Linux</a>.</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">With this all three of the updated games are available on GOG either as a <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/crysis_remastered_trilogy" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">bundle</a> or you can purchase them individually:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/crysis_remastered" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Crysis Remastered</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/crysis_2_remastered" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Crysis 2 Remastered</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/crysis_3_remastered" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Crysis 3 Remastered</a></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20738373541759758038gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/crysis" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">original Crysis</a> is the only one currently noted to be now in the GOG Preservation Program. And with that GOG promise to keep it running on modern systems along with providing technical support.</p>
<p>They also recently had the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/tomb-raider-definitive-survivor-trilogy-now-available-on-gog/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tomb Raider Definitive Survivor Trilogy release</a> along with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/gog-expands-their-preservation-program-to-include-gothic-1-2-mortal-kombat-trilogy-and-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">multiple</a> other <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/even-more-yes-again-classics-join-the-gog-preservation-program/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">expansions</a> of the Preservation Program.

      <title>Merge dogs to make bigger dogs in the delightfully silly roguelike deckbuilder Dogpile</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I love how delightfully silly Dogpile is as you drop various types of dogs into a vertical yard where they merge into bigger dogs. <em>What a wonderfully cute idea this is.</em></p>
<p>Dogpile is the first collaboration between the co-developers Studio Folly and Toot Games, the audio design team A Shell in the Pit, and the co-publishing team at WINGS.</p>
<p>A roguelike deck-builder they say (everything is a roguelike now apparently). Play your dogs, get money, customise them with special traits to refine your deck and then play more dogs. There's even a demo you can try right now on the Steam page and it works perfectly with Proton 9 on Linux Desktop. It's all about building up your money and bones, which you can then use to extend and upgrade your pack of dogs, and eventually unleash some insane combinations that might just break the game.</p>
<p>Check out the reveal trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aofUQAqCUx8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/777f8e7fa7cd7b0e1684fa2fec3cb936.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aofUQAqCUx8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What really helps to sell it is all the cute little animations on each individual dog. And, like any good deck-builder, there's various special relics (or dog tags in this case) you can buy to help boost you along the way. You'll need that boost too, with the Balatro flavour of it as you attempt to beat the increasing amount of bones you need for each round.</p>
<p>Physics are involved too since you're dropping them into the yard like a big rock, where some unexpected things can happen. Like the dog tag you can get that flips the entire pit when you have to shuffle your deck, which is quite amusing to watch. You can even make the physics <em>bouncier</em> with the right dog tag added to your collection which makes it even funnier.</p>
<p>It's just amusing that they call where you place your dogs the yard, but it's as if the yard is completely vertical, so they drop into what looks like a pit. A pit of dogs. <em>I'm sure that's totally safe right?</em></p>
<p>Your dog cards have all sorts of individual special traits too. Some might help you, some might mess with you. Traits like dropping another dog instantly from your hand, or being crated so they cannot combine. Other traits are quite funny like how they might push other dogs away from barking (which is especially hilarious with bouncy upgrades).</p>
<p>The more I played of it to see all of the traits and upgrades available in the demo, the more I fell in love with it and I think you'll love it too.</p>
<p>Right onto my wishlist this went. The demo was but a small slice but a brilliant idea.</p>

      <title>LEGO The Incredibles gets a small update to improve Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>LEGO The Incredibles from TT Games / Warner Bros. recently had a small update to bring it up to an official Steam Deck Playable status.</p>
<p>In the update posted on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/818320/view/547873227591910840" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> they didn't go into any details on what's changed, but they did note that Steam Cloud saving is also now enabled. They previously did similar small updates for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/lego-the-lord-of-the-rings-gets-updated-and-its-now-steam-deck-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">LEGO The Lord of the Rings</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/lego-batman-2-dc-super-heroes-gets-steam-deck-verified-and-cloud-saves/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes</a> which are both now Steam Deck Verified. In the case of LEGO The Incredibles, small text is stopping it being fully Verified.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8114851571759746452gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Would be nice if the developers actually explained what they changed. Still, nice to see classic games get updated don't you think?</p>
<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Experience the thrilling adventures of the Parr family as they conquer crime and family life through both Disney-Pixar films The Incredibles and Incredibles 2, in a LEGO® world full of fun and humor. LEGO® The Incredibles allows players to explore action-packed story levels and an epic hub world - including Municiberg, as they use their unique “Super” abilities to bring the city’s Super Villains to justice.

      <title>Fan-made Unreal remake Unreal Redux shows off a fancy new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With no release date yet, the fan-made remake of Unreal named Unreal Redux looks like it's really coming along nicely. Epic Games won't be doing their own remaster or remaking any time soon, so it's up to the community to show off what a classic Unreal the FPS actually is.</p>
<p>Calling it a remake doesn't quite do it justice though, as technically it's mod as it's still being made for the original Unreal with Unreal Engine 1 thanks to the community OldUnreal patches.</p>
<p>See their latest trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Pw8zyKdyQsQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/641ef675607061b62c223b68a569d376.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Pw8zyKdyQsQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More from the <a href="https://unrealredux.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">official site</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unreal Redux is a fan made project to remake the game Unreal which was released in the year 1998. This remake will stay close to the original game but will be enhanced with new features.</p>
<p>Unreal 1 was revolutionary for its time and the Redux version will transport the player back into the past to revive the unique feelings and emotions conveyed by the original game.</p>
<p>This remake is based and runs on Unreal Engine 1 which is extremely enhanced by the new oldunreal’s 227 patch. Therefore, the remake is able to catch the flair and atmosphere of the original Unreal while beeing improved with new visual effects and gameplay mechanics.</p>
<p>The insane weaponry of Unreal becomes more visually stunning than before and gives now the feedback that they are kicking asses for sure!</p>
<p>Unreal Redux will be a new experience to everyone who is stranded on NaPali.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Buckshot Roulette meets Big Pharma in the latest game from Free Lives, and it's as grim as you might expect it to be with that sort of description.</p>
<p>Two test subjects. One twisted medical trial. Only one leaves. Each round you'll be presented with a selection of pills. Some are helpful, some are harmful, and some mean instant death. Outlast your opponent in order to win. According to what I was sent over an early prototype of Side Effects went viral on itch.io and YouTube, drawing millions of views and hundreds of thousands of plays. </p>
<p>Here's the demo trailer below:</p>

      <title>Unity devs are scrambling to update their games due to a recent security issue</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Unity team recently <a href="https://unity.com/security/sept-2025-01" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> a security issue in their game engine, with lots of developers scrambling to update their games. Valve actually already implemented their own fix to help with it in a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/steam-stable-update-brings-end-of-life-notice-for-32-bit-windows-and-lots-of-bug-fixes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent Steam Client update</a> but a fix in games is still the best thing for developers to do.</p>
<p>Some developers temporarily removed their games for sale while they worked to update their games to a newer version of Unity. According to Unity the affect platforms included Android, Linux, Windows and macOS. The Unity team said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Applications that were built using affected versions of the Unity Editor are susceptible to an unsafe file loading and local file inclusion attack depending on the operating system, which could enable local code execution or information disclosure at the privilege level of the vulnerable application. There is no evidence of any exploitation of the vulnerability nor has there been any impact on users or customers. Unity has provided fixes that address the vulnerability and they are already available to all developers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This prompted Valve to even post their own full <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/524229329545071275?utm_source=SteamDB" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on it for developers as it's such a major issue.</p>
<p>It affects the Unity game engine going back quite a lot of versions, however Unity are only supporting fixes for Unity 2019.1 or newer.</p>

      <title>Wine 10.16 released with fast synchronization support using NTSync</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>At the weekend Wine 10.16 was released finally answering all the questions on when NTSync will land - well it's here now.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The main changes from Wine 10.16 are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fast synchronization support using NTSync.</li>
<li>16-bit apps supported in new WoW64 mode.</li>
<li>Initial support for D3DKMT objects.</li>
<li>WinMD (Windows Metadata) files generated and installed.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>To benefit from NTSync you still need a recent Linux kernel version, with kernel 6.14 or later. You likely also need to actually enable NTSync in the kernel, as most distributions do not have it on by default.</p>
<p>For bugs fixed in this release they noted improvements for Need for Speed III, Shadow Company: Left for Dead, Alpha Polaris, Face Noir, A Stroke of Fate series, Overwatch, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat, Metro 2033, Project CARS, Wolfenstein: The Old Blood and New Order, Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen, Star Wars: Jedi Knight - Dark Forces II and more.</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/releases/wine-10.16" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Wine GitLab</a></p>
<p>We're still waiting on Proton 10 from Valve exiting Beta, which should hopefully be soon and then onto Wine 11 and Proton 11 sometime eventually next year.</p>

      <title>Proton Hotfix updated to improve FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles released on September 30th and while it's Steam Deck Verified, it had some troubles on Desktop Linux.</p>
<p>Valve just released an update to Proton Hotfix which should sort out the most pressing issues with playing it on Desktop Linux including the game not launching properly, and some very annoying background flickering as noted on the <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/9078" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub bug report</a>. All you need to do is change over your Proton version for it to Proton Hotfix. Check out <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-change-the-proton-version-on-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the GamingOnLinux guide</a> if you don't know how to do that.</p>
<p>A remaster of the 1997 classic, FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles transports players to the war-torn Kingdom of Ivalice, a medieval realm fractured by political infighting, class struggle and the ambitions of rival noble houses in the wake of the Fifty Years' War. Against this backdrop appear Ramza, third son of House Beoulve, one of Ivalice's leading military families, and his childhood companion Delita, a commoner raised amongst nobles, who find themselves on opposing sides of a war brewing within the kingdom.</p>

<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Key features include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tactical Battles that Define the Genre - </strong>Engage in strategic, turn-based combat across diverse and dynamic terrains where every decision matters. Terrain advantages, unit positioning, and character customization come together to deliver thrilling battles full of unexpected twists. This acclaimed battle system is what makes <em>FINAL FANTASY TACTICS – The Ivalice Chronicles</em> a quintessential tactical RPG experience.</li>
<li><strong>Robust Job System – </strong>Utilize over 20 jobs and 300 abilities, from black mage to dragoon to time mage—each job features a distinct skill kit, which can be further customized by assigning abilities learned from other jobs, providing nearly endless builds and strategies unique to each player’s playstyle.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced &amp; Classic Versions – </strong>The enhanced version of the game includes a breadth of new features such as updated visuals, an overhauled UI, added dialogue and full voice acting alongside quality-of-life enhancements like fast-forward and autosave. The classic version lets players relive the faithful 1997 classic with the renowned <em>War of the Lions</em> translation—discover what made the original a timeless masterpiece.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Since release it has managed to get a Very Positive rating on Steam which is great to see.</p>

      <title>The truly excellent Utopia Must Fall has a new Beta with Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Utopia Must Fall is great base-defense arcade shooter, easily <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/utopia-must-fall-is-easily-one-of-the-best-modern-arcade-shoot-em-ups/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">one of my favourites that I played earlier this year</a> and soon Steam Deck players will enjoy it.</p>
<p>More about it: Utopia Must Fall is a vector-flavored base-defending arcade shooter with rapid progression, procedurally generated attack waves and enough upgrade variety to suit both the defensive or aggressive player. It incorporates elements from tower defense, roguelikes and beyond, all neatly packaged into a laser-sharp bullet-purgatory arcade frenzy!</p>
<p>Writing about the update developers Pixeljam said "This update is a little different, as it focuses mainly on performance, graphics options, Steam Deck support, quality-of-life features, and lots of small additions and improvements" and that it was a "necessary update to pave the way for new content, which will be much easier to add now that we have these others things out of the way" - so there's even more to come.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5713357971759496826gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>For the Steam Deck they added controller support, and suggest you use the latest Proton 10 Beta. And you'll want to set "Disable Frame Limit" in the Steam Deck performance settings for it to v-sync properly.</p>
<p>Aside from that there's some other major changes to improve it including:</p>
<blockquote>​​​​
<ul>
<li>Entirely new vector rendering system built from scratch</li>
<li>Around 6x faster raw line drawing performance!</li>
<li>Custom effect shader pipeline</li>
<li>Multisample antialiasing up to 4x</li>
<li>Variable pixel density up to 2.0x</li>
<li>Improved system loop timing: legacy 'delta' timing mode removed</li>
<li>Significant optimisation gains in collision detection, entity management, memory traffic, etc.</li>
<li>More accurate collision detection</li>
<li>After one launch into fullscreen via the windowed intro, the app will auto launch into fullscreen next time (unless the app is set to windowed again while running and then quit)</li>
<li>New CRT effects (bezel reflections, barrel distortion, phosphor trails, new overlays)</li>
<li>New graphics options: aperture (beam width), dwell (corner sharpness)</li>
<li>Manual viewport scaling options</li>
<li>New audio mix: sound effects, aux reverb and speech generator are dynamics compressed in a dedicated bus (pre-fader), music channels are no longer affected by global dynamics compression</li>
<li>Experimental X/Y oscilloscope audio renderer (requires high sample-rate DC-coupled audio interface, not practical for or enabled in UMF yet)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>The Crazy Hyper-Dungeon Chronicles (TCHDC) is for fans of dungeon crawlers with roguelite replayability</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Filled up with eccentric characters, tricky foes, plenty of jokes, and a lot of pop culture references - The Crazy Hyper-Dungeon Chronicles (TCHDC) sounds fun.</p>
<p>A rather unique take on dungeon crawling too. It's equal parts a throwback to the golden age of dungeon crawling as it is its own thing. Featuring a unique fusion of turn-based strategy for the battles that blends in some twitch-based arcade styled action. I can't think of any other game that mashes things together in the way that TCHDC does. First highlighted <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/the-crazy-hyper-dungeon-chronicles-tchdc-combines-the-ideas-of-undertale-and-dungeon-master/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here on GamingOnLinux back in July 2025</a>.</p>
<p>It's releasing still on October 23rd, but now they have an even fresher demo available. With support for Native Linux and Steam Deck. Check out the new trailer too:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Q2iITSMeGOs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d8fc97c1120c47a32b7f62c7fd1590d5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Q2iITSMeGOs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What's new in this demo includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Saves wiped! Major game rebalance: as a result, old saves had to be deleted. Don’t panic—this should be the last time!</li>
<li>New combat intro! Doesn’t change the gameplay but adds the right dose of tension before every battle.</li>
<li>Improved journal: clearer, prettier, and more useful.</li>
<li>Tactical battle pause: you can now pause while still observing the battlefield to better plan your strategy. Not available for the Destroyer (you wanted it hard, right?).</li>
<li>Tweaked enemy combat styles: small adjustments to make them more interesting (and less predictable).</li>
<li>Adjusted some Hero powers.</li>
<li>Various bugfixes: weapons that behave as they should, recipes now complete, typos fixed, and the game exploding a bit less… all thanks to the reports from many players!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus II gets a first demo live now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What will no doubt be a popular release, Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus II from Bulwark Studios and Kasedo Games now has a demo available. The first game did have a Native Linux version, but this will not - so you'll need to run it with Proton on Linux systems.</p>
<p>More about Machanicus II: "After millennia of slumber, Vargard Nefershah mobilises her dynasty’s legions to annihilate the Adeptus Mechanicus interlopers who unknowingly settled upon her world. Across the galaxy, Magos Dominus Faustinius is summoned to bring his hard-won expertise to bear and ensure the Necrons do not succeed. The conflict soon becomes a crucible of unanticipated significance, drawing to it external actors stranger and more deadly still.</p>
<p>Two playable factions, two narrative campaigns, two highly unique play-styles and one important choice – who will you lead to victory in this arcane technological war of cold metal hatred?"</p>
<p>You can see the original gameplay overview from August below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="XD_nKRCwz0w"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4b8f69d2729dbddbda4d02629dfc6639.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/XD_nKRCwz0w" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>About what the demo will offer: For the very first time, players can experience the prologue of the game, where they will play as both the Adeptus Mechanicus, battling against the awakening of a Necron tomb world, and the Necrons, who strive for the resurgence of their dynasty.</p>
<p>The hands-on demo offers players a taste of the strategic gameplay that is again at the forefront of the action, with players able to assemble forces for each mission, choosing from a vastly expanded selection of fighters from each faction’s range. New environmental mechanics will also require players to maneuver their forces like never before and play to their chosen faction’s strengths and weaknesses - take cover behind terrain as the Mechanicus, or destroy it as the Necrons.</p>

      <title>Aggro Crab (PEAK, Another Crab&#39;s Treasure, Going Under) revealed a new co-op game Crashout Crew</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Crashout Crew is the latest casual comedy co-op game from Aggro Crab (PEAK, Another Crab's Treasure, Going Under). Another great looking title to add to your lists of co-op games to play with friends!</p>
<p>It's a 1 to 4 player cooperative forklift experience in which players will fulfill increasingly chaotic orders, delivering physics-based packages to the best of their abilities in a warehouse full of safety hazards. A demo is gonig to be available for Steam Next Fest containing the first three levels.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="g5zAxMMDE2U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1c0641c7c4db52e7dbd78686d92dd360.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/g5zAxMMDE2U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A bit more info behind the scenes — Crashout Crew is the other half of the 2025 game-jam projects from Aggro Crab. After the recent cancellation of Going Under 2, the studio decided to explore the whimsy multiplayer side of game development. While some of Aggro Crab developed PEAK with Landfall, the rest of the studio locked in to produce Crashout Crew! </p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Online, lobby-based co-op physics chaos for up to 4 players.</li>
<li>A variety of contracts to complete, each with a unique set of crazy boxes to ship.</li>
<li>Manage your stress, and don’t crash out - or you’ll end up making your friends’ lives even tougher!</li>
<li>Upgrade your warehouse and forklift to make the job easier! It’ll all reset after the contract, so no need to hoard your money!</li>
<li>Additional Safety Violations modify the warehouse to add even more chaos! If the shift was tough before, just wait until the lights go out!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Crashout Crew should launch in 2026. And no doubt it will work well with Proton to play on Linux systems.</p>

<p>EvoCreo brings a fresh take on the creature-collector genre while paying homage to the classics. With more than 170 Creo to capture and evolve, uncover the dark truth behind the nefarious group known as the Shadow Hive. Face off against elite Evokers and ancient legends, challenge five elemental arenas, and build an unstoppable team of monsters to take on anything standing in your path along the way."</p>

      <title>Steam stable update brings end of life notice for 32-bit Windows and lots of bug fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released the latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/507340830949770870" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> to the Steam client, making it a good time to jump to Linux if you're still on Windows 10.</p>
<p>The Steam client will now warn people on 32-bit Windows 10 that it's reached end of life, so people will need to upgrade. And hey, Linux has come a long way thanks to all the support from Valve with projects like Proton to run Windows games - so it's a perfect time to switch.</p>
<p>And if you missed it recently Valve also added <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/steam-link-vr-now-available-for-pico-and-htc-headsets-plus-valve-confirm-experimental-linux-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Link VR support for PICO and HTC headsets</a>, plus Valve confirmed experimental Linux support for it too!</p>
<p>Other changes in the latest Steam update include a security fix for Unity games, a DualSense crash on Linux and more you can read below:</p>
<blockquote><strong>General</strong>
<ul>
<li>Added mitigations for Unity CVE-2025-59489, blocking a game launch through the Steam Client when an exploit attempt is detected.</li>
<li>Added "End of Life" alert for 32-bit versions of Windows. Currently Windows 10 32-bit is the only 32-bit version of Windows supported by Steam.
	<ul>
<li>The Steam client will continue running on Windows 10 64-bit and 32-bit games will continue to be supported.</li>
<li>Steam Client support for Windows 10 32-bit will end on Jan 1st, 2026 at 10am. See <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/faqs/view/49A1-B944-48B8-FF00" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> for additional details.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed "\" characters appearing in some news posts</li>
<li>Added ability to switch tabs in the tabbed browser by pressing CTRL+TAB</li>
<li>Fixed some cases where access to "Mark as private" game setting was unavailable.</li>
<li>Fixed some cases where adding a large number of non-Steam games to a collection would fail.</li>
<li>Fixed some "Friends &amp; Chat" settings occasionally resetting to their default value temporarily after getting disconnected from Steam</li>
<li>Fixed a case where a user's achievements would fail to display in the overlay when activated by a game.</li>
<li>Fixed scroll arrow buttons on Post-Game Summary overscrolling to the end of the summary instead of the next non-visible item.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare crash when constructing the menu for the tray icon on Windows.</li>
<li>Fixed a case the client window could keep growing in size for WindowsBlinds theme users</li>
</ul>
<strong>In-Game Overlay</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a crash in D3D12 games that could sometimes be triggered by opening and closing sections of the overlay (like notes) rapidly. This could manifest as a game or gpu hang, was easier to trigger in some games than others, and was a new regression in this week's public client update and the last beta cycle. We will test this briefly in beta before shipping as a hotfix to all users.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Game Recording</strong>
<ul>
<li>Improved performance when recording is on for some games using Vulkan rendering</li>
</ul>
<strong>Steam Input</strong>
<ul>
<li>Added support for dual gyros when using Nintendo Switch Joycons in combined mode</li>
<li>Fixed the "listen for binding" panel in the configurator</li>
<li>Fixed the configurator being blank when opening a configuration for an uninstalled game that requires being installed to edit the configuration</li>
<li>When authoring an official configuration for a Steam Input API game, use a setting under Settings-&gt;Developer instead of relying on the SetInputActionManifestFilePath API call</li>
</ul>
<strong>Streaming</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fix cases where clicking "stream" did nothing.</li>
</ul>
<strong>SteamVR</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Steam Client notifications getting suppressed after you exited SteamVR. The suppressed notifications would appear inside your VR headset the next time you started SteamVR.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Accessibility</strong>
<ul>
<li>Improved High Contrast view of game list search and app filter panel</li>
</ul>
<strong>Windows</strong>
<ul>
<li>Added detecting if Secure Boot and a TPM are enabled on the current machine. This information is displayed under <strong>Help</strong> &gt; <strong>System Information</strong>. It is now also collected when opting into the Steam Hardware Survey.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Linux</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a crash when DualSense controllers are connected and idle.</li>
</ul>

      <title>MARVEL Cosmic Invasion gets a demo with Native Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>MARVEL Cosmic Invasion is an upcoming retro-styled beat 'em up from Tribute Games with Dotemu and Gamirror Games. A demo was just released with Linux support.</p>
<p>Tribute Games have previously worked on a number of Native Linux games including Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge and they're also doing the upcoming Scott Pilgrim EX. So it's nice to see direct support continue for MARVEL Cosmic Invasion too!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="IYxemvK0fEI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8e4a07b1ecece2fa1071983f53142919.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/IYxemvK0fEI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The demo features 9 playable heroes including Nova, Spider-Man, Wolverine, Phyla-Vell, Captain America, Storm, Venom, She-Hulk and Rocket Raccoon. There's 2 playable levels in it with New York City and a Helicarrier, plus you can play it in local or online multiplayer too.</p>
<p>The full game will have 15 playable heroes, so this is just a taste of what is to come. </p>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In MARVEL Cosmic Invasion, the immortal Super Villain Annihilus has launched an unprecedented attack across the galaxy, threatening all life as we know it. Super Heroes, both Earth-born and cosmic, must now join forces in a star-spanning adventure against the deadly Annihilation Wave. Brawl through the streets of New York City all the way to the depths of the Negative Zone to foil Annihilus’ vow to spread death across the cosmos in classically inspired side-scrolling combat.</p>
<p>Choose and control your own team of two characters while tagging between them mid-fight with the innovative Cosmic Swap system, capitalizing on distinct superpowers and special attacks to create unique team-ups and dish out devastating damage. Unlock stellar power-ups and rewards while experimenting with different duos and bash through a fantastic collection of locales and nemeses from the MARVEL universe. MARVEL Cosmic Invasion’s action includes a range of accessibility features, empowering the whole family to be Super Heroes (or Super Villains), and supports four-player drop-in/drop-out local and online co-op with crossplay.</p>

      <title>Grounded 2 gets a major update and brings some Steam Deck improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Grounded 2 from Obsidian Entertainment and Eidos-Montréal recently had quite a big upgrade, and now it should work better on the Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>Named the "Hairy and Scary Update" it brings with it AXL, the Colossal Tarantula, which is incredibly creepy. A better building system has been added in too with a grid system to make snapping all your stuff together easier than ever. There's also upgrades to the buggy, new buildings, support for Japanese and Brazilian Portuguese, a new Praying Mantis Armour set and other assorted general improvements.</p>
<p>Specifically for the Steam Deck they noted they "Fixed an issue where Grounded 2 did not launch properly on Steam Deck" and "Tweaked Steam Deck Settings with the updated Graphics Options in the settings".</p>
<p>Check out the update trailer below:</p>

      <title>Below the Crown from the developer of Duskers arrives November with a demo live now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Misfits Attic developers of the excellent Duskers have revealed their quirky blend of genres in Below the Crown will hit Early Access on November 10th. It's a love letter to chess, roguelikes, and dungeon crawlers with a demo that should be live today.</p>
<p>In an email to GamingOnLinux their press team noted "For transparency, I know Linux support is planned, but we're unsure when it will be available at this time". So initially you may need to use Proton to run the Windows version.</p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Covet great riches and please the Emperor by engaging in a satisfying mix of chess, spell slinging, and strategy. As a Wizard, lead a party of chess-inspired pieces, including Bishops, Knights, perhaps even a Mad Queen, to brave a mysterious, ever-changing dungeon.</p>
<p>Outwit the enemy with superior strategic maneuvers, or wing it by flinging freezing spells and explosions. Collect and assign magical runes to increase the challenge level of the next run. Acquire new skills and spell cards to expand the tactical possibilities, as well as the fun.</p>
<p>Connect with the community by competing in challenges, creating and sharing custom boards, and watching repays of other Wizard’s high scores. Post epic victories for all to admire, and answer glitchy psychological evaluations to uncover what’s really going on below the crown. Don’t worry, just answer honestly, and move on with more badass wizard shenanigans.</p>
<p>Engage in an approachable and dynamic experience that honors the dynamism of chess, now with a magical, dark ‘80s sci-fi twist. Below the Crown was created by industry veterans who have worked on everything from well-known series Diablo and Call of Duty to DreamWorks classics, including Shrek 2, How to Train Your Dragon, and Bee Movie.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Below the Crown was ultimately born out of our love for chess and fun, strategic gameplay," said Tim Keenan, Founder, Misfits Attic. “Executing very complex, multistage moves is the best part of the game for some, but can be intimidating for others. By creating an atmospheric and escalating romp through the depths below, we hope to create an experience that both types of players can enjoy."</p>
<p>They also released a first proper gameplay trailer recently too you can watch below:</p>

      <title>Cinematic puzzle-platforming adventure LIFTED gets a new trailer and demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From the mind of former Disney Imagineer Jeffrey Ashbrook and his company Adventure Works, LIFTED looks gorgeous and a lot of fun in the new footage and demo.</p>
<p>The game was previously called Ari Buktu and the Anytime Elevator, looks like it was renamed back in May (<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2184020/history/?changeid=U:62255261" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>). While this new name is easier to remember, it's a lot more generic and boring. At least the gameplay seems like it's still just as great looking.</p>
<p>More about it: "Step into the inquisitive shoes of Ari Buktu, a cool and curious lad simply looking for some extra credit in Professor Lionel Raventhorpe’s science class. Witness the unlikely pair travel through history in an immersive journey full of heart, humor, and imagination. Platform through ancient Egypt and Mayan ruins to find a beautiful tiara for the Professor’s lady love. Evade pirates, solve perplexing puzzles, and beat history’s most notorious troublemakers to the treasure."</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vc3EsJ0odD4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a913085ef8356a93de62fee7ced82fb9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vc3EsJ0odD4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The full game releases sometime in Q1 2026. It has a Native Linux version and they said it's "Perfect for STEAM DECK".</p>

      <title>Amazon Luna cloud gaming will get a refresh with a new social game system - and an AI powered game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Amazon have announced a bit of a refresh is coming to their cloud gaming service Amazon Luna, with new games and new ways to play.</p>
<p>From the announcement they said at some point later this year (they didn't specify) you'll see a "completely redesigned and reimagined Amazon Luna that combines innovative social party games with amazing blockbusters to make every night in your house the perfect game night to share with your family and friends".</p>
<p>The new additions will be included in Amazon Prime subscriptions at no additional cost. This includes "GameNight", a new social play system that doesn't need a controller, you can use a smartphone with games designed around the living room TV with people able to join by a QR code. It all sounds a bit similar to what Jackbox Games do with their party packs. </p>
<p>GameNight will arrive with a collection of social party games that will be added to the service including more than 25 multiplayer games that include "GameNight-optimized takes on favorites like Angry Birds, Draw &amp; Guess, Exploding Kittens and Flappy Golf Party, to party‑ready adaptations of board game hits such as Taboo, Ticket to Ride and Clue".</p>
<p>However, they're also jumping in with more AI generation. One of these games is called Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg which they say is "human‑built" that's an "AI‑powered improv courtroom game where players invent outrageous characters, spin wild stories, and do whatever it takes to defend their testimonies before Judge Snoop Dogg".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ajawdjs6KKA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/719238d06642e6f3daaf9af9867228ff.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ajawdjs6KKA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They also announced a further expansion for traditional gaming. So for those of you who prefer bigger more normal gaming, there's something in the announcement for you too.</p>
<p>With this "all-new" Luna will it have "a diverse and growing library of more than 50 popular, classic, indie, and blockbuster games" including the likes of Hogwarts Legacy, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, and TopSpin 2K25, Dave the Diver, MotoGP 25, Farming Simulator 22, and SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom amongst others like EA SPORTS FC 25, LEGO DC Super-Villains, Team Sonic Racing, and Batman: Arkham Knight.</p>

      <title>Bloober Team announce a Native Steam Deck release for Cronos: The New Dawn</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is the latest survival horror from Bloober Team that arrived September 5th, and they just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2101960/view/498333631688737999" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> a Native Steam Deck release.</p>
<p>This is a little bit confusing though as they <em>already</em> had a Native Linux version at release. The Steam Deck uses SteamOS (Linux), and so it did already have a Native version available. They don't go into <em>any</em> details on what has specifically now been tweaked for the Steam Deck. The announcement simply said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At launch, Cronos arrived as our latest survival horror title with full Steam Deck verification—but that’s not all!</p>
<p>Today, we’ve released a native build of the game for Steam’s handheld console, which means even better performance on this platform.</p>
<p>Enjoy Cronos on Steam, wherever you are!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Valve have also already changed the defaults to use the Native Linux version, where previously it used Proton to run the Windows version. It's possible with the change to the Steam Deck default, they just mean that and they're hyping it up, but without any details it's difficult to tell.</p>
<p>I've reached out to Bloober to see if they could clarify what's changed and improved.</p>
<p>Looking on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2101960/depots/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, there is still the normal Native Linux content depot along with a content depot tagged for the Steam Deck now too. So hopefully this won't cause any issues with downloading it on Desktop Linux PCs<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/baldurs-gate-3-gets-a-native-linux-version-to-improve-it-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> like we saw with the Native Linux version of Baldur's Gate 3 for Steam Deck</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="e5xqIwEAJKs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/57e0a3894f1f67d09e5a018786fb988c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/e5xqIwEAJKs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is a brutal third-person survival horror where you fight for the future by salvaging the past. Burn monsters before they merge. Extract souls from the living. Adapt or die.</p>
<p>Set in a grim world where Eastern European brutalism meets retro-futurist technology, Cronos: The New Dawn lets you experience a gripping story that straddles the line between past and future.</p>
<p>In the past, you will witness a world in the throes of The Change, a cataclysmic event that forever altered humanity. Meanwhile, in the ravaged wastelands of the future, every moment is a fight for survival against dangerous abominations that will test both your reflexes and your tactical thinking.</p>
<p>You are a Traveler working for the enigmatic Collective, tasked with scouring the wastelands of the future in search of time rifts that will transport you to 1980s-era Poland.</p>

      <title>The Elder Scrolls: Arena game engine remake OpenTESArena adds Vulkan support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While OpenTESArena is still a work in progress to bring The Elder Scrolls: Arena up to modern standards, it's looking even better with the 0.17.0 update.</p>
<p>According to the developer the current status is: "Player movement is nearly feature-complete - currently you can jump, climb out of chasms, and swim, but stairsteps are unsolved. Enemies can be killed but their AI is not yet implemented. Items in containers can be picked up and found in the player's inventory but cannot be equipped yet. All world map locations are implemented and the player can fast travel to them. Citizens wander around and have their names generated but conversations are not yet implemented. Character creation is mostly implemented except for class generation questions". You can see the current <a href="https://github.com/afritz1/OpenTESArena/wiki#roadmap" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">roadmap</a> for what's planned across the next few releases.</p>

<p>For this release here's some of what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Vulkan renderer:
	<ul>
<li>Must enable manually in options menu by setting Graphics API to Vulkan.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mesh combining.</li>
<li>Changed forward lighting to tiled forward.</li>
<li>Added classic heavy fog effect.</li>
<li>Added floating origin to reduce Z-fighting and shimmering.</li>
<li>Added tavern patron dialogue.</li>
<li>Increased physics updates per frame to reduce bumpy feeling when moving.</li>
<li>Added baseline .OBJ file format support, used with voxels.</li>
<li>Added inverted mouselook option.</li>
<li>Added Enable Validation Layers option (must have Vulkan validation layers installed).</li>
<li>Improved frame pacing.</li>
<li>Improved high DPI support.</li>
<li>Reduced sky mesh vertices.</li>
<li>Slightly reduced player and citizen move speed.</li>
<li>Updated SDL to 2.0.12.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You need the original files from The Elder Scrolls: Arena to work with it which you can find on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/the_elder_scrolls_arena" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG.com</a>.</p>

      <title>Class-based co-op zombie shooter Projekt Z: Beyond Order gets a new trailer - plans a 2026 release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Projekt Z: Beyond Order is a promising looking upcoming class-based co-op zombie shooter from 314 Arts and we have a fresh short look at it. As far as we know they still plan Linux support which they confirmed to GamingOnLinux multiple times previously.</p>
<p>Inspired by Left 4 Dead, they're hoping to blend "the casual and the hardcore market by implementing a bit of both" they said in an email.</p>
<p>More about it: "Experience the intense action of battling the undead in Projekt Z: Beyond Order, a thrilling first-person zombie shooter with robust character progression and extensive weapon customization. Set around World War II, take on fast-paced missions or explore the terrifying island during expeditions as one of four survivors, each with their own unique abilities and role in 4-player co-op. Shoot, loot, craft, survive."</p>
<p>New trailer below:</p>

<p>I missed it but they also announced back in August that they've moved the release date to sometime in 2026, with no firm date set now. Will keep you posted when I hear more.</p>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 Classic will get an open Beta on October 13 during Steam Next Fest</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Team Fortress 2 Classic is an upcoming mod for Valve's shooter that aims to re-imagine the launch era of the original game and you'll be able to try it soon. Upcoming in the sense of the Steam release that is, as it was originally launched sometime back in 2014.</p>
<p>On Steam the team behind it <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/3545060/announcements/detail/525355229451911904" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> that for Steam Next Fest it's going to get an open Beta test. Seems like it will be filled with a <em>lot</em> of content too.</p>
<p>More about it from the Steam page: "Team Fortress 2 Classic is a mod for Team Fortress 2 that re-imagines the early post-launch era — circa 2008 to 2009 — of the original game. Starting from there, we've added quality-of-life features, remade and reworked scrapped content, and built onto it with full-size updates in homage to TF2's timeless style and tone."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16192301921759250721gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Just a small slice of what's new in the mod includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exclusive new gamemodes, including Domination, Territorial Domination, and VIP Race — all playable on professional-quality official maps, with more yet to come.</li>
<li>Jump pads, flak cannons, bricks, chains wrapped around your fists; made-in-house weapons that go beyond mere sidegrades, and dramatically change how you play the game.</li>
<li>Extensive modding support, allowing players to customize the look of their game, and allowing servers to host advanced custom weapon packs and maps.</li>
<li>A whole host of visual enhancements, including improved textures, models, mapping features, and restored toon-style shading that was mostly absent in the retail release.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every TF2C-exclusive weapon, gamemode, and map* will be returning, available for you to play with during the open beta! A handful of new additions we've made including damage feedback, balance changes, revamped Four-Team support, and more will also be available for testing. Additionally, we have a few extra surprises waiting for you.</p>
<p>Features that won't be showing up just yet are ones mostly unrelated to the core gameplay experience. Achievements and custom weapon support won't be available during the open beta, but are still slated for launch. We're also eyeing further work to the main menu and weapon balancing.</p>
<p>In addition to officially hosted servers, a number of community servers will also be hosting during the event. We've been working with them over the last month to iron out any crashes or technical issues.</p>
<p><em>*Casbah will not be returning in its current form. We apologize for not removing it sooner.</em></p>

      <title>Fallout: London mod gets a huge upgrade with &#34;Rabbit &amp; Pork&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Team FOLON today announced the huge Rabbit &amp; Pork update for the popular Fallout 4 mod Fallout: London. It expands the game in some massive ways.</p>
<p>You can expect to see new quests, companions and lots and lots of bug fixes to smoothen the experience - a lot of which were taken from community feedback on it. In addition to the existing GOG release, they're also now doing their own custom launcher powered by <a href="https://www.overwolf.com/app/teamfolonlimited-folon_launcher" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Overwolf</a>. They also recommend starting a new save for it as otherwise you might see issues.</p>
<p>More about it if you missed it previously: "Set in a reimagined post-apocalyptic London, Fallout: London brings authentic London flavor to the Fallout universe with new factions, locations, and up to 90 hours of gameplay. Built as a completely different experience of Fallout 4, it features a brand-new story, original weapons, London-centric items, and a vast recreation of the ruined city to discover. The “Rabbit &amp; Pork” DLC marks a milestone in its development, delivering the most polished experience yet while making installation faster and more reliable for players worldwide."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some of what's new in the update includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>80 fully-voiced NPCs with 8,000+ new dialogue lines.</li>
<li>30 new quests &amp; minigames.</li>
<li>30 new weapons &amp; armors.</li>
<li>70 new random encounters.</li>
<li>New companion &amp; player home.</li>
<li>New content for early faction introductions.</li>
<li>Thousands of bug fixes and stability improvements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UIZx_KF3Kkc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cbf8b6c558a9dc90a3e394fa12be85d7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UIZx_KF3Kkc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>They're calling it a DLC, but it's not a DLC in the traditional sense of the term. It's an update for the mod.</em></p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“Rabbit &amp; Pork represents the next iteration of Fallout: London. It’s the most complete and stable version yet, with brand-new storylines and characters that push our vision even further,” said Dean Carter, CEO for Team FOLON. “Working with Overwolf to launch the custom installer makes this experience more accessible than ever, removing barriers so fans can dive straight into London.”</p>
<p>“The sheer talent and dedication of Team FOLON is proof that in-game creators are shaping the future of gaming,” said Uri Marchand, CEO at Overwolf. “Projects like Fallout: London show how UGC can extend the shelf life of the world’s most beloved games, bringing fresh lore, worlds, and characters long after launch. Overwolf’s mission is to empower these visionary creators, and we’re proud to help bring their work to millions of players with our easy-to-access launcher.”</p>
<p>You'll need Wine / Proton to play it on Linux since it's a mod for a Windows game. It appeared to work <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/fallout-london-mod-for-fallout-4-has-released-today-on-gog/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">when I previously tested the original release</a>, with help from Heroic Launcher (check out <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-play-games-from-gog-and-epic-games-on-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our guide to GOG games on Linux</a>).</p>

      <title>NVIDIA driver 580.95.05 released as the latest recommended for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA have launched their latest recommended driver for Linux users with driver version 580.95.05 now available.</p>
<p>With it being their latest "Recommended/Certified" driver it means you should be good to upgrade to this version for all your gaming and other needs. As NVIDIA explain: "This driver meets the quality levels applied to Windows drivers that pass testing in Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL), therefore providing the same attention to driver reliability, robustness, and performance for non-Windows operating systems (e.g., Linux)".</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's all that's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added support for YCbCr 4:2:2 display modes over HDMI Fixed Rate Link (FRL). This capability is only supported on Blackwell or later.</li>
<li>Downgraded an error message "Failed to allocate NvKmsKapiDevice" to an informational message "NUMA was not set up yet; ignoring this device" when initializing nvidia-drm in cases where initialization is expected to fail due to NUMA not being online.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused interactive object outlines to not be rendered in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression introduced in the 575 driver series that caused GPUs to be powered on unnecessarily when processing redundant system power source notifications from the ACPI subsystem.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/details/254665/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">NVIDIA</a></p>
<p>And in case you missed the recent news <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/nvidia-are-investing-5-billion-in-intel-to-develop-new-chips-together/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NVIDIA are investing $5 billion in Intel</a> to develop new chips together.</p>
<p><strong>Update 01/10/25</strong>: they also released driver version <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/details/254657/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">570.195.03</a> the same day that notes "Minor bug fixes and improvements".</p>

The developer emailed noting their plan for full Native Linux support at release, and the demo also has a Linux version available (although Steam only shows a Windows icon for the demo currently - they've missed a tickbox somewhere).</p>
<p>More about it: "The city is overrun with villains, and your team is the one to stop them. Put your heroes to the test in diverse battles: from epic duels to chaotic street brawls, and earn incredible rewards. Collect powerful gear, quirky costumes, and rare weapons to enhance your heroes' effectiveness and style."</p>

      <title>Inspired by gameshows Task Time looks like a quality chaotic local and online party game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Taking some inspiration from silly TV gameshows, Task Time needs to be on your list if you're after more games to play with friends either locally or online. I've been trying to find more for my own crew lately, and this looks like just the ticket we need.</p>
<p>A recent announcement from publisher Wired Productions and developer ReadGraves who have worked on titles like Gang Beasts, Fall Guys and more. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10850360071759231570gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10850360071759231570gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19254113941759231572gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19254113941759231572gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“I’ve seen members of the Wired team transform from quiet and measured souls, into mouth frothing and evil laughing demons while playtesting Task Time. That is enough for me to know ReadGraves have delivered a wonderfully chaotic party game” said Leo Zullo, Managing Director at Wired Productions. </p>
<p>“We made Task Time to see what happens when you throw a gameshow, a physics engine and all your friends into a blender.” Said Sam Read-Graves, Creator of Developer ReadGraves. “Task Time is competitive, chaotic and completely unpredictable, where no two rounds are ever the same. It’s an excuse to laugh at each other, celebrate small victories, glorious failures and delight in ruining your friends’ plans. The rules change every minute and the game doesn’t care about fairness; it cares about giving you stories to shout about afterwards and we're really happy Wired Productions have joined us on our journey of chaos. To be honest, we wanted to make WarioWare but Nintendo already did that, so we made some friendslop instead.”  </p>
<p>It looks like a real blast! Check out the reveal trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="pHntv0H5VRk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dd6355d90f7601b804c71790b765f34d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/pHntv0H5VRk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A Gameshow inspired competitive friendslop, where one player will reign supreme to become the ultimate Taskling across 6 rounds of unpredictable and chaotic fun.   </li>
<li>Unleash your inner mischief-maker to sabotage your fellow Tasklings. Fortunately, there are no (real-life) consequences, just good vibes and endless hilarious moments.  </li>
<li>Easy to pick up, impossible to put down, every round presents a new opportunity to come out on top. So, even the clumsiest Taskling can pull off a shocking victory.  </li>
<li>Over 500 unlockable cosmetics and emotes. The best part? NO MICROTRANSACTIONS!  </li>
<li>Endlessly replayable with over half a million randomly generated tasks to complete.   </li>
<li>Host lobbies with up to 8 players, where 4-player split screen and online multiplayer are playable simultaneously.  </li>
<li>Multiple vibrant maps to discover, filled with interactive objects and items… plus, there’s loads more to come!  </li>
<li>Dual-language support made with streamers in mind – go on… stream to your friends in China or Brazil! </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Looks like one to add into my rotation next to PEAK, R.E.P.O and Crab Champions when it releases.</p>

      <title>Evil Empire (Dead Cells, The Rogue Prince of Persia) take over Brotato with a plan for more updates</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Evil Empire who did lots of work on Dead Cells and made The Rogue Prince of Persia have announced they're taking over future development of Brotato.</p>
<p>In the Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1942280/view/506214931042926789" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they said the original developer Blobfish Games want to make some new games, so they're moving on. This is where Evil Empire comes in, with a plan for lots more. Evil Empire have already pushed out a first update with a new Gobbler enemy that will steal materials with another small update planned to arrive in late October. </p>
<p>A lot more is to come, with plans to be announced later to gain feedback from players. Basically we'll get "more content for the game, more often" but they're also "aware that too much content can bloat a roguelike, so don’t worry, we’ll be considering each addition carefully".</p>
<p>Some of what they want to do includes "regular updates (and betas of updates), plus we’ll also be doing other things like quality-of-life additions, various improvements and bug fixes. Maybe even a DLC".</p>
<p>Patch notes for the latest release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Content</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added the Gobbler enemy that steals materials</li>
<li>Added the Gobbler's Hat item + its challenge to unlock it</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed challenges being duplicated when using retry-wave</li>
<li>Fixed Burning Spread stat and Damage against bosses translation in Simplified Chinese</li>
<li>Fixed Giant Belt description in Simplified Chinese</li>
<li>Fixed German translation for the Padding item</li>
<li>Increased precision of stat gains. Getting 5 Harvesting with 80% reduced Harvesting gain now correctly results in 1 Harvesting</li>
<li>Updated to Godot version 3.6.1</li>
</ul>

      <title>Terminator 2D: NO FATE delayed again and now releases in November</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For the second time the release date of Terminator 2D: NO FATE has been moved, and now it's going to arrive on November 26th.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/terminator-2d-no-fate-moves-to-an-october-release/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Previously it was delayed</a> from September to October due to physical releases taking longer than expected, and they want to sync up digital and physical releases. The latest delay they claim is due to "ongoing global trade and tariff changes that delayed shipment of the components for our Day One and Collector’s Editions". They still want both digital and physical editions to launch together, so this should hopefully give them enough time to ensure that's possible.</p>
<p>Hopefully we won't see a third delay.</p>
<p>More about it: "Experience the events of ‘Terminator 2: Judgment Day’ brought to life through glorious pixel artwork and action-packed arcade gameplay! Play as Sarah Connor and the T-800 through a variety of thrilling missions as they take on the T-1000 and try to put a stop to Skynet’s plans before the human race is annihilated. Lead the Resistance as John Connor in the future, fighting on the front lines as mankind’s only hope in the War Against the Machines. In this unique story blending iconic scenes from ‘Terminator 2: Judgment Day’ with original scenarios and multiple endings, humanity’s fate is yours to decide."</p>

      <title>Confirmed - Electronic Arts (EA) sold off to investors including Saudi Arabia&#39;s Public Investment Fund</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, there it is. It's now official <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/ea-reportedly-to-be-sold-off-for-roughly-50-billion-to-go-private/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">after earlier reports</a> that EA (Electronic Arts) is being sold off to an investor consortium.</p>
<p>EA put up a press release going over some of the details including a confirmation that the new owners will include PIF (Public Investment Fund - Saudi Arabia), Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners (formed by Jared Kushner). In the press release they noted it's an "all-cash transaction" to the value of <em>approximately</em> $55 billion, which will result in them taking 100% of EA.</p>
<p>While the move has been approved by EA's Board of Directors, it isn't yet a complete and finished deal. They still have to go through the normal regulatory approvals process and gain approval from EA stockholders on the deal. They expect it to be all finalised in the first quarter of their 2027 financial year. From the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=712515" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">filings</a> EA will have to pay a $1 billion termination fee if the deal falls through either due to the changes in the decision from their board, a better deal was found or stock holders revolt on it.</p>
<p>When the move is done their HQ will remain in California and Andrew Wilson will stay on as CEO.</p>
<p>This, according to the PR, makes it the "largest all-cash sponsor take-private investment in history". It really is huge, and considering how big EA actually are with all their controlled franchises it's a massive sweeping change for the games industry. Around $36 billion of it is from the equity investment, while $20 billion is from debt financing — which is an eye watering amount so brace for some cost-cutting to come (and layoffs probably).</p>
<p>EA controls the likes of The Sims, Battlefield, Command &amp; Conquer, Apex Legends, Titanfall, Star Wars Jedi series, Mass Effect, Dragon Age, skate., EA Sports FC and more.</p>
<p>Here's all the fancy-worded statements from the PR:</p>
<p>“Our creative and passionate teams at EA have delivered extraordinary experiences for hundreds of millions of fans, built some of the world’s most iconic IP, and created significant value for our business. This moment is a powerful recognition of their remarkable work,” said Andrew Wilson, Chairman &amp; CEO of Electronic Arts. “Looking ahead, we will continue to push the boundaries of entertainment, sports, and technology, unlocking new opportunities. Together with our partners, we will create transformative experiences to inspire generations to come. I am more energized than ever about the future we are building.”</p>
<p>“PIF is uniquely positioned in the global gaming and esports sectors, building and supporting ecosystems that connect fans, developers, and IP creators,” said Turqi Alnowaiser, Deputy Governor and Head of International Investments at PIF. “PIF has demonstrated a strong commitment to these sectors, and this partnership will help further drive EA’s long-term growth, while fueling innovation within the industry on a global scale.”</p>
<p>“This investment embodies Silver Lake’s mission to partner with exceptional management teams at the highest quality companies. EA is a special company: a global leader in interactive entertainment, anchored by its premier sports franchise, with accelerating revenue growth and strong and scaling free cash flow. We are honored to invest and partner with Andrew – an extraordinary CEO who has doubled revenue, nearly tripled EBITDA, and driven a fivefold increase in market cap during his tenure,” said Egon Durban, Co-CEO and Managing Partner of Silver Lake. “The future for EA is bright, we are going to invest heavily to grow the business and we are excited to support Andrew and the EA team as the company accelerates innovation, expands its reach worldwide, and continues to deliver incredible experiences to players and fans across generations.”</p>
<p>“Electronic Arts ​is ​an ​extraordinary ​company with a ​world-class ​management ​team and a bold vision ​for ​the ​future. ​I've admired their ​ability to create iconic, lasting experiences, ​and ​as ​someone ​who ​grew up playing their ​games ​- and now enjoys them with his ​kids - I couldn't be ​more ​excited about ​what's ​ahead,” said Jared Kushner, Chief Executive Officer of Affinity Partners.</p>
<p>“The Board carefully evaluated this opportunity and concluded it delivers compelling value for stockholders and is in the best interests of all stakeholders,” said Luis A. Ubiñas, Lead Independent Director of EA’s Board of Directors. “We are pleased that this transaction delivers immediate and certain cash value to our stockholders while strengthening EA’s ability to continue building the communities and experiences that define the future of entertainment.”</p>

      <title>Pull the lever to gamble and break the machine in CloverPit, a slot machine with horror vibes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>CloverPit from Panik Arcade and Future Friends Games has released bringing you the true horrors of a slot machine rogue-lite as you try to save your life. Note: a key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</p>
<p>A game that could be called a horrific fusion of Balatro and Buckshot Roulette for the gameplay and style, it will have you repeatedly pull that lever in the hopes of paying off a seemingly never-ending debt. Just you locked up in a small room with a slot machine, a toilet and a few other things to keep you busy.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17910619051759150737gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17910619051759150737gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's another in the list of growing games designed for you to <em>break</em> it as much as possible. You have to spend your money wisely on various special charms to help you earn big to pay off that debt. Pull the lever, play multiple rounds and deposit your cash into the ATM to bank it and repeat as much as possible.</p>
<p>Since it's a rogue-lite, each run through will be a little different on how it goes. Some rounds you may win big, others not so much. The horror theme is certainly an interesting twist on it, with multiple possible endings and a death-drop below you if you don't manage to pay it off. You literally get dropped down a deep dark hole, never to be seen again.</p>
<p>You know, giving you that real feeling of losing big time that some gambling addicts likely feel with the weight of it all. No laughing matter though, it's a real problem but this is still a game with a slot machine in the centre of it. The developer is very clear on their thoughts on it though noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"CloverPit is not a slot machine simulator. Our slot machine is designed to be broken and ultimately overcome. If you’re looking for a real gambling experience please look elsewhere. Or better yet, don’t look at all. We don’t really like gambling. That’s what the game is about!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the launch trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6f_6xETRrOI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cb4332f73ec857571b74fa54c2c37de1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6f_6xETRrOI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Each round you successfully complete, the debt will grow. Not only that, but the cost to play also rises with it as does the amount you have to deposit into the ATM. It's a frightening game of ever-growing numbers. A constant panic between trying to spend coin to make coin, buying up charms to increase your chances of screwing with the odds in your favour to depositing your needed cash to beat the round. Lots of difficult choices, and you will no doubt fail a great many hours before you feel like you're really getting somewhere.</p>
<p>Even just deciding how much coin to put into the slot machine is at times a challenging choice. You can deposit more coin to get more pulls but only 1 charm ticket, or deposit less to have fewer pulls of the lever and more charm tickets. It's the whole risk versus reward, but amplified by the thought of being dropped into the dark pit and having to start again where you can try something different.</p>
<p>There are of course a number of ways you can cheese through it, especially once you get the hang of it. But games are supposed to be about fun right? Not necessarily finding the easiest way to grind through it to complete it quickly. There's hundreds of charms, and with the right combinations, you can do some pretty funny things to the results of each pull of the lever. It's about seeing how far you can push it and watching as all your charms slide into the screen to keep pumping your numbers up as high as possible.</p>
<p>You do have a limit on the amount of charms you're allowed to have in play during each round though, so you have to choose wisely here too. It's not just about stacking as many as possible,</p>
<p>CloverPit does throw some pain your way too, like encountering 666. If you find that pattern, it's brutal, you'll lose all money earned that round and once you into the later rounds it really can destroy you. You do get a little extra help here and there, with strange phone calls where you're offered certain types of bonuses. Some of these can be especially helpful and can really save your ass during a run!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11782412071759149111gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11782412071759149111gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>One of the keys is to really focus on certain symbols, and put your charms and phone call upgrades as much as possible into those as well as general luck boosts. So that way you can stack up as much as possible from specific symbols on the machine. Easier said than done, but once you get it you're in for some monstrous winnings where you might end up seeing millions and more from a single pull.</p>
<p>You really do get the firm sense of being <em>required</em> to just have one more round. It's deliciously addictive, but in the non-destructive sense where the only real money you're paying is the single purchase cost. Excellent atmosphere, and really fun to try out all the different charms to try and mess with the slot machine.</p>
<p>CloverPit is Steam Deck Verified and works great on Desktop Linux PCs with Proton. </p>
<p>Another big indie hit too, with it hitting over 100,000 sales in 24 hours. It also has a Very Positive rating on Steam at time of writing.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Work is ongoing on the new cross-platform open source Nexus Mods app to support more games, and a smaller release is out now for more testing.</p>
<p>It's getting more exciting with some of their planned features like the built-in downloads page, along with easier library sorting and performance improvements in this release. Currently the app has full support for Stardew Valley and Cyberpunk, with work ongoing towards Baldur's Gate 3 and Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord and Skyrim. They haven't actually announced it yet, but work has also started for supporting Fallout 4 and it now appears as a placeholder in the app.</p>

<li>Downloads page placeholder: While full functionality isn't quite here yet, clicking the button in the bottom left will now open the downloads area with placeholder text. We look forward to showing you more soon.</li>
<li>Library improvements: You'll now find a new Collection column showing you what collections your mod is installed into, with an icon that show if the collection is installed or in progress. (<a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/issues/3786" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#3786</a>)</li>
<li>Kebab menus are now in place in Loadout and Installed Collections pages as well as to the Library. (<a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/issues/3743" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#3743</a>)</li>

      <title>More major updates coming to Minecraft - some highlights from Minecraft Live (September 2025)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/mclive_fall2025_recap" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Minecraft Live</a> has again come and gone (twice a year now), so here's just some of what's coming to the popular open-world game with major updates planned.</p>
<p>Firstly, The Copper Age releases on September 30th, so tomorrow you'll be able to dive into the latest update for the game. This will bring Copper Bars, Copper Chain, Copper CHest, Copper Golem Statue, Copper Lantern, Copper Torch and many more Copper related items. The Shelf is going to be a highlight as a new storage block allowing you to stack items in your fancy little house, along with the Copper Armour set and especially the Copper Golem that will help you sort through your Chests.</p>
<p>Another big update coming is <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/unveiling-mounts-of-mayhem" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Mounts of Mayhem</a> arriving later this year. This will bring the Nautilus, an underwater mount mob that allows you to fully explore the watery depths of Minecraft. Much like the Happy Ghast, you can build from it, and you won't lose oxygen while riding it. There will also be a Zombie Nautilus, which can be mounted by the Drowned. So underwater fights are about to get interesting…</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18352852281759145113gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Mounts of Mayhem will also add a new tiered weapon, the Spear, which allows you to craft it from different materials with each one acting in a slightly different way which sounds fun. It also has two different kinds of attacks with a jab or a charged attack, and if you go faster (like on a mount) it will hit harder. You're going to need it too, as Zombie Horses are finally making their way into survival mode in Minecraft with the update.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2067234031759145069gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>You can see the highlights video below:</p>

<p>Quite excited about all the planned stuff to come, might finally be time for me to start up a new world with the family. Such a great game to play with others.</p>
