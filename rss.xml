      <title>Immortal Boy looks wild blending a little Undertale and OMORI together</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>IcarusDev is currently making Immortal Boy a 2.5D turn-based RPG of battles, puzzles and exploration - amid secrets and betrayal. It's a little of Undertale meets OMORI.</p>
<p>There's a whole lot of adventuring exploration here with lots of side missions where you engage with a "character-rich story with fleshed-out character arcs" and of course, plenty of mini-games too. Wrapped up in a slick chiptune soundtrack, and a little "Windows 98 Webcore" nostalgia thrown in too for some of the UI it certainly looks like an experience.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DxBkQzQ7W8U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7ce18f150a410c95f64e617016d79921.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DxBkQzQ7W8U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The Steam page explains a little more noting that the combat in it features a 4-member party system, with special ability that come at the cost of another character's health, mixed in with 3D bullet-hell styled platforming for the enemy turns. I've not really seen many that look like this.</p>
<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A group of 4 friends race against Tree monsters, Food creatures, Whacky snowmen, Sci-Fi computers, Gambling kings and who-knows-what to obtain a magical object that can grant anyone their Deepest Desire...</p>
<p>However, something tells you a certain friend isn't who they seem...</p>
<p>Spanning 9 Chapters (Kinda), Immortal Boy delves into the perspective of a Boy trapped in a psychological prison created by his own self-esteem and self-perception.</p>
<p>Delve into Themes of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insecurity</li>
<li>Emotional Manipulation</li>
<li>Emotional Attachment</li>
<li>Loneliness</li>
<li>Relationships</li>
<li>Characters being stupid for no reason in particular</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking to the developer over email, they confirmed it will have Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Free to play toy soldier Battle Royale game Mini Royale enters Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mini Royale from IndigoBlue is out now in Early Access and free to play, with Native Linux support and Easy Anti-Cheat enabled. Another shooter for you to try if you're missing some multiplayer fun on Linux platforms.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The initial release comes with both first and third-person options across multiple games modes includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Battle Royale:</strong> Engage in an action-packed free-for-all where you fight to be the last soldier or team standing. Traverse chaotic, larger-than-life environments, making every match a new adventure.</li>
<li><strong>Color Conquest:</strong> Take on three other teams in a nostalgic twist on classic toy soldier battles. Eliminate enemy players to convert them to your team’s color until only one color remains.</li>
<li><strong>Deathmatch:</strong> Enter tightly packed arenas like the inside of a pinball machine, a sandbox, or a moving box filled with toys. Prove yourself as the ultimate deathmatch champion.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Qd4kGADVIFY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2ec68f087b53545973d2c2d9d9e09203.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Qd4kGADVIFY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I've been playing it on and off since the early testing versions, and it does work quite well on Linux. Although the Steam Overlay doesn't seem to work with it. Other than that, no technical troubles encountered at least. Very much a back-to-basics Battle Royale here, although the movement system with a grapple hook is quite fun.</p>
<p>They've got a tough uphill battle with this one though. Launching any multiplayer game is always difficult, especially when you're a small indie team and when there's so many free to play online games out already so it could easily fail. At least being free to play they've given it the best possible chance for now. Who knows, perhaps the toy soldier style will be what wins people over. The skill floor is at least low with this one, as it's easy to get into to pick up and play and get some frags without being particularly good.</p>
<p>While it's free to play, they do plan to sell cosmetic items.</p>

<p>This version of Ubuntu includes the recently released Linux <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/linux-kernel-6-14-out-late-due-to-pure-incompetence-dont-get-too-excited-about-linux-gaming-boosts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">kernel 6.14</a>, along with various installer improvements like expanded dual-boot install and upgrade support for Ubuntu sitting alongside Windows with a focus on BitLocker protected Windows systems.

<p>Since I like to live on the <em>wild</em> side, I decided to upgrade my system to Kubuntu 25.04 Beta today. After a bit of a woops with it entirely removing KDE, a quick TTY swap to reinstall kubuntu-desktop, then re-installing Flatpak and we're looking good.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's the up to date list of games available on Amazon Prime Gaming for March 28th, and what compatibility you can expect for Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck. An easy way to build up your gaming collection with these games coming as part of your Amazon Prime subscription.</p>
<p>I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"/> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play. Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now.</p>
<p>You can install games from Epic, GOG and Amazon easily via <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/heroic-games-launcher-2152-released-fixing-amazon-gog-and-epic-games-issues/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Heroic Games Launcher</a> with Prime giving you a code for each game for whatever store it's on.

      <title>Starsector, one of the best space RPGs that&#39;s not on Steam had a huge update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Starsector (formerly "Starfarer") is still in development but it's been a seriously impressive game for years. Not yet on Steam or any other store, as you have to buy it direct, but don't let that stop you with a big update out now.</p>
<p>What exactly is it? Hard to pin it down specifically. It has a glorious mixture of open-world single-player exploration and space-combat, with RPG elements and economic simulation. It has some of the most interesting 2D space combat around, with seriously great ship designs.</p>
<p>Along with an update to Java 17, which they said should "substantially improve performance", there's also a whole bunch of major new features in Starsector version 0.98a including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Several new endgame-level enemies to fight in the Abyss.</li>
<li>New ships, weapons, and hullmods.</li>
<li>Codex UI revamp.</li>
<li>Autosave, revamped save/load UI.</li>
<li>Intel map markers and little notes.</li>
<li>Revamped combat simulator with many options and opponents.</li>
<li>Planet search UI revamp.</li>
<li>New story (not “main” story) missions.</li>
<li>New music.</li>
<li>New portraits and illustrations.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Amazon Luna and Electronic Arts sign a multi-year deal, as Luna expands into more countries</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems like Amazon are not ready to give up on their cloud gaming service Luna just yet, with it expanding into more countries and getting a big new deal going.</p>
<p>Amazon announced they've partnered with Electronic Arts (EA) for a multi-year deal. This brings the likes of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Dead Space to Luna+ subscribers with more on the way sometime soon. Some others mentioned to be coming include various EA Sports games but no dates other than "over the coming months".</p>
<p>Luna has also expanded its supported countries into Sweden, Portugal, Belgium and Luxembourg. Marking 14 countries that are now supported by the service.</p>
<p>If you have Amazon Prime, you can play various games free including Fortnite, Trackmania and a rotating monthly selection of games. You can also link your GOG and Ubisoft accounts to play certain games you already have.</p>
<p><a href="https://luna.amazon.co.uk/home" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Amazon Luna</a> is playable on Linux. Although the experience testing Fortnite with it today wasn't the best. The controls didn't feel great, but the visual quality was a lot better than the last time I tried it.</p>

      <title>Ubisoft launches new subsidiary for Assassin’s Creed and other big games with funding from Tencent</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ubisoft are attempting to turn around their fortunes, with the creation of a new subsidiary with funding help from Tencent. This new group will have full control over Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry and Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six.</p>
<p>Tencent will be investing €1.16 billion for a minority (25%) stake in the new subsidiary, with this subsidiary having a "focus on building game ecosystems designed to become truly evergreen and multi-platform" they say it will "drive further increases in quality of narrative solo experiences, expand multiplayer offerings with increased frequency of content release, introduce free-to-play touchpoints, and integrate more social features".</p>
<p>Ubisoft are valuing this new creation at about €4 billion which they said is "implying a FY23-FY25E average sales multiple of around 4x".</p>
<p>This new subsidiary includes all the teams developing Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six, Assassin’s Creed and Far Cry based in Montréal, Quebec, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia. This includes existing games plus any new games currently under development or planned. This subsidiary has a "worldwide, exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual license in respect of the intellectual property and similar proprietary rights owned or licensable by Ubisoft in relation to Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six, Assassin’s Creed and Far Cry in exchange for a royalty".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7513716991743156444gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“Today Ubisoft is opening a new chapter in its history,” said, Yves Guillemot, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer. “As we accelerate the company’s transformation, this is a foundational step in changing Ubisoft’s operating model that will enable us to be both agile and ambitious. We are focused on building strong game ecosystems designed to become evergreen, growing high-performing brands and creating new IPs powered by cutting-edge and emerging technologies.”</p>
<p>“With the creation of a dedicated subsidiary that will spearhead development for three of our largest franchises and the onboarding of Tencent as a minority investor, we are crystalizing the value of our assets, strengthening our balance sheet, and creating the best conditions for these franchises’ long-term growth and success. With its dedicated and autonomous leadership team, it will focus on transforming these three brands into unique ecosystems.”</p>
<p>Guillemot concluded, “We are committed to building a sharper, more focused organization-one where talented teams will take our brands to the next level, accelerate the growth of emerging franchises, and lead innovation in next-generation technologies and services, all with the goal of delivering enriching, memorable games that exceed players' expectations, and create superior value for our shareholders and other stakeholders.”</p>
<p>Martin Lau, President of Tencent, said “We are excited to extend our longstanding partnership with Ubisoft through this investment, which reflects our continued confidence in Ubisoft’s creative vision and exceptional talent to drive sustained success in the industry. We see the immense potential for these franchises to evolve into long-term evergreen game platforms and create engaging new experiences for gamers.”</p>

      <title>Fixing a Steam Deck OLED bug for the Linux kernel 6.14 release was a major challenge</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the Linux kernel 6.14 out now, I noted <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/linux-kernel-6-14-out-late-due-to-pure-incompetence-dont-get-too-excited-about-linux-gaming-boosts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">in my quick-look overview</a> about a bug that was fixed for the Steam Deck OLED model. Collabora have given a little more info on their work for this issue and how it was a challenge.</p>
<p>The problem? Sometimes when resuming from suspend, the Steam Deck OLED would enter a unrecoverable faulty state. Thankfully, a solution was found by developer Cristian Ciocaltea at Collabora.</p>
<p>Collabora put up a <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/kernel-614-enhances-hardware-capabilities-improved-performance.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> about some of their work that went into Linux kernel 6.14, with the Steam Deck OLED issue being noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Linux 6.14 aims to fix an audio breakage issue on the Valve Steam Deck OLED variant when the system resumes from suspend. It's worth noting the investigations raised major challenges, as the reproducible rate varied randomly, in some cases being necessary to go through hundreds of successful suspend/resume cycles. On top of that, it was virtually impossible to make efficient use of any kernel debugging techniques due to the annoying side effect of hiding the actual problem. Eventually, Cristian Ciocaltea managed to submit a patch series providing a new ACP quirk to address the issue, as well as a few additional improvements to the AMD Vangogh/ACP SOF drivers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Showing off the power of open source here, with multiple companies and groups involved in the development and as a result issues like this can be found and fixed to benefit a lot of people. Nice to see it get solved!</p>
<p>Currently, the Steam Deck (as of SteamOS 3.7 preview) uses Linux kernel 6.11. Even if Valve don't upgrade the SteamOS Linux kernel to 6.14 yet, they will likely cherry-pick the patch and back-port it to their current kernel version.</p>

<p>The Warfare Legacy Collection bundles together two classic Flash strategy games Warfare 1917 and Warfare 1944, upgraded for modern computers and expanded for a Steam release on April 28th. Games I haven't heard of in a long time, with some fond memories attempting to beat them some 17 years or so ago.</p>
<p>The release date was just announced today with a new trailer, and the game built with Unity will also have Native Linux support, and at time of writing there's a demo you can try too. With this release they've also added in an all-new Battle of the Bulge campaign.</p>

      <title>Stealth platformer Kiyo puts up a new playtest with improved Linux and Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/stealthy-platformer-kiyo-in-need-of-linux-testers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">requesting Linux testers back in Early 2024</a>, the sneaky stealth platformer Kiyo has a new playtest on Steam for you to try with expanded Linux support. The style and lighting in this one really does look interesting.</p>
<p>One of their team emailed noting how they got "a bunch of really good feedback last year" thanks to our article on the two-person developed game with a custom game engine, and so they're back again. The new playtest on Steam has "more content, improved Linux support (Joypads work too via Steam Input) and this time the Steam Deck is also supported" according to the dev.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mADnyzF0XYw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a595df95fc9718d43c780f45b01c386b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mADnyzF0XYw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it (from Steam):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This game creates a special visual style, as it combines “2D ray tracing” pixel art with its neon-bright nightlife.</p>
<p>Immerse yourself in Rabbithole City and enjoy the vibe of a Japanese megalopolis mixed with the feeling of Blade Runner and Cyberpunk.</p>
<p>Visit sexy nightclubs, mansions, secret labs, arcade halls, industrial plants and many more locations in order to liberate all animals.</p>
<p>Whether you prefer a stealthy approach or want to slay all the enemies, the choice is yours.</p>
<p>Use different tools and time your sneaky moves perfectly to hide from all dangers or remove one bunny at a time from the shadows.</p>
<p>You can also unlock other members of the resistance group, take advantage of their different abilities, and find new ways to overcome the bunnies' oppression.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Semi-open overworld.</li>
<li>A complex story with a plot that addresses real social issues.</li>
<li>Stealth gameplay.</li>
<li>Specially composed synth-wave soundtrack and immersive audio design.</li>
<li>In-house engine.</li>
<li>Pole dancing.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see another developer putting effort into their Linux support. Go give it a run on the playtest and see what you think of it.</p>

      <title>Animated series ENA gets a video game with the free surreal adventure ENA: Dream BBQ</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'll admit I'm pretty uncultured apparently as seeing the release of ENA: Dream BBQ today led me down a bit of a rabbit hole about the ENA animated series. After watching what's available, I still have absolutely no idea what's going on. Perhaps it's just not my thing but apparently it is for a lot of people.</p>
<p>Now available with Native Linux support, ENA: Dream BBQ was announced multiple years ago (2021) with Chapter 1 now available. It's free but there's also an optional supporter pack DLC with some extra goodies. The Steam page doesn't exactly give much away about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first interactive adventure of the ENA series by Joel G.</p>
<p>Play as ENA as she searches for the Boss that everyone wants to be. Explore strange worlds, take on side gigs, and meet both sweet and sour characters along the journey.</p>
<p>There is a lot to encounter on your adventures:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Explore new environments</u> filled with hidden secrets and oddities.</li>
<li><u>Meet different characters</u> who only want you to do things for them.</li>
<li><u>Use strange Tools</u> to solve unusual problems.</li>
<li><u>Live the experience</u> of being the least popular person at any party.</li>
</ul>

<p>Seems people like it with an Overwhelmingly Positive user rating on Steam.</p>

<p>Obsidian Entertainment have revisited the original Pillars of Eternity, with a big bumper patch out now and plans for another big update later this year. <em>You can actually grab it and the sequel in the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/dice-and-destiny" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">current Dice and Destiny Humble Bundle</a>.</em></p>
<p>Posting in the <a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134573-patch-138087535-is-live/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">official forum</a> one of the developers said "Coming later this year, Watchers will be able to help us test a brand-new feature: Turn-Based Combat. We’re excited to explore this new way to experience encounters in Pillars of Eternity, and your feedback will help shape its future. More details on how to participate will be shared in the near future, so keep an eye on our socials and in our discord."</p>
<p>The developer did the same for Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire, adding a turn-based mode in its final update.</p>

The first two chapters will also get various improvements ranging from better texture work to new secrets and scripted sequences, revised dialogue with extra one-liners and more. There's also multiple all-new features like a shop system and gameplay modifiers coming.</p>

<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Navigate hand-crafted levels stuffed to the brim with secrets, using key cards, completing puzzles, and accomplishing a variety of objectives to progress. All this is set in a vast array of locations, from a space station looming high above the Earth to realms shifting beyond our reality.</li>
<li>Wield 9 unique and powerful weapons, from staples of the genre like the "Bunker Buster," a double-barreled shotgun that fires explosive rounds, to the more unique and offbeat guns, such as the Plague Rifle.</li>
<li>Slaughter over 27 different Enemy Types and up to 7 Bosses, from the minor grunts who make up the U.S.C's forces to monsters beyond your ability to comprehend, such as the horrifying Maledict. New enemy types are introduced in almost every level, each compounding the challenges you'll face with a wide variety of attacks and behaviors.</li>
<li>Juggle your resources as you fight to stay alive, constantly balancing your use of ammo, health, and armor.</li>
<li>Move at the speed of light, chaining Bunny Hopping and Dashing together to move at speeds no man would dream of, and with your overbearing Air Control, dance around projectiles like no other.</li>
<li>Collect tons of goodies to unlock Gameplay Modifiers and Cheats to spice up your playthroughs, with such staples as "Viscerahot," where time slows as you Bunny Hop, or "Oops All Cultists," where your dreams of being torn apart by the hitscanning occult can be made a reality.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Some bits won't quite be finished though like the soundtrack and a number of other sound effects due to some of the team having issues as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAj2v5HLstI" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">detailed in a video</a>. Seems the publisher, Fulqrum, just won't budge on the release date.</p>

      <title>Monsterpatch is Pokemon meets Stardew Valley from the dev of Littlewood and Kindergarten</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Monsterpatch is the latest game from Sean Young developer of Littlewood and Kindergarten, blending together Pokemon and Stardew Valley with a little of their own Littlewood thrown in. <em>It will have Native Linux support like their previous games.</em></p>
<p>Much like Pokemon games, it will have two different editions, although both come with the game and you can swap between them. Each version offers up two unique stories with different antagonists, and you'll be able to trade your MoNs between the save files on each — sounds like a pretty clever hook.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DEXvmpBXBPc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/474e8f6e17c7d2369e1fa0d6374c4b92.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DEXvmpBXBPc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore a floating continent teeming with magical creatures known as MoNs. These creatures love battling alongside the wizards that catch and care for them.</li>
<li>Catch magical MoNs, learn powerful spells, and battle other wizards across the continent.</li>
<li>An Epic Adventure unfolds as you explore each route and city. Return to your town at any time to plant some crops, harvest some fruit, or relax with the MoNs you've caught! Maybe some NPCs will even move into your town!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The game is being <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seanyoung/monsterpatch-a-cozy-monster-collecting-rpg/description" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">crowdfunded on Kickstarter</a>, and it's been a huge success. With 29 days still left to go it's currently on over $68,000 against the original $15,000 goal. So it's currently going through special stretch-goals for extra content like interior decorating, an increased number of MoNs creatures, special shiny MoNs and more.</p>
<p>Definitely excited about this one!</p>
<p>You can also follow the developer on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/seanyoungsg.bsky.social" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>.</p>

      <title>Folkways DLC for the excellent village builder dotAGE released - here&#39;s a little interview with the developer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>dotAGE is a very unique turn-based village builder that blends in roguelike survival elements. It's one that you should definitely add to your list, and a new DLC expansion is out now so I took the chance to speak to the developer a bit.</p>
<p><em>It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified too!</em></p>
<p>Firstly, check out the original trailer to get a feel for it if you missed it previously:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="m4crJPLWC30"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4a98eac279529566d8d01ee41a4cef01.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/m4crJPLWC30" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The new DLC, Folkways, adds a whole lot more content into the game. Including Pipfolks that live outside your village, and give you a chance to get them to join you. They bring with them unique bonuses special food and promotion requirements, dedicated events, and dedicated buildings for dwelling and for production and much more.</p>
<p>And now for the chat with the developer…</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can you introduce yourself, and tell us how you got into game development?</strong></p>
<p>Hello! I'm Michele, indie dev from Bergamo, Italy. 38 years old, been gaming for 35 years straight. I am an automation engineer and hold a PhD in computer science from the Polytechnic of Milan, where I graduated with a thesis on serious games for physical rehabilitation of elderly patients. I've been working as a freelance game developer for ten years since then for various companies, especially focusing on gameplay and systems design and programming. In the meantime, I kept following my dream of making my own game in the little spare time I had, and after 9 years, dotAGE was released to popular acclaim in 2023 which allowed me to transition to being a full time indie dev!</p>
<p><strong>Q: Tell us a little about dotAGE and the new DLC?</strong></p>
<p>dotAGE is the merciless turn-based worker-placement roguelike survival village builder (wow) where you play as the prophetic elder of a village that fights against the apocalypse! It is a mix of genres with base mechanics heavily inspired by board games like Agricola and Stone Age, but paired with the progression and tension of roguelikes and ironmode XCOM (I like contrast, what can I say). The new DLC Folkways expands the world of dotAGE with plenty of wacky ideas and is fueled by the love of dotAGE's fans and geared towards them! It increases complexity and variation in the game, making it bigger, larger, more varied, and wackier! It adds dryads, prisons, fish-pips, playable cats, 3 new elders, dwarves eating stone, you can eat cats, you can eat manure, and much more.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How did you come up for the idea of dotAGE?</strong></p>
<p>I had been wanting to make a game like The Settlers for a while, making various (bad) prototypes at the beginning of my career. They were really ugly games, and had nothing new, so I realized it made little sense to continue them. One day, in 2014, I played FTL, and it blew my mind. I realized you could apply the same feeling of a roguelike to any genre in that specific moment, and quickly I decided I would try to apply it to one of the genres that usually had not roguelike elements in them (yes, that was not a great idea).</p>
<p>After 9 years of bashing my head against that idea and cursing, dotAGE was ready!</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are you most proud of with dotAGE?</strong></p>
<p>I set out, alone, with the vision to make the tension of a traditional roguelike with its risk of loss paired with the tranquility and relaxing gameplay of board games, and I am very proud to have achieved that very complex mix! As a systems designer, I am fascinated with the emergent dynamics from game elements, and dotAGE is full of carefully designed interactions to reinforce that basic contrast. That is what I am most proud of!</p>
<p><strong>Q: Now dotAGE has been out for over a year, how has the reception been? Were the sales about what you expected?</strong></p>
<p>It has been stellar, and way above what I could dream of. I had no big aims for sales, as I just wanted to make the game, but after so many years of working on it I *had* to try and market it, I owed it to myself and the game itself. So I made sure to make a big launch without a publisher (marketing is an interesting area too!), and much to my surprise it worked! Sales have been above any expectation I had and it has allowed me to focus more on the game, and finally add all the weird ideas I had saved up in labeled files named "keep_this_for_the_dlc_or_you_will_never_finish_the_game.txt" and variations of that.</p>
<p><strong>Q: The game has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified. How difficult was it to support Linux and get it Steam Deck Verified too? Any top tips?</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to the Unity engine, I must say that Native Linux support has been easy to achieve, as by focusing on general optimizations the benefits were felt by all. This was true also for Steam Deck, as I had to optimize a bit for it (the ugly code I had, and still have, after 9 years of iteration!), and especially add controller support, but I think it was a good thing to do as the game plays great on it! Getting verified was not too hard once I asked kindly Valve to take a look at it, and they answered quickly (they do have great developer support). My advice is to keep controller support in mind from the beginning, as that can help in transitioning to it!</p>
<p><strong>Q: Any other general advice for developers releasing their first game?</strong></p>
<p>Please do not take 9 years to make your first game, as I was lucky this time around. My project is a mess, and I would redo almost everything differently with the knowledge I have now! The most important thing that I realized is that if you take so much to make it, *you will feel you will never finish the game*, because while working on it you will become a better game developer and what you did 2 years before will look *bad* to you and you will want to redo it. </p>
<p><strong>Q: Any thoughts on what game you'll make next? What's next for you?</strong></p>
<p>Now that I released the DLC, I will monitor how dotAGE's trajectory changes and decide what to do next! I still have plenty of stuff I'd like to do with dotAGE, but I also am eager to start prototyping something new, as while making dotAGE I saved up dozens of ideas of stuff to do next and can't wait to have a fresh start! Surely, next for me is more game dev!</p>
<p><em>Big thank you to Michele for taking time to speak to me.</em></p>

      <title>UnderMine 2 comes to Early Access in July with co-op</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>UnderMine 2 from developer Thorium is set to enter Early Access on July 22nd, promising to take the best bits of the fun original and expanding on it. It will also feature local co-op play this time around too so you can bring a partner along for the ride.</p>
<p>A demo will also be available during Steam Next Fest between June 9th—16th.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LkgGSkVfsI8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/92e721d094530b0bada93a7f0f20d800.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LkgGSkVfsI8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>PLAY WITH A FRIEND - Invite your friend to drop in and play through the entirety of UnderMine 2 together! Two-player co-op lets you tackle the game with each other, presenting a dynamic challenge and opening up new strategic options.</li>
<li>PLAYABLE CHARACTERS - Discover, unlock, and play as new characters, including Black Rabbit, a lucky and ambitious treasure hunter. Each character has unique stats, abilities, upgrades, and relics.</li>
<li>BRANCHING PATHS - New regions of the Undermine have been revealed, and each branches off into various other areas. Navigate it to complete builds, quests, and different objectives. Your final challenge depends entirely on your decisions throughout the run.</li>
<li>ARCANA - Wield new, interactive relics called Arcana. Each adds a new ability to your character, from casting fireballs to summoning skeleton minions to rearranging time and space.</li>
<li>FULL MOD AND WORKSHOP SUPPORT - Easily create new items, characters, encounters, quests, and more with paintable tilesets, a visual scripting editor, and other included development tools. You can also easily download other players' creations through Steam Workshop.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>While the original had Native Linux support, you'll need to run this one with Proton.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the first one and it's exactly the type of game I can happily sink hours into, so I'm also quite excited about an expanded sequel.</p>

      <title>Infinity Nikki devs are working on Steam Deck support for the Steam release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While there's no current release date for the Steam release, Infold Games are still working towards it for Infinity Nikki and it seems it may be good news for Steam Deck players.</p>
<p>I've spoken with their PR team a couple of times on this, and they've now allowed me to share a note from the developer to say "the team are working on Steam Deck support currently, and will share news as they have news to share". So it's not much right now, but good to see they are actually working on it as it's <em>incredibly</em> popular.</p>
<p>They didn't have anything to share on Desktop Linux though, which may be a little problematic, as they're using Anti-Cheat Expert (ACE). ACE seems to do some sort of <em>device</em> specific whitelisting for the Steam Deck as we've seen games using it work on Deck but not on Desktop Linux, like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/delta-force-developer-mentions-they-will-look-at-supporting-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Delta Force</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/anti-cheat-stops-mecha-break-running-on-desktop-linux-but-works-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mecha BREAK</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9649563571742985016gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I really do hope Valve can eventually properly sort this <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat</a> situation out so we don't end up with more titles having Steam Deck with SteamOS Linux and Desktop Linux separated.</p>
<p>Will be interesting to see how the Steam release is received, for what they call the coziest open-world game. Certainly does look bright and inviting.</p>

      <title>Junk Store plugin for Steam Deck plans new release as closed-source paid software to run other stores</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Junk Store may have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/that-didnt-last-long-the-junk-store-for-steam-deck-has-its-steam-page-removed/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">failed to get released on Steam</a> as Valve removed their store page, but that hasn't stopped their team working on this special Steam Deck plugin to bring other stores like Epic Games, GOG and Amazon Games to the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>While there's already various ways to get other stores on Steam Deck like the Heroic Games Launcher, Lutris, directly installing the stores Windows apps with Proton, plugins for Decky Loader and more, Junk Store plans to be a fully integrated direct solution. And, it will be able to sit alongside Decky Loader too.</p>
<p>Writing on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JunkStore/comments/1jjx3k4/junk_store_the_next_generation/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Reddit</a> they went over some progress recently along with clearly noting it will be "paid software and will be closed source". Initially it will launch with support for Epic Games, GOG and Amazon Games with more added over time.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some of what they say is new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Global download queue</li>
<li>Language selection</li>
<li>DLC selection</li>
<li>Installation of game dependencies, like C++ runtimes, without the need for proton tricks</li>
<li>Gog has proper support for DosBox and ScummVM games</li>
<li>Gog Dosbox support has a Dosbox config editor</li>
<li>The option to enable experimental cloud saves for supported games (we still don’t trust it, but it’s there if you’re a risk taker).</li>
<li>There’s a LOT more options (too many in fact), to control all manner of things. If you like to tinker, this is for you.</li>
<li>The new version is faster and more optimised so you can now see 1000 games per tab compared to the 100 in the python version.</li>
</ul>

<p>They noted in replies that the current open source Decky Loader plugin version will keep working, nothing will be taken away.</p>

      <title>Neverwinter Nights 2 Enhanced Edition hasn&#39;t been announced yet but it just got a Steam Deck Playable rating</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We know Neverwinter Nights 2 Enhanced Edition is probably coming, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/neverwinter-nights-enhanced-edition-gets-a-sequel-dlc-and-it-looks-like-neverwinter-nights-2-enhanced-edition-is-on-the-way/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">thanks to the previous leak</a>, but it still hasn't actually been announced yet. However, it's clearly getting closer.</p>
<p>Going by <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2738630/history/?changeid=28119543" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, it appears that Valve were able to get pre-release testing on this one done, and they've given it a Steam Deck Playable rating. While it has a green check for most things, Valve noted the game does not exit cleanly and "may require you to manually quit via the Steam overlay". If that's the only issue Valve have noted as per the listing, seems it might be another great classic to play on Steam Deck.</p>
<p><em>While SteamDB is a community website, it's generally a great source for early info like this.</em></p>
<p>From what we do know it seems Aspyr Media are involved with it, thanks to their name clearly stated in the EULA notice. And we also know that Beamdog are <em><a href="https://x.com/BeamdogInc/status/1890121268034519371" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">not</a></em> involved with this one even though they did a bunch of previous Enhanced Editions for the original and other RPGs.</p>
<p>Hopefully we'll get some real details on it soon. Will keep an eye out.</p>

      <title>Civilization VII update 1.1.1 adds quick move, lots of UI improvements, a new start position and lots of fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Firaxis Games are quickly cleaning up the messy release of Civilization VII, with more new additions now available in patch update 1.1.1. <em>The game has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</em></p>
<p>This update seems like it adds in some things the game was really missing, but there's plenty of work left to be done before it will likely sway more classic Civ fans over to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15647397911742912427gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The highlights of the patch include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new "Quick Move" option to make gameplay faster and disable some animations.</li>
<li>A new "Standard" start position option for map generation, which is closer to Civilization VI.</li>
<li>Settlement and Commander Renaming.</li>
<li>New Natural Wonder: Mount Everest.</li>
<li>Plenty of UI improvements including:
	<ul>
<li>Improve Unit Flag and Health Bar Visibility.</li>
<li>Improved Plot Tooltips.</li>
<li>New “District Under Attack” notification.</li>
<li>New Trade Lens and Ability to Send Merchants from Lens.</li>
<li>Age Progress Now Shows Turns Remaining Until Crises.</li>
<li>A new Restart Button to re-use your settings and start fresh within the first few turns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That's just the brief highlights. There's a lot more to the update including various game pacing and balance issues solved, lots of general AI improvement, narrative improvements, some cursor problems on Linux and macOS were also solved. And for the Steam Deck they also noted "Fixed several input flows and prompts for the UI when using a controller".</p>

      <title>Devs of Monster Crown: Sin Eater a 2D monster taming RPG want to &#39;take that concept to its absolute limits&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Studio Aurum are developing a new 2D monster taming RPG with Monster Crown: Sin Eater, a standalone follow-up to their previous Monster Crown.</p>
<p>One of the challenges faced with the previous game was solo developer Jason Walsh getting diagnosed with a significant disability in 2019. This time around, Walsh has moved into the role of Producer with an expanded team to help bring the ideas to life.</p>
<p>They said they want to take the concept "to its absolute limits" and it sounds like they have some nice ideas. From encountering creatures that act different between fleeing, chasing and stalking you to branching dialogue options that will "have a real impact on the game".</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EFS2oOOGc_s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f049325fdc6ba753823d0c5b7d664caf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EFS2oOOGc_s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's a demo available on the Steam page, although it only has a Windows build right now. It should have Native Linux support at the full release. The demo does work with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a>.</p>
<p>You can help fund the development on the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/monster-crown/monster-crown-sin-eater-monster-taming-rpg/description" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">just-launched Kickstarter page</a>. They're hoping to get at least CA$43,000 over the next 30 days.</p>

      <title>Mudborne is a wonderfully chilled sim about catching and breeding frogs out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mudborne from ellraiser / TNgineers is a wonderfully charming laid-back casual nature management sim about discovering &amp; breeding frogs. Officially out now with Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified. <em>Note: key provided for me.</em></p>
<p>Just like their previous game APICO, it's all about nature. Instead of breeding bees this time though, you're breeding frogs and trying to restore the pond back to its former glory. It's all bit more spiritual too. You're also a frog this time, not a person, and there's even a dedicated "ribbit" key which is really sweet and makes the other litter frogs speak back to you.</p>
<p>Imagine if you took Stardew Valley, turned you into a frog and swapped farming for breeding other frogs and that's sort-of what to expect from it. No rushing around, you do pretty much whatever you want to get through it at your own pace. Simply lovely. A little more on the puzzle side with the frog genetics but the mechanics around it are great to keep you wanting to explore more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="XuxM31FAOMM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/156a1c0d28eafa10e058f8103dc94ed3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/XuxM31FAOMM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about the developer: ellraiser is half of TNgineers, a small UK-based indie studio made of Ell (ellraiser) and their older brother Jamie (metakitkat). TNgineers’ first game, APICO, was released in 2022 and did well enough to allow Ell to start making games full-time. Ell works on development as well as the art for the games, with Jamie focusing more on writing and design. </p>
<p>While Jamie has been busy designing their second game, Snacktorio, Ell has been focusing on what started as a pet project - Mudborne. They wanted to take all the lessons learned from APICO into a spiritual sequel of sorts, combining elements from games they loved growing up, like Link To The Past and Dr Brain, all mashed together into one slimy baby.</p>
<p>When you buy this one a portion of the money made gets donated to national and international amphibian, wetlands, and environmental charities. So you've got the added feel-good factor here too.</p>
<p>Really nice clean design for the world, the art, the sound and the UI. Not a bad thing to say about this one. Just so thoroughly charming all the way through. Another seriously easy recommendation to go and buy.</p>

      <title>HP are interested in making a SteamOS handheld as the Windows experience sucks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you look at nearly all reviews of handheld gaming PCs that run Windows, the major problem is Windows itself. So with Valve opening up the door to SteamOS Linux for more devices, it seems HP are interested in jumping in too.</p>
<p>Windows simply isn't designed for the use-case of being on a gaming handheld. Forcing you through a terrible setup experience, and just a generally poor experience when using it in this form factor. A few vendors have tried doing their own UI on top of Windows, but it all feels rather disconnected. </p>
<p>A point made by HP's SVP and Division President of Gaming Solutions Josephine Tan when talking to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/hp-hasnt-made-omen-gaming-handheld/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">XDA Developers</a>, Tan mentioned "If you look at Windows, I struggle with the experience myself. If I don't like it, I don't know how to do a product for it.". Tan continued "If I'm buying a handheld, I want a very simple setup. The minute I turn on my handheld, it will remember the last game I played. In the Windows environment, it doesn't".</p>
<p>When XDA asked Tan if they're interested in doing a SteamOS handheld the answer was simply "Yes".</p>
<p>We just need Valve to get going on that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">upcoming public SteamOS 3 beta</a>. Still, it's going to take a lot to dethrone the Steam Deck, with Valve mentioning how it saw <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/330-million-hours-played-on-steam-deck-in-2024-up-64-from-2023-steam-year-in-review-2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">330 million hours played in 2024</a> which is a big increase from 2023.</p>

      <title>Nexus formally announce their open source cross-platform Nexus Mods App: Stardew Valley Preview</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The new cross-platform and open source Nexus Mods App is coming along with their team now formally announcing the Stardew Valley Preview. With support for Linux / Steam Deck baked right in.</p>
<p>I've been tracking it for a while, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/stardew-valley-modding-on-linux-steam-deck-takes-a-step-with-the-nexus-mods-app/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">regularly reporting on it</a> and testing it out and it has come a long way. Exciting, because modding has often been a sore spot for players on Linux platforms including the Steam Deck with Valve's SteamOS Linux. A properly supported app like this is simply a must-have.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20975901581742904757gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20975901581742904757gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Now, they really think it's ready for Stardew Valley fans to jump in and get modding, and give them some feedback on it. Other games will be supported with Cyberpunk 2077, Baldur's Gate 3 or Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord in progress (locked behind an experimental option). Going by their roadmap they do plan to expand it onto various Bethesda games like the Fallout series, Skyrim and more.</p>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Easy and Reliable Mod Installation</strong> – The app ensures a smoother installation process for most mods.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://nexus-mods.github.io/NexusMods.App/users/gettingstarted/DownloadACollection/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Collections</a>﻿</strong> – Easily turn them on and off, allowing you to experiment with using mods in conjunction with collections so that you can configure your perfect setup. Premium users will also have the extra benefit of super-fast collection installs.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://nexus-mods.github.io/NexusMods.App/users/features/Loadouts/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Loadout Management</a>﻿ </strong>– It offers loadouts and loadout switching, with separate configs per loadout, and fast loadout creation and cloning. This means you can easily swap between different sets of mods, perfect for switching between single-player and multiplayer setups.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://nexus-mods.github.io/NexusMods.App/users/features/HealthCheck/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Health Check</a>﻿</strong> – This feature will give you guidance on possible issues in your setup and how to fix them.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://nexus-mods.github.io/NexusMods.App/users/features/Workspaces/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Workspace System</a>﻿ </strong>– View and use every feature side by side with panels, with the ability to open 4 panels side-by-side for seamless multitasking, on demand. So you can cross-reference with ease and quickly compare information across pages, manage mods, and check details without losing your flow.</li>
<li><strong>Faster Than Vortex</strong> – Experience up to 10x faster collection installation compared to Vortex.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Since I last covered it they also put up a quick bug-fix release. The one <em>after</em> the latest release should also <em>hopefully</em> speed up the loading time on Linux, which can be a problem right now.</p>

      <title>Dawnfolk is a must-play if you like chilled unique city-builders</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you like your games that try to break the mold, you should definitely check out the recently released Dawnfolk from Darenn Keller. Made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot</a> it has Native Linux support and is also Steam Deck Verified. <em>Note: key provided for me.</em></p>
<p>Rather unique and not a city-builder like you would expect. Here you take on the role of a ruler who has lost their kingdom to an oppressive darkness. Guided by a mythical companion, Lueur, you explore the world tile-by-tile to expand and remove the darkness.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="79z_w1-XbpM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/64b0c919d64ecb16695fc435ee477d46.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/79z_w1-XbpM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What makes it really unique is not just the setup and visuals but how you actually interact with the game. Most tiles you build in give you little mini-games to do, making every action an added little challenge. It's all quite laid-back though, going as slow or as quickly as you want it to and easy enough to get through, but the result is a thoroughly different take. I couldn't help but be thoroughly charmed by it the more I played of it, and the more I was able to illuminate the map to see all the secrets hidden away.</p>
<p>Coming from the mind of Darenn Keller, who originally worked for Ubisoft Bordeaux on the likes of Ghost Recon and the Assassin's Creed franchises. This is their first independent game and they very much succeeded in making something really interesting.</p>
<p>The developer also announced that in managed to hit over 10,000 sales in the first 5 days. Not bad for a first indie release from a solo developer.</p>
<p>The mixture of simplicity with lots of little game mechanics together really sells the experience. One not to miss and easy to recommend to anyone.</p>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A Unique Blend of City-Building &amp; Mini-Games – Your success depends not only on strategy but also on skillful execution of resource-gathering mini-games.</li>
<li>A Dark, Atmospheric World – A fresh take on the city-builder genre with an eerie yet beautiful aesthetic.</li>
<li>Play at Your Own Pace – Build a thriving settlement in under an hour or take your time uncovering the lore and secrets of the realm.</li>
<li>Designed for Accessibility – Easy to pick up, yet filled with strategic depth for those who seek a challenge.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Starship Troopers: Extermination gets a Steam Deck upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Starship Troopers: Extermination from Offworld just had another major upgrade released, and they're now improving the experience of playing it on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>For Update 1.3 they've added new Steam Deck specific Video settings between Performance and Quality. It's in "Alpha" and they said they hope to improve it in future updates. Nice to see! Although currently it does have an issue where swapping the mode during a match may crash it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9917564331742894557gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I'm definitely going to have to check this out again. Update 1.3 added some other properly exciting additions too like day and night cycles, dynamic weather, staged weapon reloads and various performance improvements. There's also numerous bug fixes, UI improvements, audio improvements and so on.</p>

      <title>Stellaris 4.0 &#39;Phoenix&#39; game-changing update due May 5 with the BioGenesis Expansion</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox have today launched the new Season 09 Expansion Pass, which initially launches with the Stargazer Species Portrait. There's stuff that's actually interesting to come though, but you have to wait until May 5th.</p>
<p>That's because not only is the BioGenesis Expansion launching then, which sounds exciting, but Stellaris 4.0 will officially arrive too overhauling various major parts of the game and hopefully improve performance too.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The Season 09 Expansion Pass includes: </p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>BioGenesis Expansion (May 5, 2025):</strong> Take command of the forces of life itself in BioGenesis. Engineer living ships, terraform entire ecosystems, and wield advanced genetic tools to shape the destiny of your empire. Will you create a utopia of adaptation and growth or weaponize biology to dominate the stars? </li>
<li><strong>Shadows of the Shroud Expansion (Q3 2025):</strong> The psionic plane holds untold power—but at what cost? Shadows of the Shroud is a complete overhaul of the Psionic Ascension path, introducing new moral dilemmas, patron allegiances, and the ever-present temptation of ultimate destruction.</li>
<li><strong>Infernals Species Pack (Q4 2025):</strong> Forge your destiny in the Infernals Species Pack. Adapted to relentless heat and volatile landscapes, you wield the power of extreme environments to reshape the galaxy. Will your empire thrive in the heat, or be consumed by the very forces it seeks to command?</li>
<li><strong>Stargazer Species Portrait (available now):</strong> Dream of the stars with this exclusive portrait, available immediately upon purchasing the Season 09 Expansion Pass. Featuring three phenotypes and unique animations, the Stargazer Species Portrait is perfect for players who seek to embody the spirit of cosmic curiosity.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_Mrj29R5Orw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/87e7115e0cfe319f9e6b6cceb8c47385.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_Mrj29R5Orw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The 4.0 update really is a huge one too, and makes you think - why don't they just do Stellaris 2 at this point? Multiple major features of the game have been completely changed (multiple times in some cases too). Anyway, just some of what to expect from the free update includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Pops and Pop Groups
	<ul>
<li>One of the biggest changes in the Stellaris 4.0 ‘Phoenix’ update, and one of the primary focuses of this Open Beta, is the new Pop system. Rather than being individuals, Pops are now grouped based on Species, Strata, Ethics, and Faction, mostly for calculation purposes. As part of this change, Pop numbers have been increased by a factor of 100, allowing more granular manipulation of Pops by various systems.</li>
<li>All Pop Groups on a planet have simultaneous growth every month following the existing Logistic Growth formulas.
		<ul>
<li>Underrepresented pops are no longer given population growth bonuses.</li>
<li>Fractional growth is not retained from month to month - if a Pop Group would have fractional growth, it has a chance to gain 1 pop that month based on that fraction.</li>
<li>All migration is now handled through the auto-migration system rather than push and pull that previously affected pop growth.</li>
<li>As more granular and simultaneous pop growth is now possible, the minimum growth for small colonies has been removed. Early colonization will be extremely reliant on migration from the empire capital.</li>
<li>Open Beta Note: Xenocompatibility no longer produces hybrid pops, but has not yet been updated to pool all planetary species into a single group for logistic growth purposes. When this is complete, we are likely to remove the Xenocompatibility galaxy setup toggle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A Civilian stratum has been added to represent the masses that do not generally contribute to the empire’s military economy.
		<ul>
<li>Open Beta Note: Civilians are intended to replace Clerks, which will be removed in a future Open Beta update.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Empires now begin with 2000 more pops, most of whom will be Civilians.</li>
<li>More details can be found in <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/stellaris-dev-diary-370-4-0-changes-part-4.1728047/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Stellaris Dev Diary #370</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Planet UI, Zones, Workforce, and Jobs
	<ul>
<li>The other major economic change in the Stellaris 4.0 ‘Phoenix’ update is a revamp to how jobs work.</li>
<li>Rather than Districts and Buildings being especially similar, we are shifting to a model where:
		<ul>
<li>Planets produce and consume resources through Jobs.</li>
<li>Districts provide Jobs based on their development. (Mining District: Add 200 Housing and 200 Miner jobs per development level.)</li>
<li>Zones manipulate what Jobs are provided by Districts. (Foundry Zone: Replace 200 Civilian jobs and 200 Housing with 100 Metallurgists per development level.)
			<ul>
<li>Open Beta Note: Currently the Zones are simpler, and will just provide the jobs. It is our intention for most Zones to convert rather than add.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Buildings are planet-unique and change what the Jobs produce. (Mote Harvesters: Technicians now also produce Volatile Motes.)</li>
<li>Pops produce Workforce that fills up Jobs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Open Beta Note: The Planet UI is still very much a work in progress.</li>
<li>More details can be found in <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/stellaris-dev-diary-371-4-0-changes-part-5.1729244/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Stellaris Dev Diary #371</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Empire Focuses and Timeline
	<ul>
<li>The Situation Log now contains a tab for the Empire Timeline, which keeps track of important milestones of your playthrough.</li>
<li>The Timeline tab also contains a set of Empire Focus Tasks, which are intended to assist players with forming short and medium terms that align with their empire’s nature, while reducing the randomness of the tech tree.
		<ul>
<li>Empires can choose between Conquest, Exploration, and Development as their primary Empire Focuses. You will still gain Tasks from other categories, but they will generally be weighted towards your choice. Some Tasks are basic “Core” Tasks, and will provide progress along all three tracks.</li>
<li>Completing Tasks provides progress towards Guaranteed Technology unlocks that are considered critical for that playstyle. You still need to research the technologies, they only provide the research option when you reach progress milestones. If you already have the technology unlocked or as a permanent research option, there is no alternate reward.</li>
<li>Because Task completion is retroactive and there are no alternate rewards, there should be no benefit in waiting to complete any that you have.</li>
<li>Should you end up with a Task that you find uncompletable or that you do not wish to complete, you can discard it and gain a new Task for a small cost in Unity.</li>
<li>It is our intention that empires that behave consistent with their Empire Focus should naturally complete the Tasks of that category.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>More details can be found in <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/stellaris-dev-diary-368-4-0-changes-part-2.1727417/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Stellaris Dev Diary #368</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trade has been revamped into a standard resource.
	<ul>
<li>Trade is now used as the Market currency.</li>
<li>The Trade Routes system has been removed.</li>
<li>Ships now have logistical upkeep paid by Trade based on whether they are docked (free), friendly space (reduced), neutral space (normal), or hostile space (expensive).
		<ul>
<li>Larger ships tend to have higher upkeep.</li>
<li>The multipliers based on location are set in defines.</li>
<li>Juggernauts do not have logistical upkeep, and reduce the logistical upkeep costs for ships in their system by 75%.</li>
<li>Resources blocks can now include a "logistics" block, which is currently only used by ships.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Planets now have logistical upkeep paid by Trade based on their local resource deficits. This represents the additional costs of diverting freighters to transport materials between planets.
		<ul>
<li>Local deficit costs vary based largely on the base market value of the resources in question.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trade Policies can set how much of your Net trade after logistics upkeep is converted into other resources.</li>
<li>Added galaxy setup sliders for Fleet Upkeep Logistics Costs and Planetary Deficit Logistics Costs.</li>
<li>More details can be found in <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/stellaris-dev-diary-369-4-0-changes-part-3.1728017/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Stellaris Dev Diary #369</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The main help button now displays the Databank window where you can explore brief articles on many in-game concepts, reducing the need to navigate to external information sources.</li>

      <title>Linux kernel 6.14 out late due to &#39;pure incompetence&#39; - don&#39;t get too excited about Linux gaming boosts</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Linux kernel 6.14 has arrived today, and a day later than it was expected. As usual there's lots new from supported hardware to various improvements.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Writing about the release Linus Torvalds <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2025/3/24/797" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So it's early Monday morning (well - early for me, I'm not really a morning person), and I'd love to have some good excuse for why I didn't do the 6.14 release yesterday on my regular Sunday afternoon release schedule.</p>
<p>I'd like to say that some important last-minute thing came up and delayed things.</p>
<p>But no. It's just pure incompetence.</p>
<p>Because absolutely nothing last-minute happened yesterday, and I was just clearing up some unrelated things in order to be ready for the merge window. And in the process just entirely forgot to actually ever cut the release. D'oh.</p>
<p>So yes, a little delayed for no good reason at all, and obviously that means that the merge window has opened. No rest for the wicked (or the incompetent).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the interesting inclusions in kernel 6.14 is enabling the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/ntsync-for-proton-wine-now-in-linux-kernel-6-14-that-should-make-many-steamos-users-happy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new ntsync driver</a> as it's ready, after being in kernel 6.13 but disabled. The idea is for it to better match Windows behaviour for compatibility tools like Wine to run Windows games and apps on Linux. In some cases it can have <em>much</em> better performance than what Wine was originally doing, although it hasn't yet been pulled into Wine but a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/ntsync-driver-support-heads-to-wine-in-a-new-merge-request/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">merge request is open</a>.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">For Valve's Proton however, don't go expecting much here with ntsync. As Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais replied to a user on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/plagman.bsky.social/post/3lkp26xmco22k" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> to note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We already include fsync, which should be as fast or faster as ntsync. We developed ntsync as a general solution that'd be acceptable in upstream Wine, but there's no urgency in including it in the Deck / SteamOS kernel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some other random cherry-picked highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>A fix for Steam Deck OLED potentially entering an unrecoverable faulty state when resuming from suspend.</li>
<li>Faster suspend and resume for some systems.</li>
<li>Lenovo Go S microphone and controller support.</li>
<li>Support for Microsoft's Copilot key on some devices.</li>
<li>SteelSeries Arctis 9 support.</li>
<li>Controller support for the ZOTAC Gaming Zone.</li>
<li>Support for the TECNO Pocket Go.</li>
<li>Support for the Nacon Evol-X Xbox One Controller, 8BitDo SN30 Pro, Hyperkin X91 and Gamesir G7 SE controllers.</li>
<li>Support for the Wooting Two HE.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course there's absolutely loads more including various other improvements to support newer and upcoming hardware from laptops to processors and graphics cards. See more in the <a href="https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v6.x/ChangeLog-6.14" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">full changelog</a>.</p>
<p>Anything in this release you're particularly happy to see?</p>

      <title>Emulation manager EmuDeck 2.4 brings Steam library integration changes, improved BIOS checker</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>EmuDeck is an all-in-one solution for managing emulation on Linux, SteamOS, Steam Deck and other handhelds and the 2.4 release brings some nice additions.</p>
<p>With this release you can select the level of integration you want to see in your Steam Library, between using ES-DE directly or Steam Rom Manager where you'll get an icon for everything. There's a better BIOS detection system, support for the Citron Nintendo Switch emulator (you have to supply it yourself), support for the Nintendo 3DS emulator Azahar and they've gone through their <a href="https://manual.emudeck.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Wiki</a> to overhaul it.</p>
<p>See their highlights in their new video below:</p>

      <title>Thief-like free and open source game The Dark Mod 2.13 brings better AI vision and new graphical goodies</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Dark Mod is a seriously impressive project giving us a completely free and open source standalone Thief-like stealth game, and The Dark Mod 2.13 release is another great one. </p>
<p>In this release they've managed to overhaul AI vision system, which sounds lot more impressive and accurate. They go into a bit of detail on the history on why it wasn't great originally, with light previously being calculated as "either cubes or pyramids with perfect exponential falloff" but now they have "a stochastic sampler model that does regular measurements of the actual light volume pixels and builds a running average of how illuminated different entities are". The result? Light works more like actual light with their example video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JhJYFMNLfT4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c3fb7882da5fdc50e81507133093534e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JhJYFMNLfT4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's also been an overhaul to Mission Management with a new UI. It has a search filter now that "follows modern conventions of reducing the listed items as each new letter eliminates a possible matching mission name" with new sorting options. You can also now scroll the additional mission details and more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QBycvr58ERs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6a6cfc3ae486cace0ef0d63dc6ebe5cd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QBycvr58ERs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They've also added in Parallax Occlusion Mapping and other new graphical goodies, an improved training mission, new potions were added, new assets are available for mission builders and <a href="https://wiki.thedarkmod.com/index.php?title=What%27s_new_in_TDM_2.13" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">much more</a>.</p>

      <title>The EchoPatch to modernize F.E.A.R. adds in gamepad support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>EchoPatch, a mod patch for the classic and awesome shooter F.E.A.R. has another new release out and this brings gamepad support. I wrote about this patch <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/echopatch-mod-is-a-great-way-to-modernise-the-classic-shooter-fear/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">only recently</a> because it's awesome.</p>
<p>The patch itself does work just fine with Proton on Linux, and now it should make it even better for players who prefer a gamepad and Steam Deck too. A great time for the game since it was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/silent-hill-4-fear-and-more-join-the-gog-preservation-program/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently added to the GOG Preservation Program</a>.</p>

<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="gsPqwR53Z3g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f192b8319d1e11975a1da8cf5c8c3e9a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/gsPqwR53Z3g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Jet-fueled knuckle acrobatics! Scientifically inaccurate flight action that rewards high-speed momentum and precision. Feel free to completely ignore G-force in the name of awesomeness, and keep smashing, crashing and crushing to stay in the flow!</li>
<li>Non-stop arcade action! Tons of standalone levels (How many? we don't know yet, we're still making them! but there will be plenty!) packed with fresh things to punch, easily navigable through a revolutionary new innovation we call a "map screen". Utilize the environment, find rewards, and chase perfection!</li>
<li>Hoard equipment for the challenges ahead! Collect and upgrade a large array of gear that offers drastic gameplay changes. Ignore all fashion sense and pick item combinations that suit your playstyle, specialize in optimized builds for each challenge, or go for stylish matching gear- it's all good.</li>
<li>A rogues gallery of despicable villains! From high-rise clockwork cities to soot black forests, each biome in Motorland is under the grip of the scheming business partners of power-hungry industrialist Baron Tychoon. They've kidnapped a whole orphanage and put the little ragamuffins to work among the crushing pistons and spinning cogs of their robotic death machines, and it's up to you to save the kids. Crush this cadre of conniving crooks before facing the ultimate foe!</li>
<li>Drop into battle together with a friend! It is nice to have friends. It's even better when they can join you in battle! Fight together across the main campaign, or beat the snot out of each other in a friendly game of Knuckleball.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Minecraft is getting a graphics overhaul with the Vibrant Visuals update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Minecraft Live has been and gone again and this time there was some pretty big news. Vibrant Visuals was announced as a future major upgrade, which will bring some fancier looking graphics to Minecraft. Now before you get your pitchforks out about how much you like the current look of Minecraft, it seems it will be entirely optional.</p>
<p><em>It will come to the Bedrock edition first, with the Java edition getting it later.</em></p>
<p>What to expect from it? It looks like a shader pack. They'll be officially adding in things like directional lighting, subsurface scattering, volumetric fog and more. With that you'll see lots of improvements to how it looks throughout the whole game. From light rays shining through windows to shadows moving with the sun and more. </p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5zcZJcXRdw0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/13bcabf3ada74cd3ed33c7b8e80fe251.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5zcZJcXRdw0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The next main update is Spring to Life, which should release tomorrow that includes variants of a few different mobs, new ambient features like the firefly bush and falling leaves. More on that when it's out.</p>
<p>Another new update was also teased that will feature the dried ghast – a new block you’ll find in the Nether. You can bring it back to the Overworld, and bring it back to life as a friendly mob. You'll be able to put a harness on it, mount up and go soaring through the sky.</p>

      <title>Wine 10.4 continues work on Bluetooth driver and more Vulkan video decoder support in WineD3D</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wine 10.4 is out now as the latest development release of the Windows compatibility layer, bringing new features and assorted bug fixes.</p>
<p>Highlighted additions in this release include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improvements to PDB support in DbgHelp.</li>
<li>More Vulkan video decoder support in WineD3D.</li>
<li>Accessibility support in the SysLink control.</li>
<li>More progress on the Bluetooth driver.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's also bug fixes for Battle.net, Steam, Need for Speed: Shift, Command &amp; Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath, Europa Universalis 4 Golden Century, ShaderMap 4.x, Chessbase, Zenless Zone Zero, Myst, iTunes, Firefox and more.</p>
<p>See all in <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/releases/wine-10.4" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the release notes</a>.</p>
<p>Since Valve's Proton is built from Wine, to preempt the question — no, we don't know exactly when Proton 10 will release after rebasing onto Wine 10. Proton 8 was released in April 2023, Proton 9 got a Beta in late April 2024 with a release in May, so it's probably not likely until sometime around April / May.</p>

      <title>The Last of Us Part II Remastered devs aiming for &#34;best possible experience on handheld gaming devices&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sony have revealed the system requirements and more info for the PC release of The Last of Us Part II Remastered, which is due to arrive on April 3rd. Looks like it might be good news for Steam Deck owners too.</p>
<p>The first game on PC released in quite a poor state so hopefully this time around they have learned from some mistakes. Sounds like they may have as they've pulled in Nixxes Software in addition to Iron Galaxy as well. On top of that, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/playstation-network-requirement-on-pc-will-now-be-optional-with-in-game-rewards/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">as Sony announced previously</a>, there's no PlayStation Network requirement here now but you will get bonus features if you sign-in.</p>
<p>For Steam Deck players, they didn't mention the handheld specifically but they did note how it offers a "wide range of graphics settings and presets, to ensure the best possible experience on hardware ranging from high-end PCs to handheld gaming devices". <em>The minimum system requirements seem quite reasonable too.</em></p>
<p>One <em>potential</em> issue here though is that they say it supports the PlayStation Overlay, which does not work on Linux platforms with Proton. It's part of why Ghost of Tsushima is rated Unsupported. However, since the sign-in is optional, hopefully that won't cause any problems.</p>
<p>The system requirements:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5475464221742577448gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5475464221742577448gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The PC release arrives with support for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nvidia DLSS 3 Super Resolution and Frame Generation support.</li>
<li>AMD FSR 3.1 and AMD FSR 4 support with upscaling and frame generation.</li>
<li>VSync and framerate cap options, including an uncapped framerate option.</li>
<li>DirectStorage support, and more.</li>
</ul>

<p class="plain-list-title">System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster Key Features:</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From Ogre Pixel who made Lonesome Village and A Tiny Sticker Tale, their next game is an action roguelike where you're defending a walking castle. Castlebound seems like it could be a lot of fun.</p>
<p>You fight off various waves of different foes while trying to progress through each level, all while ensuring your castle keeps on walking. Available to play solo or in local co-op too, could be another great game to play with a partner. So it's a mixture of base defence with a whole lot of fast-paced action going on.</p>
<p>Check out the first gameplay teaser below:</p>

<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fast-Paced Combat: Jump, dodge, and unleash devastating attacks to fend off relentless enemy hordes!</li>
<li>Defend the Walking Castle: Protect your fortress as it moves through dangerous lands!</li>
<li>Solo or Co-Op Action: Take on the challenge alone or team up with a friend for an epic multiplayer adventure!</li>

      <title>The Entertainment Software Association have launched the Accessible Games Initiative </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Accessible Games Initiative from the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) has been launched, with an aim to improve how developers and stores list clear information about the accessibility features available in video games.</p>
<p>It was announced at GDC this year with Electronic Arts, Google, Microsoft, Nintendo of America, Sony Interactive Entertainment, Ubisoft, Amazon Games, Riot Games, Square Enix and Warner Bros. Games signing up to it. It will be directly managed be the ESA.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11899726521742556755gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The primary purpose of the new Accessible Games Initiative is to help provide clear information about whether a specific video game has accessibility features and, if so, what those features are. The initiative is launching with a set of 24 “tags,” all with clear criteria about what each tag means. Sample tags include: <em>clear text, large and clear subtitles, narrated menus, stick inversion and save anytime</em>, among others. Over time, participating companies will place the Accessible Games Initiative tags near their game product information – for example on digital storefronts, product pages or digital catalogues. This can help provide players and other consumers, such as parents and teachers, with clear information about which features are in any given game before they make a purchase.</p>
<p>“Tens of millions of Americans have a disability and often face barriers to experiencing the joy and connection that comes with playing video games,” said Stanley Pierre-Louis, ESA president and CEO. “We are immensely proud to announce the Accessible Games Initiative in partnership with industry leaders. This initiative demonstrates how impactful we can be when we work together in our industry-wide pursuit of helping more people experience the power of play.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully we will see the likes of Valve expand on accessibility notices on Steam store pages, they could definitely do with noting various features on there to help people.</p>
<p>I would really like to be able to search directly for games on Steam that have font and UI scaling, which is one of the biggest nuisances not just for Steam Deck but for Desktop too. I find too many games have tiny text. I can't imagine how bad it is for people with worse vision than me. This all sounds like a good step in the right direction.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental adds fixes for GTA V Enhanced and more for Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released another smaller update for Proton Experimental, the constantly changing compatibility layer to run Windows games on Linux platforms like the Steam Deck with SteamOS. Confused on the differences between each Proton version? Then be sure to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check out my guide</a>.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The Proton Experimental update for March 20th has these changes noted:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced crashing on launch*.</li>
<li>Fixed The Finals crashing after a recent game update. (previously in Proton Hotfix)</li>
<li>Fixed Warhammer: Vermintide 2 showing prerequsite installer on every launch.</li>
<li>Added Steamworks SDK 1.62 support.</li>
</ul>
<p>*There's still no online play for GTA Online, since it's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/grand-theft-auto-v-gets-battleye-anti-cheat-breaks-online-play-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">intentionally blocked by Rockstar</a>. Single-player works though. See more anti-cheat game compatibility on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our dedicated page</a>.</p>
<p>This update will just show up in your Steam Downloads for Proton Experimental, it would have been automatically downloaded if you launched a game that Valve set to use it.</p>

      <title>Everything to grab from Prime Gaming, March 21st edition for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's the up to date list of games available on Amazon Prime Gaming for March 21st, and what compatibility you can expect for Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck. An easy way to build up your gaming collection with these games coming as part of your Amazon Prime subscription.</p>
<p>I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"/> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play. Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now.</p>
<p>You can install games from Epic, GOG and Amazon easily via <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/heroic-games-launcher-2152-released-fixing-amazon-gog-and-epic-games-issues/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Heroic Games Launcher</a> with Prime giving you a code for each game for whatever store it's on. For any games that use anti-cheat be sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat compatibility page</a>.</p>

      <title>SteamOS 3.7.2 Preview gets a fix for the Steam Deck OLED</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Valve continue working towards the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">public SteamOS 3 release for more devices</a>, and we've seen them note work towards that in the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/steamos-3-7-0-preview-brings-the-beginnings-of-support-for-non-steam-deck-handhelds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">initial SteamOS 3.7 Preview</a>, they continue rolling out more bug fixes for the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>The latest "SteamOS 3.7.2 Preview: 2 Safe 2 Sound" release is available with this fix:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fixed a sound crash on session switch on Steam Deck OLED</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Source: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/529841887223218179" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Valve</a></em></p>
<p>Since this is in Preview you need to manually opt into it via Settings &gt; System &gt; System Update Channel. SteamOS 3.7 is a big update but it's not reccomended if you want a properly stable experience.</p>
<p>One annoyance I've encountered so far is that all input seems to randomly break sometimes. On both the Steam Deck itself and external controllers. A bug is <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/SteamOS/issues/1838" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">already logged</a> with Valve on this.</p>

      <title>Assassin&#39;s Creed Shadows out now - Steam Deck Verified but has NVIDIA problems on Desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is out now and it's Steam Deck Verified, so I took a look to see if it deserves the rating. The good news is that it will also work on normal Desktop Linux with AMD GPUs but NVIDIA GPUs have problems.</p>
<p>There's a Proton bug <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/8543" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report open</a> for NVIDIA owners, with it noting the game freezes before accessing the main menu. A possible workaround is to use the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">NVIDIA Developer Beta Driver</a> 570.123.06, which may have a fix. That's not a normal driver though. <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/8543#issuecomment-2739884726" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">According</a> to the developer of VKD3D-Proton it's a known driver bug and there's another workaround in the link.</p>
<h4>Steam Deck</h4>
<p>As for Steam Deck, I was really interested to see if it actually truly <em>deserved</em> being Steam Deck Verified. This testing was done on the <strong>Steam Deck LCD 512GB</strong> model. For verification currently it appears Valve used Proton Experimental.</p>
<p>I will take this initial time to <em>complain</em> about one thing first though, and you likely already know what — extra launchers and logins. It's plain and simply annoying downloading a game, getting excited and ready to play to then having to login to an extra launcher for single-player.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7471989951742468533gol1.jpeg"/><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9725216181742468534gol1.jpeg"/><br/>
<em>That said, it all worked fine.</em></p>
<p>With the interface, it's <em>mostly</em> great. Ubisoft have some nice settings you can tweak, with it defaulting to large sizes for text and icons. However, when it shows up some icons on-screen like initial tutorial bits telling you specific buttons, the icons are <em>tiny</em> and very unclear. Apart from that though, I have no problems with the interface, it fits nicely.</p>
<p>For the Steam Deck, Ubisoft have locked away most graphical settings but they have left in upscaling settings and frame generation. The default settings use TAA, with the option of AMD FSR and Intel XeSS available. For these default settings the game (so far) appears to hover close to 30FPS, although it will repeatedly drop below it. Even so, it feels smooth and most importantly <em>enjoyable</em> on the defaults.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10181502301742470085gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10181502301742470085gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5302331331742470090gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5302331331742470090gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Testing between the different upscalers. I barely saw any difference in performance between TAA, FSR and XeSS. TAA actually looks better than the others, so this might be a rare case where sticking with the actual defaults is just — fine.</p>
<p>Don't bother with Frame Generation though, as with most heavy titles on Steam Deck, it absolutely destroys the Frame Timing making it quite a <em>mess</em>. It doesn't even really improve FPS here, just ruins Frame Timing making it feel awful. The Steam Deck simply doesn't have the performance needed to make Frame Generation work for most titles.</p>
<p>As long as you keep expectations in check and don't expect to see 60FPS, you're quite likely to have a good time with Assassin’s Creed Shadows on Steam Deck. At least from my so far cursory check (I need to see more of the game), it's <em>surprisingly</em> good on Steam Deck and seems like it holds up pretty nicely. You have to remember most normal people are not playing with an FPS counter up, they won't even notice the small momentary drops. In the open world it really holds up nicely, just some bigger more intense fights with lots going on can bring some dips. About what you would expected for a game as big as this.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/386580351742472303gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/386580351742472303gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20558264641742472952gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20558264641742472952gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>I have to say it looks quite gorgeous on the Steam Deck screen too. I think Ubisoft did actually a good job on the details here, even when it's clearly running on lower settings with upscalers on a lower resolution. There are some really minor upscaler artifacts when you look very close, but not noticeable when you're just playing it. It actually looks <em>far</em> better than the screenshots show.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6440560611742473853gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6440560611742473853gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>For battery life, tested on the Steam Deck LCD, you're not going to get much above 1 hour. It really does drain it quickly there. So you're going to want a charger or battery pack readily available for this one.</p>
<p>Ubisoft said they will be looking into providing further graphics options on Steam Deck in future updates.</p>
<p>For those of you who do want to tweak more settings, sadly the usual method of setting the "SteamDeck=0 %command%" launch option doesn't work here. So they're doing something different to detect the Steam Deck compared with other games.</p>
<h4>Offline Play?</h4>
<p>If you're also curious about offline play with no internet connection, I tested that too. When disabling WiFi, sadly, it <em>doesn't</em> appear to work. Ubisoft Connect will repeatedly tell you "connection lost", and clicking "Go offline" in the launcher doesn't seem to do anything and it just repeats. Their "Go offline" button appears pointless. So based on that, it's only portable if you have a connection, which is another mark against these ridiculous launchers. <em>This is not mentioned on Valve's verification notice, which it should be.</em></p>
<p>The above point contradicts what they <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1791095143799414951" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">said</a> before release on X/Twitter. I tested it on Desktop Linux too, and it doesn't launch without an active internet connection.</p>
<h4>Desktop Linux</h4>
<p>As for Desktop Linux, at least with AMD GPUs, the experience there should be pretty great overall. Naturally much better performance than the Steam Deck. However, it does have an initial notice stating it's been installed on a HDD instead of an SSD but that can be safely ignored. Hopefully Valve can find a fix in Proton to stop this notice appearing.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16858536511742476809gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16858536511742476809gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Performance is generally about where I expected it to be on my Kubuntu Linux desktop running an AMD Ryzen 5800X and Radeon 6800 XT at 2560x1440 resolution. By default it set me to the High preset at 60FPS which did feel pretty great, but tweaking it a bit you can get it running <em>much</em> better with only minimal changes.</p>
<p>Setting it to AMD FSR Quality + Frame Generation, enabled me to see a lot of it around 100FPS and it still does look incredible.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13890098231742477632gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13890098231742477632gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8356103281742478999gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/8356103281742478999gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>An issue that I have seen across both Steam Deck and Desktop Linux, is that the game will not always quit properly, so you may have to force-quit it.</p>
<p>For the Steam launch as a whole it arrives with Steam Achievements, Trading Cards, Badges, Emoticons and Profile Background Images. Nice to see a proper release. Nice to see another big release working so well on Linux systems, at least if you're on an AMD GPU.</p>

      <title>Communications Workers of America (CWA) announce an industry-wide video game union</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Great news for game developers and everyone involved in the industry that isn't at the top of the chain, as the Communications Workers of America (CWA) in partnership with the American Federation of Musicians (AFM) have announced an industry-wide video game union.</p>
<p>Called the UVW-CWA (United Videogame Workers-CWA), their aim is to help protect workers rights, which is sorely needed, given the absolute masses of layoffs over the last few years, which still shows no real sign of stopping.</p>

<p>“The creation of this union was not done in isolation; it’s a cumulative effort by the thousands of video game workers who have been fighting for years to redefine what it means to stand together and reclaim power in one of the largest and highest-grossing industries on the globe,” said Tom Smith, CWA’s Senior Director of Organizing. “These workers are taking a bold stand, joining together to build power for the workers behind the games we all know and love.”</p>
<p>“Our mission is to take back our lives, our labor, and our passion from those who treat us like replaceable cogs; to empower our fellow workers; to link up arms with the laid off, with the freelancer, with the disillusioned contractor, with the disenfranchised and the marginalized, with the workers laboring invisibly to keep this industry afloat,” reads UVW-CWA’s mission statement. “We are going to create a game industry that works for us, one that nourishes its talent and invests in its future, rather than constantly seeking short-term profits. We are the ones that make the games, so we must be the ones that set the terms of how we work.”</p>

      <title>Metal band Voivod are getting an official video game from Chaosmonger Studio</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Chaosmonger Studio developer of ENCODYA, Speedollama, Three Minutes To Eight and Clunky Hero have announced their working on an official video game for the metal band Voivod.</p>
<p>It's going to be a retro styled pixel-art action-platformer that's inspired by the band's concept albums. From the email: "Voivod: The Nuclear Warrior immerses players in a post-apocalyptic world filled with biomechanical mutants, cybernetic fortresses, and war-torn wastelands. Featuring pixel-art visuals reminiscent of the golden era of action platformers, the game aims to capture both the intensity of classic run-and-gun combat and the depth of exploration found in Metroidvania titles."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15999622221742471578gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15999622221742471578gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1744318581742471579gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1744318581742471579gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left">To ensure an authentic representation of their artistic vision, Voivod is actively involved in the game's development. The band will oversee the creative direction, ensuring that the world, characters, and music align perfectly with the band's deep and intricate lore. Furthermore, each member of Voivod has a dedicated role in shaping the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Michel Langevin (<strong>Away</strong>) is contributing to the game’s visual design and artwork.</li>
<li>Daniel Mongrain (<strong>Chewy</strong>) is supervising the adaptation of Voivod’s music into a game-friendly format.</li>
<li>Denis Bélanger (<strong>Snake</strong>) lends his voice to the protagonist.</li>
<li>Dominic Laroche (<strong>Rocky</strong>) will playtest and provide gameplay feedback.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not the first time they've worked together, as Nicola Piovesan of Chaosmonger Studio noted in the email that "Nicola and Chaosmonger Studio previously created the acclaimed music video for Voivod’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itHcrRaZhXs" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Target Earth</a>, a visually stunning 3D animation that captured the band's aesthetic long before AI-generated content became mainstream".</p>
<p>There's no release date being set as it's due to launch a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/piovesan/voivod-the-nuclear-warrior/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> crowdfunding campaign too.</p>

      <title>Lenovo Legion Go S with SteamOS now on Best Buy for pre-order with Ryzen Z1 Extreme or Ryzen Z2 Go</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While there doesn't seem to have been any announcement from Lenovo yet that I can see, Best Buy in the USA have put up two versions of the Lenovo Legion Go S with SteamOS for pre-order.</p>
<p>This is the <em>first</em> approved third-party device with SteamOS from Valve as an alternative to Windows, the same system used on the popular Steam Deck. Not a surprise to see them appear now, since the Game Developers Conference (GDC) has begun. Valve are getting closer with a SteamOS 3 public release too, with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/steamos-3-7-0-preview-brings-the-beginnings-of-support-for-non-steam-deck-handhelds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.7 preview</a> adding the beginnings of support for non-Steam Deck handhelds.</p>
<p>Best Buy are listing a Legion Go S with the AMD Ryzen Z2 Go, 16GB RAM and a 512GB SSD for <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lenovo-legion-go-s-8-steamos-120hz-gaming-handheld-amd-ryzen-z2-go-16gb-with-512gb-ssd-nebula/6619192.p?skuId=6619192" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">$549.99</a> and also a Ryzen Z1 Extreme model with 32GB RAM and a 1TB SSD for <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lenovo-legion-go-s-8-steamos-120hz-gaming-handheld-amd-ryzen-z1-extreme-32gb-with-1tb-ssd-nebula/6619188.p?skuId=6619188" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">$749.99</a>. It's worth nothing the comparable versions with Windows are $729.99 for the Ryzen Z2 Go and $829.99 for the Z1 Extreme.</p>
<p>Best Buy are listing the actual release date as March 25th for the SteamOS versions, and the Windows version of the Z1 Extreme, but we don't know if that's correct or their best guess for now.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/71030581742466234gol1.png"/></p>
<p>I'm excited to see it release, but the current reviews of the Windows version haven't exactly been favourable due to a mixture of Windows issues and the lower powered Ryzen Z2 Go chip. Perhaps SteamOS and the lower prices will make it better value.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on their pricing versus the Steam Deck LCD and Steam Deck OLED?</p>

      <title>Help, I&#39;ve discovered Nubby&#39;s Number Factory, a &#39;plinko-style roguelike&#39; where you stop the sun exploding</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>See you in a week. Nubby's Number Factory is what the developer calls a "plinko-style roguelike" (everything is a roguelike now apparently?) where you drop your ball (Nubby) down a pegboard to rack up increasingly large numbers to stop the sun from exploding.</p>
<p>It's really simple but it deliciously sucks your time away as you keep on dropping Nubby down to get higher numbers. It's the same sort of feeling you might get from putting time into the likes of Balatro, Ballionaire and various other straight to the point games. Much like Balatro, you're trying to hit a specific number each round. </p>
<p><em>Tested on Kubuntu Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the latest Proton 9.0-4</a> it works perfectly.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1652492881742465378gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1652492881742465378gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The basics are: you click to aim and launch Nubby down the pegboard, where Nubby will bump into all the numbers and they continue to add up. The pegs can be hit multiple times, as each number is double of the one before it. So a peg of 32 can be hit down to 16, 8, 4, 2 and 1.</p>
<p>It's all about hitting your quota for each run. The numbers end up getting silly at hundreds of thousands and more. You only have a limited number of Nubby's to launch down the board though to hit the quota each round, so you have to aim carefully. Sometimes it really is just hoping for the best. You also have to reach the quota from a <em>single</em> launch of Nubby, otherwise it resets the board to try again. And with you only having a limited number, if you fail on your last one it's game over and you begin afresh.</p>
<p>To help you on your mission there's also a shop system, so you can spend some of your hard earned cash on 50 different items to help you surpass that ever-increasing quota. Items like a Flamethrower that can pop a random peg and pop 8 nearby pegs as well, or Jake the Snake that can double all pegs. Or, the Rubber Chicken that if activated when Nubby is still on the board will launch an egg missile that will explode a bunch of Pegs. The items are just plain <em>silly</em>. You can upgrade these items as well by buying up the same one and dragging it over the top of the other.</p>
<p>You also get random loot drops as well that will give you permanent perks like an increased chance to trigger your purchased items, a Grab-A-Tron like arcade grabber game to gain you some extras and more.</p>
<p>It also throws in various different types of Pegs too. There's plain numbers but there's also Pegs that can give you extra gold, Pegs that will explode the highest other Peg that isn't themselves, Pegs that will kill Nubby and all sorts.</p>

<p>I love the really cheap style of it too, it reminds me of various bargain-bin games when shopping around PC World when I was young and had a head full of hair. That's the only real way I can describe it, the graphics are kind-of hilarious. The kind of thing I would have expected in some kind of "100 games in 1!" collection. It's clever with it though and charming.</p>
<p>This is one game that someone might have to come over and physically pull me away from. I need more. Lots more. Nothing else matters right now, I need to stop the sun from exploding and make bigger numbers.</p>
<p>Absolutely love it. One to grab for sure and it's only £4.29.</p>

      <title>GNOME 48 released with Notification Stacking, Performance Improvements and initial HDR support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GNOME 48 is a big new release including multiple major enhancements to one of the most-used desktop environments on Linux. There's some big stuff in this one!</p>
<p>For those of you with a HDR monitor you can finally use some of it! This brings the initial introduction of system-level HDR support enabling you to turn it on in the display settings. There's also a new Digital Wellbeing settings section that allows you to adjust screen time limits (good for kids), break reminders and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15436824861742462934gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15436824861742462934gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Notification Stacking is another nice one. Bundling together similar notifications in the top bar to not overwhelm you, and it just overall looks a whole lot better.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3867806981742462905gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3867806981742462905gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14723402941742462906gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14723402941742462906gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>The developers noted various performance improvements too like introducing dynamic triple buffering, finally, after going through "significant review and testing over a period of five years". They said it should improve the "perceived smoothness of changes on screen, with fewer skipped frames and more fluid animations". On top of that some other performance improvements included:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>GNOME’s JavaScript engine, a core part of the desktop, has reduced CPU and memory usage for many common operations.</li>
<li>File indexing now uses less memory when crawling large folders, and has faster multimedia metadata extraction.</li>
<li>Users with monitors directly attached to a discrete graphics card will experience improved performance and stability.</li>
<li>In Files, significant performance improvements have been made to folder load time and scroll rendering. These enhancements primarily apply to folders which contain a lot of thumbnails. In testing they resulted in a ×5 speed increase when loading, and a ×10 rendering speed increase for scrolling.</li>
<li>Optimizations in the latest GTK version result in faster performance when app interfaces are created and resized.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's also an enhanced image viewer, new fonts and a feature to let you adjust maximum battery charge level to help preserve its life. Also added is Decibels, a new minimal audio player and an updated text editor.</p>
<p>Some of the other listed new features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Global shortcuts</strong>: apps can now create their own system-wide shortcuts. This is useful for cases when you want to control an app when not directly interacting with it, for example when recording screencasts. Apps must request permission to add global shortcuts, and global shortcuts can be removed from the Apps page in the Settings app.</li>
<li><strong>Window placement improvements</strong>: new windows are now placed in the center of the screen by default, for a more natural and balanced layout. There have also been several improvements to window placement when using multiple displays.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced support for special function keys</strong>: if your keyboard includes <kbd>Copy</kbd>, <kbd>Paste</kbd>, <kbd>Cut</kbd>, <kbd>Undo</kbd>, or <kbd>Redo</kbd> keys, they can now be used in entries and text fields. The <kbd>Find</kbd> key is now also supported in many contexts to initiate searches.</li>
<li><strong>Contacts UI improvements</strong>: the layout of contact editing has been improved for better usability, and birthday editing is now adaptive, enhancing support for different devices.</li>
<li><strong>Settings refinements</strong>: in Region and Language, the formats dialog has been updated for improved locale and format selection. The Power settings have also been restructured to aid navigation.</li>
<li><strong>Orca screen reader on Wayland</strong>: Orca shortcuts now function correctly in GNOME with Wayland, including the use of the Caps Lock key as the Orca modifier key. This is a major step forward in making assistive technologies available with the default GNOME display manager.</li>
<li><strong>Refined app interfaces:</strong> app interface colors have been slightly tweaked, buttons and entries are slightly more rounded, and banners and toasts have been restyled.</li>
<li><strong>Maps modernization</strong>: Maps includes various interface enhancements, including updated spinners, animated star buttons, and a redesigned point of interest editing window.</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility support in Web</strong>: accessible contents of web pages are now available when Web is running as a Flatpak. This is a major security enhancement for users of accessibility features.</li>
<li><strong>Calendar refinements</strong>: the event editor dialog in Calendar has been significantly improved, with redesigned date/time scheduling, improved calendar selection, and the ability to set the timezone. Additionally, various other UX improvements and bug fixes have been implemented, and performance has been significantly improved when showing many events at once.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Unique platformer Ruffy and the Riverside with a copy and paste mechanic releases June 26</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ruffy and the Riverside could be one of the best platformers of 2025, and it's going to release with Native Linux support on June 26th. The release date was revealed today on the PlayStation blog, but it's a confirmed date for all platforms.</p>
<p>In Ruffy and the Riverside, you wield the magic power of SWAP, using it to Copy &amp; Paste textures within the game world. Turn ice into lava or waterfalls into vines as you ride hay bales, explore, fight, and solve puzzles throughout Riverside. Unleash your imagination in this quirky open-world action game that literally lets you change the world! It's seriously clever and one you have to try. </p>
<p>The game was going to launch in Q1 but they said the date was moved to June 26 to "ensure a simultaneous release on all platforms and to make this the best possible game it can be".</p>

      <title>The UPERFECT UMax 24 is a gorgeous addition to any desk</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In need of a new monitor? UPERFECT sent over a review unit of the UPERFECT UMax 24 and I've come away from it thoroughly impressed with it. <em>Disclosure: the review unit was not required to be sent back.</em></p>
<p>You might know the name <a href="https://uperfect.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">UPERFECT</a> from some of their great looking reasonably sized portable monitors.</p>
<p>Now, <em>technically</em>, this <em>is</em> a portable monitor but it's on the rather large size at 24.5 inches so it's really pushing the limits here of what's possible (no battery, it's USB-C powered). Portable then, with an asterisk, that it's not something you're going to stick in an ordinary bag. But it is super simple quickly to pack it down and move.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, it's still pretty light and easy to move around anywhere and I've tested this between multiple locations for setting it up. What makes it <em>great</em> is the quality built-in stand. Anywhere you can find the space for it you can just stick it down, plug in and away you go.</p>
<p>First impressions are everything of course, and the UPERFECT UMax 24 doesn't disappoint. The flip-out stand on the back, despite being quite thin, feels decently strong. Unless you're really doing something stupid, I don't see it breaking. And, bonus, it's actually incredibly stable with it too. More so than I actually expected. I thought there would be a fair bit of wobble (I've seen some awful stands for things in my time), but it's as solid as a rock with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7947054001742385653gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7947054001742385653gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>My testing with it has been mainly with a Steam Deck attached to it. Although it will support basically any device that can be hooked up via the full-featured Type-C and mini-HDMI ports on the side.</p>
<p>This is hardware I've always wanted to try! But I don’t have a reference here against any other portable monitor, besides the Elecrow CrowView Note that has an integrated keyboard, but they’re different markets and this absolutely blows that out of the water. So with that in mind, I’ve only usually tested more traditional monitors of which I’ve been through many over the years. And yet, the UPERFECT UMax 24 sold itself very quickly. That said as well, I will be surprised if there’s many such portable monitors with a built-in stand of this size that will be able to beat it - it’s just that good.</p>
<p>Originally, I had my Steam Deck hooked up to the additional HDMI port on my main work monitor. That's been quite a nuisance to swap between, so having a dedicated monitor like this has actually been thoroughly great. Not just due to having an extra (always nice), but because the UPERFECT UMax 24 is properly gorgeous. Easily giving my main monitor for work and play a run for its money.</p>
<p>It comes with everything you need out of the box including a USB-C to USB-C cable, a mini-HDMI to HDMI cable, a power adaptor and even VESA mounting screws. As you don’t have to use the stand, you can attach it to a mount as well, like a traditional monitor.</p>
<p>In terms of features it’s ridiculously packed too. You get a nice 165Hz, 2560 × 1440 (QHD) IPS screen that supports HDR and Freesync. It also has a blue light protection feature and 100% sRGB so in motion while playing games, it looks brilliant. Although the screen is capable of 165Hz you’ll only get up to 144Hz with the HDMI, but the USB-C port gives the max 165Hz.</p>
<p>The 178° viewing angle is <em>wonderful</em> too. I’ve set this up and moved it about for a few co-op sessions over the last week, and it hasn’t given a single issue on that. The screen remains crisp and clear from quite a ways over to the side of it so there’s many ways this can be used from gaming to work.</p>
<p>The only build quality issue here that I can see are the buttons on the side to power it on and manage the on-screen UI for adjusting volume, picture and so on. I’ve actually never found a monitor that didn’t have rubbish buttons, so I’ve just come to expect that. They’re not overly bad, just they feel a bit wobbly and cheap compared to the rest of it. Bit weird to have everything else about it so nice.</p>
<p>Nothing to really note about the on-screen UI to adjust things either. It’s a bit fiddly with the buttons, as it always is on monitors but generally acceptable to do what you want to adjust the picture, turn on</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6241084421742389717gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6241084421742389717gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Wonderfully thin too (563 × 324 × 16 mm (8 × 12.76 × 0.63 inch)), so it really doesn’t take up much room other than being on the larger size overall. Despite the sleekness of it, the durability of the monitor itself feels close to perfect. Apart from those side buttons, the build quality is truly fantastic and the design of it is great with a nice thin border on it so it doesn’t look too imposing. Zero issues with ports lining up that I've seen across other devices, they look perfectly placed.</p>
<p>As for sound quality, don't go expecting the world here, it's nothing special. It's "2*8Ω 1W" according to the specs sheet, which is perfectly <em>fine</em> for me and wasn't a problem during co-op but a little bit louder would have been nice to have. Loud enough to be clear enough to enjoy playing games on it, even while my (somewhat loud) fan heater was going to not cause any problems.</p>

<p>When it comes to such a review, I’ve been trying to think of things to add in. However, I’m not one to unnecessarily pad any of my articles with fluff just to hit some sort of mark. The fact is: if you’re after a display that’s quite portable, very versatile <em>and</em> big then this might be your best bet — the ultimate portable monitor for all your needs. However, if truly easily portable is your definite need, going for the smaller model <em>might</em> be a better idea. Overall though, my time with it has been absolutely great. Really do love it.</p>
<p><em>Thank you to UPERFECT for their trust in sending it over.</em></p>
<p>If interested you can purchase it <a href="https://uperfect.com/products/24-inch-monitor" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">directly from their website</a>. At time of writing the normal price is $539.99 but it’s discounted to $439.99.</p>

      <title>Fedora Linux 42 Beta and Fedora Asahi Remix 42 Beta released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fedora Linux 42 Beta and for macOS hardware Fedora Asahi Remix 42 Beta are both now available for some testing to help make another great Linux distribution release.</p>
<p>One exciting major addition here for Fedora Linux 42 is that the KDE Plasma desktop has now been promoted to "edition status", meaning you can consider it a flagship experience and that their support of the KDE Plasma desktop will be good.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8894099091742390503gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8894099091742390503gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Fedora KDE 42 Beta</em></p>
<p>Additionally they also now have a Fedora COSMIC spin, the new in-development Rust-based desktop environment from hardware vendor System76.</p>
<p>Another change for Fedora Linux 42 is the installer, which introduces a new "Web UI" as the default for Fedora Workstation (GNOME). They said "This means that users can enjoy a smooth installation experience, with features such as an installation progress indicator, built in help, configuration review and more. This new feature also includes Wizard which will allow users to skip what they don’t need during installation". On top of that it adds ina proper guided partition manager for easy installs.</p>
<p>More in the <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-linux-42-beta/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release announcement</a>.</p>
<p>On the Fedora Asahi side it includes all the main improvements from Fedora Linux 42, plus a notable change of the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/FEX" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">integration of FEX in Fedora Linux</a> which they say "provides an easier way to run x86 and x86-64 binaries out of the box via emulation".</p>

      <title>Palworld cross-play has arrived along with a new cosmetic system and Pal transfers between worlds</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pocketpair have released the latest update for their smash-hit monster catching game Palworld, bringing cross-play for all platforms along with other features and bug fixes. At last, I can get my console friends to run around with me on Linux thanks to Valve's Proton.</p>
<p>There's also a new Global Palbox you can use to transfer them between worlds, a bigger Pal storage system, a new cosmetic system to change your style without affecting your armour stats, a photo mode and more. One of my favourite changes is that Pals will no longer block building - at last! That was quite a nuisance when you have a lot of them running around doing things.</p>

      <title>Steam Beta improves download speed of Steam Client updates on Linux / Steam Deck and other fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve just released a fresh Steam Client Beta available for all platforms that includes some feature tweaks and a healthy injection of bug fixes.</p>
<p>Since it's a Steam Client update, it applies across the board on Linux, macOS and Windows systems. However, there's one change that's very specific to SteamOS / Steam Deck:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>'Enable Steam Play for all other titles' is always enabled on SteamOS, updated the UI accordingly to stop showing a non functional toggle.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This toggle is still there in the Desktop Linux client. It likely won't be long before they just remove it entirely for Desktop Linux too, and just leave it to have the drop-down for you to pick the default version. Proton is so good now, it seems odd to have a toggle to turn it off.</p>
<p>Here's all the other changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed brief layout shift of elements (one or two frames) when navigating back to the library section.</li>
<li>Fixed Steam Client window focusing multiple times on startup.</li>
<li>Fixed Update News window being covered by Steam Client window at startup.</li>
<li>Fixed notifications displaying in wrong position in some games.</li>
<li>Fixed some instances where windows fail to render after display events.</li>
<li>Improved consistency and clarity of download/install/update UI:</li>
<li>Byte counts, when displayed, refer to the number of bytes to download.</li>
<li>Progress bars and percentages, when displayed, refer to the total progress of the install/update, which includes work before, after, and during the download. The exception is the top (blue) progress bar on the downloads page, which shows the bytes downloaded.</li>
<li>Time remaining estimates refer to the total progress of the install/update. These estimates will be very rough at first but will become more accurate as Steam learns more about the performance of the user's network and disks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Big Picture</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue that could allow the keyboard to cover the target text area when summoned from a game.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>macOS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added Steam Overlay support for games using HDR rendering.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Linux</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved the download speed of Steam client updates.</li>
<li>No longer applying compatibility tool filtering to shortcuts.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare issue where non-steam Protons could get assigned an incorrect compatibility tool.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed crash when using "Hexgaming Phantom Controller", related to Gyro Timestamp Information.</li>
</ul>

<p>I do have some very fond memories of the first game. They were one of the first lot of indie developers that decided to start bringing their games officially to Linux, so it's nice to see that continue. Can't wait to dive in.

      <title>War Thunder major Hornet&#39;s Sting update adds Ray Tracing for AMD and intel GPUs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>War Thunder has been updated with the first major expansion of 2025. Titled Hornet’s Sting it adds in Ray Tracing support for AMD and Intel GPUs. There's but coming though.</p>
<p>But…not in the Native Linux version. Ray Tracing, and multiple upscalers, are only available via DirectX 12 and not their Vulkan renderer. So unless you play with Proton, you're getting left further behind on this one. That said, Proton doesn't appear to actually work properly for it right now either.</p>
<p>At least on my AMD Radeon 6800 XT system, the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a> makes the latest update unplayable with graphics missing all over the place. And then going into a match, it gives multiple errors and the game will quit. Trying with Proton Experimental, and it's the same problems.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12825420141742307299gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12825420141742307299gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12831924381742307302gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12831924381742307302gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>So right now for War Thunder, you might <em>have</em> to stick with the Native Linux version to at least have it working, just without all the recent fancy graphical additions and upscalers.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ufk9SI6q1GA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/92b5b7daba707efb553f5c895c55d3d5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ufk9SI6q1GA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's quite a lot of new content in this update from new aircraft like the F/A-18 Hornet and others, new naval and ground vehicles, three graphically overhauled maps, a new "Maneuver and limits mode" for jets that "allows you to perform much tighter maneuvers and to get the little-but-so-needed nose authority to launch a missile", some interface updates, a UAV Picture-in-Picture Mode and more. One I'm quite happy about is the addition of new tank guns sounds, to help make them more unique.</p>
<p>I do really enjoy the battles in War Thunder, but seeing Linux get left behind like this is quite frustrating. And their spectator camera has been left feeling so <em>broken</em> for many <em>years</em> at this point, which makes it seriously annoying when waiting around or trying to see what friends are doing if you're with a crew when you're out.</p>
<p>See all the changes in their <a href="https://warthunder.com/en/news/9429-meet-the-hornets-sting-major-update-en" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release announcement</a>.</p>

      <title>Half-Life 2 RTX demo has launched on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Half-Life 2 RTX now has a demo available on Steam for those of you who want to check out what Orbifold Studios have done to the Valve classic with ray tracing. <em>You do need to own Half-Life 2 to be able to play the mod.</em></p>
<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ravenholm and Nova Proskpekt demo coming March 18th.</p>
<p>The fight for freedom begins anew. Experience the award-winning game that has captivated millions of players worldwide with its immersive story, thrilling combat, and mind-bending physics, fully overhauled with full ray tracing, new hand-crafted, physically based textures, enhanced high-poly models, and updated lighting, all in stunning 4K.</p>
<p>Half-Life 2 RTX is a free DLC for all Half-Life 2 owners developed by Orbifold Studios, a collective of passionate, community-assembled developers behind Half-Life 2: VR, Half-Life 2: Remade Assets, Project 17, and Raising the Bar: Redux.</p>
<p>Half-Life 2 RTX uses the latest version of RTX Remix leveraging new RTX Neural Rendering technologies, cutting-edge full ray tracing, accelerated by NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, and NVIDIA Reflex to bring one of the greatest video games of all time to life in a whole new light.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="j31ISEd8xRM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/91449e1064f5c4924d85d7ccc9b83c27.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/j31ISEd8xRM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Just out of curiosity, I did give it a try on my Kubuntu Linux system. Although this is with an AMD Radeon 6800 XT, so I was expecting it to barely run at all. It does actually run though with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the latest Proton 9.0-4</a> but as you can probably imagine, it performs awfully out of the box on my system.</p>
<p><em>If you press ALT+X, you can open the Remix menu to change settings.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13632835401742304703gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13632835401742304703gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Fiddling with a few settings then caused it to crash and quit.</em></p>
<p>I'm curious to see what your thoughts are now it's available for testing. Do you think it's too bright? Or do you love the enhancements? Let me know.</p>

      <title>Stardew Valley modding on Linux / Steam Deck takes a step with the Nexus Mods app</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The team at Nexus Mods have released a new version of their open source and cross-platform Nexus Mods app, with Stardew Valley modding now considered close to being ready for everyone. Eventually, this app will replace the Vortex app, once it's ready and supports more games.</p>
<p>Release 0.8.2 has added in a new "Unsupported Games" flag, with Stardew Valley currently the only one <em>not</em> hidden away. With Cyberpunk 2077, Baldur's Gate 3 and Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord placed behind this new option as they're not quite ready for everyone (but still work rather well). One of their team mentioned to me this is a <em>soft</em> launch, and as long as it goes well it will eventually be recommended as your main mod manager for Stardew Valley.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13423552191742302828gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13423552191742302828gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Nexus App 0.8.2.0</em></p>
<p>A lot more that's actually new with this release including better game detection and versioning, an external changes page to help you track everything and remove any problem files being tracked, improvements to the mod Collections feature, Stardew Valley mods that are packaged without a top-level folder will now install correctly, more information added to the Health Check diagnostics for Stardew Valley and various bug fixes.</p>
<details class="spoiler_container"><summary class="spoiler_header">Changelog, click me</summary>
<div class="spoiler-content">
<p><strong>More Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Collections from Nexus Mods are now installed in a read-only state to ensure the collection is as the curator intended it. Cloning and editing collections will be added in future.</li>
<li>The Collection Download page now includes an Instructions tab with both collection and mod instructions.</li>
<li>Collections can now be removed from loadout without deleting them from the Library using the menu option in the header.</li>

<p><strong>Technical Changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All games except Stardew Valley have been moved behind the "Unsupported Games" flag in Settings. If you were modding Cyberpunk, Baldur's Gate 3 or Mount &amp; Blade II:Bannerlord in a previous release, you will need to enable this option to continue managing your mods.</li>
<li>The app can now differentiate between a mod installed as part of a collection and the same mod installed directly from the Library.</li>
<li>When installing collections for Stardew Valley, any unrecognised mods are now installed relative to the "Mods" folder instead of the game folder.</li>

<li>Large numbers are now displayed with comma separation or abbreviations.</li>
<li>File sizes now only show decimal places above 1GB.</li>

<li>Added a new "Give Feedback" button to the bottom of the main window.</li>
<li>When two different versions of the same SMAPI mod are installed into the loadout, diagnostics will use the most up to date version to display messages.</li>
<li>Errors communicating with the SMAPI server will now silently be recorded in the logs rather than showing a pop up.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mod updates now correctly show the number of mod files with updates rather than the number of new versions between the current and latest releases.</li>
<li>The left menu now displays the correct name of a collection if the internal manifest and website don't match.</li>
<li>A Command Prompt window will no longer be open behind the app on Windows.</li>
<li>The Success Rating for a collection now shows the correct value.</li>
<li>If a collection has less than 3 votes on the Success Rating, it shows as grey instead of red.</li>
<li>Collections with no required mods can now be installed.</li>
<li>Fixed multiple places where the app UI would freeze when making large numbers of changes in quick succession.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the workspace could be broken by a saved page no longer being available.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the SMAPI version and game version comparison diagnostic was not running correctly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Known Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The sort order for some columns does not work as expected.</li>
<li>The game version is not checked when adding a collection meaning you can install outdated mods without being warned.</li>
<li>The table header sorting and collapsible section states are not saved and reset each time the view is loaded.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</details>
<p>There's some niggling issues with the app loading times on Linux though. Depending on what you have installed and how the Nexus Mods app searches for things and sets everything up, you may have a few minutes to wait. I've <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/issues/2865" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reported it</a> and they're looking into it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11042794581742302986gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11042794581742302986gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Nexus App 0.8.2.0, with some Stardew Valley mods added</em></p>
<p>Really pleased to see the progress on this. Having a proper full mod manager supported on Linux (and so Steam Deck) like this will remove a big pain point for players wanting to expanding their games.</p>

      <title>Discord wants developers to stick it inside their games with a new SDK</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the great things about modern online gaming is how (usually) easy it is to link up with friends. You have your friends list on Steam, GOG, Epic and others but what about Discord? They want a bigger piece of the pie now.</p>
<p>Announced yesterday, Discord have launched a new Discord Social SDK, a toolkit for developers to embed Discord into their games. This will then add in your Discord friend list, enable game invites directly for people on Discord, cross-platform messaging and more. All without a Discord account actually being needed.</p>
<p>It doesn't support Linux though, as only Windows 11 and macOS have been announced. Hopefully this won't cause any issues with running Windows games via Valve's Proton compatibility layer.</p>
<p>Some developers have already signed up to use it including Theorycraft Games, Facepunch Studios, 1047 Games, Scopely, Mainframe Industries, Elodie Games, Tencent Games and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12712226211742298531gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12712226211742298531gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Supervive with Discord, Credit: Discord</em></p>
<p>It doesn't necessarily need to <em>replace</em> other methods, but give developers the option to hook into it. So developers could bundle together Steam and Discord friends lists for example. It will be interesting to see if many more developers opt to use Discord, and how players ultimately end up feeling about it.</p>

      <title>Surprisingly, Valve rated Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced and Rainbow Six Siege as Steam Deck Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 19/03/25 —</strong> at 10:14 pm yesterday, Valve once again changed the rating for both games. Putting them both back to Unsupported. The compatibility notice on each game now simply notes how the anti-cheat is not configured to support the Steam Deck. No reply from Valve press yet, likely as they're at Game Developers Conference (GDC).</p>
<p>Hopefully we won't see repeating issues like this for games that have anti-cheat.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Even though both of them have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat</a> that blocks Linux platforms from playing online, Valve have suddenly rated both Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced (and so GTA Online) and Rainbow Six Siege as Steam Deck Playable.</p>
<p>Many people have had issues with how Valve rate various games on Steam Deck, with a few outliers showing up as Verified when they don't perform well or Unsupported when they actually work fine. With the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/steam-deck-hits-18000-games-playable-and-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Deck recently hitting 18,000 games playable / verified</a>, Valve really need to ensure the system is working well to not give the wrong idea.</p>
<p>The new ratings now appear on the store pages for both games, which you can also see via SteamDB (<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3240220/history/?changeid=28004229" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GTAV</a> / <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/359550/history/?changeid=28004220" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">R6 Siege</a>) showing testing was done and published.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/856933871742293678gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured: Steam store page rating for Rainbow Six Siege</em></p>

<em>Pictured: Steam store page rating for Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced</em></p>
<p>And since the ratings are live on Steam, they then show as compatible when looking directly on Steam Deck too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16456409571742295631gol1.jpeg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - how Rainbow Six Siege appears on my Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>We know that Rockstar themselves <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/grand-theft-auto-v-gets-battleye-anti-cheat-breaks-online-play-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">intentionally blocked GTA Online for GTA V when they added in BattlEye</a>. As they say clearly it's simply not supported on Steam Deck. Although single-player works, a Playable rating is very misleading.</p>
<p>For Rainbow Six Siege it has been blocked the entire time, although they did just launch a new update with additional anti-cheat measures.</p>
<p>Trying out Rainbow Six Siege on Desktop Linux and it clearly does not work when trying to join a match, getting kicked pretty rapidly before the game properly begins.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14489418911742294045gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - getting kicked from Rainbow Six Siege on Desktop Linux</em></p>
<p>Trying to reconnect after this also does not work.</p>
<p>I then had to wait an hour before being able to test on Steam Deck, since it counted me as a leaver and locked me out. Same issue on Steam Deck though, it simply doesn't work. The live Playable rating from Valve is wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18515369001742297826gol1.jpeg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - getting kicked from Rainbow Six Siege on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>Thankfully, Valve do have their two hour play time and two weeks refund period, but still — issues like this are not the best look for ongoing trust in Valve's Steam Deck verification system. Ideally, Valve should have some sort of manual rating lock on games that have these kinds of anti-cheat blockers, so they can't mistakenly get a rating that leads to player confusion. That way, if there's a legitimate change, Valve can get it checked properly first.</p>
<p>Especially important if Valve are going to continue with new Steam hardware based on Linux, as Valve did say "The future of hardware at Valve is bright" <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/330-million-hours-played-on-steam-deck-in-2024-up-64-from-2023-steam-year-in-review-2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">and noted 330 million hours were played on Steam Deck in 2024</a> so this trust in their system is vital.</p>
<p>I've reached out to Valve press about this and will update if any reply is received.</p>

      <title>Must-have Steam Deck games under £10 in the Steam Spring Sale 2025 </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the Steam Spring Sale 2025 in full swing now, here's some updated recommendations for games to grab for the Steam Deck. I already gave a few suggestions in the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/steam-spring-sale-2025-is-live-now-heres-some-great-budget-games-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">initial sale launch post</a>.</p>
<p>Most of my picks are Steam Deck Verified, with just a couple being rated Steam Deck Playable for minor reasons that still generally work great. All of them are under £10 as well, great if you're on a budget!</p>
<p>First up, we're going to start with what I'm calling the <strong>Steam Deck Essentials Collection</strong>. Games that are all great and that everyone talks about that you just <em>need</em> to own. This list is a true no-brainer for you to grab.</p>

<p>For this next set, I've picked out a bunch that I also think are really great and worthy of adding to your Steam Library. Again, I consider these generally a no-brainer that all gamers should try. So much entertainment for such low prices it's nuts. Steam sales are also.</p>
<p>These are all great:</p>
<h4><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/870780/Control_Ultimate_Edition/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Control Ultimate Edition</a> (£8.74)</h4>

<h4><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/28590/_Crysis_Remastered_Trilogy/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Crysis Remastered 1+2+3</a></h4>
<p>Okay, technically three games, but stick with me here. The first is also only rated Playable (but works well), because yes - the Steam Deck <em>can</em> run Crysis. The third in the series is also just over that £10 mark by itself but still worth it! Together they're £13.49 as a bundle so works out <em>less</em> than £5 each.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2898030271742296730gol1.jpg"/></p>

<h4><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/22370/Fallout_3_Game_of_the_Year_Edition/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Fallout 3 (£5.27)</a></h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Bethesda Game Studios, the award-winning creators of Fallout 3 and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, welcome you to the world of Fallout 4 – their most ambitious game ever, and the next generation of open-world gaming.</p>

<h4><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1328670/Mass_Effect_Legendary_Edition/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Mass Effect Legendary Edition (£4.99)</a></h4>
<p>I was a little torn on including this but it's such a fantastic series. The EA app can be a nuisance, but overall it works well.</p>
<blockquote>

<h4><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1237970/Titanfall_2/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Titanfall 2 (£2.49)</a></h4>
<p>One of the best single-player FPS experiences around. The EA app can be a nuisance, but overall it works well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Respawn Entertainment gives you the most advanced titan technology in its new, single player campaign &amp; multiplayer experience. Combine &amp; conquer with new titans &amp; pilots, deadlier weapons, &amp; customization and progression systems that help you and your titan flow as one unstoppable killing force.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7314967891742297233gol1.jpg"/></p>
<h4><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/379720/DOOM/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">DOOM (£1.59)</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Developed by id software, the studio that pioneered the first-person shooter genre and created multiplayer Deathmatch, DOOM returns as a brutally fun and challenging modern-day shooter experience.

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3886611961742297384gol1.jpg"/></p>
<h4><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sub/648168/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Middle-earth: The Shadow Bundle (£5.99)</a></h4>
<p>Includes both Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and Middle-earth: Shadow of War. They're both Verified too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fight through Mordor and uncover the truth of the spirit that compels you, discover the origins of the Rings of Power, build your legend and ultimately confront the evil of Sauron in this new chronicle of Middle-earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5119845451742297514gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Finally, a special extra shout out for:</p>
<h4><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Balatro</a> (£10.87)</h4>
<p>It's just above that £10 mark but it's quite essential so you know what they heck everyone keeps talking about. It's also a genuinely great game that just deserves it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The poker roguelike. Balatro is a hypnotically satisfying deckbuilder where you play illegal poker hands, discover game-changing jokers, and trigger adrenaline-pumping, outrageous combos.</p>

      <title>GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) version 3.0 is finally out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Not gaming news but big news in the open source world - the GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) version 3.0 is finally out now.</p>
<p>As someone who uses it every day for various images here on GamingOnLinux, the new non-destructive editing and text styling with editing are going to save me a whole lot of time overall. Nice to see this open source image editor become a fair bit more modern.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16108531181742292264gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some highlights of the 3.0 release include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Need to tweak a filter you applied hours ago? New in GIMP 3.0 is non-destructive editing for most commonly-used filters. See the changes in real time with on-canvas preview.</li>
<li>Exchange files with more applications, including BC7 DDS files as well as better PSD export and many new formats.</li>
<li>Don’t know how big to make your drawing? Simply set your paint tool to expand layers automatically as needed.</li>
<li>Making pro-quality text got easier, too. Style your text, apply outlines, shadows, bevels, and more, and you can still edit your text, change font and size, and even tweak the style settings.</li>
<li>Organizing your layers has become much easier with the ability to select multiple items at once, move them or transform them all together!</li>
<li>Color Management was again improved, as our long-term project to make GIMP an advanced image editor for all usages.</li>
<li>Updated graphical toolkit (GTK3) for modern desktop usage.</li>
<li>New Wilber logo!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer Part 47: Before I Was Born</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-46-bursting-bubbles/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Part 46: Bursting Bubbles</a></strong></p>
<p>So far the oldest game binary I have launched has been the original Linux port of <em>Doom</em>, after reading an article by Jason Heiss outlining how to launch legacy a.out executables on later Red Hat Linux versions. This brought me back to 1994, both the year I was born and the year that the Linux kernel reached its milestone 1.0 release. Linux as a project however dates back to 1991, first announced by Linus Torvalds on the comp.os.minix newsgroup my father also frequented at the time.</p>
<p>Browsing an old SunSITE archive I came across the jetpack-linux.tar.z tarball, which contained an unusual X11 game built and packaged in June 1993. <em>Jetpack</em> itself was first released by Mark Bradley in 1992 under a restrictive source licence requiring his written consent to any changes, contributing to its obscurity. Getting the game to start was even more complicated than it was for the X11 build of <em>Doom</em>, although both are a.out executables demanding an X server running at 8-bit colours.</p>
<p>After extracting the game files to the paths specified in the tarball, I discovered that I also needed to create symbolic links of the libX11.so.3 and libc.so.4 libraries in the top-level directory of my file system. From there I found that <em>Jetpack</em> would only launch from the Failsafe session accessible in the display manager, as even a window manager as basic as Blackbox would cause the game to fail with an "X Error of failed request: BadAccess (attempt to access private resource denied)" warning.</p>
<p>As with many other X11 games the default control scheme is odd, but <em>Jetpack</em> is even weirder than most by demanding the use of a three button mouse; there are keybinds for moving your character left or right, but to fire the titular jetpack you must press the middle mouse button. As such it becomes easier to just control the entire game using the mouse, which is cumbersome at first but does somewhat succeed at imitating how the game would feel if it were played with a joystick.</p>
<p>Similar to <em>Xkobo</em> the game features simple but attractive graphics, smooth scrolling, and a strong arcade premise. You begin each level at a set of doors and must find a key to unlock them to reach the next level, with the game awarding you a bonus if you return fast enough. Text will berate you severely for not completing a stage in time, which can be rather aggravating given most of the level layouts and item drops are randomly generated. Even the praise feels hollow if it is down to just luck.</p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10492595251742290613gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10492595251742290613gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13801891831742290614gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13801891831742290614gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>There is one pre-defined "DEMO" level that functions as a tutorial of sorts, but getting this to load requires knowing how the game was configured at compilation. There are no sound effects, but considering that OSS support was not even merged into the Linux kernel until 1994, this can be very much excused. Perhaps due to limitations such as these Mark Bradley would soon shift his focus to Mac OS, releasing an expanded shareware version of <em>Jetpack</em> for Macintosh not long after.</p>
<p>The Mac OS version has twenty five levels and does have music and sound effects. I was able to extract the WAV files using the resource_dasm utility, with the music consisting of short repeating loops. These I cut into roughly one minute tracks, apart from the menu music which I kept at thirty seconds, which I then made work with a modified version of my MIDI scripts using the play command from SoX instead. I also got the X cursor to change to the "shuttle" theme for added flare.</p>
<p>The only UNIX flavour I have found still packaging <em>Jetpack</em> is NetBSD, which still has the original jetpack.tar.Z source tarball backed up through pkgsrc. Using this I was able to build an ELF binary after passing "-L/usr/X11/lib" on the "XONLYLIB" line of the generated Makefile, which also allowed me to change where it looks for the score and level files to be in the same directory as the executable; levels are easy to parse text files, which when renamed to jetpack.lev001 will take the first slot.</p>
<p>Beyond being built for ELF the game still has all of the same limitations as the old a.out binaries, but it will at least attempt to start on modern versions of Linux now. Supplying the 8-bit colour depth it demands can be realized through a nested Xephyr session, allowing me to further modify my launch script to even have the game be playable on my current Arch Linux machine; <em>Jetpack</em> refused to build from there, but the ELF binary I made on Red Hat Linux 7.3 works just fine.</p>
<p>In a lot of ways this is more convenient as the mouse focus can be grabbed by the Xephyr window, and I no longer need to fall back to to a Failsafe session or modify my XF86Config-4 file each time I want to play. I am not even breaking Mark Bradley's restrictive licence in order to do this, as I did not modify any of the source code, just a few of the paths specified in the Makefile. I somehow seem to have gotten stuck in this particular time period, as the next game I played also dates to 1993.</p>

      <title>Atomfall from Rebellion is Steam Deck Verified ahead of release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rebellion are set to release Atomfall on March 27th, their survival-action game inspired by real-life events set in Northern England. The good news is that it's Steam Deck Verified already. <em>As a Brit myself, I'm going to have to play this aren't I?</em></p>
<p>While the main release is on March 27th, you can play three days early with Advanced Access from the Deluxe Edition.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck Verified status went live today with Valve testing it against the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a>.</p>

<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A survival-action game inspired by real-life events, Atomfall is set five years after the Windscale nuclear disaster in Northern England.</p>
<p>Explore the fictional quarantine zone, scavenge, craft, barter, fight and talk your way through a British countryside setting filled with bizarre characters, mysticism, cults, and rogue government agencies.</p>
<p>From Rebellion, the studio behind Sniper Elite and Zombie Army, Atomfall will challenge you to solve the dark mystery of what really happened.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Player Driven Mystery</strong>: Unravel a tapestry of interwoven narratives through exploration, conversation, investigation, and combat, where every choice you make has consequences.</li>
<li><strong>Search, Scavage, Survive</strong>: You’ll need to scavenge for supplies, craft weapons and items, and fight desperately to make it out alive!</li>
<li><strong>Desperate Combat</strong>: With weapons and ammunition scarce, each frenetic engagement will see you blend marksmanship with vicious hand-to-hand combat. Manage your heart rate to hold a steady aim and ensure you have the energy you need to reach for your cricket bat and land the killer blow.</li>
<li><strong>Green and Unpleasant Land:</strong> The picturesque British countryside, with rolling green hills, lush valleys, and rural villages belie the dangers that await you. Navigate cult-controlled ruins, natural caves, nuclear bunkers and more as you explore this dense, foreboding world.</li>
<li><strong>Reimagining Windscale:</strong> A fictional reimagining of a real-world event, Atomfall draws from science fiction, folk horror, and Cold War influences to create a world that is eerily familiar yet completely alien.</li>
</ul>

      <title>CS:Legacy announced as a full standalone remake of Counter-Strike 1.6</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For classic Counter-Strike fans, you may want to keep an eye out for the just announced CS:Legacy from the team behind CSPromod. This is not a mod but a full game due out sometime in Early Access in 2025.</p>
<p>As their developers explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CS:Legacy is a fully standalone remake of classic Counter-Strike 1.6, built from the ground up on Valve’s official Source Engine 2013 SDK, releasing on Steam Early Access in 2025.</p>
<p>We’ve carefully recreated every detail of the original gameplay, while introducing modern enhancements and major technical improvements—all without losing the classic CS feel that made it legendary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What exactly makes this so special then? They highlighted these points about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Full Remake, Not Just a Mod</strong> – Built from scratch with <strong>100% custom code, 3D assets, levels, textures, characters, UI, weapons etc. </strong>We own the entirety of our work, which guarantees the game's future and unlimited potential.</li>
<li><strong>Authentic Gameplay</strong> – Every mechanic, movement, and weapon behavior is <strong>faithfully replicated</strong> from the classic game.</li>
<li><strong>Engine Enhancements</strong> – We improved Valve’s Source Engine with our custom renderer, Physically Based Rendering pipeline, completely rewritten surface reflection system, fully custom UI, custom in-house source engine tools and many more features.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Initially Ubisoft said it wouldn't be supported, then they said it would be and now Valve have said that Assassin's Creed Shadows is Steam Deck Verified. <em>This new status was first noted in my article on the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/steam-deck-hits-18000-games-playable-and-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Deck hitting 18,000 playable games</a> but it's easy to miss if you skipped over it.</em></p>
<p>From the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3159330/view/572625355297260282" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have some exciting news to share: our talented developers gave Steam Deck players the option to play Assassin’s Creed Shadows at launch ; despite initially announcing we wouldn’t be able to support until later. Indeed, the team made great progress over the past few weeks and was able to make it happen for launch, despite the fact the team thought it would not be the case. It is now fully confirmed the game is "Steam Deck verified" for launch on March 20th.</p>
<p>We know many of you who play on Steam Deck have requested this, so we’re thrilled to be able to bring Shadows to this platform. While graphical settings will be locked at launch, you’ll be able to choose the upscalers you want, and we’re looking into providing further options in future updates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You'll most likely be able to unlock the graphical settings if you set the "SteamDeck=0 %command%" launch option. Unless they're locking it differently to other developers who have done the same.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="9DOgHjPLs3I"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1053ce939ff2486bd678844a41c5bca4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/9DOgHjPLs3I" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With it being Steam Deck Verified, that's good news for Desktop Linux players too, since this means it will work fine on your more powerful systems. Valve verified it against <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the latest Proton 9.0-4</a>.</p>
<p>For the Steam release it will launch with support for collectible virtual trading cards, badges, emoticons, and background images exclusively on Steam. The game does have Denuvo though, so be careful swapping any Proton version around, as you can end up locked out for a day.</p>
<p>What do we think? Will it see a nice clear 30FPS at least?</p>

      <title>Nightingale gets font improvements for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nightingale from Inflexion Games continues improvements during Early Access, with the latest patch out now with the developer trying to get it Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>The game was already rated Steam Deck Playable, with one of the two marks against it being the text small and difficult to read. The latest update notes (amongst many other things) - "Ensured font styles now meet Steam Deck requirements". The other issue Valve noted is that it "sometimes shows mouse, keyboard, or non-Steam-Deck controller icons" so hopefully they'll solve that next.</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1928980/view/534344680625669759" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Nightingale City Update</a> it also adds in these major changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Defend Nightingale City</strong></p>
<p>Humanity’s last stronghold is besieged. The Fae and their formidable Automaton Queen have unleashed chaos, and it falls to you to reclaim our home. Leap across rooftops, clear enemy-infested streets house by house, and explore the intricate network of sewers beneath the city.</p>
<p>Fight your way through three massive city quadrants, confront Bound invasions head-on, close the dangerous Transepts, and activate Pale Pylons to regain control. Your bravery and skill will be tested like never before when you face the fearsome Automaton Queen herself.</p>
<p><strong>Feature Highlights</strong></p>
<p>Alongside the City, there have been improvements to our building system, as well as new Gear and Fabled Charms!</p>
<p><strong>Enhanced Building &amp; Customization</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Structure rotation and placement has been refined with more options</li>
<li>Outfits, and Furniture: The update adds a Western-themed Frontier Tileset, Wrangler Outfit, and new furniture sets for the Crude and Tudor tilesets.</li>
<li>Defensive structures can be obtained in the city.</li>
<li>New Furniture available</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Powerful Gear &amp; Fabled Charms</strong></p>
Tier 5 weapons and tools can be purchased with a new currency you can earn in Nightingale City. These weapons and tools have new components and recipes to allow for greater parametric crafting power.

<ul>
<li>Tier 5 weapons and tools can now receive 2 charms</li>
<li>Tier 5 weapons have unique visual treatment options both in crafting and in glamour</li>
<li>Tier 5 Fabled Charms can be purchased with the new currency.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Supernatural horror adventure ASYLUM from Senscape is finally out - Linux version delayed</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>12 years after the successful Kickstarter, the supernatural horror adventure ASYLUM from Senscape has finally seen a release. Although the Native Linux version has unfortunately been delayed.</p>
<p>Writing on the Steam forum the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/230210/discussions/0/552359157631578362/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">developer said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, I know a few of you were waiting for a properly native Linux version. Regrettably, it won't be ready for launch because of an annoying issue: the game makes use of MP4 videos, a codec which Linux doesn't support by default, and the Unreal plugin we were using to handle this stopped working with the 4.27 version. Very annoying, because the game launched and performed flawlessly, except that many videos were missing 🫠<br/>
<br/>
HOWEVER! We tested the game with Proton and it performs great. The "Proton Hotfix" version works just fine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a follow-up post the developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/230210/discussions/0/552359157631578362/#c552359350148037993" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noted</a> they also tried WebM:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We tried, and no. Unreal 4.27 has crappy WebM support, the videos stuttered all the time. Believe me, we tried lots of approaches, and the solution seems to be resurrecting an old VLC plugin that has been discontinued for years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For now then, it <em>should</em> hopefully work if you use Proton. However, some players have replied to note the videos are not working for them even with Proton. So it might still need some improvements.</p>
<p>Check out the release trailer below:</p>

<p>Nice to see it finally get launched though, that was a long wait. I'll be following along for any Linux updates on it.</p>

<ul>
<li>Add support for Razer Huntsman V3 Pro.</li>
<li>Add support for Razer Blade 15 Base (Late 2020).</li>

      <title>Mech combat game Mechanized Corps: Rebirth arrives in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Back in 2014 the mech combat game Dark Horizons: Mechanized Corps arrived on Steam in Early Access but it was eventually abandoned. Now, a few of the original team got back together to bring it back as Mechanized Corps: Rebirth.</p>
<p>So if you're in the mood for a new mech shooter, perhaps this is one to keep on your radar. Giving a very brief bit of background their team <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3434530/discussions/0/505068966120635859/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">said this</a> in a post on Steam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, Mechanized Corps: Rebirth (MCR) is by a few original Max Gaming developers from the previous Early Access game Dark Horizons: Mechanized Corps (DHMC) and games Lore: Aftermath and Dark Horizons: Lore Invasion (DHLI).<br/>
<br/>
Last year, in 2024, a few of the original Dark Horizons Universe folks got back together to revive the tabletop game and, at the same time, wanted to bring a PC gameplay experience back to Steam.<br/>
<br/>
From a scope standpoint, we feel that MCR is a much more reasonable game for X10. We want to provide solid mech gameplay and fun multi-player and single-player action and ensure we use the work we do on the tabletop game to enhance the PC experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All owners of the original have been gifted the new edition free.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="v061EdKveSc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7acc8a6abfe5a80c79f93211a85f619d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/v061EdKveSc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Current Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instant Action (play offline with AI-driven squad mates versus AI enemies).</li>
<li>Multi-player (fight online with friends against AI opponents or take on other players head to head in online arenas.</li>
<li>Manage your pilot (review stats and change faction allegiances).</li>
<li>Squad Management (Create or Join a Squad for online gameplay).</li>
<li>MC Hanger (Select your chassis, edit it, buy a new chassis, and create your ultimate machine of war!).</li>
<li><em>Campaign missions are not currently available.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>It has Native Linux support and a demo is available. They hope to finish it sometime around mid-2026.</p>

<p>Another seriously impressive milestone has been hit. The Steam Deck now has 18,000 games that Valve have rated to be either Playable or Verified.</p>
<p>For a little background here on how long it's taken for the Steam Deck to hit these milestones across 2024 we had <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/steam-deck-officially-hits-over-13000-games-playable-and-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">13,000 in January</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/steam-deck-hits-14000-games-rated-playable-or-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">14,000 in March</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/steam-deck-hits-15000-games-rated-playable-and-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">15,000 in May</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/steam-deck-reaches-over-16000-playable-and-verified-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">16,000 in August</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/steam-deck-hits-17000-games-playable-and-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">17,000 in November</a>. With this being the <em>first</em> milestone hit during 2025. In case you missed it Valve also announced recently that during 2024, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/330-million-hours-played-on-steam-deck-in-2024-up-64-from-2023-steam-year-in-review-2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">330 million hours were played on Steam Deck</a>, which was a big increase from 2023.</p>
<p>When filtering specifically just to games on Steam at time of writing there's 6,012 Verified, 11,989 Playable and 4,593 Unsupported. As shown on <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5BappType%5D%5B0%5D=Game&amp;refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified&amp;refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B1%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Playable" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA RTX Remix released, plus Half-Life 2 RTX demo arrives March 18 - looking way too bright</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA have released NVIDIA RTX Remix, their modding platform that allows developers to enhance games with full ray tracing. Additionally, Half-Life 2 RTX is getting a demo on March 18th.</p>
<p>After a year or so in Beta, the release of NVIDIA RTX Remix brings with it DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation support. NVIDIA said that "Since that initial RTX Remix release, over 30,000 modders have experimented with hundreds of classic titles, and over 1 million gamers have played RTX Remix mods". It's open source and uses DXVK (part of Valve's Proton), under the MIT license, but only available for Windows via the NVIDIA app.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4EbVvrCuOBM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5e378b9344c0f731b37e144908361acf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4EbVvrCuOBM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Additionally, Half-Life 2 RTX that takes Valve's classic game and shoves ray tracing into it will get a demo on March 18th. They've shown off some more footage of it, and I'm thoroughly torn on it. I love the idea of enhancing games, and the newer textures look like a big improvement while keeping the style but overall this looks <em>far</em> too bright and shiny and just seems like it's lost part of what made it special. Still, as another sort-of tech demo of what the possibilities are with such upgrades, it's still quite interesting.</p>

<p>Announced March 13th by Epic Games in a <a href="https://onlineservices.epicgames.com/en-US/news/windows-on-snapdragon-support-is-coming-to-epic-online-services-anti-cheat-and-fortnite" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are working with Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. to add Windows on Snapdragon support to <a href="https://onlineservices.epicgames.com/en-US/services-games" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Epic Online Services Anti-Cheat</a>, also known as Easy Anti-Cheat, and make Fortnite available for Windows on Snapdragon devices later this year. This will help developers bring more games to more devices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Worth noting that Epic's Easy Anti-Cheat <em>does</em> support Linux (including Steam Deck with SteamOS Linux), and there's many games that are supported (check <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">out our dedicated anti-cheat section</a>). However, EAC <em>doesn't</em> support the kernel-level side of it on Linux, which has resulted in a number of games actually <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/ea-respawn-now-block-apex-legends-from-running-on-linux-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">removing support like Apex Legends</a>.</p>
<p>Tim Sweeney of Epic Games <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/fortnite-on-linux-steam-deck-not-until-tens-of-millions-of-users/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously said</a> back in late 2023 that it wouldn't make sense to support Fortnite on Steam Deck until it has "tens of millions of users". I still have my doubts Epic will <em>ever</em> do it, even <em>if</em> the amount of Steam Deck users and SteamOS devices (with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a public SteamOS Beta coming</a>) continue to increase, since Epic firmly see Valve as a competitor with their Epic Games Store. Not that the Epic Store is actually doing well, as it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/amazons-previous-vp-of-prime-gaming-said-they-tried-everything-to-disrupt-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">continues coasting on revenue from Fortnite</a> while seeing a cut in third-party game spending.</p>
<p>Still, money talks, and what Sweeney said does still make sense purely from a business standpoint — they want to see the big bucks come in from each platform they add. Especially when Epic have others to keep happy like Tencent, Disney, Sony and more who have invested in them. Windows overall is already big, and Windows on Arm is likely to get bigger quite quickly with Epic noting it's a "rapidly growing segment of the PC gaming market".</p>
<p>Who knows, maybe Epic and Sweeney will prove me wrong one day and actually get Fortnite on Linux platforms. For that, we need those millions of users, and our only hope clearly is Valve for that. So I do hope we get a Steam Deck 2 and eventually a proper living room box. Valve did only just reveal that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/330-million-hours-played-on-steam-deck-in-2024-up-64-from-2023-steam-year-in-review-2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">330 million hours were played on Steam Deck in 2024</a> up 64% from 2023 so there's plenty of hope there.</p>

      <title>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3 announced and in development</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 was clearly a big success, so much so that Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3 has now been officially announced as in development.</p>
<p>There's no real details about it yet, other than it now being in development. Shared via a press release from Focus Entertainment Publishing, Games Workshop, and Saber Interactive they said more information will be revealed at a later date.</p>
<p>From the press release: "We have been honored by the incredible response from fans following the launch of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. We will continue to support the game with exciting content and regular updates in the coming years. Today, we are thrilled to announce that the adventure will continue with Space Marine 3. Players can look forward to an immersive campaign, a multiplayer mode, and innovations that will redefine the standards of third-person action games. Developed in close collaboration with Games Workshop, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3 will take the genre to new heights by introducing large-scale battles that are even more spectacular," said John Bert, Deputy CEO of Focus Entertainment Publishing, a subsidiary of the PULLUP Entertainment Group.</p>
<p>"Space Marine 2 has proven to be a transformative game for Saber. ​ It is the culmination of everything we have learned about game development in our 25 years in the business. ​ We are now starting to develop Space Marine 3, a game that carries with it tremendous expectations from our rapidly expanding fanbase. ​ While we will continue to support and grow the Space Marine 2 universe over the coming years, we will take all our learnings and apply them to an even bigger and more spectacular game for the third instalment. We view this as an opportunity to create a true love letter to the Warhammer 40.000 universe." said Matthew Karch, CEO of Saber Interactive. </p>
<p>Not really surprising since the developer revealed Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 managed to hit 4.5 million sales back in October 2024.</p>
