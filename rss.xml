      <title>Vampire Survivors - Adventures Update out now, plus Among Us collab DLC coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this is quite unexpected. Vampire Survivors is getting a new DLC later this month with an Among Us cross-over. Plus, a big update is also out now.</p>
<p>First up, the free Adventures Update which brings with it self-contained, mini story-modes that remix the game's content. They will keep expanding this but the first initial part out now adds in:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">1 relic, Atlas Gate: Enables base game Adventures. Found in Boss Rash, minute 7.</div>
</li>
<li>1 new achievement for obtaining the Atlas Gate (in-game only. Will be added to the list on Steam together with the next content patch, your 100% is safe for the rest of the year!).</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">2 base game Adventures.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">1 Adventure for the Legacy of the Moonspell DLC.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Developer poncle said part of the point is to "actually to give you an excuse to play VS when you feel like it, but have already unlocked everything the game has to offer" on top of giving you a "feeling of starting fresh, with a different set of weapons, without actually remaining behind with the progression of the base game"</p>
<p>As for the Vampire Survivors: Emergency Meeting DLC, they took some elements of Among Us and "freely re-interpreted them in a Vampire Survivors spin, for some outrageous, ridiculous, and hopefully fun, combinations of characters and weapons". Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1WMUJ_YMPlY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/320934630b023a6dd59bf9080b0708cf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1WMUJ_YMPlY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Vampire Survivors: Emergency Meeting DLC releases December 18th for $2.49 / €2.49 / £1.99. It's pretty content packed too with multiple characters, 15 new weapons, a new stage and new music. I'm totally sold already.</p>
<p>The game has Native Linux support (still not advertised) and it is Steam Deck Verified. It's also <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/heres-the-most-played-steam-deck-games-for-november-2023/" target="_blank">regularly one of the most played games on Steam Deck</a>.</p>
<p>Buy it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/" target="_blank">from Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>dotAGE adds controller support - working towards Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>dotAGE is a challenging turn-based village builder, one that will suck away a lot of your time. It's a genuinely great game and it only keeps getting better! Now it has controller support, as the dev works towards being Steam Deck Verified and it already has Native Linux support too.</p>
<p>"Dotage has deep worker placement mechanics inspired by board games. Build your village and assign your workers to their daily tasks, grow crops, herd animals, bury corpses, forge tools, upgrade buildings, train professionals, and produce dozens of resources. Each turn, the Domains, the forces that govern the world, will unleash increasingly powerful events on your village. From poison, to disease, to earthquakes, to kittens. Will you be able to survive them all and find out what is causing the apocalypse?"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="m4crJPLWC30"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4a98eac279529566d8d01ee41a4cef01.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/m4crJPLWC30" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I actually missed writing it up when it released back in early October — woops! The developer did send over a key, and I've spent a number of hours with it recently and it has been quite hard to put down. You really do want just one more turn to see what it's going to throw at you next. Having proper controller support too, that's going to make staying away from it in bed with a Steam Deck quite difficult.</p>
<p>The controller support uses Steam Input, with official Xbox and Steam Deck layouts, and seamless switching between mouse/keyboard and controller along with plenty of UI improvements for controller players.</p>
<p>Other stuff that's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New Feature: Doomsday Mechanic</p>
<ul>
<li>Added new Doomsday mechanic. This allows snowballing runs to end sooner.</li>
<li>Doomsday Tower building is unlocked if you research the whole tree, or if you complete a game</li>
<li>Building the Doomsday Tower will trigger the Apocalypse immediately</li>
</ul>
<p>New Feature: Mini-Apocalypses</p>
<ul>
<li>Added mini Apocalypse events!</li>
<li>They work like Omens that do not increase threat level, and they come at a reduced strength (-2) compared to the current threat</li>
<li>They have effects similar to Omens, and take from their pools</li>
<li>They always happen 3 days before the corresponding Apocalypse</li>
</ul>
<p>New Buildings</p>
<ul>
<li>Added new building, Doomsday Tower, tied to the Doomsday mechanic</li>
<li>Added new building, Large Buoy, as an upgrade to Buoy</li>
<li>Added new building, Stone Toolmaker, as an upgrade to Stone Workbench</li>
</ul>
<p>New Score Formula</p>
<ul>
<li>Pips and Buildings now give 0 points for scoring</li>
<li>Protected Events now give 200 points instead of 100</li>
<li>Saved turns now give 300 points</li>
</ul>
<p>UX</p>
<ul>
<li>Added glyphs to Tutorial</li>
<li>Highscore tables are now separated per Elder</li>
<li>Revised highscore screen to support new scoring</li>
<li>Cycle pulsing now won't zoom anymore on creatures and will pulse only one at a time</li>
<li>Added "minimum font size" setting</li>
<li>Added a few controller-specific settings</li>
<li>Added several new hotkeys</li>
<li>Added hint for Doomsday Tower</li>
<li>Added new UI and text for Mini-Apocalypses</li>
</ul>

      <title>Check out the demo for Planetiles, a chilled city-builder like Dorfromantik</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Enjoy games like Dorfromantik that have you build tiles and expand while mostly just chilling? Then you're going to want to look at Planetiles. Just recently the developer emailed in to notify their new demo "is 100% perfectly playable and optimised for Steam Deck and Linux".</p>
<p>You build natural habitats on remote planets to satisfy quests, and earn bonuses with strategic placement. You get various planet sizes, unlockables and the landscape changes and evolves with your choices. As you progress you'll also uncover special structures thanks to your clever tile placement choices, which can give you some special actions. So you get to turn a few trees into a big forest, and create distinct biomes. There's also no end-game, so you can keep planet hopping and building up until you want to take a break.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="tVTHZ8WTKyc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e54aa67355851e3858f5fc1d76dd64b4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/tVTHZ8WTKyc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Looks like another wonderful chilled game to keep an eye on! It really does sound like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/relaxing-and-gorgeous-city-builder-dorfromantik-is-out-now/" target="_blank">Dorfromantik</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/relaxing-minimalist-building-strategy-game-tiny-atolls-fixed-up-for-linux/" target="_blank">Tiny Atolls</a> in space.</p>
<p>Go <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2447030/Planetiles/" target="_blank">check it out on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>The incredibly weird psychedelic physics game Juice Galaxy got a Steam release </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A game I checked out back in 2021, Juice Galaxy (formerly Juice World), is a thoroughly odd game that is terribly hard to actually describe.</p>
<p>It's a very colourful and quirky open-world psychedelic physics game, where nothing really makes any sense. Look, I'm trying real hard to make any sense out of this one and I'm just stumped. Even the developer can't really describe it as they say "Juice Galaxy is a happy place to fly around and smack things and drink juice. And explore things. And just, flip around doing stuff. Use any of a multitude of weapons to clobber and devour the local wildlife. Gather juice to increase your power and take on more powerful enemies".</p>
<p>Take a look at the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kojcHlX3TzY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b2384f2c9fbc76697b7bea25bb8f6526.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kojcHlX3TzY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>That is indeed…a video game.</em></p>
<p>It has Native Linux support and is now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1708150/Juice_Galaxy/" target="_blank">available on Steam</a> in Early Access.</p>

      <title>Skyrim Special Edition updated with Steam Deck support, ultrawide res, bug fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm as surprised as you are but The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition just got a brand new update that includes Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>This update brings "<a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/52xMsb1fD2nTiNBkiWCbxq/build-share-and-find-creations-skyrim-special-edition" target="_blank">Bethesda Game Studios Creations</a>" to the Special Edition, which is a new and updated way to download community-made content in-game. Not only is this for making downloading mods easier, but Bethesda said modders can get verified through it and earn money from their creations. That's right, paid mods are coming back.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3796168831701805669gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3796168831701805669gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>On top of that there's now support for "ultrawide PC monitors, including 16:9, 16:10, 21:9 and 32:9 displays", lots of bug fixes, performance improvements, localization fixes and various in-game console improvements.</p>
<p>When it comes to Steam Deck support, they <em>don't</em> exactly say what they improved or added for the announcement. Big studios being as <em>helpful</em> as ever. In the <a href="http://bethesda.net/en/article/4ORD7tshfmHUN8H4ULSgE4/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-special-edition-creations-update-patch-notes" target="_blank">patch notes</a> it says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Steam Deck Support (PC)</strong></p>
<p>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is now supported on Steam Deck! Whether your adventures take you on the road or just on the couch, enjoy Skyrim wherever you go with Valve’s portable PC handheld.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then under the PC Only section it just says "FEATURE: Support for Steam Deck."</p>
<p>It's <em>currently</em> at time of writing rated Steam Deck Playable by Valve, which was reviewed back in April 2022. The issues preventing it being fully Verified were needing to manually bring up the on-screen keyboard and a problematic launcher. Testing this update myself on Steam Deck and there was <em>no</em> launcher, it went straight into the game — that's one tick. And when going to name my character, the big Steam Deck <a href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17326071221701805617gol1.jpg" target="_blank">overlay keyboard</a> appeared — so another tick. Looks like it can be bumped up to Steam Deck Verified now.</p>
<p>That said, the trouble is, the game is old and doesn't let you change graphics settings in-game. So you're stuck with the defaults they set. If you wish to change them, setting <code class="inline-code">SteamDeck=0 %command%</code> as a launch option in the Properties will bring back the launcher.</p>
<p>Also, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition looks <em>awesome</em> on the Steam Deck OLED. I have so many other games to go through but…it's now calling to me again.</p>

      <title>Combined Arms, the big free retro C&amp;C and Red Alert combo 1.0 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Combined Arms brings Command &amp; Conquer and Red Alert action mashed together into a single <a href="https://www.openra.net/" target="_blank">OpenRA</a> powered game and the 1.0 release is out now. Probably one of my favourite standalone OpenRA games, since I grew up playing all the Westwood classic RTS games.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15326411591701802208gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15326411591701802208gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Combined Arms 1.0 on Linux</em></p>
<p>The 1.0 release brings with it chapter VI of single-player campaign so there's now about 30 missions to play, they also added two new 8v8 multiplayer maps, a new music track, a new "Rhino Heavy tank (Stolen Tech - Soviet War Factory)", balanced various units and a few bug fixes.</p>
<p>Combined Arms allows you to play as Allies, Soviets, Nod, GDI and the Scrin. It takes gameplay elements from Tiberian Dawn, Red Alert, Tiberian Sun, Red Alert 2 and even a little Generals. All factions have new units and the game has new artwork and sound effects too. It really is a big merging of the classics together.</p>
<p>Their download includes Linux, macOS and Windows versions. Since it's OpenRA it also has cross-platform online play.</p>

      <title>Minetest 5.8.0 is out now with improved settings, Minetest Game no longer default</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Minetest, the popular free and open source voxel game engine, one that can be used to play various different games (like a Minecraft clone) just released version 5.8.0.</p>
<p>There's some pretty big changes to how it works with this release removing Minetest Game from the default install. The idea seems to be a mixture of it not exactly being a good showcase, along with making Minetest itself more of a neutral game engine (and get away from all the Minecraft Clone comments).</p>
<p>Going along with that the main menu went through a redesign, prompting you to install an actual game and a much improved settings menu making it easier to use and more modern. There's also more antialiasing filters, rendering performance improvements, modding improvements and so on.</p>
<p>New settings menu layout style:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20673714061701783044gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20673714061701783044gol1.jpg"/></a>The settings menu now actually looks like it's from a modern game — hooray!</em></p>

      <title>Grand Theft Auto VI trailer is live but no mention of a PC release yet</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is no doubt going to be the absolute biggest release all year when it arrives in 2025, but for now Rockstar Games are only announcing it for consoles. In the <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir/news/rockstar-games-announces-grand-theft-auto-vi-coming-2025" target="_blank">press release</a> they only mentioned PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>It's quite likely such a massive game wouldn't really run on the current Steam Deck, but for Desktop Linux we've seen Proton do some ridiculous magic to get even the most intense games working pretty well. By the time GTA VI is released onto PC, no doubt Proton would be able to run it (or soon after release as we see sometimes).</p>
<p>"Grand Theft Auto VI heads to the state of Leonida, home to the neon-soaked streets of Vice City and beyond in the biggest, most immersive evolution of the Grand Theft Auto series yet."</p>
<p>Trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QdBZY2fkU-0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c8f85a91362886ad54f73692c87ea0f2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QdBZY2fkU-0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“Grand Theft Auto VI continues our efforts to push the limits of what’s possible in highly immersive, story-driven open-world experiences,” said Sam Houser, Founder of Rockstar Games. “We’re thrilled to be able to share this new vision with players everywhere.”</p>
<p>Even though on Linux systems we have Proton, there's a rather big elephant in the corner, waiting to jump out and squash you with SURPRISE. That elephant's name is Anti Cheat. We have no idea what sort of tooling they're going to include with it, if they decide to go for some invasive kernel-based solution, both Steam Deck and Desktop Linux would probably be left out in the cold without a coat. Hopefully this won't happen. There's also the chance it could end up being an Epic Games Store exclusive, making it even more of a nuisance.</p>
<p>When do you think we might see an actual PC release of it? A year later?</p>

      <title>Steam Deck - SteamOS 3.5.9 Preview &#39;Well Paced Edition&#39; brings more fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Even more fixes are landing in Preview for Steam Deck in the SteamOS 3.5.9 Preview: Well Paced Edition update. I'm enjoying Valve giving them fun code-names too.</p>
<p>Here's what's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3870343609925005477" target="_blank">changed</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Graphics and Performance</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced stutters when the upscale filter was set to FSR or NIS under high GPU load.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue regarding frame-pacing and stutter, especially affecting some external displays.</li>
<li>Fixed display sometimes getting stuck at 60Hz after returning from sleep on the Steam UI.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where a core could be stuck at 100% CPU if a game's window closed in an unclean way.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This comes shortly after the bigger <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/steam-deck-steamos-358-now-in-preview/" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.5.8 Preview: Flatlined</a> update a few days ago, as Valve continue cleaning up issues from the rather <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/steamos-355-rolls-out-to-all-steam-deck-owners-plus-new-steam-client-update/" target="_blank">massive SteamOS 3.5 update</a> that changed a ridiculous amount of the system.</p>
<p>Since it's in Preview you need to opt into it before Valve roll it out to everyone. You can opt into this in Settings &gt; System &gt; System Update Channel.</p>
<p>Are there any particular bugs you really want to see solved right now that haven't been fixed in these two recent Preview updates?</p>

      <title>A favourite and top Steam Deck game Brotato is expanding with new content</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Brotato is a great game, absolutely one of my favourites, it's also <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/heres-the-most-played-steam-deck-games-for-november-2023/" target="_blank">one of the most played Steam Deck games</a> and the good news is that it's set to expand! It is Steam Deck Verified by Valve and Platinum on ProtonDB.</p>
<p>One of the best bullet hell / bullet heaven games around and the developer just released a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1942280/view/3881602608981549634" target="_blank">new update</a> fixing up a bunch of issues. However, they put the most exciting news at the top of the post confirming "Regarding the future of Brotato: New content will be coming to the game in the form of DLCs and free updates! We're excited for what's in store and will share more details as they become available.".</p>
<p>You can see a previous video of mine on Steam Deck below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="727NFQkdMBU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bf4ed8ef1d3451cd2081130c14178320.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/727NFQkdMBU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I'm quite excited to see what will be coming to the game. It's already spilling with content in all the characters you can unlock, and with so many different weapons there's thousands of character build combinations to do that just makes it so entertaining to play through constantly. Seems like a game ripe for just continually adding into so I'm pleased to see more coming and and DLC will be pretty much a guaranteed purchase here.</p>
<p>Anyway, latest patch notes for now are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
<li>Added projectile and explosion opacity options to improve visibility in endless mode</li>
<li>Added option to limit FPS to 60</li>
<li>The health bar will now indicate whether tardigrades are still active in the current wave using a purple color</li>
<li>Reduced weapon cooldown variation for Multitasker with many weapons</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixes</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed bug preventing more than one weapon from appearing in shop on wave 3 (is now the same as waves 4-5)</li>
<li>Fixed bug causing revolver and chaingun to reset their interrupted cooldowns on stat changes</li>
<li>Fixed bug causing gardens that are far away from the player to stop spawning fruits</li>
<li>Fixed bug causing some consumables to drop outside of map bounds</li>
<li>Fixed the player HP bar being hidden by some effects</li>
<li>Fixed movement with controller D-pad</li>
<li>Fixed bug preventing crates from dropping items locked in the shop</li>
<li>Fixed bug that could cause the maximum HP regeneration rate to be linked to framerate</li>
<li>Fixed display bug preventing shop stats affected by material count from updating on reroll</li>
<li>Fixed bug that could cause effects to not be removed when weapons are combined or recycled after resuming saved game</li>
<li>Fixed bug that could cause incorrect danger level to display during run after resuming saved game</li>
<li>Fixed bug preventing boosted enemies from flashing when attacked</li>
<li>Fixed crash at wave end</li>
<li>Fixed UI bugs in options menus</li>
<li>Various performance improvements</li>
</ul>
<p>Modding</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated godot-mod-loader to v6.2.0 (mod authors should check deprecation warnings)</li>
<li>Mods can now extend these classes without workarounds: Effect, EntitySpawner, ItemParentData, Weapon, WeaponStats, Shop</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Also nice to see a game made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> see such success with over 60,000 reviews on Steam and an Overwhelmingly Positive rating.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Cyberpunk 2077 gets another big upgrade with a Metro System, new Accessibility options</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the most popular single-player games on Steam, Cyberpunk 2077 has received another big free update for all players. Cyberpunk 2077 is rated Steam Deck Verified by Valve and Gold on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1091500" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a>.</p>
<p>Main new features in the 2.1 update:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>V's issue with their NCART City Pass is resolved and they can now travel between the 19 metro stations located throughout Night City on 5 different lines via fast travel or riding the train itself while gazing out the window and watching the world go by.</li>
<li>V will now be able to invite their love interest to spend some time together in any of the apartments. Hangouts are a repeatable, unlimited event that become available once the romance path with a given character has concluded.</li>
<li>You can now listen to the radio while on foot (or while riding the NCART train) using the new Radioport feature. Available while you explore, it switches seamlessly to car radio whenever you get in a vehicle and turns off when quest-specific music starts playing. It is now also possible to adjust volume directly in the radio window.</li>
<li>Added replayable car races V can take part in after finishing The Beast in Me. Look for race flag icons on the map and win the races to get eddies and a discount for the Autofixer website. Additionally, we improved the racers' AI to make them more competitive and made enhancements so that the whole experience is much more fun!</li>
<li>Sightseeing binoculars in various scenic spots have been added as another way to appreciate Night City's vistas.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7B4r1jbpS2A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d7cac608c0cbdff0a2c04682dd7702ba.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7B4r1jbpS2A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The accessibility additions in this update will also be thoroughly welcome too with colour blind modes, text sizing options, improved subtitles, aim assist options, larger HUD options, the ability to remove HUD visual effects and more. Really nice to see these being added, although this is the kind of thing games should really have at release. I hope to see more developers add all this too to their games.</p>

      <title>EA opens up more patents for increasing Accessibility in gaming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>EA (Electronic Arts) have added a few more patents to their <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/commitments/positive-play/accessibility-patent-pledge" target="_blank">Patent Pledge</a> for Increasing Accessibility to help game developers. The idea is that game developers are free to use ideas they've patented, without fear of EA coming after them.</p>
<p>As EA say: "Through the Pledge, we share our accessibility-centered technology with the wider industry so that together we can meet the needs of our diverse gaming community. It covers some of our most innovative technologies designed to break down barriers for players with disabilities. This includes those with vision, hearing, speaking or cognitive conditions. Better yet, all this IP has been shared royalty-free, which means you won’t need to pay royalties or license fees to use it."</p>
<p>I covered some of what they did with this previously when they also <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/ea-open-source-fonttik-helps-devs-check-text-size-a-contrast-m-plus-patent-pledges/" target="_blank">open sourced Fonttik</a>, but now they've added some more patents for devs to use including these:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Auto-detects when a player stops interacting with a game and temporarily converts their player-controlled character to a personalized system-driven character.</em></p>
<p><strong>Patent No.: </strong><a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US10864446" target="_blank">US 10,864,446</a><br/>
<strong>Country: </strong>United States<br/>
<strong>Title: </strong>AUTOMATED PLAYER CONTROL TAKEOVER IN A VIDEO GAME<br/>
<strong>Date Issued: </strong>December 15, 2020<br/>

      <title>Adventure Mode for Dwarf Fortress arrives April 2024</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kitfox and Bay 12 Games have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/3880475983255753766" target="_blank">revealed</a> that the new Adventure Mode for Dwarf Fortress (Steam) will arrive in April 2024 with a new trailer.</p>
<p>This is the game mode that's more like an RPG. You create a character and roam around the simulated world doing pretty much whatever you want. You can either use the world you made during the Fortress Mode or start an entirely new generated world for it. It's coming with numerous enhancements like new character faces coming with the procedural portrait system, rich conversations with character, a visual and mechanical revamp for combat with updated wrestling mechanics, plus an update to the world map to show off landmarks better.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="fz1e5y4Ipzc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ef67d58d9806e309b3972c0f91894c07.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/fz1e5y4Ipzc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Work on this mode is happening in parallel to the Fortress Mode, so expect more to come there too.</p>
<p>Dwarf Fortress has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Playable.</p>

      <title>Sons Of The Forest adds FSR 2.0 and better settings for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sons Of The Forest is one game that was sadly a little too much for the Steam Deck to handle at the release, but now it seems it should run a fair bit better.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1326470/view/3907498306834312015" target="_blank">update</a> released at the end of November the developers not only put in some default settings for the Steam Deck and low-end PCs but they also implemented AMD FSR 2.0, so together it should give a much nicer experience on Steam Deck although you're still looking at 30FPS with drops below. Hopefully they will be able to optimize it further during Early Access.</p>

      <title>ControllerImage provides easy on-screen prompts for game developers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer and game porter Ryan "Icculus" Gordon has created a new library named <a href="https://github.com/icculus/ControllerImage" target="_blank">ControllerImage</a> for game developers, with an aim to help showing on-screen controller prompts</p>
<p>Built on top of the popular <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/" target="_blank">SDL</a>, specifically SDL 3, the idea is game developers would use this to show things like "Press *controller button* to open" type of prompts in-game. No matter what controller, it would be able to show the right prompt, as long as SDL knows what that controller is.</p>
<p>As written in the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/project-93970348" target="_blank">Patreon post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Something that's been bothering me for awhile is how SDL handles game controllers: you plug in darn near anything, and it can figure out what to do with it, so the developer can assume the player is using an Xbox controller even if the actual gamepad is built by Sony or Nintendo. It can sort it out whether it's a first-party controller you paid 70 bucks for, or it's something totally anonymous, bought for a few yuan at a chinese street market.</p>
<p>But all SDL does is say "I know this controller, here's where its equivalent of the Xbox Y button is" to the programmer, and not "I know this controller, here's <em>what it looks like" </em>to the player.</p>
<p>I set out to change that.</p>
<p>This is a dirt-simple library that builds on SDL's ability to detect joysticks, to provide scalable images of its buttons and other features, so you can show users instructions that match the controller in their hand, even for controllers you've never heard of, and for screen resolutions that don't exist yet.</p>

      <title>Linux share on Steam back to nearly 2% thanks to Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a couple of months of the Linux user share on Steam dropping, the November 2023 Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey shows it shooting back up again. With Steam Deck continuing to push Linux gaming. <em>See the data over time on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">the GOL Steam Tracker</a>.</em></p>
<p>As mentioned in the last article for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/october-23-steam-survey-simplified-chinese-rises-linux-and-macos-decline/" target="_blank">October 2023's numbers</a>, the issue was something we've seen quite a few times now. A sudden surge of Simplified Chinese as a language on Steam, which pretty much always brings down the Linux and macOS share. Things look back to normal again now though.</p>
<p>The current numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Windows </strong>96.56%</li>
<li><strong>Linux</strong> 1.91%</li>
<li><strong>macOS</strong> 1.53%</li>
</ul>
<p>When filtering just to the Linux numbers we can see that SteamOS Holo (Steam Deck) continues to be what's pushing the numbers up overall:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 42.99% +0.68%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 7.81% +0.27%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS 64 bit 6.67% -0.06%</li>
<li>Freedesktop.org SDK 23.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 5.33% -0.40%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 21.2 64 bit 4.25% +0.32%</li>

      <title>Steam Deck - SteamOS 3.5.8 now in Preview</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a fresh SteamOS update into Preview for Steam Deck, with SteamOS 3.5.8 out now fixing up various problems since the big 3.5 update.</p>
<p>One issue that concerned players, that was reported a lot, was the performance overlay GPU speed flipping between a low and high number which this should solve, on top of improving performance in some areas and general bug fixing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where modifying settings in the desktop partition manager could prevent the SD card from being mounted and visible in Steam</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in desktop mode where dropping a folder on the desktop would erroneously create a shortcut for every item within the folder.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Graphics and Performance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the performance overlay displaying GPU clock speed as an instantaneous measurement rather than an average, resulting in misleading numbers.
<ul>
<li>This matches behavior of SteamOS 3.4.11</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed a problem with elevated noise levels for trackpad pressure sensors. Affects only certain configurations.</li>
<li>Fixed incorrect colors (gamma) when using Steam In-Home Streaming.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare system crash on game exit</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in certain HDR titles wherein wiggling the cursor on the same frame as closing the game would cause incorrect colors in subsequent game launches</li>
<li>Improved a situation where a game's frame presentation could block because of buffers submitted by Steam or other windows, removing a potential source of game stutters.</li>
<li>When the frame limiter or vsync is enabled, the performance overlay now shows frame timings based on when they are flipped to the display, rather than when the GPU rendering was completed. The GPU-based timings are still visible on level four setting.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue causing stutter in certain games that buffer multiple frames in advance.</li>
<li>Miscellaneous compositor performance improvements.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Roots of Pacha 1.1 adds new content and a fix for Steam Deck external controllers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The single-player and co-op life sim / farming game Roots of Pacha has a big update out now, with it there's plenty of new content and a nice fix for Steam Deck players docking to the big screen.</p>
<p>For Steam Deck players and Linux Desktop, the game has been a bit problematic with controllers. That should be a little bit better with this update as they noted "Steam Deck now recognizes external controller and can work in docked mode". However, it's not fully fixed, as "there's still a known issue in the library we use that will prevent reconnection from a disconnected controller" but it's certainly better than it was.</p>

      <title>Story Mode for Them&#39;s Fightin&#39; Herds cancelled and active development to cease</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some sad news for fans of the fighting game Them's Fightin' Herds, as the developer Mane6 has cancelled the Story Mode and will be ceasing active development on the game.</p>
<p>This was announced on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/574980/view/3882727783056476087" target="_blank">Steam</a> in an update post going over the 5.1.0 version release that pulls in a new Armor Break game mechanic, along with various bug fixes. It also goes over a few details up an upcoming DLC character named Nidra, and teases the final DLC character Baihe. Below all that though, is a short note about the future of the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As we look forward to the release of Nidra and Baihe, let's talk about what comes next.<br/>
After the Season 1 Pass is complete, we will be ceasing active development on TFH. We will still be able to release small patches to address game-breaking bugs, but no new content will be produced. Unfortunately, that includes Story Mode.<br/>
<br/>
Story Mode has always been an ambitious feature and one we truly desired to implement. We know how much our fans have been looking forward to Story Mode chapters, and we hope you understand how much we looked forward to working on and releasing them.<br/>
<br/>
We are looking for opportunities to release content that has already been produced for Chapter 2, starting with a new stage, "Restricted Section". This stage will be a part of the version 6.0 update alongside Nidra and Baihe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Always a shame when long-promised features for a game don't happen, and it seems players really aren't pleased with this. Since the announcement went up on November 22nd, the recent user reviews on Steam are now Mostly Negative</p>
<p>You can buy it from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/thems-fightin-herds?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/574980/Thems_Fightin_Herds/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Check out the new trailer for Demonschool, an upcoming light horror tactics RPG</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Demonschool looks like one of the most unique tactics RPG I've seen for a while, and the new trailer that just went up really has me excited for it. Unique because of the movement and combat system, allowing for plenty of planning and experimentation — not to mention it's stylish as heck.</p>
<p>What is it: "a new-style tactics RPG where motion equals action. Defeat big weirdos in between the human and demon worlds as Faye and her misfit companions, while navigating university life on a mysterious island.". Developed by Necrosoft Games (Hyper Gunsport) and publishing help from Ysbryd Games (WORLD OF HORROR, VA-11 HALL-A). Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WvhTfNvVfaU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5822b997c1f36cb79afb139e5aaa899c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WvhTfNvVfaU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Main Features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tactics</strong>: Rewind any action during the planning phase and create combos to dispatch your foes.</li>
<li><strong>Story</strong>: A light horror narrative told through huge avatars with side quests aplenty.</li>
<li><strong>Schedule</strong>: Plan your school schedule to level your characters and build their skills.</li>
<li><strong>Friendship</strong>: 15 characters with whom to build relationships.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's releasing in Q2 2024 with Linux and Steam Deck support.</p>

      <title>Huge update to Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 adds an Epilogue, new game modes and willy physics</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well that's quite an upgrade Baldur's Gate 3 just got, and one of my absolute favourite games of this year. Might be time to jump back in again!</p>
<p>The main headline features are all <em>great</em> like the new Epilogue, Honour Mode and Custom mode, improved inventory access and more but — there's one other little feature that they didn't seem to talk about, that plenty have been discovering to great surprise. I am of course talking about willy physics. Yes, all those people upset at release that there wasn't any wobbly bits can now rejoice. I don't think you <em>really</em> need to see it but <a href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/bg3willyphysics.mp4" target="_blank">video proof</a> (NSFW, obviously). Glorious.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17658034131701440859gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17658034131701440859gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The main highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Epilogue: An entirely new section at the end of the game that aims to provide a well-deserved sense of closure with your allies.</li>
<li>Two new play modes: Honour Mode and Custom Mode.</li>
<li>Many performance improvements, particularly in Act III.</li>
<li>Players playing on machines with low VRAM/RAM should see improved performance.</li>
<li>The game is now available in Korean!</li>
<li>While at camp, you can now access and manage the inventories of companions who aren't in your active party.</li>
<li>Added a brand new fight in Ramazith’s Tower.</li>
<li>Orin’s outfit now drops as loot and is wearable by anyone. We also gave it a suitably disgusting description and name.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Those performance improvements as well will be quite welcome, especially on top of AMD FSR 2.2 that was added <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/baldurs-gate-3-patch-4-brings-amd-fsr-22-looking-better-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">in a previous update</a>.</p>
<p>For Linux Desktop and Steam Deck just make sure you're either on Proton Hotfix or the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/proton-experimental-fixes-baldurs-gate-3-improves-nickelodeon-all-star-brawl-2/" target="_blank">latest Proton Experimental</a>, as they have the needed updates to ensure the game will actually launch.</p>
<p>You can buy Baldur's Gate 3 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/baldurs_gate_iii?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma 6 - Beta 1 released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The KDE team continue sprinting towards to finish line of the Plasma 6 release next year, with a Beta release now available for the popular Linux desktop environment which is also used on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>"Plasma 6 is the upcoming version of Plasma that integrates the latest version of Qt, Qt 6, the framework upon which Plasma is built. Plasma 6 incorporates new technologies from Qt and other constantly evolving tools, providing new features, better support for the latest hardware, and supports for the hardware and software technologies to come."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2984700221701439298gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2984700221701439298gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>If you held off testing with the previous Alpha release, perhaps the Beta might be a good time to jump in. You can test it with a Plasma 6-powered distribution like <a href="https://neon.kde.org/download" target="_blank">Neon Unstable</a>.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/megarelease/6/beta1/" target="_blank">announcement here</a> and the recent <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/changelogs/plasma/5.27.80-5.90.0/" target="_blank">changelog here</a>.</p>

      <title>Battle.net broke in Wine / Proton - here&#39;s how to fix for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ah launchers, don't you just love them? A reoccuring nuisance for Steam Deck and Desktop Linux gaming is that they can and will break and the latest to break (again) is Battle.net. Here's how you can fix it for now.</p>
<p>Firstly, for people just using Proton on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux direct through Steam you can use the bleeding-edge Beta of Proton Experimental. As <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1730445392058462509" target="_blank">posted on X</a> (Twitter) by Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="css-175oi2r">
<div class="css-175oi2r r-1s2bzr4">
<div class="css-1rynq56 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0 r-37j5jr r-1inkyih r-16dba41 r-bnwqim r-135wba7" data-testid="tweetText" dir="auto" id="id__kzdjjv7895r" lang="en" style="color: rgb(247, 249, 249); text-overflow: unset;">Initial Battle.net fix has been pushed to the [bleeding-edge] beta branch of Proton Experimental. Timing of mainline Proton Experimental availability is TBD.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>How to do that? Find Proton Experimental in your Steam Library and go into its Properties -&gt; Betas -&gt; and select bleeding-edge from the dropdown box.</p>
<p>Another solution that you can try is to use this as a launch option on any Proton version in Steam:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">WINE_SIMULATE_WRITECOPY=1 %command%</code></p>
<p>For people using some form of Wine / Proton in Lutris you can add WINE_SIMULATE_WRITECOPY with a value of 1 as an environment variable in the system options inside a Wine runner you're using.</p>
<p>It can be frustrating when this happens, and it's certainly far from the first time Battle.net has broken along with EA, Ubisoft and other extra launchers. Thankfully this time it's an easy enough sort until it's fixed properly inside Wine and Proton directly.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong> - 17:17 UTC: If you use Wine-GE, the latest <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/wine-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton8-25" target="_blank">Wine-GE-Proton8-25</a> release has a fix for it.</p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher 2.11 released with custom library categories</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Heroic Games Launcher 2.11 is out now and brings with it an easier way to sort your game library by adding custom categories. This allows you to put your games into whatever category you want, just like you can do with the Collections feature on Steam.</p>
<p>So you would go to a game page, to the three dot menu, down to categories and then add it to an existing one or create a new one like below:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11135809511701351069gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11135809511701351069gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19287417041701351068gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19287417041701351068gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em>Click pictures to enlarge</em></p>
<p>They developers also said "We also revamped all our filters to make it more seamless and to clean the library UI. Visual issues related to logs, dialogs, and RTL layout have been addressed, and anti-cheat runtimes are now enabled by default. We've also made several UI/UX enhancements and fixed some issues specific to macOS. Thanks to our amazing community for their contributions!".</p>

      <title>So what the heck is an &#39;indie game&#39; nowadays anyway?</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You'll have to forgive me, dear readers, because I am a little confused on what's going on at the moment. What the heck actually is an indie or independent game nowadays? Someone like <em>me</em> is probably supposed to tell <em>you</em> what it is, but honestly I'm just as confused as you are now.</p>
<p>The problem is, there doesn't really seem to actually be a good answer to this now. Game developers and publishers alike don't agree on it, and other prominent people in the industry all seem to have different opinions on it now too.</p>
<p>To add to the confusion, The Game Awards decided to put DAVE THE DIVER into the "Best Independent Game" category. A great game for sure but the problem is that while it may perhaps have the look of what a lot of people think is an indie game, in my book it's firmly <em>not</em>. You see it was developed by Mintrocket, a sub-brand of Nexon, who are a pretty big South Korean publisher that have <em>billions</em> in income. How, in any possible meaning of the term, is that indie?</p>
<p>Arguments on this have been ongoing since the nominees were announced a couple of weeks ago, and adding fuel to the fire now TGA's Geoff Keighley has given some thoughts on it during a recent <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1988267110" target="_blank">Twitch</a> (about 27:00) livestream and Keighley's response to a question on it was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look it's a great question. Independent can mean different things to different people, it's sort of a broad term right. You can argue does independent mean the budget of the game, does independent mean where the source of financing was, is it based on the team size, is it the independent spirit of a game meaning the kind of smaller game that's different. Everyone has their own opinion about this. We really defer to our jury, 120 global media outlets that vote on these awards to kind of make that determination of is something independent or not.</p>
<p>In other industries sometimes there are things like the film industry the budget can't be above this amount of dollars, some people said Larian with Baldur's Gate 3 that's an independent game, Kojima Productions with Death Stranding some people say that's an independent game and even though it's an independent studio of course it's funded by PlayStation. It's question like if you have a publisher, is that still independent or not. We also have Best Debut Indie Game, which is something I'm really proud of too, that's for teams doing it's first ever game this year, that's often really really independent studios just starting out and I love that we can recognise them that way.</p>
<p>So yeah Dave the Diver, that game is made by a group named Mintrocket, it's a smaller game from a smaller group  but it's part of Nexon which is a very large publisher so I think it's a fair debate and discussion is that game truly independent or is it not. You can kind of argue either way it's independent in spirit, it's a small game, I don't know what the budget it is but i think it's a probably a relatively small budget game but it's from a larger entity, whereas there's other games on that list that are from much smaller studios. Like Dredge, published by team17, so is that independent or not, 'coze you have a publisher. It's a really complicated thing to figure out and come up with strict rules around it, so we kinda let people use their best judgement and you can agree or disagree with the choices, but the fact that Dave the Diver was on that list meant that out of all the independent games that the jury looked at or what they thought were independent games that was one of the top 5 that they looked at this year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keighley goes on to mention past game awards and games that won and how people debated this in the past, but basically sums it all up with the exact criteria being an "open debate for discussion". Seems to me that Keighley had no real answer on this. Just a lot of dancing around it, asking more questions of the category and just further adding to the confusion.</p>
<p>I get what Keighley was trying to say though, when mentioning how "it's a different set of games, and I like that we get to recognise different games in our show and not have the same 5-10 games nominated in every category". As otherwise, you likely would just get the huge publisher games filling up every year but the category itself is just not named particularly well it seems, or they need to actually properly settle on what indie actually is.</p>
<p>Certainly is an interesting debate.</p>
<p>So — over to you in the comments: what is an indie or independent game now? How would you define it exactly?</p>

      <title>Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP gets a 2023 refresh and Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP, originally released back in 2012, just got a fresh upgrade bringing with it some compatibility fixes and it's now also Steam Deck Verified too!</p>
<p>Not heard of it before? Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP is an exploratory action adventure with an emphasis on audiovisual style. Traverse a mythic little realm, use a sword to do battle &amp; evoke sworcery to solve mystical musical mysteries. Experience a videogame world that is affected by moon phases &amp; help a wandering warrior monk complete her woeful errand.</p>
<p>Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP features an album's worth of original music by noted composer Jim Guthrie as well as artwork &amp; designs by Superbrothers Inc, crafted &amp; engineered by videogame wizards at Capy in Toronto, Canada.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15858397061701347570gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15858397061701347570gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>From the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/204060/discussions/0/6027566653454582072/" target="_blank">patch notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We had a lot of changes in the latest Sworcery update! Most of them are focused on bringing the game up to date for the latest operating systems and devices. This should help the game stay stable in the years to come! The biggest fix by far is the game can run on Steam Deck! After that, it's having the game run on MacOS again. Followed by better support for Linux and finally, better High DPI resolution support for Windows. We also fixed a whole bunch of little gameplay bugs, some kind of serious, some just janky, but all of them we think were pretty rare. Here's a breakdown:<br/>
 </p>
<div class="bb_h3">Upgraded:</div>
SDL 1.2 -&gt; SDL 2.26.0<br/>
FmodEx -&gt; Fmod Studio 2.2.16<br/>
Steamworks SDK -&gt; 1.57<br/>
Various Compilers -&gt; Latest/near latest Compilers<br/>
New minimum of Windows 10<br/>
New minimum of Ubuntu 18.04<br/>
New minimum of MacOS<br/>
 
<div class="bb_h3">Added:</div>
64bit support<br/>
Steam Deck Playable (We failed the Green checkmark due to showing some mouse icons)<br/>
 
<div class="bb_h3">Removed:</div>
Twitter/X support (libcurl)<br/>
Windows XP/Vista/7/8 support, Steam itself is set to remove support soon <a class="bb_link" href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/4784-4F2B-1321-800A" target="_blank">https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/4784-4F2B-1321-800A</a><br/>
 
<div class="bb_h3">Fixed:</div>
<p>Game running super slow on Steam Deck<br/>
Game runs on MacOS again<br/>
Fixed libcurl issues on Linux that prevented launching the game<br/>
Windows High DPI issues, game running at a resolution bigger than monitor, etc.<br/>
Plus soooo many little things, I honestly lost track!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Native Linux version was initially missing some files so it wouldn't run, so I held off on covering this until it was solved, which it now is so I can confirm it launches properly on Kubuntu 23.10 and Steam Deck now!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>And for Steam Desktop here's what's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the new controller support panel showing on tools/applications.</li>
<li>Fixed opening Big Picture Mode from the system tray/task bar.</li>
<li>Fixed display of disk space available in "Add a new Steam library folder" dialog.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where unlocking Family View in the client would sometimes not unlock checkout.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the controller info interstitials could be scaled incorrect on Steam Deck or other small monitors.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where VR-only games could be shown with the "Controller Required" notice along with no controller support.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>

<li>Improved Gyro to Joystick Deflection mode's low level noise.</li>
<li>Reinstated horizontal haptics for all new "Gyro To..." modes.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Steam VR</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Desktop Game Theater - Only capture non-VR applications while visible in headset. Throttling will revert to default (monitor or no vsync, rather than headset vsynced) when content is not displayed in headset.

<li>Fixed some cases of the VR dashboard showing itself on game start.</li>
<li>Fixed a couple cases where the dashboard was being opened when it should not.</li>
</ul>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">

      <title>Steam Deck global top seller again thanks to cheaper LCDs and the Steam Deck OLED</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Not exactly a surprise but still great to see for Steam Deck fans for the ongoing support from Valve, as the Steam Deck is now firmly the global top seller on Steam once again.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/after-over-80-weeks-the-steam-deck-leaves-the-top-10-global-sellers-on-steam/" target="_blank">I reported on previously</a>, until around the end of September 2023, the Steam Deck was consistently in the top 10 on Steam for revenue since the release back in February 2022. Revenue being the <em>key</em> word here, because Valve's lists are based on revenue as they don't give out units sold publicly. Then it dropped globally down to 11th in the week for September 26, 2023 - October 3, 2023 and hovered around 11th - 15th place.</p>
<p>Now that Valve have discounted the LCD models and released the Steam Deck OLED though, this has caused a nice spike in sales for Valve with the Steam Deck jumping up to 4th place for the week November 7, 2023 - November 14, 2023 and now the global <em>top</em> seller once again as of the week for November 14, 2023 - November 21, 2023 and it's still the top seller for the last week as well so it's firmly back.</p>
<p>Valve will of course be happy with this, as they plan to continue supporting all models, and they clearly have <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1722675542875402311" target="_blank">plans</a> for a Steam Deck 2 once the hardware becomes available that's a big enough of a performance boost. We don't know how many Steam Decks have been sold but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/9/23954205/valve-steam-deck-multiple-millions" target="_blank">it is now</a> in the "multiple millions" number.</p>
<p>When you look at <a href="https://steamdeck.komodo.jp/?lang=en" target="_blank">Komodo</a> who sell the Steam Deck across Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong they're currently listing the Steam Deck OLED models as out of stock right now too - so clearly there's healthy demand there as well.</p>
<p>Depending on availability, you may still be able to pick up a Steam Deck LCD model in 64GB or 512GB until they run out of stock as those models have been discontinued. Or you can go for the 256GB LCD model which is now cheaper, or just grab the excellent Steam Deck OLED in either 512GB or 1TB.</p>
<p>You can buy a Steam Deck <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" target="_blank">directly from Valve</a>.</p>

      <title>An Amazing Wizard is a bland name for a game but it looks like great chaos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Jakub Dąbrowski may need to work on their game naming, but at least the gameplay looks like it's a lot of fun in An Amazing Wizard.</p>
<p>Currently in development with a demo available on Steam (Native Linux support), it's a 2D fast-paced, metroidvania inspired rogue-lite featuring a procedurally generated world, over 250 upgrades, 7 different characters, over 100 spells to wield and going by the trailer it looks actually great with some pretty chaotic action going on. I'm getting a Dead Cells meets Skul: The Hero Slayer vibe with this one.</p>
<p>Have a look below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yMUFVrNXhvU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ce059a88e323ac0e95b72df458568acb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yMUFVrNXhvU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Planned Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>PROCEDURALLY GENERATED WORLD</strong> - Explore a unique world every time you play.</li>
<li><strong>ACTION ROGUEVANIA</strong> - This means permanent deaths where you lose everything you have found, but there are lots of permanent upgrades available.</li>
<li><strong>250+ PERMANENT UPGRADES</strong> - Upgrade your starting items or statistics, add more elements to the world, increase your chances of finding better items and many more!</li>
<li><strong>7 PLAYABLE CHARACTERS</strong> - Unlock and play as one of the 7 Elemental Wizards!</li>
<li><strong>ENCHANT YOUR SPELLS</strong> - Search for Astral Forges to add enchantments to all your Spells and Magic Weapons to add some special effects to them!</li>
<li><strong>250+ UNIQUE ARTIFACTS</strong> - Every artifact has it's own special use. A lot of them change your Basic Spell behavior or add special abilities. Literally countless combinations.</li>
<li><strong>100+ POWERFUL SPELLS</strong> - Cast Fire Balls or Tornados, Summon Creatures, Slow Time, Create Gravity Zones and many, many more...</li>
<li><strong>DOZENS OF MAGIC WEAPONS</strong> - Use one of many Magic Weapons to help you survive!</li>
<li><strong>5 NONLINEAR LEVELS</strong> - Only 5 levels? Yes, but each time you die you will respawn in one of the four nature-inspired worlds and face other enemies based on the current biome. Levels order is never the same!</li>
<li><strong>FEW DIFFICULTY LEVELS</strong> - Every time you kill the end boss, you will gain the possibility to change the difficulty level and face stronger foes.</li>
<li><strong>MANY BOSSES</strong> - After every level you will have to face a merciless boss.</li>
<li><strong>LEVEL UP YOUR CHARACTER</strong> - Gain Experience Points for killing enemies. Select one of dozens of perks after leveling up to make you even stronger!</li>
<li><strong>A LOT OF SECRETS AND MYSTERIES TO DISCOVER</strong> - No spoilers!</li>
<li><strong>HOURS OF FUN</strong> - This one depends on your skill. Something about 50 - 80 hours or even more!</li>
<li><strong>MULTIPLE SAVE SLOTS</strong></li>
</ul>

      <title>Aether combines Risk of Rain 2 with Wizard of Legend</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What do you get when you combine the elemental combat system from Wizard of Legend, with the gameplay progression from Risk of Rain 2? The result is Aether.</p>
<p>Now available in Early Access on Steam, developer ORYgames has created a rather entertaining cocktail of gameplay elements here. They sent me a key to take a look, and I have to say my initial impression is rather positive on this one, because it's a really good blending.</p>
<p>The basic gameplay loop is very much Risk of Rain 2 where you drop into a map and fight through enemies, collect relics to power up and then beat the boss to continue onto the next map. You'll do this using your elemental powers like Fire, Water, Ice and so on with one initially picked during the brief intro and the rest you can purchase as you progress through to swap between them. As you go through taking down enemies, you can then level up that element for you run to gain access to more powerful abilities.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BHkyO7bMdPg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6dd9b5ddea7065ba0f3e9f7b22bb0548.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BHkyO7bMdPg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Since it's a new release, and Early Access, it's a little rough around the edges (especially the UI), but it shows an enormous amount of promise and it's already really fun to blast through with the different elements. If you love action rogue-lites, this is definitely one to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support built with Godot Engine.</p>
<p>Available in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2462790/Aether/" target="_blank">Early Access on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Xorg is dead, long live Wayland - Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) dropping Xorg</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some interesting Linux industry news for you here, as the long road towards Wayland by default everywhere is taking another big step with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) removing the Xorg server and other X servers (except Xwayland) from RHEL 10 and the following releases.</p>
<p>From their <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/rhel-10-plans-wayland-and-xorg-server" target="_blank">announcement</a> by developer Carlos Soriano Sanchez posted November 27th:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We want to recognize the significant effort all these organizations and individuals have made, especially the rest of the upstream community, without whom this project would never be so mature. This effort gave us the confidence to first make Wayland default for most use cases in RHEL 8, followed up with the <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/9.0_release_notes/deprecated_functionality#deprecated-functionality_graphics-infrastructures" target="_blank">deprecating</a> of Xorg server in RHEL 9, with the intention of its removal in a future release. Earlier this year (2023), as part of our RHEL 10 planning, we made a study to understand Wayland’s status, not only from an infrastructure perspective, but also from an ecosystem perspective. The result of this evaluation is that, while there are still some gaps and applications that need some level of adaptation, we believe the Wayland infrastructure and ecosystem are in good shape, and that we’re on a good path for the identified blockers to be resolved by the time RHEL 10 is out, planned to be released on the first half of 2025.</p>
<p>With this, we’ve decided to remove Xorg server and other X servers (except Xwayland) from RHEL 10 and the following releases. Xwayland should be able to handle most X11 clients that won’t immediately be ported to Wayland, and if needed, our customers will be able to stay on RHEL 9 for its <a href="https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata#RHEL8_and_9_Life_Cycle" target="_blank">full life cycle</a> while resolving the specifics needed for transitioning to a Wayland ecosystem. It’s important to note that “Xorg Server” and “X11” are not synonymous, X11 is a protocol that will continue to be supported through Xwayland, while the Xorg Server is one of the implementations of the X11 protocol.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Red Hat and their engineers have their fingers in many pies across the Linux space, so this is a pretty big move, and one they say will enable them to "tackle problems such as HDR, increased security, setups with mixed low and high density displays or very high density displays, better GPU/Display hot-plugging, better gestures and scrolling, and so on" — which of course will end up benefiting everyone because that's how open source works.</p>
<p>Have you fully switched over to Wayland yet?</p>

      <title>Post-apocalyptic real-time strategy game Retro Commander is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Up for some more classic RTS action? Retro Commander from Noble Master is now officially released after 6+ years in development. Some of you might know Noble Master from their previous games like Age of Conquest IV and Demise of Nations.</p>
<p>You definitely get some early Westwood RTS game vibes from this like Command &amp; Conquer. The developer mentioned over email that "Retro Commander tries to emulate the classic RTS look and feel, albeit with modern day controls and elements. The game focuses on both single and multiplayer matches. A comic-based story campaign follows the footsteps of Agent Johnson, who wakes up in a futuristic wasteland. In over 25+ missions, you need to make new friends and fight against their enemies. The single player AI comes with several difficulty levels. In multiplayer games you fight co-op style with the AI and other players for ultimate victory. Players are given an ELO-like rating. The game supports cross-platform multiplayer matches against players on PC, Mac, Linux, Android and iOS.".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1zW6AUVAXlE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2c9e8508f522524c9d5c3a8632452c74.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1zW6AUVAXlE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Post-Apocalyptic: Real-time strategy (RTS) played in a post-apocalyptic timeline on Mother Earth. The environment includes day-night cycles, rain, snow, wind and solar flare activity.</li>
<li>Story Campaign: Deep campaign and story line of humanity after a cataclysmic event. Factions come with their own specialized technologies such as stealth, robots, drones or shields.</li>
<li>Single &amp; Multiplayer: A challenging AI for both single and multiplayer matches with co-op play. Cross-platform multiplayer including LAN/internet. ONLINE play comes with an award and rating system.</li>
<li>Play Modes: In addition to regular skirmish matches, the game supports missions such as elimination, survival, capture the flag, defense and battle royale. Available in both single and multiplayer also are escort and rescue missions.</li>
<li>Structures &amp; Troops: Common troops for land, sea and air warfare is available to all factions. Specialized elements such as stealth, shields, EMP weapons, nukes, portals, orbital weapons, assimilator and other troops and structures provide for additional variety.</li>
<li>Research: A tech tree and research options enable to build specialized structures and troops. A Tech Snatcher can be used to steal enemy technology.</li>
<li>Modding: A map editor is included allowing for player-modded maps including player-modded campaigns. All elements including troops, structures, as well as graphics and sound effects, can be modded if desired.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Just like their previous games you get a couple little tutorial levels free to play plus some multiplayer maps, and then you have to buy the rest of the game. It's a curious way to try to pull people in that not many games on Steam do. The actual full complete game can be picked up as a DLC on Steam or in-game for £16.75 / $19.99.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

<p>What is GUNHEAD? It's technically a sequel to CRYPTARK but with a new perspective as a fast paced strategic roguelike FPS where you take the role of a pirate mech with a gun for a head, looting derelict spaceships filled with monstrous drones made out of bone and steel.</p>
<p>In a recent patch they <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/704000/view/3889483182511062265" target="_blank">announced</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've updated to 1.44 - focused on better Steam Deck support.<br/>
<br/>
- Will default to 130% UI scale for Steam Deck<br/>
- Better scaling of the UI for different UI scales<br/>
- Larger fonts (inventory, license station)</p>

      <title>TUXEDO Sirius 16 launches full AMD gaming notebook with Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for your next hardware purchase? How about a new Linux notebook that's all-in with AMD? The TUXEDO Sirius 16 looks delicious.</p>
<p>"Sirius is the brightest star in the night sky and a binary star system. With the new Sirius 16 - Gen1, TUXEDO is breaking new ground and launching the first and long-awaited full AMD Linux gaming notebook named after the celestial body, especially since the TUXEDO Sirius 16 is also powered by a particularly exciting binary star, consisting of the AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS and the AMD Radeon RX 7600M XT." — TUXEDO Computers</p>
<p>What you get here is quite the powerhouse with a 16.1 inch 2560x1440 display, with a 165Hz refresh rate. Backed up by the 8 cores and 16 threads from the AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS, a large 80 Wh battery, 2x 8 GB DDR5-5600 RAM and 1x 500 GB Samsung 980 SSD.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13466143511701093094gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13466143511701093094gol1.png"/></a><br/>
Pictured - TUXEDO Sirius 16</em></p>
<p>As you might be able to tell from the image above it has a colour-adjustable light bar on the front edge as well as a per-key RGB-backlit keyboard for those of you who like things a little less plain.</p>
<p>Plenty of room for upgrades during configuration or <em>after</em> purchase with the ability to up it to 96GB RAM, and they say it has two easily accessible M.2 slots when you remove the base tray, which is covered by their warranty, so you can configure it up to 2 x 4TB SSDs with a fast PCIe 4.0 connection.</p>

      <title>Plasma 6 full steam ahead with only one showstopper left for Wayland by default</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As the KDE team continue working full steam ahead towards Plasma 6, they're now down to a single showstopping bug for having Wayland by default. Written up in a <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2023/11/24/this-week-in-kde-the-plasma-6-feature-freeze-approaches/" target="_blank">blog post</a> as usual by developer Nate Graham, recent work for readying Plasma 6 sounds great.</p>
<p>The last bug considered a showstopper is "<a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=444335" target="_blank">Full sticky keys functionality does not work under Wayland</a>", so once that's solved they will consider it ready to be default. There's various other bugs of course, with lots of users now testing and reporting from the recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/kde-plasma-6-gets-a-first-alpha-release/" target="_blank">huge Plasma 6 Alpha release</a> but mostly minor issues.</p>
<p>Another important issue that has now been solved is that Plasma on Wayland will now actually prompt you about unsaved changes in apps, instead of just rebooting or shutting down and allowing you to lose your work. Thankfully no Wayland protocol changes were needed for this.</p>
<p>Found an app behaving badly? The "Kill unresponsive window?" is now fully online on Plasma Wayland and got a modern UI face-lift.</p>
<p>Something else that's been changed that sounds useful is that when you upgrade to Plasma 6 from Plasma 5, if there's Widgets you were using that aren't API compatible it will be shown in a "user-friendly way" so you don't think it's all just broken.</p>
<p>A reminder on the roadmap for Plasma 6:</p>
<ul>
<li>8 November 2023: Alpha</li>
<li>29 November 2023: Beta 1</li>
<li>20 December 2023: Beta 2</li>
<li>10 January 2024: Release Candidate 1</li>
<li>31 January 2024: Release Candidate 2</li>
<li>21 February 2024: Private Tarball Release</li>
<li>28 February 2024: Public Release</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm very much looking forward to seeing everything Plasma 6 has to offer up at release next year for my desktop. And eventually on Steam Deck when Valve pull it into a future SteamOS upgrade for the desktop mode.</p>
<p>Is there anything in particular you're looking forward to in Plasma 6?</p>

      <title>Over 5% of The Pale Beyond players were on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's an interesting little data point for you, as the developers behind the polar exploration and survival game The Pale Beyond have given an update on Steam Deck engagement with their game.</p>
<p>In a recent video from Bellular Studios, who run the Bellular News YouTube channel, they showed off that 5.28% of players overall were on Steam Deck. The video went up on Nov 24th, 2023 and it's mentioned they're recent stats and Michael mentions in the video how they were "absolutely god damn shocked just how many people were playing on Steam Deck".</p>
<p>The Steam Deck bit starts around 4:37 which is where the video embed below should start:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aghkxdkzX_c?rel=0&amp;start=277"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/54c4badac7eae11792f25a981dd79d9c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aghkxdkzX_c?rel=0&amp;start=277" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What's interesting though is this is not the first time I've covered it. Looking back on it, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/the-pale-beyond-sold-10-of-copies-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">they also said back in March</a> this year how Steam Deck sales were at 10% but that was quite early on after release and the game has now been out for around 9 months. Seeing over 5% of players actually being on Steam Deck though seems like a pretty good number, and far above macOS.</p>
<p>You can buy a copy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/the-pale-beyond?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1266030/The_Pale_Beyond/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I adore creature collecting games and Portal Fantasy looks and sounds like it could be quite an interesting spin on the genre, with you creating worlds for people to explore. We've had a few pretty great entries into the genre in recent years like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/charming-monster-collector-cassette-beasts-is-out-now/" target="_blank">Cassette Beasts</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/relics-of-chaos-update-out-for-monster-sanctuary-as-the-last-major-update/" target="_blank">Monster Sanctuary</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/pokemon-like-coromon-finally-has-big-fps-problem-fixed-for-steam-deck-linux/" target="_blank">Coromon</a> and others and it's awesome to see more coming.</p>

      <title>VKD3D-Proton 2.11 released with DirectX Raytracing enabled by default</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>An exciting release of VKD3D-Proton has arrived! VKD3D-Proton 2.11 brings with it some big improvements for the Direct3D 12 to Vulkan translation layer used in Valve's Proton for Linux PC and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>First big change is that DXR is now enabled by default, no more needing to set "VKD3D_CONFIG=dxr" as that is the default. However they note a few special cases where it is not. Sampler feedback is also now supported through emulation, and thanks to this DX Ultimate (FL 12.2) is also now exposed by default on RDNA2+ and Turing+.</p>
<p>There's also various performance fixes, new workarounds for game issues and a few general bug fixes. All the rest available below in the full changelog:</p>
<details class="spoiler_container"><summary class="spoiler_header">Changelog, click me</summary>
<div class="spoiler-content">
<h3>Features</h3>
<h5>DXR enabled by default</h5>
<p><code class="inline-code">VKD3D_CONFIG=dxr</code> is default now, and no longer needed.<br/>
There are some special cases where DXR is not enabled by default. The only such current example is<br/>
"Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice" on Deck which force-enables DXR if it is supported, even on Deck.<br/>
New semantics are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">dxr</code>: Force-enable DXR, even when it is considered unsafe</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">nodxr</code>: Disable DXR</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">dxr11</code>: Removed. <code class="inline-code">dxr</code> already implied DXR 1.1 anyway</li>
</ul>
<h5>Sampler feedback</h5>
<p>This feature was the last feature required for FL 12.2 and is implemented through emulation.<br/>
As demonstrated in the <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/blob/master/docs/sampler_feedback.md" target="_blank">implementation docs</a>, all<br/>
native implementations of this feature are fundamentally broken in some way.<br/>
There's also no known game that ships requiring this feature, so we just consider this a checkbox feature.</p>
<h5>DX Ultimate (FL 12.2) now exposed by default</h5>
<p>On RDNA2+ and Turing+ we can finally expose the DX Ultimate feature set!</p>

<ul>
<li>Implement a bunch of missing "Vulkan-on-D3D12" features

      <title>Upcoming bullet hell shooter Cosmic Carnage looks wild</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need more bullet hell goodness for your Linux PC or Steam Deck? Good news, Cosmic Carnage looks pretty wild and it will have Native Linux support.</p>
<p>No, I'm not talking about the fighting game Cosmic Carnage from 1994 but a space shooter filled with action and glorious upgrades from developer LionSword Studios. Looks like they've learned a lot from their 2016 game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/366010/Generic_Space_Shooter/" target="_blank">Generic Space Shooter</a> because this looks far more interesting. Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="abfbWyCVlzM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f44d7c48a6f62f3136875790a4e36c1c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/abfbWyCVlzM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Battle endless waves of alien spaceships. Fight against a variety of enemies with different behaviours and attack patterns</li>
<li>Collect EXP to level up and upgrade your ship to help you survive the onslaught. 80+ upgrades available making each run unique and interesting</li>
<li>With a roguelite progression system, no run is ever a fail. Gather more points and unlock new upgrades and weapons to add to the pool to create overpowered builds!</li>
<li>Upgrade your build by unlocking new astronauts and ships. Each astronaut has unique abilities and stats. Each ship has a unique weapon and stats. Synchronize astronauts and ships to unlock hidden synergies.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It has a demo <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2440650/Cosmic_Carnage/" target="_blank">available on Steam</a> and with Native Linux support the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2440650/discussions/0/7342618062800321868/" target="_blank">developer said</a> it's "100% compatible with the steam deck". No current set release date while they're still working on it but they have been regularly updating the demo so be sure to check it out. Looks like they may also have a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2704660/Cosmic_Carnage_Prologue/" target="_blank">Prologue</a> coming as well.</p>

      <title>Explore secrets in a sacred operating system in Crossroad OS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's something wrong with this operating system. Crossroad OS is a single-player adventure where you solve puzzles, meet strange creatures and explore a sacred operating system created as a junction between the human and spirit world.</p>
<p>According to the developer it's a bit of a weird mixture between a puzzle and a horror game and that "Crossʀoad OS was created with noble intentions, however approaching the spirits without a stable mind is a risky undertaking. What secrets are hiding in the system's partitions?". Don't go expecting any jump-scares though it's more about the spooky and unsettling atmosphere. Looks like a rather odd one but it has me curious to see more from it.</p>
<p>Check out the initial teaser below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_NAwAIi5l9A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6884bbcf5dd851439f7986b7abd99551.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_NAwAIi5l9A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's a demo available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1783800/Crossroad_OS/" target="_blank">Steam </a>and it releases December 8th.</p>

      <title>Please save me I have discovered Leaf Blower Revolution</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's cold and blowy outside, there's leaves everywhere and so the obvious solution to keep warm is to stay inside and play a game about blowing away leaves. Apparently that's what I'm doing with my life now, playing a free to play Steam game where I throw my mouse around the screen like a maniac to get all these damn leaves off my lawn.</p>
<p>Leaf Blower Revolution is a peculiar game. Released back in 2020 it's gone onto be rather popular too, with over 20,000 user reviews and an Overwhelmingly Positive rating. Clearly they're onto something, and I can see why. I want to keep going and I don't exactly know why.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1421276971700834197gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1421276971700834197gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's very much a game of watching numbers go up, or not, just leaf it alone and come back later and see what's happened. Since it's an idle game, you can just leave it on a second monitor or in the background, to dive in for a few minutes to take an active role whenever you want.</p>
<p>The game trickles in little treats for you too. There's many different types of leaves to blow away you'll find drop onto your lawn, and as you blow them away you'll get a leaf currency to go and buy some special tools. I must admit, the game gave me a chuckle the first time I closed and opened it, <a href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2674673571700831763gol1.jpg" target="_blank">noting how</a> I shouldn't be rewarded for doing nothing but it did so anyway and gave me a ton of basic leaves to go and buy stuff with. Okay Leaf Blower Revolution, I see what you're doing, you're trying to get me to play more.</p>
<p>When you start playing more, and buying more (with the in-game currency), it only gets bigger and funnier too. Starting off with nothing but your hands, moving onto rakes and leaf blowers, automatic leaf blowers that travel around the screen like little robots and more. You can even buy nuclear fuel to power-up your devices, what could possibly go wrong there?</p>
<p>After you accrue enough leaves you can buy the ability to get different leaves, which then opens up other types of shops to buy more different quirky tools and abilities. Each shop gives you the ability to buy the next level leaf too and — repeat. Glorious number-go-up repetition while leaves fly around the screen. It's weirdly therapeutic. There's over 30 different leaves, over 38 different shops, over 40 areas, there's even some pets you can get.</p>
<p>The Steam reviews make me laugh too, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Sockman21/recommended/1468260/" target="_blank">someone</a> with over 1,000 hours in it wrote "Still need just another hour or two to see if I really like it....", and yeah — that about sums this game up I think. Apparently at some point my Tea went cold, I'll warm it up later, gotta blow away some more leaves.</p>
<p>Unless you want it to take over your life don't download Leaf Blower Revolution.</p>
<p>Works great on desktop Linux with Proton 8, and Valve rated it Steam Deck Playable. Worked fine on Steam Deck with my testing but the font can be a little small. You can turn up the font size, but the font itself is not very clear but thankfully you can choose an alternative font too which is much clearer.</p>
<p>Check it out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1468260/Leaf_Blower_Revolution__Idle_Game/" target="_blank">free to play on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Hell Let Loose now works on Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a fun one I managed to somehow miss recently, but it seems that Hell Let Loose has hooked up Easy Anti-Cheat to work on Linux / Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Not a big surprise though, considering they clearly stated <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/hell-let-loose-planning-steam-deck-support/" target="_blank">it was in their roadmap</a>, but it appears the addition came without any proper announcement I can find. Seems it was added around a 1-2 months ago. You just need to ensure you have the "Proton EasyAntiCheat Runtime" installed in your Steam Library, and then it should work with Proton 8.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3818444321700829459gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3818444321700829459gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take to the battlefield in this squad-based, 50v50 multiplayer game, and choose one of our 14 roles available within the Command, Infantry, Recon and Armour unit types. Play as an Officer, Spotter, Medic, Tank Commander and more, to experience every aspect of World War II combat. Each role is equipped with different historical weapons, vehicles, and equipment that are intricately detailed, bringing the realism to the brutal and bloody warfare. Unit focussed gameplay is crucial and when done well can command the tide of battle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's plenty of reports of it working well on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/686810?device=pc" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a>.</p>
<p>It's 45% off on <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/hell-let-loose?ref=gol" target="_blank">Fanatical</a>, and 35% off on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/hell-let-loose?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/686810/Hell_Let_Loose/" target="_blank">Steam</a> until November 28th.</p>

      <title>Deckmate, my favourite Steam Deck accessory is discounted for Black Friday</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Your Steam Deck deserves a Deckmate. It's easily one of my most used and favourite accessories to pair up with a Steam Deck and now it's discounted so go grab it. They've actually done a bit of a rebrand recently, since they now offer up similar accessories for the ROG Ally too, so they're now known as <a href="https://getmechanism.com/" target="_blank">Mechanism</a>.</p>
<p>For those who haven't seen it before: it's an attachment system giving you a mounting system to basically mount…well, anything to it. Valve even used it for their video of the Steam Deck OLED orb in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vTsZMvjJ-A" target="_blank">official trailer</a>, all those OLED's were mounted with the Deckmate.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11197497451700828392gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11197497451700828392gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>It simply hooked over the top and bottom, and the mount itself is thin enough that it really doesn't get in the way of anything. Then you just hook whatever you want into the back of it. That could be a battery pack, a stand, a USB-C hub, attach it to a wall (because why not?) or whatever else you can think of that might need to be attached to it.</p>
<p>For Black Friday there's discount on the <a href="https://getmechanism.com/products/deck-mate-entire-system" target="_blank">full system</a>, the <a href="https://getmechanism.com/products/the-essentials-bundle" target="_blank">essentials bundle</a>, just as a <a href="https://getmechanism.com/products/kickstand-bundle" target="_blank">kickstand</a> and <a href="https://getmechanism.com/" target="_blank">more</a>. The discounts last until Tuesday 28th November.</p>
<p>You can see my quick-take year-old video on it below:</p>

      <title>Check out Doom Infinite, a Doom-based FPS roguelike mod for GZDoom</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tired of GZDoom mods for DOOM II just adding some maps or some gore? Be sure to take a look at Doom Infinite, which turns it into a FPS roguelike. I've been testing it out myself since it was emailed in (thanks Tate), and love the idea of it! Currently not finished and what you get is only a demo of things to come, as they continue working on it but it's really promising if you love your retro shooters with a bit of extra spice.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4379728911700747267gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4379728911700747267gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>More about it: "Encounter demons empowered with various traits and curses that make them stronger, faster or much more tricky to send back to hell. Collect, mix and match multiple permanent power-ups for a unique approach on each runs. Find unique weapons variations or mod them yourself to your liking. Explore more to unlock new places or discover hidden secrets, but beware of the traps and challenges lingering about. All that while the dynamic weather or map-wide curses provide additional challenges. Even the maps themselves can warp and distort, presenting a slightly different path each time you visit them. But more importantly than that - survive the longest you can, while shooting anything moving that crosses your path!</p>
<p>Greatly expanding upon the originals' mechanics, Infinite allows for a fun, dynamic and unique experience along with perma-death and unlockable achievements. From dynamic spawners, balanced game director, visual and audio updates, three brand new weapons, music shuffler to even a simple but expressive emote system - those are only some of the extra components built into this mod, all to enhance ripping and tearing through hordes of demons hunting you down."</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/doom-infinite" target="_blank">find it on Mod DB</a>.</p>
<p>To play it on Linux you need a copy of <a href="https://zdoom.org/" target="_blank">GZDoom</a> installed, along with the wad file from DOOM II (<a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/doom_ii" target="_blank">GOG</a> / <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300/DOOM_II/" target="_blank">Steam</a>). You'll need to make sure your DOOM II wad file is in the correct location which for standard installs will be:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">~/.config/gzdoom/</code></p>
<p>And for Flathub installs it will be:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">~/.var/app/org.zdoom.GZDoom/.config/gzdoom/</code></p>
<p>And then place the Doom Infinite pk3 file into the same folder.</p>
<p>Then to run you via terminal with a standard install:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">gzdoom -file ~/.config/gzdoom/DOOM_Infinite_DEMO_0978_6.pk3</code></p>
<p>And again for Flatpak / Flathub:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">flatpak run org.zdoom.GZDoom -file ~/.var/app/org.zdoom.GZDoom/.config/gzdoom/DOOM_Infinite_DEMO_0978_6.pk3</code></p>

      <title>Dominatrix is a fresh updated port of Ritual Entertainment&#39;s SiN</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Remember SiN? The classic shooter from Ritual Entertainment released in 1998? Well there's a new updated port of it for modern systems. Developer Rohit emailed about it to mention the release on <a href="https://rohit.itch.io/dominatrix" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and their <a href="https://cohost.org/rohit/post/3207148-release-dominatrix" target="_blank">CoHost blog</a> about the work involved that's worth a read.</p>
<p>The thing is, Night Dive Studios did put out SiN: Gold, and they're working on SiN Reloaded but there's no hint at a release date for that yet. Rohit mentions that "While SiN Gold is a pretty decent way to play the game, it still has a few pain points that could really use some smoothing over" and so they put on their coding socks and made Dominatrix.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16811670421700743302gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16811670421700743302gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the new features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new Linux port.</li>
<li>Better resolution support.</li>
<li>Controller Support.</li>
<li>Weapon radial menu.</li>
<li>Gamepad-friendly virtual keyboard.</li>
<li>Better menu/interface scaling.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's also been added to the Luxtorpeda, to enable you to easily run it from Steam. See <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/steam-deck-using-luxtorpeda-for-morrowind-warzone-2100-and-x-com/" target="_blank">more on Luxtorpeda here</a>.</p>
<p>You do need the original data files to play it which you can grab from <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/sin_gold" target="_blank">GOG</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1313/SiN_Gold/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Hunt: Showdown anti-cheat now fixed for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After being left broken for about a week, Crytek have now fixed up their Easy Anti-Cheat for Hunt: Showdown to work on Steam Deck / Linux again.</p>
<p>Reported on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/hunt-showdown-is-broken-on-steam-deck-linux-due-to-easy-anti-cheat/" target="_blank">here a few days ago</a>, Hunt: Showdown would boot you out of games showing a warning that Easy Anti-Cheat authorization failed. Crytek did respond and noted in the article that they were working on it, which is good and great to see it fixed. You shouldn't need to do anything, as the issue was on their end, just make sure the game is up to date in your Steam Downloads.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9823097551700740270gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9823097551700740270gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's a shame this sort of anti-cheat issue is still happening though, as we're only a few months away from two years since the Steam Deck released. At least they enabled the support though, plenty of developers still <em>haven't</em> enabled support for Steam Deck / Linux at all like Rust, Destiny 2, PUBG, Rainbow Six Siege and many others.</p>
<p>You can see my previous Steam Deck video on Hunt: Showdown below:</p>

      <title>Diablo IV free to play on Steam until Tuesday</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a chance for you to see if you actually want to buy Diablo IV. Not only is it 40% off on Steam and works great on Steam Deck and desktop Linux with Proton but it's also <em>temporarily</em> free to play.</p>
<p>Blizzard has made it free until Tuesday, 6PM UTC — so you've got quite a while to jump in and see what to expect from it. Once the free time is over though, you will lose access if you don't purchase it. And thanks to it being on Steam, for Steam Deck / Linux there's no special configuration needed and no messing around with manually installing Battle Net.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2944295031700739740gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2944295031700739740gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Something to note though, which Blizzard don't state on Steam, is that this free to play time only lasts until you hit level 20 in the game. Still a good few hours of gameplay though to give it a run.</p>
<p>With it being 40% off you can pick it up for £35.99 / $41.99 / €41.99.</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2344520/Diablo_IV/" target="_blank">out on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Have you been playing it? What's your current thoughts on it?</p>
<p>You can see a previous Steam Deck video I did for Diablo IV below, although this was through Battle Net the performance is generally the same:</p>

      <title>SteamOS 3.5.7 released, plus Steam Deck Client update and Power LED changes coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Three bits of Steam Deck news for you this morning with multiple updates coming in including a SteamOS update, a Steam Deck Client update and info about some LED changes coming.</p>
<p>Firstly, SteamOS 3.5.7 has been promoted to Stable with these <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3870342884095376976" target="_blank">changes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed internal microphone not working in certain cases like desktop applications.</li>
<li>Deployed a temporary workaround for a performance problem with "Allow Tearing".</li>
<li>Fixed some USB connectivity issues.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>On top of that a Stable Steam Deck Client Update was also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3870342884094741095" target="_blank">released</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed SteamDeck being recognized as previously authorized device for Family Sharing.</li>
<li>Fixed the new controller support panel showing on tools/applications.</li>
<li>Fixed several layout regressions in the quick access menu, eula dialogs, and game achievements page.</li>
</ul>
<p>Big Picture Mode</p>
<ul>
<li>Add the buttons back to the game launch interstitials rather than relying on the footer buttons.</li>
</ul>
<p>Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix the desktop configuration page being blank when opted-out of Steam Input</li>
<li>Fix for Steam Controller gyro turn rate, and sped up gravity correction. Both were affecting the feel of Gyro to Deflection Mode.</li>
<li>Fixed some controllers not being able to pass the Stationary Tolerances manual calibration phase.</li>
<li>Fixed occasional "jerks" in "Gyro To..." conversion modes that used the gravity axis (i.e. Player Space, World Space, Laser Pointer modes)</li>
<li>Improved Gyro to Joystick Deflection mode's low level noise.</li>
<li>Reinstated horizontal haptics for all new "Gyro To..." modes.</li>
<li>Fixed UI: order of Steam Deck Gyro's Calibration readings.</li>
<li>Attempt to fix legacy Gyro "Joystick" mode - use the gravity orientation found upon app switch and subtract it from the live feed.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>When it comes to the Power LED, Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1727479354840822067" target="_blank">mentioned</a> on X (Twitter): "We're working on an update to let users control the intensity of their power LED, which should be interesting to *LE users." — so it will be interesting to see what they have cooking there. Would be quite nice on the OLED, since it turns bright green when charged which was a bit bright in my bedroom. <em>*By LE, Griffais most likely means the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamdeck_2023LE" target="_blank">Limited Edition</a>, as it has a translucent shell.</em></p>
<p>Great to see Valve continuing the quick improvements and listening to all feedback there.</p>

      <title>Rock &#39;n&#39; Roll Will Never Die! point and click adventure gets Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rock 'n' Roll Will Never Die!, a musical comedy point and click adventure game recently added full Native Linux support. Looks like quite a fun one too if you like your rock music and classic adventure games like this.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="--rKONUxDuM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/21dc329096a06d78770cde2455f86dc5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/--rKONUxDuM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>About it: "Rock 'n' Roll Will Never Die! is a parodic adventure inspired by classic point-and-click games, heavy metal, and underground comics. You'll jump into the beer-soaked denim vest of a middle-aged teddy bear to orchestrate the comeback of your old glam metal band, not caring that glam metal has been the laughing stock of everyone in the music industry since the 1980s. A true heavy metal heart never stops beating!</p>
<p>Almost four years in development, Rock 'n' Roll Will Never Die! offers about ten hours of wild adventures all over the rockosphere with hand-drawn graphics and a bunch of original music."</p>
<p>You can find it on <a href="https://bestgames.itch.io/rock-n-roll-will-never-die" target="_blank">itch.io</a>. Hopefully eventually the Linux version will also come to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1644080/Rock_n_Roll_Will_Never_Die/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has a Positive rating on Steam but not many reviews overall.</p>

The game is currently rated Steam Deck Verified and Platinum on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1545560" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a>, it's also rated Overwhelmingly Positive on Steam so it's a good one!</p>

      <title>NVIDIA 545.29.06 Linux driver released with Source 2 game fix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA has today released the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/download/driverResults.aspx/216530/en-uk/" target="_blank">545.29.06</a> Linux stable driver. A small one with only a few useful sounding fixes.</p>
<p>Here's the changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a regression that prevented setting backlight brightness levels.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could lead to UI corruption in nvidia-installer on systems with more than one initramfs file per kernel.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused games built on the Source 2 engine to hang when running under Xwayland.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also a good time for a reminder, especially as it seems other sites did not report on this, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/nvidia-driver-5452902-out-for-linux-plus-other-releases-due-to-security-issues/" target="_blank">NVIDIA did a security bulletin back in late October</a> and so you'll want to ensure you are up to date to prevent any issues. At a minimum you'll want to ensure you're on one of these drivers:</p>
<ul>
<li>545.29.02</li>
<li>535.129.03</li>
<li>525.147.05</li>
<li>470.223.02</li>

      <title>GameMaker now free for non-commercial use, one-time fee for indie devs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems like GameMaker are trying to eat some of Unity's lunch here after the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-attempt-to-clarify-new-install-fees-as-developers-revolt/" target="_blank">mess</a> that was Unity's install fee plan, GameMaker have made it much easier for developers to use it (and cheaper).</p>
<p>Firstly, for non-commercial use, GameMaker is now free to use. So for game devs just starting out, this could be an interesting choice again. And then when you plan to sell your games, the Professional license (doesn't include console) is now a one-time fee instead of a subscription. Much, <em>much</em> better. Simpler and clearer and will no doubt pull in some more developers.</p>
<p>All three of their licenses (Free, Professional, Enterprise) also note this very clearly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Revenue Share</strong>: there is no revenue share that you will be required to pay as part of this license.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Cost per Install</strong>: there is no cost associated with the number of instals that your content can have.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Additional Costs</strong>: there are no additional costs associated with this license.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Professional license also notes it's perpetual, so no worries on them dumping new terms onto you like Unity attempted to do.</p>
<p>On top of that they've also made all their <a href="https://gamemaker.io/en/bundles" target="_blank">asset bundles</a> free.</p>
<p>See their <a href="https://gamemaker.io/en/blog/gamemaker-free-platforms" target="_blank">announcement here</a>.</p>

      <title>Riders Republic should now run on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some good news for fans of crazy sporty games like Riders Republic, as Ubisoft actually worked to get it working on Steam Deck / Linux.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2290180/announcements/detail/3810669011448242938" target="_blank">announcement post</a> on Steam they said: "As some of you may have noticed, some work has been going on behind the scenes to get Riders Republic running on Steam Deck. And we're happy to announce that you can now play the game on this platform!".</p>
<p>The game uses BattlEye, as it's a big multiplayer playground, and since BattlEye does work on Linux they've now gotten it enabled. You just need to ensure you have the BattlEye Runtime installed in your Steam Library. They also said they will continue to work on improving the "flow and playability of Riders Republic, but we're happy that you can now enjoy the game on the go".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2yzzA_nZHtk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bca408aff17d9fe6702501688dbd4c53.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2yzzA_nZHtk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's still labelled as Unsupported by Valve for Steam Deck but that's an old rating, so Valve will need to re-check it.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2290180/Riders_Republic/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>The Invincible gets updated to fix it with the latest Steam Deck updates</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Invincible is a story-driven adventure set in a hard sci-fi world by Stanisław Lem. Quite popular and it broke recently with the latest Steam Deck / SteamOS upgrade.</p>
<p>In this case, thankfully, the developer was quick to provide support and they actually patched the game directly to get it working. Now this is what I love to see - proper direct support. The developer mentioned in an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/731040/announcements/detail/5872192466327821927" target="_blank">announcement</a> the fix came thanks to people sending over save files so they could identify the problem.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uvNGTLPAIPI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/80688cf3043c110ba75e04f302851a81.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uvNGTLPAIPI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Invincible is a first-person game based on the motifs of The Invincible - an iconic novel of the world-known, hard science-fiction author and Polish futurologist Stanisław Lem.<br/>
<br/>
There are places like Regis III, not prepared for us and for which we are not prepared for. Still, our spacecraft inevitably comes closer to the destination - for our stories and fates to cross in a dead spot.</p>
<p>You are a highly qualified, sharp-witted astrobiologist named Yasna. Being entangled in a space race, you and your crew end up on the unexplored planet Regis III. The scientific journey quickly turns into a search mission for lost crewmates. Follow its trail, but be fully aware that every decision you make can bring you closer to danger.</p>

      <title>Valve gives Steam a nice upgrade for controller-friendly games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After recently tweaking Steam Input and the Steam Client, Valve has now <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/3823053915988527062" target="_blank">upgraded</a> the main Steam Store to show off controller support for games.</p>
<p>They've updated the main <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/controller/" target="_blank">Controller-Friendly Game Hub</a>, allowing you to filter specifically by controller type between Xbox and PlayStation DualShock and DualSense. Making it easier than ever to ensure you're finding games that support your main controller. Example below:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15192256231700569569gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15192256231700569569gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Store pages for individual games also had their controller support status expanded. Down the right-side of pages were features are listed, you'll now see bits like this to indicate what controllers they work with:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15494809321700569896gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15494809321700569896gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's more too including new search filtering options for specific controller models, Steam Library updates to show controller support more clearly and new filtering for your Steam Library (including for Big Picture Mode).</p>
<p>Speaking about why they're now expanding all this they said there were "over 3 Billion game sessions that included a controller in the past year" and of that 60% were with an Xbox controller, 27% PlayStation and the rest a mixture of Steam Deck, Switch Pro, and hundreds of other controller models. Four years ago that controller gaming session count was only 990 million, so it's a huge increase in people gaming with controllers and back then only 19% were using PlayStation controllers so their popularity has increased a lot too.</p>
<p>What do you prefer to game with?</p>

      <title>Open source re-implementation of Tomb Raider 1 &#39;TR1X&#39; gets Linux builds</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to play a classic with a fresh open source game engine? TR1X for Tomb Raider 1 from 1996 has a new release out with a Native Linux version now available. Available under the GPL license, TR1X was made by reverse engineering the TombATI / GLRage variant of the original game and replacing proprietary audio/video libraries with open source variants.</p>
<p>The 3.0 release went up a few weeks ago, followed by two bug fix releases over the last 2 weeks which included the renaming from Tomb1Main to TR1X, adds a developer console, adds Linux builds and toolchain, an option to allow Lara to roll underwater, an option to turn off Eidos logo entirely through config, the bonus level type for custom levels that unlocks if all main game secrets are found, detection for animation commands to play SFX on land, water or both and more features and plenty of bug fixes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2752794051700567727gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2752794051700567727gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>TR1X includes masses of improvements over the original game like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proper UI and bar scaling.</li>
<li>Enemy health bars.</li>
<li>PS1 style UI.</li>
<li>Fade effects to displayed images.</li>
<li>Improved support for windowed mode.</li>
<li>Ability to set user-defined FOV.</li>
<li>Ability to look up and down while hanging.</li>
<li>Ability to forward and backward jump while looking.</li>
<li>Ability to look around while running.</li>
<li>A pause screen.</li>
<li>+ the list goes on and on, making it much more modern feeling.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the project on <a href="https://github.com/LostArtefacts/TR1X" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>You do need assets from the original game which you can grab from <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/tomb_raider_123" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/224960/Tomb_Raider_I_1996/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Intel Vulkan drivers on Linux should run more games with Mesa 24.0</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While work is ongoing to provide brand new Intel Xe Vulkan drivers on Linux with their newer driver, work is still happening to improve the current driver.</p>
<p>Merged recently is support for <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/25512" target="_blank">Sparse Binding</a> on the i915 driver, which is required by <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton" target="_blank">vkd3d-proton</a> to support Direct3D 12 features to run plenty of modern games including (according to <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/5003" target="_blank">this feature request</a>) the likes of DEATHLOOP, DIRT 5, Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, Assassin's Creed: Valhalla, Forza Horizon 4 and 5 and no doubt plenty more.</p>
<p>So when Mesa 24.0 releases, users of Intel GPUs should hopefully get a much better gaming experience with the i915 driver able to run many more games with Proton. Mesa 24.0 isn't due until early 2024, with Mesa 23.3 due this month.</p>
<p>Eventually too when the newer Xe driver (more on that <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/gpu/rfc/xe.html" target="_blank">here</a>) is fully upstreamed, Intel GPU gaming on Linux might be even better with a properly modern system.</p>

      <title>Open source NVIDIA Vulkan driver NVK hits Vulkan 1.0 conformance</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A big step for the in-development open source NVIDIA Vulkan driver NVK, as Collabora have announced how it's hit Vulkan 1.0 conformance. <em>Side-note: This is not coming from NVIDIA directly but people working on Mesa drivers.</em></p>
<p>What does this mean? As explained by developer Faith Ekstrand on the Collabora <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/nvk-reaches-vulkan-conformance.html" target="_blank">blog</a>: "Practically, it means that we can pass the entire Vulkan conformance test suite. From the Khronos perspective, it means that NVK now meets the bar required to claim to support the Vulkan API officially. (There are some legal implications to this which matter to the Mesa project, but most users don't care about them.) From the perspective of users, it means the driver should pretty much work on Turing and later GPUs. There will still be bugs, of course, but those bugs are likely to be app-specific. Most stuff should just work."</p>
<p>This is after <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/24998" target="_blank">merging</a> in their new back-end compiler which was required but there's still a lot of work ahead. As Ekstrand goes on to explain heading into 2024 they're actually not far off being able to advertise Vulkan 1.3 but they need to do plenty of compiler work to get there. Plus there's others working on getting Maxwell GPUs supported and once the compiler is a little more "feature-complete" they can then start "taking deep dives into apps, working on app-specific bug fixing as well as performance improvements".</p>
<p>Still experimental but it seems like open source NVIDIA drivers will get quite exciting through next year.</p>

<p>Set in the dead and decaying Aperture facility the developers say it will present you with over 40 new puzzles, and they will use mechanics "not seen in Portal 2". How difficult will it be? They say "Portal: Revolutions puzzle difficulty starts where Portal 2 stops" but the new mechanics will be taught as you go along like any good puzzle game does. You can expect somewhere around 5-7 hours playtime.</p>

<p>How was it made? They said it's using a "modified version of Portal 2: Community Edition's engine, which is a custom version of the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Source Engine branch using licensed source code provided by Valve Software" which has allowed them to expand it and provide mechanics and various game engine improvements that weren't possible in the original Portal 2.</p>

      <title>Point and click adventure Zarathustra uses AI Art and AI Voices </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this is sure to be an interesting one and will no doubt spark up some comments - Zarathustra is an in-development point and click adventure that looks intriguing but the way it's made will raise some eyebrows.</p>
<p>I have to admit…it <em>does</em> look pretty good <em>but</em> it's made with AI tools. Which in many ways, opens a big can of worms. Not just AI giving a <em>bit</em> of a hand, but a <em>lot</em> of it was done thanks to AI. The developer, Tim Rachor, doesn't hide it either and states it clearly on the itch.io page that "Most of the Art was created with Dall E 3 and the voice over comes from <a href="https://elevenlabs.io/" target="_blank">https://elevenlabs.io/</a>".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="emRBKiafJyw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d01dc1a555bbd47b2c9b643235913364.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/emRBKiafJyw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer said only the first day in-game is available, and they will continue it if people show interest for them to carry it on. They say it's a "rather casual experience with no dead-ends or overly difficult puzzles".</p>
<p>Find it on <a href="https://tim-rachor.itch.io/zarathustra" target="_blank">the itch.io page</a>.</p>
<p>What do you think to this one?</p>

      <title>Hunt: Showdown is broken on Steam Deck / Linux due to Easy Anti-Cheat</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 20/11/23 14:33 UTC</strong> — Crytek responded to note: "This is a known issue and we are working on it to fix it and apply the fix for the resolution as soon as possible."</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article text below:</em></p>
<p>Hunt: Showdown, a popular multiplayer game has been broken on Steam Deck / desktop Linux due to Easy Anti-Cheat.</p>
<p>It seems an update released on November 16th just causes players to get kicked from the game. A similar issue to what happened <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/over-a-week-later-apex-legends-is-still-broken-on-linux-steam-deck/" target="_blank">with Apex Legends recently</a>. I've yet to see Crytek comment on this, so I have reached out today see if they're aware and if it will be fixed. The game is currently rated Steam Deck Playable so either they need to fix it, or Valve will need to change the rating over to Unsupported.</p>
<p>Trying it myself today and it's clearly broken (screenshot from Steam Deck):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18365912251700484668gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18365912251700484668gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Hopefully given the popularity of the Steam Deck, and with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/steam-deck-oled-is-just-pure-joy-the-definitive-steam-deck/" target="_blank">new Steam Deck OLED</a> release, more developers will actually test instead of just pushing out updates like this that break it.</p>

      <title>Heroes of Might and Magic II game engine fheroes2 v1.0.10 released</title>
      <author>fheroes2</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dear supporters of the fheroes2 project and Heroes of Might and Magic 2 players! After a month of tedious work, we are presenting a new version of the fheroes2 engine - <a href="https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2/releases/tag/1.0.10" target="_blank"><strong>1.0.10</strong></a>. As always today's release is full of compelling features and code changes.<br/>
<br/>
The editor being the highest priority at the moment is evolving. Our team added an <strong>enhanced erase tool</strong>, the ability to put artifacts and treasures on the adventure map and also did important groundwork towards expanding the game with new future heroes. The current state of the editor is still not ready to be open to the public, but this is planned to be changed in the very near future.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4793549741700481834gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4793549741700481834gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>We made a lot of changes in relation to rendering and the overall UI of the engine in this release. A lot of small rendering issues were fixed, several dialogs were reworked and we were able to speed up graphics-related code as well. Speaking of UI, the team added a <strong>new hero action icon</strong> to separate situations, when a hero stands on an action object and when he needs to travel to another place.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12668965191700481849gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12668965191700481849gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Additionally, we updated the town portal dialog to make it resizable in relation to game resolution and the number of available towns.</p>

<p>The AI in this release received a huge boost in its logic: now it <strong>can use marketplace</strong> to speed up the castle’s development. Important to note, that the AI does not cheat and uses the same exchange rate as human players. The team improved the AI decision-making logic during battles regarding pathfinding and spell evaluation. This makes AI more competitive on higher difficulties.<br/>
<br/>
As in every release before the team updated multiple language translations and fixed dozens of small UI and logic issues, totaling<strong> </strong>more than 30 issues being closed.<br/>
<br/>
An important update: save files that are created by the engine older than 1.0.5 are not supported anymore. This is done to proceed with the Editor development by removing a lot of "hacks" for old saves. If you have save files older than 1.0.5 and want to play them, use 1.0.9 version to open and save these files. The engine will resave files in 1.0.9 format.</p>

      <title>Half-Life 25th Anniversary Update brings Half-Life: Uplink, Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Something many guessed was coming, Valve has released the Half-Life 25th Anniversary Update and it's pretty exciting with lots of goodies.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/3843320743741606906" target="_blank">announcement</a> it mentions updated graphics settings including lighting fixes and an actual widescreen field of view, Controller and Steam Networking support and Steam Deck support with it now officially Steam Deck Verified!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7586694111700245939gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7586694111700245939gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Half-Life: Uplink on Linux</em></p>
<p>Not just that though they've added in content from Half-Life: Uplink, four new multiplayer maps, and there's restored content for "the true nostalgia-seekers, including original main menu artwork and some early prototype player models from the alpha builds of the game".</p>
<p>On top of that there's in a documentary to mark the occasion from folks at <a href="https://www.secrettape.video/" target="_blank">Secret Tape</a> (known for their work as NoClip Media):</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="TbZ3HzvFEto"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3ec9367da68d1023a0da84c235fa7e3e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/TbZ3HzvFEto" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The older version of Half-Life is now in a Beta branch named "steam_legacy", and they're now considering this the definitive version of Half-Life and the one they will "continue to support going forward". So Half-Life: Source is getting reduced visibility (store page will be hidden) but it will remain available for the Source engine community.</p>
<p>Grab it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/70/HalfLife/" target="_blank">free until November 25th on Steam</a> and see the <a href="https://half-life.com/en/halflife25/" target="_blank">special page here</a>.</p>

      <title>Inventory Tetris with roguelike exploration and combat Backpack Hero is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just released out of Early Access is Backpack Hero, an intoxicating mixture of backpack sorting that feels like a Tetris shapes sorting-puzzle game with roguelike turn-based combat and exploration that's a thoroughly odd but terribly fun blend.</p>
<p>A game that became pretty popular thanks to the web-based demo on itch.io. The full release is much expanded with a lot more content and features like the addition of rebuilding a town. Really clever idea too, although not the first to do it, but the setting and the way it handles the items and your growing backpack size is thoroughly charming.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4sOIlao40W8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/95496321fac2f216972cc7ca996d0ea8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4sOIlao40W8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experiment with your strategy and create game-breaking solutions.</li>
<li>Collect 800+ distinct items, with ingenious powers and synergies to harness.</li>
<li>Battle with over 100+ enemies. Learn their attack patterns and vanquish your foes.</li>
<li>Dive into the endless dungeons! Start every run with randomly generated levels and discover unpredictable items, unique layouts, events, and challenges.</li>
<li>Explore 5 unique play styles by selecting different heroes.</li>
<li>Play standalone runs or experience the full adventure and meta progression in Story Mode.</li>
<li>Rebuild Haversack Hill and help its inhabitants.</li>
<li>Turn the village into an appealing and efficient hamlet to attract new residents. Buy and sell items, conduct research, and unlock heroes, challenges, and quests.</li>
</ul>
<p>It has Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified. I've been playing it on the Steam Deck and it's an absolute joy. Needing to constantly swap around items with others, and re-position them to get the best placement to have all the items effects stack-up on other items in your backpack — it's a game that mixes puzzling and constant strategy. Really, really great stuff and a total joy to play.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/backpack_hero" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://thejaspel.itch.io/backpack-hero" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1970580/Backpack_Hero/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Narrative-focused expansion Astral Planes released for Stellaris</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It might be time for my next 100 hour run in Stellaris with the narrative-focused and exciting sounding Astral Planes expansion, along with a free update now available.</p>
<p>First up the free 3.10 "Pyxis" patch brings Leader Consolidation, merging together the likes of Admirals and Generals have been merged into the Commander, the Military leader class. Plus, Governors and some Envoy functions have been merged into Officials, the Administrative leader class. On top of that all leaders can now govern planets which opens up new ways to play. Plus various other improvements across the game like new planet modifiers, new planetary decisions and lots of balancing improvements and bug fixes.</p>
<p>As for Astral Planes the release trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="O544CkFV5ck"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/320f3832a180dc74c072857600e7b43d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/O544CkFV5ck" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"For the first time in Stellaris, navigate in widely branching narratives through a dedicated interface, specifically designed to maximize the effects of player choice. The Astral Planes are full of surprises, and hard choices will be necessary to reach your desired outcome. Make the right decision for your empire and chart a course that fits your play style."</p>
<p>Some of what's in the expansion includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added Astral Scars and Rifts
<ul>
<li>Added 30+ Rift Sites
<ul>
<li>Each site contains branching narratives, featuring multiple potential endings and a chance at powerful new rewards</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added Astral Thread Resource</li>
<li>Added Astral Harvesting and Rift Sphere Technologies</li>
<li>Added “Rift in Space” Situation and random Rift Situations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added 8 New Relics</li>
<li>Added 10 Astral Actions, plus 4 additional Astral Actions if you have the Overlord expansion</li>
<li>Added Riftworld Origin</li>
<li>Added 4 New Civics
<ul>
<li>Hyperspace Specialty</li>
<li>Dimensional Worship</li>
<li>Dark Consortium</li>
<li>Sovereign Guardianship</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added 3 New Music Tracks from Andreas Waldetoft</li>
<li>70+ New Event Pictures</li>
<li>80+ New Sound Effects</li>
<li>the formless...</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>On the surface it sounds awesome and looks really interesting. Then you go look at the Steam page, and see it's "Mostly Negative". The main complaint seems to be the pricing at €19.99 / $19.99 / £16.45 not matching up to what players feel the content is worth.</p>
<p>Stellaris is available from <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/stellaris?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/stellaris?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/281990/Stellaris/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Shake up an AI-controlled robotic world in Soul Tolerance releasing in December</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Chaosmonger Studio developer of ENCODYA and of the recently released Three Minutes To Eight, has announced the release date of Soul Tolerance as December 11th, 2023. Although, this is only Part 1.</p>
<p>The game, entirely created in voxel-art, is set in a society composed exclusively of robots, and controlled by the Divine Mother, a super AI-deity that rules the planet. The protagonist is Unit-12, a simple robo-detective coming hot off the assembly line, who will manage to twist his code and discover a mystery that will shake the roots of the A.I. controlled world.</p>
<p>They've decided to split it up into parts. From the developer: " We’ve been pretty busy here at Chaosmonger Studio. Just a few weeks ago we released Three Minutes To Eight and now we are announcing a new release! The truth is: Soul Tolerance has been ready for a while now, or, at least, its first chapter. We were thinking of releasing the full story we had in mind all together, but that would have required a few years. So, we decided to split the release into five chapters, each at a very fair price, also because we really feel the urge right now to start telling our story about A.I. and its philosophical implications, in perfect line with the times."</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In the mood for something a bit smaller and more bite-sized this weekend? Zipp's Café just released and looks nice and chilled. From developer The Wild Gentlemen who also made Chicken Police - Paint it RED!, and the upcoming Chicken Police: Into the HIVE! that takes place in the same world.</p>
<p>"Zipp H. Murphy is one raccoon that does not eat trash - on the contrary, his palate is one of excellent taste, and it shows since he is the owner, chef, and manager of Zipp’s Cafe, the most popular joint in Clawville. The cafe offers an oasis of peace in the midst of the chaos that is Clawville. It doesn’t matter if you are a cop, a criminal, or as is usually the case in Clawville, both; Zipp will always have a hot cup of coffee and a delicious plate of food waiting for you… as long as you have the money to pay for it.

      <title>SteamOS 3.5.5 rolls out to all Steam Deck owners, plus new Steam Client update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another big day for Steam Deck owners, as SteamOS 3.5 is finally here with lots of big additions. Plus, Valve also released a fresh Steam Client update.</p>
<p>SteamOS 3.5 is the update that brings official support for the new Steam Deck OLED, along with adjusting the default colour rendering for the Steam Deck LCD to emulate the sRGB color gamut giving warmer and more vibrant colours. Although you can change this any time in the new display settings:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18875014431700216826gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18875014431700216826gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You will also now have:</p>
<ul>
<li>HDR settings for external displays.</li>
<li>VRR can be enabled for external displays.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where certain workloads would exhibit severe CPU performance issues unless SMT was manually disabled.</li>
<li>Auto-mounting of external drives.</li>
<li>Improved Bluetooth connection stability, especially with multiple controllers.</li>
<li>Upgraded graphics drivers with lots of performance and compatibility improvements.</li>
<li>An updated Arch Linux package base.</li>
<li>Upgraded KDE Plasma desktop to 5.27.</li>
<li>+ lots and lots and lots more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Full SteamOS 3.5.5 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/5484882897552407488" target="_blank">changelog here</a>.</p>
<p>As for the Steam Client update that pulls in some recent additions from various Beta versions for both Desktop and Steam Deck. This <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/5484882897551382405" target="_blank">includes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This update has been re-released with the following fix:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed video freeze when streaming games with launchers when using NVIDIA hardware encoding.</li>
</ul>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow local game content transfers from a plugged-in Steam Deck to other Steam clients on the same LAN.</li>
<li>Fixed setting the correct AppID in Source SDK mod manager.</li>
<li>Visual tweaks to Steam Deck, Big Picture Mode and SteamVR: Many small changes throughout to make the user interface a more visually-rich experience in Home, Library and other areas.</li>
<li>Nicer layout for Soundtracks pages. These pages are now easier to navigate in Big Picture Mode and feature larger artwork on Desktop.</li>
<li>Fixed some layout and interaction bugs in the Media viewer.</li>
<li>Move the controller support information in the desktop client from the play bar to a widget in the right column</li>
<li>Add HDR badge to app details for games that are marked as having HDR output.</li>
<li>Fix bug preventing you from launching a game that had temporarily disabled auto-updates if new workshop content was available.</li>
<li>Additional information about controller support has been added to the client:
<ul>
<li>Game details pages in the library will now show information about specific controller and VR support in the right-hand column when devices are connected.</li>
<li>PlayStation controllers have a new default mode in Steam Input where Steam will route controllers to the game's built-in support if available and to Steam Input when they would be unsupported. These controllers can still be globally opted-in or out of Steam Input in the controller tab of the Steam settings page.</li>
<li>The landing page of the controller configurator now has controller support information, and it has been made easier to quickly opt in or out of Steam Input for a particular game.</li>
<li>In the Big Picture library there is now Xbox/DualShock/DualSense support tabs similar to the "Great on Deck" tab that are populated based on your connected devices.</li>
<li>DualShock, DualSense, and Steam Input API support have been added to the available filters in the library.</li>
<li>Games that require controllers (no mouse/keyboard support), require a VR Headset, or support both VR and standard game modes will now show that information in the client, similar to how it displayed in the store.</li>
<li>Footer icons for DualSense controllers in Big Picture have been updated to use the black and white style on the device.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Remote Play</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed hidden mouse cursor when streaming to Android TV.</li>
<li>Fixed stream lockup when using Intel iGPU hardware encoding.</li>
</ul>
<p>Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve look of configurator when there are no controllers connected.</li>
<li>In games that support SteamInput API Actions we no longer hide the Flick Stick as Mouse option if a FlickStick action is defined - this is so that Gyro To Mouse can be properly complemented if you wish.</li>
<li>Fixed the ROG Pugio II mouse showing up as a controller.</li>
<li>Fix: Gyro Joystick mode: Core gyro quaternion is updated even when the app requesting it is not focused.</li>
<li>Fixes to both Gyro as Joystick Modes: Min/Max remapping was not allowing values to become zero when gyro values were less than minimum required joystick output values.</li>
<li>Gyro to Joystick (Deflection) mode uses sensor fusion controller accelerometer rather than quaternion for more consistent behavior. This should address issues where the X output would become canted in the legacy modes. Note: it may feel subtly different. Feedback welcome.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam Deck OLED is just pure joy - the definitive Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Steam Deck OLED releases officially from Valve today, bringing with it numerous improvements to my favourite Linux-powered gaming handheld and here's my initial thoughts on spending some time with it. I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/steam-deck-initial-review/" target="_blank">originally reviewed the LCD Steam Deck back at release</a> since Valve sent over a review unit and they did the same for the Steam Deck OLED.</p>

<p>Plus there's a Limited Edition Steam Deck OLED with different exclusive colours for the 1TB model but that is only available in the USA / Canada and it's in limited quantities. For the release Valve said they are limiting the Steam Deck OLED purchases to one per customer per week, but this will be relaxed when they are confident they can meet the demand.</p>
<p>While it's refresh of the existing Steam Deck, it really is quite a <em>different</em> beast. Looks wise though, it's pretty much the same at first glance with the same shell size apart from the new <em>slightly</em> bigger thumbstick design, and a new coloured power button that's a little higher. The new thumbsticks are <em>much</em> nicer though and more concave than the older design, so they're easier to keep your thumbs actually on them. Funny how even the smallest of tweaks makes the Steam Deck OLED so much nicer to actually play games on directly as it really does make a big difference. Even without using HDR, the Steam Deck OLED screen is just far superior in standard games.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/869697361700157296gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/869697361700157296gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Steam Deck 1TB OLED top, 512GB LCD bottom. Look at the colours and the power / battery time. Click to enlarge.</em></p>
<p>Looks are very much deceiving overall here though, because once you turn it on and start using it — clearly this is <em>not</em> the Steam Deck I've come to know and love. It's just better. That display is just…gosh, the difference between it and the LCD is completely ridiculous. It's brighter, it's clearer, the colours are better and it's slightly bigger too and with it going up to 90Hz it's pure joy to play with. HDR support is working well, although there's not a whole lot to test with and finding them isn't actually that easy but Valve did just recently add HDR Support notices into the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/steamos-353-preview-fixes-lcd-issues-plus-steam-deck-desktop-beta-adds-hdr-info/" target="_blank">previous Steam Beta update</a> and hopefully soon a proper category on the Steam Store to make finding them easier again. From the picture above showing Ori and the Will of the Wisps, with both on max brightness and the OLED with HDR it should be clear enough how much richer the colours are. Not just that, but so much more battery time!</p>
<p>Since it's the same shell, the vast majority of existing accessories will still fit as well, which I did <a href="https://youtu.be/v-tFH1kO-BM" target="_blank">a short demo on in a recent video</a> showing the Deckmate, dbrand Killswitch and the JSAUX Modcase. So you won't have to go out and buy a whole bunch of new kit to go with it, which is really great. Not <em>everything</em> though. Some screen protectors won't fit if they didn't cover the entire screen area including the bezels, and with the thumbsticks tweaked design that's just slightly bigger so most thumbstick covers likely won't fit either (my dbrand thumbstick covers didn't fit properly and easily pop-off).</p>
<p>There's improvements to some of the buttons as well too which is good to see. The Steam and Quick Access Menu buttons that were notoriously spongy and kind-of awful feeling on both my LCD models have been adjusted to give a nice muted click feeling. The Select and Menu buttons at the top of the unit also feel a bit more clicky too. Not an audible click though, just the click-feel.</p>
<p>Cooling is massively improved too. While I don't have thermal equipment and have to rely on touch, it's noticeably cooler where it counts. The biggest improvement is the fan though, something that was an issue on the original LCD model that was split between two different fans. Here, the fan is bigger and quieter than both of my LCD models (one of which has that annoying high-pitch noise). It's more like a gentle blowing sound that you would expect from something pumping out a lot of heat and with the Steam Deck audio turned up even to 50% - I simply can't hear the fan. Absolutely wonderful.</p>
<p>Charging speed was something I was keen to test as Valve said they "improved battery chemistry for faster charging, from 20% to 80% in as little as 45 minutes" — so that was put to the test in my own way. Bringing both an OLED and LCD down to 10% charge (where you get the on-screen warning) and then leaving them plugged in while turned on but completely idle, at 50% screen brightness on I saw:</p>
<ul>
<li>512GB LCD to 90%: 2 hours, 11 minutes.</li>
<li>1TB OLED to 90%: 1 hour, 28 minutes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most people of course will likely charge while the unit is asleep though, so of course I tested that too. Running the Steam Deck down until it gave the yellow on-screen 10% warning again up to the LED showing full charge:</p>
<ul>
<li>512GB LCD: 2 hours 31 minutes</li>
<li>1TB OLED: 1 hour 33 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p>So that's nearly a full hour faster to charge in sleep mode to a full charge. So yes, the OLED really will charge faster despite the bigger battery too thanks to their improvements. This is great news for people in a rush, or for people who keep leaving it on sleep and forgetting to charge it because that is surprisingly quick and I’m really happy with those results, Valve did a great job on the new battery for the Steam Deck OLED.</p>
<p>Actually in-game time though, how’s the battery life there (see my <a href="https://youtu.be/aWa8xNBPuro" target="_blank">latest OLED Q&amp;A video Part 2</a>!)? Testing with 50% brightness, 50% volume I picked Cyberpunk 2077 and DiRT Rally. DiRT Rally actually has a benchmark mode you can infinitely loop, making this a good test. For DiRT Rally on Medium settings at 60FPS the Steam Deck OLED model gave a good 2 hours extra battery life around 5 hours compared to 3 hours on the older Steam Deck LCD. The OLED was also <em>consistently</em> using <em>less</em> power at all the same settings.</p>
<p>How does this translate to other titles though? Testing Cyberpunk 2077, matching up all settings at 30FPS locked using the same save I saw similar results to DiRT Rally with less power being used. Using the Steam Deck graphics preset, it was giving a good solid extra hour battery life. So it went from around 1 hour 30 on the Steam Deck LCD up to 2 hours 30 on the Steam Deck OLED.</p>
<p>From other games I've tested like Elden Ring and various others including plenty of smaller indie games, the battery life is just clearly better. But not just that, there are some differences in the performance I've seen too. Every game so far has been at least a little bit noticeably smoother. Not overly surprising though, given the RAM speed bump from 5500 MT/s to 6400 MT/s, and since I've seen it run cooler and use less power while gaming as well, it's probably not hitting the limits the LCD is allowing the OLED performance to stay up top. It's not drastic though, we're talking a couple FPS and a little bit smoother frame-timing. I'll have more on that in future articles / videos.</p>
<p>For people who enjoy docking their Steam Deck, the Steam Deck OLED's ability to wake from Bluetooth with controllers is another really nice addition. With the release firmware update, I've tested this working with a latest-gen Xbox controller, and with a PlayStation 4 controller. A bit quirky though, as the Deck OLED blips back to life for a second or so on Sleep at times and then fully sleeps. So as always, a few little niggling issues for Valve still to sort but it does work. Now when I want to play docked on my sofa with my 4K TV, I can just flop onto my sofa, gab my controller and jump back into whatever game I told it to go to sleep with.</p>
<p>Since we've seen that Valve constantly upgrade all the software from the Steam Client to SteamOS itself (that they sometimes decide to call Steam Deck OS), we know it's only going to keep getting better for both the LCD and OLED and I can't wait to see what else they have cooking. Plus, with it being more repairable than before due to the internal redesign and new case screws, it's going to have a long healthy life. While I aimed to talk about various bits here, there's plenty of things I've missed and this should <em>not</em> be considered a final review by any means since Valve do change things quite often (and I've had a lot less time with the OLED to review compared with the LCD at release). So be sure to follow the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/Steam_Deck/" target="_blank">Steam Deck tag</a> for all the incoming news.</p>
<p>If you were previously considering buying a Steam Deck - I can't see a reason not to just finally go for it. For people who already have a Steam Deck, it's still a very impressive upgrade when taking the sum of all the improvements together from the <em>massively</em> improved screen to the healthy battery life boost.</p>
<p>Overall and simply put: I cannot imagine going back to the LCD model after toying with the Steam Deck OLED. It's better in pretty much every way aside from a big performance bump that we can expect from an eventual Steam Deck 2. It's a thing of beauty and my new constant companion. It may not be a next-generation thing but at this point it's close enough.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It has Native Linux support but there's currently no Steam Deck rating for it. The developer mentioned it works great but needs custom Steam Input configuration due to it lacking full controller support. Players on Steam have given it a Very Positive rating so looks like another quality indie release worth your time!</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/of_blades_and_tails" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1768780/Of_Blades__Tails/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Core Keeper 1.0 planned for Summer 2024, dev says it&#39;s had 2 million downloads</title>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Next on my list to complete once my current run through co-op Terraria is done with, Core Keeper is another wonderful mining sandbox adventure and the 1.0 release has now been set with a new content roadmap to Summer 2024.</p>
<p>The developers <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1621690/view/3731854745516089782" target="_blank">announced</a> the news on Tuesday, along with a planned console release. In the announcement the developer mentioned they've now hit 2 million downloads too, so it has been rather popular.</p>
<p>Currently on their roadmap they have a Year-End Update coming in December as a minor update, a Lunar Update is February 2024 that will have seasonal content and other minor additions, a Language Update in Spring 2024 as another minor update and then the Summer Update in (you guessed it) Summer 2024 as another minor update before the full 1.0 release but they also teased there's "more to come".</p>
