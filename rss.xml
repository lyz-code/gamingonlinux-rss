      <title>Steam Deck Verified round-up for early April 25 with new and upcoming games</title>

      <title>Neverwinter Nights 2 Enhanced Edition rated Steam Deck Verified - but still no official announcement that it exists</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While it still hasn't been announced yet, we've seen that Neverwinter Nights 2 Enhanced Edition exists thanks to SteamDB and now its rating has <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2738630/history/?changeid=28298036" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">improved</a> to be Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/neverwinter-nights-2-enhanced-edition-hasnt-been-announced-yet-but-it-just-got-a-steam-deck-playable-rating/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Over a week ago</a> it gained a Steam Deck Playable rating, so it appears recent hidden developments have enabled it to get re-tested by Valve ahead of an announcement to be Verified. <em>Nice to see for the upcoming game. </em></p>
<p>As a reminder: from what we do know it seems Aspyr Media are involved with it, thanks to their name clearly stated in the EULA notice. And we also know that Beamdog are <em><a href="https://x.com/BeamdogInc/status/1890121268034519371" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">not</a></em> involved with this one even though they did a bunch of previous Enhanced Editions for the original and other RPGs. We still know basically nothing <em>else</em> about it though for now. Hopefully an announcement will come soon.</p>
<p>Since it's Verified though, it should at the very least have good controller support and (hopefully) good performance.</p>

      <title>Run, jump and glide at blazing speed in Haste, the latest game from Landfall out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Originally called Haste: Broken Worlds and now just Haste, it's the latest game from Landfall (Content Warning, Totally Accurate Battle Simulator, Clustertruck) that ensures you gotta go fast.</p>
<p>A Sonic-like? Well, sort-of. It's a high-speed third-person running game, set in a collapsing universe. It's an odd one to describe really. You're racing through various zones as quickly as possible, trying to build up speed by landing as perfectly as possible to boost yourself constantly across the map. The demo was impressive and good fun and now it's available with Native Linux support and rated Steam Deck Playable by Valve.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="dHoXrWIawxY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0f652cf81173505d525539cc788e917e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/dHoXrWIawxY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Race through a variety of worlds, master your movement and use items and abilities to progress through each level before it falls apart around you. The game consists of ten Shards, each featuring a collection of procedurally generated levels that must be completed without fail to unlock the next. You’ll encounter challenges and characters on your journey, seeking answers about what lies behind the destruction, and how to escape it!</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Third-person high-speed running gameplay.</li>
<li>10 Shards, each featuring a collection of procedurally generated levels that must be completed without fail to advance to the next Shard.</li>
<li>90+ Items that let you customize your build for each attempt to clear a Shard.</li>
<li>A story to explore and a lovable cast of characters to befriend.</li>
<li>Spectacular biomes and 4 different bosses to discover.</li>
<li>4 abilities to master.</li>
<li>An unlockable endless mode.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The demo did have an issue where alt+tab would just close the game. It's not clear if that's been solved yet. So keep that in mind for the release.</p>

      <title>Earthquakes, cockroaches and broken bones didn&#39;t stop the Hungry Horrors demo releasing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sometimes developers put up blog posts talking about developing their game, but it's not every day you read about how they had to deal with earthquakes, cockroaches and broken bones. And yet, Clumsy Bear Studio still managed to get the Hungry Horrors demo out on Steam.</p>
<p>You can read all about what happened in <a href="https://clumsybearstudio.com/blog/post-008-launching-our-first-steam-demo.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">their blog post</a>, which makes for quite a read. Thankfully, they're okay. So we can all enjoy what they've clearly put a bit of blood, sweat and tears into. A game I was already quite interested in from testing an earlier build <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/feed-the-demons-dont-fight-them-in-the-deckbuilder-hungry-horrors/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in February</a>.</p>
<p>So what is it? Hungry Horrors is a culinary roguelite deckbuilder where you strategically cook and serve authentic traditional dishes to legendary monsters. Your deckbuilding skills and culinary decisions determine whether you successfully satisfy your monstrous guests or become their dinner. That's right. You don't fight the monsters, you cook for them. Your cards make up your dishes, just don't let them get too close.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2Qu3xZbn114"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7eff493a3dbf15b055d4c438649f5c88.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2Qu3xZbn114" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Feed, Don't Fight - Gameplay focused on matching dishes to monsters' preferences, replacing traditional combat.</li>
<li>Legendary Monsters - Encounter iconic folklore creatures such as Jenny Greenteeth, Dullahan, and Glaistig.</li>
<li>Traditional Dishes - Serve authentic regional recipes like Bara Brith and Cranachan.</li>
<li>Strategic Deckbuilding - Build your deck using dishes, spices, herbs, and utensils for strategic depth.</li>
<li>Pixel-Art &amp; Music - Enjoy vibrant pixel art visuals and original whimsical music composed exclusively for the game.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Really a unique spin on a deck-builder and definitely worth a go. Made with Godot it has Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Oddventure blends Alice in Wonderland and EarthBound now in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Like your RPGs a little on the weird side? Oddventure from developer Infamous Rabbit that's inspired by and blending a little Alice in Wonderland and EarthBound has finally entered Early Access. The game was crowdfunded on Kickstarter back in 2021, and the release arrives with Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Oddventure is a rollercoaster of emotions, blending bittersweet comedy with dark humor and an innovative combat system involving the mood of each character. You'll be unravelling hidden secrets, facing off against bizarre foes, and discovering just how deep the rabbit hole goes.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EvjjRWJx9zw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/359bb3dbd5e68da05423ffe9810b3630.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EvjjRWJx9zw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it: "Step into the twisted fairytale world of Oddventure, where every choice shapes a story like no other! Join Charlie, a rebellious and sharp-witted teen with a fiery temper and a streak of nihilism, as she embarks on a perilous quest to rescue her troublemaking brother, Bonzo. But the cursed kingdom of Luxia is no ordinary place, it’s riddled with eerie mysteries, unexpected consequences, and a darkness that lurks behind every fateful decision."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Battle Enemies – Classic turn-based combat with a twist; use the MOOD of each character! Every battle can have a different outcome.</li>
<li>Explore and Interact – Meet new people (or creatures). In this world, every character can be talked to and has something to say. Don't forget to check the objects surrounding your character, either.</li>
<li>Make Choices – Every decision matters. It’s up to the player to see how the story plays out and which of several endings they’ll come to face.</li>
<li>Solve Puzzles – Between battles, explore a world filled with cute and weird puzzles full of odd creatures.</li>
</ul>

<p>I actually supported this myself on Kickstarter, so I can't wait to dive in. My key only arrived recently though, so I haven't yet had time to play it other than checking the Linux version works.</p>

      <title>Everything to grab from Prime Gaming, April 4th edition for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's the up to date list of games available on Amazon Prime Gaming for April 4th, and what compatibility you can expect for Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck. An easy way to build up your gaming collection with these games coming as part of your Amazon Prime subscription.</p>
<p>I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"/> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play. Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now.</p>
<p>You can install games from Epic, GOG and Amazon easily via <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/heroic-games-launcher-2152-released-fixing-amazon-gog-and-epic-games-issues/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Heroic Games Launcher</a> with Prime giving you a code for each game for whatever store it's on. For any games that use anti-cheat be sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat compatibility page</a>.</p>
<p><em>The table is sorted by the End date with those ending soon at the top.</em></p>

<p>New since last covering includes: Mafia III: Definitive Edition (GOG), Gravity Circuit (Amazon), Paleo Pines (Amazon) and Clouds &amp; Sheep 2 (Amazon). I also forgot to actually put Let's Build a Zoo (Epic) in the table last week, so it's in there now. There's also Wolfenstein: The Old Blood and Minecraft Legends, but they're only for Xbox and the Microsoft Store which isn't usable in any way on Linux platforms.</p>
<p>Plenty more to come this month. I'll push out a new list each week as things change to keep you updated.</p>
<p>On top of all that you get access to various Cloud Games via Amazon Luna.</p>

      <title>Awesome auto-battler Mechabellum gets a free weekend, discount and update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>My absolute favourite auto-battler Mechabellum will have a Free Weekend starting later today, it's one you definitely have to try as the battles just look awesome.</p>
<p>It works perfectly on Desktop Linux with the latest Proton 9.0-4, and has been running great since release. To go with the Free Weekend it's also on a 20% discount, and they just added in a huge new unit to the game. The new unit is the Abyss, a huge aerial unit that fires off a massive sweeping laser (and might be my new favourite unit).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6076794101743757136gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6076794101743757136gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Mechabellum on Linux</em></p>
<p>This is also the start of Season 3, which runs through until July 3rd. Another major update is planned for May 22nd, which adds in another new unit — the single-target specialist unit Void Eye and an all-new Undo feature available across all game modes. Looking forward to that!</p>
<p>While I grew somewhat quickly bored of other auto-battling games, or they just died out (R.I.P Dota Underlords), Mechabellum feels like it's carved out something special here. The battles are just magic to watch unfold, with all the destruction. A great game for people who love strategy games but don't have hours and hours to put into them.</p>

<p>The developer also just recently teamed up with a new publisher, Dreamhaven, to help the developer continue to expand the game further.</p>
<p>Don't sleep on this one.</p>

      <title>Wildkeepers Rising blends survivor-like bullet-heavens with creature collection for lots of chaotic battles</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Available now in Early Access on Steam, Wildkeepers Rising is one of the latest to attempt to put a new spin on the popularity of whatever genre we're calling things like Vampire Survivors today. <em>Note: key provided by Evolve.</em></p>
<p>Bullet heaven? Survivor-likes? Auto-attacking roguelite? Heck, I don't know but I'm going to play all of them. Something about this genre just has me hooked. Probably because I have so little free "me" time, and they're always easy to get into for a quick run around.</p>
<p>Wildkeepers Rising is another quite unique entry here, and one that (at least initially) feels a whole lot more like you're playing a mini-RPG epic. There's an actual background story, and the starting setup acts much more like a game that's much bigger than the auto-attacking genre it's in. The style of it is fantastic too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8179969481743681877gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/8179969481743681877gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9536695731743681878gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9536695731743681878gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>While most games in this genre just sort-of throw you into the thick of it, and expect you to understand them already, this is thoroughly different. You get a short story cut-scene, and then actual dialogue between characters before it sends you off into the world. What's really quite unique about this one, and how it helps evolve the whole genre, is the creature collection side of it. Not only are you levelling up and picking various character buffs and abilities, but you'll also be customising various Guardian creatures as you go along too.</p>
<p>During a run you'll come across various little shrines, where you can summon a Guardian creature from a list. These creatures then follow you around dealing damage to all the creatures around you. They each have their own health, and super ability that you manually activate. They can get knocked out, and then have their own individual timer to come back to life.</p>
<p>Active abilities you gain from the level up system can be given to either you, or your Guardians, and you can swap them around at any time. The ability swapping is only a small thing really but this change feels genuinely different and interesting. It's not just the active abilities either, on level up you'll also be picking character buffs between you and your creatures, so there's a <em>lot</em> of room to customise each run through.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zEqR269udQ0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/64663edfdd463b67d8076bf449cde188.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zEqR269udQ0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developers said they only expect it to be in Early Access for "a few months" but they plan to add in new playable characters and Guardian creators to follow you, new environments, more enemy variety, more content for the story and so on. Definitely keen to see what this evolves into once it's properly complete. At least from my initial look, it has all the makings of another excellent game to add to your collection.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bullet Heaven </strong>| Shred thousands of monsters in bullet heaven runs.</li>
<li><strong>Creature Collector</strong> | Discover, tame, and train magical beasts.</li>
<li><strong>Runs &amp; Builds</strong> | Create team synergies with different Guardians.</li>
<li><strong>Roguelike Runs</strong> | Take runs with different Wildkeepers wielding different weapons.</li>
<li><strong>Progression</strong> | Unlock new Guardians and items and make them stronger between runs.</li>
<li><strong>RPG Elements</strong> | Discover a rich world of fantasy heroes and magical monsters.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Wildkeepers Rising works <em>great</em> on Desktop Linux with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a>.</p>
<p>I also tested it on Steam Deck (LCD model) but it's a bit problematic here. Their graphics settings are just odd. There's only a single setting "Quality" and anything below "Epic" in that drop-down results in a really blurry picture. Even with it set to "Epic" the picture quality is still a bit too blurry. Performance seems okay enough, but they've clearly got work to do to make it properly Steam Deck Playable.</p>
<p>Having a good time with this one. There's a whole lot of potential here, and even in the initial Early Access release there's a lot of fun to be had and a lot of charm to the style. I just hope they add in some proper progression into the game outside of the runs, and additionally once they add in a little more enemy variety it could be a must-have.</p>

      <title>Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed gets a couple of Steam Deck fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed was already rated Steam Deck Verified by Valve, it's nice to see developers still making improvements to it. The original game released back 2010 for the Wii, with this remake arriving in September 2024.</p>
<p>Seems it didn't sell as well as hoped by THQ Nordic, a subsidiary of Embracer Group. In Embracer's earning report from November 2024 they <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q2-july-september-2024-adjusted-ebit-amounted-to-sek-1207-million/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">said</a> "The most notable new release, Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, late in the quarter, was well received by players but initial digital sales were slower than expected". On Steam, it has less than a thousand user reviews but it does have a Very Positive rating.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">As for the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1522160/view/542227873190117637" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> the notes are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Excluded user settings from Steam Cloud saves; meaning Steam Deck and PC use separate user settings from now on.</li>
<li>Fixed initial start up resolution setting on Steam Deck.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm quite thankful for that first one. Games should simply not be storing any video settings at all in Steam Cloud saves. It makes it a real nuisance switching between systems like PC, Steam Deck and other handhelds. So it's good to see the issue solved.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uI5t2oXQSAg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6af285e589383d445996dcd86bffe949.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uI5t2oXQSAg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

      <title>Spilled! is a gorgeous and relaxing short game about cleaning up the ocean</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Spilled! is a thoroughly relaxing cute gem about driving a little boat and cleaning up the ocean, to bring life back to the planet. Playable on Linux and Steam Deck, it worked perfectly with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a>. Note: the developer sent me a key.</p>
<p>With you starting off in a tiny and slow little boat as you clean up more of the ocean you'll earn some coins to upgrade your engine, storage and your front bumper scoop to deal with all that plastic floating around. This is the kind of game where you can just happily zone-out from the world. It's so incredibly satisfying seeing each section come alive as you clean it up, a reminder that we have a beautiful world that we love to ruin.</p>
<p>A game designed for you to take your time and just take it all in. No pressure here at all, no timers, nothing you can do wrong. Just drive the boat and clean things up.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xYfb_orPMoM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/aef5de89e1ff2cdb7183213f0148d47b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xYfb_orPMoM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This is a rather short game at only an hour or so, but worth it for people who like sweet casual games with a good message to them. The developer is also giving a cut of the funding to Whale and Dolphin Conservation from every Steam purchase.</p>
<p>I just wish it was longer. It's a lovely game and worth taking a look at, it's just so peaceful. If the developer ever decides to expand it with a full bigger sequel or a big expansion DLC, I'll be first in line.</p>

      <title>Command &amp; Conquer - Combined Arms gets a major update with new missions, AI improvements and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Command &amp; Conquer - Combined Arms is a huge free RTS game based on OpenRA that includes Command &amp; Conquer and Red Alert action combined in one game with plenty of extras and enhancements.</p>
<p>It's easily one of my favourite OpenRA games, as a big fan of the classics growing up playing both Command &amp; Conquer and Red Alert. And thanks to EA making them free so long ago, you don't need anything extra to play Combined Arms — it's fully standalone.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3020683261743675845gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3020683261743675845gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5510907781743675847gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5510907781743675847gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Combined Arms 1.06</em></p>
<p>The developers of Combined Arms said about the new 1.06 release: "This update introduces intense new Soviet campaign missions, along with an additional mission for each existing campaign chapter. We've also implemented a smart transport unit system, making troop deployment faster and more efficient on the battlefield. These enhancements open up new tactical possibilities and customization options, taking your gameplay experience to the next level."</p>

      <title>PC port of Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Ship of Harkinian, gets a huge Randomizer upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ship of Harkinian is a free community-made PC port of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time from the Harbour Masters team. A massive Blair Alfa (9.0.0) release just went live with a Randomizer and other major new features.</p>

<p>The big part of the update is the Randomizer update, NTSC Support, a new modern menu and various other smaller improvements.</p>

      <title>Sonic Rumble is Steam Deck Verified ahead of release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Okay, now I'm excited. Sonic Rumble from SEGA is the first major multiplayer party game for the series and Valve have rated it Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Given that it's an online multiplayer game (up to 32 players), I was worried that anti-cheat would be problematic like it is for so many other games on Linux platforms. Thankfully, it seems this is not the case so players on Linux platforms like Steam Deck will be able to play. Valve tested it with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a>.</p>
<p>It does use Kernel Level Anti-Cheat called Uncheater noted on the Steam page, which seems to be some variant of XIGNCODE3. Sonic Rumble has been added to our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat compatibility page</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ckFLOcCsO_I"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8eecebaa6b0b749d7d0975838af30f17.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ckFLOcCsO_I" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>We don't yet know when the game will release though. SEGA said last month it will be sometime "this Spring" so that could be any date up until June 21st.</p>

      <title>SteamVR Beta 2.10.2 released with a Linux VR fix and a controller and physics improvement</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released SteamVR Beta 2.10.2 on April 2nd, and thankfully it includes a couple of fixes for Linux VR players.</p>
<p>Here's all the changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><strong>SteamVR:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved automatic throttling behavior. Reduces controller and physics jitter from throttling and prediction changes in response to performance variations.</li>
</ul>
<strong>OpenXR:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Better handling of non-pipelined applications. Reduces controller jitter for Unity OpenXR apps.</li>
<li>Remove XR_FB_foveation from the list of available extensions.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Linux:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed empty black window when starting SteamVR on Linux.</li>
<li>Added window icons to SteamVR windows on Linux.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see Valve remember that Linux exists for VR. We don't see SteamVR seeing many improvements for Linux very often. I'm still hoping whatever the new VR set from Valve turns out to be results in more VR improvements for Linux, if all the rumours and leaks of it using Linux are true.</p>

      <title>DELTARUNE chapters 1-4 release on Steam in June</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>UNDERTALE fans are pretty excited about this one! DELTARUNE from tobyfox is finally coming to Steam with chapters 1, 2, 3 and 4 on June 5th. The first 2 chapters have been available free for a while now and we're finally getting 2 more chapters with the Steam release.</p>
<p>There's also a new trailer with the announcement of it coming to the Nintendo Switch 2:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yDzgiGdekas"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/68a5be8e3468372eff6d263543189856.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yDzgiGdekas" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There will be one difference between the Switch 2 and PC release, as the developer explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As an effort to make the most of being a LAUNCH TITLE for the Nintendo Switch 2, I really wanted to try to do something special...</p>
<p>So, we made a very small SPECIAL ROOM which takes advantage of using MOUSE CONTROLS ON TWO CONTROLLERS AT ONCE, only possible on the Nintendo Switch 2!! You can see it in the trailer!!</p>
<p>But, don't worry! Even if you can't get your hands on a Nintendo Switch 2 right away, the other versions of the game also have THE SPECIAL ROOM, with a completely different control scheme! (To clarify, all non-Nintendo Switch 2 versions have the exact same content as each other.)</p>
<p>There is no meaningful difference in content amount, dialogue, setting, music etc between any version, so you will have a full package of fun no matter which you get! No one gets left out!</p>
<p>And -- just to clarify for the cats in the back -- no matter what version you buy, EVERYONE gets PLUEY -- for FREE!!!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For those who haven't played UNDERTALE, fear not, you don't need to have.</p>
<p>At release it will cost $24.99. You only have to buy it once, with additional chapters planned as free updates as confirmed in the recent <a href="https://toby.fangamer.com/newsletters/release-date/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">newsletter</a>.

      <title>Bullet hell dungeon crawler Enter the Gungeon 2 announced with a new 3D style</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dodge Roll and Devolver Digital announced Enter the Gungeon 2 today, teased during the Nintendo Switch 2 event and it's coming to Steam as well in 2026.</p>
<p>The first game is truly a blast to play through, so I'm definitely keen to see more on it. This new 3D style looks like it will make it seriously intense too, at least from the short teaser that was shown off.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Gg15MFGINWY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e63f5f18aaf312f715100ca59d06c6c2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Gg15MFGINWY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enter the Gungeon 2 is a reloaded, high-caliber sequel to the iconic bullet hell dungeon crawler, reinforced with a new 3D art style, new weapons and enemies, and expanded gameplay.</p>
<p>Battle through areas familiar and unknown as the ruined Gungeon reveals its secrets to those brave enough to enter. Discover, unlock, and master fantastic weaponry within its procedurally generated halls and destroy the legions of Gundead pouring forth from within. Charge into dynamic battles against devilishly cute enemies, previously confined to the 2D plane, and delight as they are knocked around, tossed into the air, and thrown deep into pits.</p>
<p>Choose from an expanding roster of Gungeoneers full of both familiar and new faces as you rescue and extract marooned heroes from the depths of the Gungeon. Become mighty through unexpected combinations of powerful passive items, explosive active items, blessings, curses, and your own mastery over an impressive armory of weapons.</p>
<p>And seek to understand why you find yourself under assault in the Gungeon once again...</p>

      <title>Hollow Knight: Silksong lives and it&#39;s releasing in 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is not a drill. Hollow Knight: Silksong is alive, thankfully, and it's even going to be releasing this year. On Nintendo Switch 2 that is at least.</p>
<p>Don't go expecting some big reveal here though, because this isn't it. During the Nintendo Switch 2 event today we were graced with just a few seconds of footage, which also clearly showed a 2025 release date. We're still waiting to see about an official announcement from Team Cherry directly on a release date for any other platform. At least for Hollow Knight fans though, the wait will soon be over in some form.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5198051341743611548gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5198051341743611548gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Hollow Knight: Silksong. Credit: Nintendo / Team Cherry</em></p>
<p>I'll be keeping a close eye out for any more news on it. Given the tiny slice we saw today though, it's likely Team Cherry aren't yet ready to divulge any more.</p>

      <title>Steam Desktop and Steam Deck stable update released with various fixes, plus tweaks to the download UI</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released and then rereleased a fresh stable update to the Steam Client for Desktop and Steam Deck with a whole bunch of fixes and improvements.</p>
<p>The initial launch came with some problems on both Desktop and Steam Deck. The rereleased update fixes a "display issue on game details page for games with queued updates" across both. But for Steam Deck, there were bigger problems with these two issues quickly getting solved:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed TDP and GPU clock performance settings not working.</li>
<li>Fixed crash loop at startup when Wifi Debug Mode setting is enabled.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As for the rest of the stable update this was specific for the Steam Deck:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>'Enable Steam Play for all other titles' is always enabled on SteamOS, updated the UI accordingly to stop showing a non functional toggle.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And all these apply across all supported systems:</p>
<blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed brief layout shift of elements (one or two frames) when navigating back to the library section.</li>
<li>Fixed Steam Client window focusing multiple times on startup.</li>
<li>Fixed Update News window being covered by Steam Client window at startup.</li>
<li>Fixed notifications displaying in wrong position in some games.</li>
<li>Fixed some instances where windows fail to render after display events.</li>
<li>Fixed game content switching from private beta to default branch in some cases</li>
<li>Fixed child accounts in a family getting additional playtime after switching to offline mode.</li>
<li>Fixed in-game friends sometimes not showing up in the "Friends Who Play" section of the game details page.</li>
<li>Improved accuracy of download progress and time estimates. Accuracy will improve over the course of more downloads.</li>
<li>Improved consistency and clarity of download/install/update UI:
	<ul>
<li>Byte counts, when displayed, refer to the number of bytes to download.</li>
<li>Progress bars and percentages, when displayed, refer to the total progress of the install/update, which includes work before, after, and during the download. The exception is the top (blue) progress bar on the downloads page, which shows the bytes downloaded.</li>
<li>Time remaining estimates refer to the total progress of the install/update. These estimates will be very rough at first but will become more accurate as Steam learns more about the performance of the user's network and disks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>Big Picture</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue that could allow the keyboard to cover the target text area when summoned from a game.</li>
</ul>
<strong>macOS</strong>
<ul>
<li>Added Steam Overlay support for games using HDR rendering.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Linux</strong>
<ul>
<li>Improved the download speed of Steam client updates.</li>
<li>No longer applying compatibility tool filtering to shortcuts.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare issue where non-steam Protons could get assigned an incorrect compatibility tool.</li>
<li>Fixed initial positioning of dropdown menus.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Remote Play</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed controller input when streaming S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</li>
<li>Fixed sending a Remote Play Together invite from a VR game streaming to a headset</li>
</ul>
<strong>Steam Input</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed crash when using DualSense controllers, related to gyro timestamp calculation.</li>
<li>Fixed adaptive trigger effects with the DualSense Edge controller.</li>
</ul>

<p>It may not be the most popular strategy game from Paradox Interactive and Paradox Development Studios, but they're still expanding it. Victoria 3 is getting a major expansion in June, with the Victoria 3: Expansion Pass 2 on Steam now.</p>
<p>Much like Paradox did with the recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/stellaris-4-0-phoenix-game-changing-update-due-may-5-with-the-biogenesis-expansion/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Season 09 Expansion Pass for Stellaris</a>, the new Victoria 3: Expansion Pass 2 arrives with a tiny cosmetic pack DLC available now and the rest comes later. I won't say Paradox are bending <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/steam-getting-proper-season-pass-support-with-clearer-guidelines-and-refunds-for-cancellations/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's newer rules around the updated Season Passes system</a>, which requires at least one DLC to be <em>released</em> with it, but twice in a row we've seen them put up a tiny cosmetic DLC like this. <em>Feels a bit cheeky and cheap just to get the pass up.</em></p>
<p>Anyway. The actual first proper DLC with Victoria 3: Charters of Commerce arrives June 17:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wm7PYewK828"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/aee02705802043263b8074843fe410e8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wm7PYewK828" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features of Victoria 3: Charters of Commerce include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Company Charters: grant charters to your nation’s companies to give them an advantage in the cutthroat game of international trade.
	<ul>
<li>Trade Charters let companies trade their manufactured goods on the world market</li>
<li>Investment Charters allow companies to establish regional headquarters and invest in foreign markets</li>
<li>Colony Charters make it possible for companies to govern colonial regions</li>
<li>Industry Charters give companies permission to expand their field of business into other types of production.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Monopolies: Encourage monopolistic industries in your country, whether it be a highly efficient but costly state monopoly, or a private company monopoly that crowds out competitors in the production of vital goods.</li>
<li>Diplomatic Treaties: Sign new types of diplomatic agreements, including imposing uneven trade deals and setting limits on colonization.</li>
<li>Prestige Goods: Let successful companies branch out into the production of high quality goods like champagne, establishing your unique cultural imprint on a good type and gaining an edge on your competitors.</li>
</ul>
<p>The full expansion pass will have:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Trade Ships Bonus Pack: Immediately available to all who purchase the Expansion Pass, this art pack adds three new on-map ship models that cross the trade lanes of the world.</li>
<li>Charters of Commerce Mechanics Pack: Use the power of trade and business to build stronger ties with friends or to bludgeon your rivals in this Mechanics Pack focused on the economic levers of power. Establish trade companies, manage monopolies and sign new types of treaties as you increase the wealth of your citizens at the expense of others.</li>
<li>National Awakening Immersion Pack: Explore the complex and dynamic history of the Balkans. Rising nationalist energies and a fading Ottoman Empire offer new opportunities for the Austrian Empire, as well as smaller regional powers, but these same nationalist energies may threaten the very foundation of the Habsburg regime.</li>
<li>Songs of the Homeland Music Pack: Expand your global empire to the accompaniment of new stirring songs to inspire national pride and celebrate the innovations of the modern age.</li>
<li>Iberian Twilight Immersion Pack: Revive the fortunes of the Spanish and Portuguese empires. Choose sides in the great political debates of the day and rebuild the global reach that once made your nation the marketplace of the world.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Luck be a Landlord dev&#39;s bullet heaven roguelite Maze Mice arrives May 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Maze Mice is the next game from the developer of the popular Luck be a Landlord, and it's going to chew through your skirting board into Early Access on May 2nd.</p>
<p>If I had to describe it, I would say it's like a blending of Vampire Survivors with Pac-Man, with a time-stop mechanic as time only moves when you move giving you a chance to plan your path ahead. The idea of it is genuinely interesting and I very much liked the demo, but I'll need to play a whole lot more of it to see what it has to offer.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uaFqfZt0O0s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c67516bd9602463c731680b60c134b69.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uaFqfZt0O0s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Developer TrampolineTales celebrated the announcement with a $10,000 donation to Indiana 501(c)3 nonprofit The <a href="https://www.thepipsqueakery.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Pipsqueakery</a>, a wildlife and small animal rescue &amp; sanctuary.</p>
<p>“The enthusiastic response from Luck be a Landlord fans following Maze Mice’s reveal has been so reassuring, so I’m happy to announce the Early Access release date,” said Dan DiIorio, lead developer and founder of TrampolineTales. “Having rescued two rabbits of my own, it means so much to be able to give back to The Pipsqueakery with my donation. I want to thank them for all they do to help rodents, rabbits, and other small animals out there! Remember: adopt, don’t shop!”</p>
<p>Maze Mice has Native Linux support. It will also be translated for English, French, Italian, German, Spanish - Spain, Danish, Portuguese - Brazil, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Spanish - Latin America, Traditional Chinese, Portuguese - Portugal, Turkish, Thai, and Arabic.</p>

      <title>Blendo Games announce full Steam Deck support for stealthy shooter Skin Deep</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Blendo Games who previously made Flotilla, Quadrilateral Cowboy, Thirty Flights of Loving and Atom Zombie Smasher have a brand new release coming on April 30 with Skin Deep. It will come with full Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>The developer made various previous games code <a href="https://github.com/blendogames?tab=repositories" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">open source</a> like Flotilla, Quadrilateral Cowboy and Thirty Flights of Loving. They're a big fan of open source, with Skin Deep using <a href="https://github.com/dhewm/dhewm3" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">dhewm</a>, a Doom 3 GPL source port.</p>
<p>What is Skin Deep? An immersive first-person shooter about sneaking, subverting, and sabotaging. You're outnumbered, outgunned, and apparently have no shoes. Here you work for some insurance corp, who freeze you and hide you on cargo ships to deal with space pirates. Sounds like fun!</p>
<p>On Steam, the developer put up a big <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/301280/view/529842339955345083" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> for their Steam Deck support. It has also been rated Steam Deck Verified by Valve. The game will have proper specific Steam Deck controller icons, Steam Cloud saving support and more.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 9-27 brings fixes for Ubisoft Connect, Epic Games, Wuthering Waves and Monster Hunter Wilds</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The community maintained compatibility layer for Windows games on Linux / Steam Deck, GE-Proton version 9-27 is out now with numerous fixes. <em>If you're confused on all the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">different Proton versions see our guide</a>. Also see our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-ge-proton-on-steam-deck-steamos-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">guide to installing GE-Proton</a>.</em></p>
<p>With this release there's a bunch of new change and additions to Protonfixes, their database of game-specific fixes that get applied to make gaming smoother including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixes added for standalone and egs versions of [Wuthering Waves] (thanks cybik).</li>
<li>Ubisoft connect fixes added for ghostrecon wildlands and rainbow six siege.</li>

<li>Fix added for PowerWash Adventure (thanks sonik2kk).</li>
<li>Fix added to shorten time taken for retrieving game_title in umu.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The original changelog noted "withering wayves", we've corrected it to Wuthering Waves. Additionally, while there's a fix noted for Rainbow Six Siege, it's not playable on Linux platforms due to the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat</a> situation.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16360687031743511297gol1.jpg"/><br/>

</ul>
<p>Patches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove now upstreamed microsoft flight sim 2024 patch.</li>
<li>Remove now upstreamed gta v enhanced patch.</li>
</ul>

      <title>The Last of Us Part II Remastered is Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What could be the biggest surprise of the year — The Last of Us Part II Remastered releases on Steam on April 3rd, and Valve just gave it the green Steam Deck Verified checkmark.</p>
<p>I was hoping it would at least be <em>playable</em> after all the issues with the PC port of the first game, which eventually did become a lot more playable on Steam Deck. Valve actually gave the first game a Steam Deck Verified rating <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/the-last-of-us-part-i-upgraded-and-now-steam-deck-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">around 3 months after the Steam release</a>.</p>
<p>However, it is worth noting how we've seen various issues with Valve's rating system, so this is very much a moment to take with a pinch of salt. Only recently Valve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/marvels-spider-man-2-has-lost-its-steam-deck-verified-rating/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">downgraded Spider-Man 2 from Verified to Playable</a> for example, and we had both Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced and Rainbow Six Siege <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/surprisingly-valve-rated-grand-theft-auto-v-enhanced-and-rainbow-six-siege-as-steam-deck-playable/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">suddenly go Steam Deck Playable and then back to Unsupported</a> and the list goes on.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/418788901743441321gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Steam Deck Verified, as shown on Steam.</em></p>
<p>Valve tested it with the latest Proton 9.0-4 (<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2531310/history/?changeid=28232666" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>) so you're good to go with it on Desktop Linux too when it releases. At least this is a good sign though, seeing Valve getting in more pre-release testing for major game releases, let's hope it deserves the rating. We did see <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/assassins-creed-shadows-out-now-steam-deck-verified-but-has-nvidia-problems-on-desktop-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Assassin's Creed Shadows working well at release</a> too so it's certainly possible.</p>

      <title>Monster Train 2 is Steam Deck Verified ahead of release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Great news for gamers on the go as Monster Train 2 from Shiny Shoe / Big Fan Games is Steam Deck Verified. It hasn't even released yet so Valve got in early for this one. Top news for Desktop Linux players too, since this means it should run without problems on your favourite distro as Valve tested it with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the latest Proton 9.0-4</a>.</p>
<p>Considering how big and popular the first game was, I'm excited to see this.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NrgUCBJbBlI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0a477015a557044d7b25787fe8ef4cf9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NrgUCBJbBlI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking in an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2742830/announcements/detail/519709240792712661" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam the developer was also clearly quite excited to reach this stage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s official. Monster Train 2 has been Steam Deck verified.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>“So what?”</strong> you say, “I’ve already been playing the Monster Train 2 demo on my Steam Deck for weeks!”<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, fair. But before today it wasn’t 100%-cerified, Valve-endorsed, Half-Life-3-confirmed, solid-gold <em>verified.</em><br/>
<br/>
So what does this mean?<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, it means that Monster Train 2 has the thumbs-up to perform well on your Steam Deck. The controls are going to function exactly like you’d expect. No fumbling around with a simulated mouse on the trackpad (although you can still do that if you want!). Text readability is going to be big, clear, and crisp. We could go on and on, but you know what to expect here.<br/>
<br/>
But the real power of Steam Deck Verification comes in the form of validation. A newfound sense of pride as you remind folks just how far the Monster Train 2 Steam Deck experience has come. Here’s a scenario: You’re sitting in traffic, playing Monster Train 2 on your Steam Deck. A police officer approaches your vehicle.<br/>
<br/>
“Excuse me, you can’t play Monster Train 2 while you’re driving”<br/>
<br/>
That’s where you’re wrong, pal. Because Monster Train 2 is <strong>STEAM DECK VERIFIED.</strong><br/>

You’re somehow years younger, back in school. Despite this nightmare scenario, you have your Steam Deck and a copy of Monster Train 2. As you attempt to escape into the zen-like deckbuilding of Monster Train 2, your teacher stops mid-lecture and tells you that you can’t play Monster Train 2 in class. This is <strong>INCORRECT.</strong> Why? Because Monster Train 2 is <strong>STEAM DECK VERIFIED.</strong><br/>
<br/>
There are thousands of reasons why being Steam Deck Verified is important, and it’s up to you to find them. Spread the news, dear reader - and share your own stories of Monster Train 2 Steam Deck Verification in the comments. For today your life has changed. Monster Train 2 is now Steam Deck verified.</p>

<p>There's currently no release date set for it. The demo is still live at time of writing.</p>

      <title>Rogue Kingdoms blends tower defense with Vampire Survivors action and will have full Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With an upgrade system that's a little inspired by the popularity of Vampire Survivors and all the games that followed, Rogue Kingdoms combines some interesting looking tower defense gameplay with direct hero control and roguelike elements.</p>
<p>The developer isn't shy on their inspiration either directly noting games like Vampire Survivors, Bloons TD6, Brotato, Kingdom Rush and others. They're just trying their hand at something that combines their favourites into a new game.</p>
<p>Here you control the hero movement to run around and build towers but you <em>also</em> attack directly. Your main weapon is automatic if you're in range, but then you do also get some manual skills and other boosts that you pick when you level up. The point is to play it again and again to try it all sorts of different hero combinations.</p>
<p>The game will have 54 unique towers, procedurally generated maps, hundreds of special relics, skills and other upgrades.</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Writing in a Steam <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2690870/announcements/detail/509576141634274765" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> the developer said about Steam Deck support:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Great news! Rogue Kingdoms now fully supports controllers and runs perfectly on Steam Deck.<br/>
<br/>
No complicated setups—just install and play. We genuinely think playing with a gamepad or Steam Deck is the best way to enjoy Rogue Kingdoms.<br/>
<br/>
Here's what's included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full Input Compatibility: The Steam Deck’s controls work perfectly right out of the box.</li>
<li>Optimized and Rebindable Controls: Controls feel smooth and responsive. Move the hero with one stick and your skills with the other—or swap them around. Customize controls to your preference!</li>
<li>Docked Mode Ready: Want to play on a bigger screen? Easily connect a Bluetooth controller or keyboard to play docked.</li>
<li>Clear, Easy-to-Read UI: Text and icons are designed specifically for the Steam Deck’s screen—no squinting needed.</li>
<li>Long Battery Life: Game optimized to help your battery last longer.</li>
<li>Smooth Performance: Enjoy stable, smooth gameplay at all times.</li>
<li>Steam Cloud Saves: Switch effortlessly between PC and Steam Deck without losing progress.</li>
<li>Native Compatibility: Runs perfectly on Steam Deck’s Linux system. Zero adjustments required.</li>
<li>Quick Resume: Pause anytime and instantly resume gameplay without any issues or crashes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a demo on Steam but that only has a Windows version, which at least worked just fine with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a> on my Kubuntu Linux desktop. It's not clear if the above "Native Compatibility" meant it will get a Native Linux version or not, or if it just works with Proton.</p>

      <title>Critter Cove gets a major performance update - should work better on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Critter Cove is an open world life sim and town building game set in a cozy post-apocalyptic paradise. It's currently in Early Access and a recent update brings a big performance improvement to it.</p>
<p>The game currently has an Overwhelmingly Positive user rating on Steam, and Valve rated it Steam Deck Playable as it currently has small text and some potential controller icon issues. Apart from that, seems you're good to go.</p>
<p>On March 26th the developer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1631470/view/511827941447958584" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Improvements to reduce hiccups, lag and stutters. Found a number of issues that were causing the CPU to block temporarily. You should now see a more consistent frame rate especially while moving around the world and lower cpu consumption. Steamdeck and lower end systems will notice the biggest change but improvements should be noticed on all systems. General improvement to frame rate as well.<br/>
<br/>
Will continue to look for bottlenecks and improve them in future releases.<br/>
<br/>
Fixed issue where if the player goes out of bounds or sometimes drowns the game would send them back to a point they had last surfaced but at the bottom of the ocean versus the top.</p>

<p>Great to see more developers optimising their games like this. The Steam Deck really gives developers a good device to test against for improving their performance. I hope over time more developers will do this.</p>

      <title>ProtonUp-Qt v2.12 brings a new Steam Deck theme and support for Proton-CachyOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ProtonUp-Qt is a tool to add extra compatibility tools on Linux / Steam Deck like GE-Proton. A new release out now with version 2.12.</p>
<p>One of those essential tools to get the most out of gaming on Linux platforms. It allows you to easily install various versions of GE-Proton for expanded Windows game compatibility across Steam, Heroic Games Launcher and Lutris along with other tools like Luxtorpeda for Native Linux builds of games, Boxtron for DOSBox and more.</p>
<p>The main highlights are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added the Proton-CachyOS compatibility tool <a href="https://github.com/DavidoTek/ProtonUp-Qt/pull/486" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#486</a>.</li>
<li>Added a new theme for the Steam Deck <a href="https://github.com/DavidoTek/ProtonUp-Qt/pull/316" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#316</a>.</li>
<li>Added a new dialog for configuring GitHub and GitLab API access tokens <a href="https://github.com/DavidoTek/ProtonUp-Qt/pull/504" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#504</a>.</li>
<li>Removed Wine-GE in favour of GE-Proton and UMU for Lutris <a href="https://github.com/DavidoTek/ProtonUp-Qt/pull/496" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#496</a>.</li>
</ul>

<em>Pictured - ProtonUp-Qt with the Steam Deck theme</em></p>
<p>I wasn't aware until now that CachyOS had <a href="https://wiki.cachyos.org/configuration/gaming/#proton-cachyos" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">their own fork</a> of Proton, which has a number of modifications on top of Valve's official Proton just like GE-Proton does. Seems this release may have a bug with not detecting games on different Steam Library drives though, which worked fine in the previous release. I've <a href="https://github.com/DavidoTek/ProtonUp-Qt/issues/508" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reported it</a> so hopefully we can figure out why.</p>
<p>You can download it via <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/net.davidotek.pupgui2" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Flathub</a> (Discover on KDE Plasma / Steam Deck) or the AppImage.

      <title>KDE Plasma 6.3.4 fixes &#39;the most common Plasma crash&#39;, now down to zero very high priority bugs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Work on the KDE Plasma desktop sounds like it continues to go very well, with some really important bug fixes arriving to make the experience a lot nicer. My favourite Linux desktop environment and what powers the Desktop Mode on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>In the latest This Week in Plasma blog post, developer Nate Graham noted how the final very high priority bug has been solved. For Plasma 6.3.4 the "most common Plasma crash" is finally solved, which could happen "when unplugging screens, especially with a dock involved in the process somewhere".</p>
<p>With Valve shipping Plasma 6.2.5 in the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/steamos-3-7-0-preview-brings-the-beginnings-of-support-for-non-steam-deck-handhelds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.7 Preview</a>, perhaps they might want to get that bumped up again to improve the Steam Deck Desktop Mode some more since docking is a rather common thing to do.</p>
<p>The KDE developers also managed to solve some common KWin crashes, fixed a severe crash in Breeze-themed apps introduced in Plasma 6.3.3 and various other bug fixes. For the upcoming Plasma 6.4 release (due out in June) they've also added in a few new features too like notifications in the history popup retaining their interactive buttons, KWin's "Fade Desktop" virtual desktop switching effect now has a customizable duration and more.</p>
<p>Plasma 6.4 also has an improved display configuration page where the screen arrangement view is hidden when there's only one screen (makes sense), and a much more obvious screen chooser at the top to make it clear what screen is currently selected for configuration along with any connected but disabled screens.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2471733411743419951gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2471733411743419951gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some other bits for Plasma 6.4 that sound quite exciting:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Massively improved performance when making screen recordings in Spectacle using the VP9 video format, which is used by default.</li>
<li>Implemented support for the <code class="inline-code"><a href="https://wayland.app/protocols/fifo-v1" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">wp_fifo_v1</a></code> Wayland protocol.</li>
<li>Implemented support for the <a href="https://flatpak.github.io/xdg-desktop-portal/docs/doc-org.freedesktop.portal.Clipboard.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Clipboard Portal</a>.</li>
<li>Made KWin more resilient against the issue of windows moving to strange positions when changing the screen arrangement or number of screens.</li>
<li>Plasma's log output is pretty quiet now thanks to Christoph's hard work. Nonetheless, he continued that work to help get us to zero!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Linux support for Command &amp; Conquer Generals Zero Hour is coming along now it&#39;s open source</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now that the code for Command &amp; Conquer Generals (along with other classic RTS games from EA) <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/ea-just-open-sourced-command-conquer-red-alert-renegade-and-generals/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">is open source</a>, the community is working on getting it working natively on Linux without the need of Wine / Proton.</p>
<p>One of the forks on <a href="https://github.com/Fighter19/CnC_Generals_Zero_Hour" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, from Fighter19, is quite active on expanding and improving the game, and the developer of the Steam Play tool <a href="https://github.com/luxtorpeda-dev/luxtorpeda" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Luxtorpeda Dev</a> (d10sfan) has been helping fixing up and implementing Linux support for Command &amp; Conquer Generals (and Zero Hour). <em>It's all still a heavy work in progress.</em></p>
<p>What is Luxtorpeda? It's a Steam Play tool (like Proton) that allows you to run games on Steam via a Native Linux build if one exists for it. The point is it keeps it all inside Steam and gives you what is usually an updated game engine, like OpenMW for Morrowind and now Command &amp; Conquer Generals too. <em>You can check out my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/steam-deck-using-luxtorpeda-for-morrowind-warzone-2100-and-x-com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previous article about Luxtorpeda being used on Steam Deck</a> as an example.</em></p>
<p>The Luxtorpeda dev, d10sfan, let us know that while it's still work in progress the fork has been added to Luxtorpeda so now you can try Command &amp; Conquer Generals on Linux with this native code.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3159599341743417197gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3159599341743417197gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Command &amp; Conquer Generals Zero Hour on Linux</em></p>
<p>To play it you still need to own a copy of Command &amp; Conquer Generals.</p>
<p>You can use <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/net.davidotek.pupgui2" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonUp-Qt</a> to download Luxtorpeda, then set it was the compatibility tool for Command &amp; Conquer Generals Zero Hour on Steam in the Properties menu.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>Due to get an experimental build for you to test it early tomorrow, controller support is coming to Satisfactory along with a whole bunch of other big upgrades.</p>
<p>Finally, you'll be able to kick-back and relax with a gamepad in your hands while building some of the most ridiculous looking factories the universe has ever seen. Great news for Desktop and Steam Deck players alike.</p>
<p>There's some other big additions coming like a much expanded Photo Mode with a ton of new settings, Hypertubes are getting junctions and branches allowing you to quickly change where you're going, they're finally adding vertical splitters and mergers, priority mergers are in with three different levels of priority to tweak your production and they even added in conveyor-belt throughput displays.</p>
<p>Oh, and for all the building you're doing for belts and pipes, there's also a new curved building mode making corners easier than ever. And of course, straight pipes are a thing now too. <em>My favourite addition might be the new personal elevators though.</em></p>
<p>This was revealed in the 1.1 update video:</p>

<p>What a <em>huge</em> update! This is going to be awesome.</p>
<p>The game works <em>great</em> on Linux with Valve's Proton. Surprisingly, it does work quite well on Steam Deck too but the controls have been a bit of a nuisance so this 1.1 update should solve that!</p>

      <title>Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 has lost its Steam Deck Verified rating</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve's Steam Deck rating system is generally quite correct, but there are <em>clearly</em> some times when it isn't. Thankfully, Valve do go back over various games to re-test them and Marvel's Spider-Man 2 has been hit with a downgraded rating.</p>
<p>Originally, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/marvels-spider-man-2-is-now-steam-deck-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve rated it as Steam Deck Verified on February 20th</a>, nearly a month after it arrived on Steam. This surprised a lot of people, considering it had a lot of well-reported performance problems on Steam Deck requiring some manual effort to get it to a more acceptable (but still rough) level.</p>
<p>Seems Valve actually agree now a bit, as they've dropped it down to Steam Deck Playable, noting that it needs manual changes to the graphics settings to "perform well on Steam Deck". That's pretty debatable though, with the game still seeing various performance drops during gameplay and especially some cut-scenes are problematic.</p>

      <title>Cassette Beasts is getting a new companion character and story quest</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cassette Beasts from Bytten Studio has a fresh update announced for release on April 7th, bringing in a number of extras to the already fantastic and unique monster catcher.</p>
<p>The 1.8 Sunshine Update will bring with it a fan-favourite character Sunny as a new companion, complete with a story-line quest, a few new monsters, the ability to record wing skins, and a new paid cosmetic DLC that add additional wing skins. Check out the update trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="MfEy-5hpi6I"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0e8611d6477f7f90a1cf284f43aeba6f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/MfEy-5hpi6I" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On top of that the developers did another showcase event video going over more details about the update, along with a few other things that's worth a look if you're a big fan:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AJe9aRZCc3U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/892df3eb24d5c38e2628caf9c29b61b0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AJe9aRZCc3U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Cassette Beasts has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified. It currently has an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam. Probably one of the best monster catching styled games to be released in the last few years, really worth picking up.</p>

      <title>Historical strategy game Old World switches to Vulkan for Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mohawk Games continue releasing some pretty big updates to their Civilization like game Old World, with the latest aiming to fix up lots of issues and improve performance.</p>
<p>With the 1.0.76988 update, it should hopefully run better than ever on Linux Desktop and Steam Deck! Mentioned under the "Programming" heading in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/597180/view/502820289461092474" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release notes</a> they've now swapped over to the Vulkan API as the default for Linux / Steam Deck. The result should hopefully be a smoother game overall, especially in the busy late-game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18042106011743412267gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>On top of that there's been multiple other performance improvements, AI upgrades, new events and UI improvements. There's also quite a long list of bug fixes.</p>
<p>Old World has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Playable. Hopefully they'll work on getting it Verified. It currently has a Very Positive rating on Steam.</p>

      <title>Immortal Boy looks wild blending a little Undertale and OMORI together</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>IcarusDev is currently making Immortal Boy a 2.5D turn-based RPG of battles, puzzles and exploration - amid secrets and betrayal. It's a little of Undertale meets OMORI.</p>
<p>There's a whole lot of adventuring exploration here with lots of side missions where you engage with a "character-rich story with fleshed-out character arcs" and of course, plenty of mini-games too. Wrapped up in a slick chiptune soundtrack, and a little "Windows 98 Webcore" nostalgia thrown in too for some of the UI it certainly looks like an experience.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DxBkQzQ7W8U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7ce18f150a410c95f64e617016d79921.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DxBkQzQ7W8U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The Steam page explains a little more noting that the combat in it features a 4-member party system, with special ability that come at the cost of another character's health, mixed in with 3D bullet-hell styled platforming for the enemy turns. I've not really seen many that look like this.</p>
<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A group of 4 friends race against Tree monsters, Food creatures, Whacky snowmen, Sci-Fi computers, Gambling kings and who-knows-what to obtain a magical object that can grant anyone their Deepest Desire...</p>
<p>However, something tells you a certain friend isn't who they seem...</p>
<p>Spanning 9 Chapters (Kinda), Immortal Boy delves into the perspective of a Boy trapped in a psychological prison created by his own self-esteem and self-perception.</p>
<p>Delve into Themes of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insecurity</li>
<li>Emotional Manipulation</li>
<li>Emotional Attachment</li>
<li>Loneliness</li>
<li>Relationships</li>
<li>Characters being stupid for no reason in particular</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking to the developer over email, they confirmed it will have Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Free to play toy soldier Battle Royale game Mini Royale enters Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mini Royale from IndigoBlue is out now in Early Access and free to play, with Native Linux support and Easy Anti-Cheat enabled. Another shooter for you to try if you're missing some multiplayer fun on Linux platforms.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The initial release comes with both first and third-person options across multiple games modes includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Battle Royale:</strong> Engage in an action-packed free-for-all where you fight to be the last soldier or team standing. Traverse chaotic, larger-than-life environments, making every match a new adventure.</li>
<li><strong>Color Conquest:</strong> Take on three other teams in a nostalgic twist on classic toy soldier battles. Eliminate enemy players to convert them to your team’s color until only one color remains.</li>
<li><strong>Deathmatch:</strong> Enter tightly packed arenas like the inside of a pinball machine, a sandbox, or a moving box filled with toys. Prove yourself as the ultimate deathmatch champion.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Qd4kGADVIFY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2ec68f087b53545973d2c2d9d9e09203.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Qd4kGADVIFY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I've been playing it on and off since the early testing versions, and it does work quite well on Linux. Although the Steam Overlay doesn't seem to work with it. Other than that, no technical troubles encountered at least. Very much a back-to-basics Battle Royale here, although the movement system with a grapple hook is quite fun.</p>
<p>They've got a tough uphill battle with this one though. Launching any multiplayer game is always difficult, especially when you're a small indie team and when there's so many free to play online games out already so it could easily fail. At least being free to play they've given it the best possible chance for now. Who knows, perhaps the toy soldier style will be what wins people over. The skill floor is at least low with this one, as it's easy to get into to pick up and play and get some frags without being particularly good.</p>
<p>While it's free to play, they do plan to sell cosmetic items.</p>

<p>Since I like to live on the <em>wild</em> side, I decided to upgrade my system to Kubuntu 25.04 Beta today. After a bit of a woops with it entirely removing KDE, a quick TTY swap to reinstall kubuntu-desktop, then re-installing Flatpak and we're looking good.</p>

      <title>Everything to grab from Prime Gaming, March 28th edition for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's the up to date list of games available on Amazon Prime Gaming for March 28th, and what compatibility you can expect for Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck. An easy way to build up your gaming collection with these games coming as part of your Amazon Prime subscription.</p>
<p>I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"/> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play. Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now.</p>
<p>You can install games from Epic, GOG and Amazon easily via <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/heroic-games-launcher-2152-released-fixing-amazon-gog-and-epic-games-issues/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Heroic Games Launcher</a> with Prime giving you a code for each game for whatever store it's on. For any games that use anti-cheat be sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat compatibility page</a>.</p>

      <title>Starsector, one of the best space RPGs that&#39;s not on Steam had a huge update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Starsector (formerly "Starfarer") is still in development but it's been a seriously impressive game for years. Not yet on Steam or any other store, as you have to buy it direct, but don't let that stop you with a big update out now.</p>
<p>What exactly is it? Hard to pin it down specifically. It has a glorious mixture of open-world single-player exploration and space-combat, with RPG elements and economic simulation. It has some of the most interesting 2D space combat around, with seriously great ship designs.</p>
<p>Along with an update to Java 17, which they said should "substantially improve performance", there's also a whole bunch of major new features in Starsector version 0.98a including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Several new endgame-level enemies to fight in the Abyss.</li>
<li>New ships, weapons, and hullmods.</li>
<li>Codex UI revamp.</li>
<li>Autosave, revamped save/load UI.</li>
<li>Intel map markers and little notes.</li>
<li>Revamped combat simulator with many options and opponents.</li>
<li>Planet search UI revamp.</li>
<li>New story (not “main” story) missions.</li>
<li>New music.</li>
<li>New portraits and illustrations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Seems like Amazon are not ready to give up on their cloud gaming service Luna just yet, with it expanding into more countries and getting a big new deal going.</p>
<p>Amazon announced they've partnered with Electronic Arts (EA) for a multi-year deal. This brings the likes of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Dead Space to Luna+ subscribers with more on the way sometime soon. Some others mentioned to be coming include various EA Sports games but no dates other than "over the coming months".</p>
<p>Luna has also expanded its supported countries into Sweden, Portugal, Belgium and Luxembourg. Marking 14 countries that are now supported by the service.</p>
<p>If you have Amazon Prime, you can play various games free including Fortnite, Trackmania and a rotating monthly selection of games. You can also link your GOG and Ubisoft accounts to play certain games you already have.</p>
<p><a href="https://luna.amazon.co.uk/home" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Amazon Luna</a> is playable on Linux. Although the experience testing Fortnite with it today wasn't the best. The controls didn't feel great, but the visual quality was a lot better than the last time I tried it.</p>

      <title>Ubisoft launches new subsidiary for Assassin’s Creed and other big games with funding from Tencent</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ubisoft are attempting to turn around their fortunes, with the creation of a new subsidiary with funding help from Tencent. This new group will have full control over Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry and Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six.</p>
<p>Tencent will be investing €1.16 billion for a minority (25%) stake in the new subsidiary, with this subsidiary having a "focus on building game ecosystems designed to become truly evergreen and multi-platform" they say it will "drive further increases in quality of narrative solo experiences, expand multiplayer offerings with increased frequency of content release, introduce free-to-play touchpoints, and integrate more social features".</p>
<p>Ubisoft are valuing this new creation at about €4 billion which they said is "implying a FY23-FY25E average sales multiple of around 4x".</p>
<p>This new subsidiary includes all the teams developing Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six, Assassin’s Creed and Far Cry based in Montréal, Quebec, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia. This includes existing games plus any new games currently under development or planned. This subsidiary has a "worldwide, exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual license in respect of the intellectual property and similar proprietary rights owned or licensable by Ubisoft in relation to Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six, Assassin’s Creed and Far Cry in exchange for a royalty".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7513716991743156444gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“Today Ubisoft is opening a new chapter in its history,” said, Yves Guillemot, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer. “As we accelerate the company’s transformation, this is a foundational step in changing Ubisoft’s operating model that will enable us to be both agile and ambitious. We are focused on building strong game ecosystems designed to become evergreen, growing high-performing brands and creating new IPs powered by cutting-edge and emerging technologies.”</p>
<p>“With the creation of a dedicated subsidiary that will spearhead development for three of our largest franchises and the onboarding of Tencent as a minority investor, we are crystalizing the value of our assets, strengthening our balance sheet, and creating the best conditions for these franchises’ long-term growth and success. With its dedicated and autonomous leadership team, it will focus on transforming these three brands into unique ecosystems.”</p>
<p>Guillemot concluded, “We are committed to building a sharper, more focused organization-one where talented teams will take our brands to the next level, accelerate the growth of emerging franchises, and lead innovation in next-generation technologies and services, all with the goal of delivering enriching, memorable games that exceed players' expectations, and create superior value for our shareholders and other stakeholders.”</p>
<p>Martin Lau, President of Tencent, said “We are excited to extend our longstanding partnership with Ubisoft through this investment, which reflects our continued confidence in Ubisoft’s creative vision and exceptional talent to drive sustained success in the industry. We see the immense potential for these franchises to evolve into long-term evergreen game platforms and create engaging new experiences for gamers.”</p>

      <title>Fixing a Steam Deck OLED bug for the Linux kernel 6.14 release was a major challenge</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the Linux kernel 6.14 out now, I noted <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/linux-kernel-6-14-out-late-due-to-pure-incompetence-dont-get-too-excited-about-linux-gaming-boosts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">in my quick-look overview</a> about a bug that was fixed for the Steam Deck OLED model. Collabora have given a little more info on their work for this issue and how it was a challenge.</p>
<p>The problem? Sometimes when resuming from suspend, the Steam Deck OLED would enter a unrecoverable faulty state. Thankfully, a solution was found by developer Cristian Ciocaltea at Collabora.</p>
<p>Collabora put up a <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/kernel-614-enhances-hardware-capabilities-improved-performance.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> about some of their work that went into Linux kernel 6.14, with the Steam Deck OLED issue being noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Linux 6.14 aims to fix an audio breakage issue on the Valve Steam Deck OLED variant when the system resumes from suspend. It's worth noting the investigations raised major challenges, as the reproducible rate varied randomly, in some cases being necessary to go through hundreds of successful suspend/resume cycles. On top of that, it was virtually impossible to make efficient use of any kernel debugging techniques due to the annoying side effect of hiding the actual problem. Eventually, Cristian Ciocaltea managed to submit a patch series providing a new ACP quirk to address the issue, as well as a few additional improvements to the AMD Vangogh/ACP SOF drivers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Showing off the power of open source here, with multiple companies and groups involved in the development and as a result issues like this can be found and fixed to benefit a lot of people. Nice to see it get solved!</p>
<p>Currently, the Steam Deck (as of SteamOS 3.7 preview) uses Linux kernel 6.11. Even if Valve don't upgrade the SteamOS Linux kernel to 6.14 yet, they will likely cherry-pick the patch and back-port it to their current kernel version.</p>

      <title>Two classic Flash strategy games make a return in April with the Warfare Legacy Collection</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Warfare Legacy Collection bundles together two classic Flash strategy games Warfare 1917 and Warfare 1944, upgraded for modern computers and expanded for a Steam release on April 28th. Games I haven't heard of in a long time, with some fond memories attempting to beat them some 17 years or so ago.</p>
<p>The release date was just announced today with a new trailer, and the game built with Unity will also have Native Linux support, and at time of writing there's a demo you can try too. With this release they've also added in an all-new Battle of the Bulge campaign.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_B6mfpeYcjw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/df53bce5f187e437d4e9a92cfb976c7f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_B6mfpeYcjw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/stealthy-platformer-kiyo-in-need-of-linux-testers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">requesting Linux testers back in Early 2024</a>, the sneaky stealth platformer Kiyo has a new playtest on Steam for you to try with expanded Linux support. The style and lighting in this one really does look interesting.</p>
<p>One of their team emailed noting how they got "a bunch of really good feedback last year" thanks to our article on the two-person developed game with a custom game engine, and so they're back again. The new playtest on Steam has "more content, improved Linux support (Joypads work too via Steam Input) and this time the Steam Deck is also supported" according to the dev.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mADnyzF0XYw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a595df95fc9718d43c780f45b01c386b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mADnyzF0XYw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it (from Steam):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This game creates a special visual style, as it combines “2D ray tracing” pixel art with its neon-bright nightlife.</p>
<p>Immerse yourself in Rabbithole City and enjoy the vibe of a Japanese megalopolis mixed with the feeling of Blade Runner and Cyberpunk.</p>
<p>Visit sexy nightclubs, mansions, secret labs, arcade halls, industrial plants and many more locations in order to liberate all animals.</p>
<p>Whether you prefer a stealthy approach or want to slay all the enemies, the choice is yours.</p>
<p>Use different tools and time your sneaky moves perfectly to hide from all dangers or remove one bunny at a time from the shadows.</p>
<p>You can also unlock other members of the resistance group, take advantage of their different abilities, and find new ways to overcome the bunnies' oppression.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Semi-open overworld.</li>
<li>A complex story with a plot that addresses real social issues.</li>
<li>Stealth gameplay.</li>
<li>Specially composed synth-wave soundtrack and immersive audio design.</li>
<li>In-house engine.</li>
<li>Pole dancing.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Animated series ENA gets a video game with the free surreal adventure ENA: Dream BBQ</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'll admit I'm pretty uncultured apparently as seeing the release of ENA: Dream BBQ today led me down a bit of a rabbit hole about the ENA animated series. After watching what's available, I still have absolutely no idea what's going on. Perhaps it's just not my thing but apparently it is for a lot of people.</p>
<p>Now available with Native Linux support, ENA: Dream BBQ was announced multiple years ago (2021) with Chapter 1 now available. It's free but there's also an optional supporter pack DLC with some extra goodies. The Steam page doesn't exactly give much away about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first interactive adventure of the ENA series by Joel G.</p>
<p>Play as ENA as she searches for the Boss that everyone wants to be. Explore strange worlds, take on side gigs, and meet both sweet and sour characters along the journey.</p>
<p>There is a lot to encounter on your adventures:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Explore new environments</u> filled with hidden secrets and oddities.</li>
<li><u>Meet different characters</u> who only want you to do things for them.</li>
<li><u>Use strange Tools</u> to solve unusual problems.</li>
<li><u>Live the experience</u> of being the least popular person at any party.</li>
</ul>

<p>Posting in the <a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134573-patch-138087535-is-live/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">official forum</a> one of the developers said "Coming later this year, Watchers will be able to help us test a brand-new feature: Turn-Based Combat.

More details on how to participate will be shared in the near future, so keep an eye on our socials and in our discord."</p>

      <title>Retro sci-fi first-person shooter Viscerafest leaves Early Access in April with a huge update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fulqrum Publishing and developers Acid Man Games and Fire Plant Games have revealed that Viscerafest, their retro styled sci-fi shooter will see a full launch on April 14th. The game has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Playable.</p>
<p>The full 1.0 launch will feature a bunch of extra content for existing fans in Early Access. This includes a full new third chapter featuring 8 brand-new levels, 11 brand-new enemy types, a small bevy of brand-new mechanics, and several challenging boss fights. All of this leads to an epic conclusion of the love story at the heart of Viscerafest's story. The first two chapters will also get various improvements ranging from better texture work to new secrets and scripted sequences, revised dialogue with extra one-liners and more. There's also multiple all-new features like a shop system and gameplay modifiers coming.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kgvXQmQCMks"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a57cb3c784088bfe1f1f54a04036849d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kgvXQmQCMks" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Navigate hand-crafted levels stuffed to the brim with secrets, using key cards, completing puzzles, and accomplishing a variety of objectives to progress. All this is set in a vast array of locations, from a space station looming high above the Earth to realms shifting beyond our reality.</li>
<li>Wield 9 unique and powerful weapons, from staples of the genre like the "Bunker Buster," a double-barreled shotgun that fires explosive rounds, to the more unique and offbeat guns, such as the Plague Rifle.</li>
<li>Slaughter over 27 different Enemy Types and up to 7 Bosses, from the minor grunts who make up the U.S.C's forces to monsters beyond your ability to comprehend, such as the horrifying Maledict. New enemy types are introduced in almost every level, each compounding the challenges you'll face with a wide variety of attacks and behaviors.</li>
<li>Juggle your resources as you fight to stay alive, constantly balancing your use of ammo, health, and armor.</li>
<li>Move at the speed of light, chaining Bunny Hopping and Dashing together to move at speeds no man would dream of, and with your overbearing Air Control, dance around projectiles like no other.</li>
<li>Collect tons of goodies to unlock Gameplay Modifiers and Cheats to spice up your playthroughs, with such staples as "Viscerahot," where time slows as you Bunny Hop, or "Oops All Cultists," where your dreams of being torn apart by the hitscanning occult can be made a reality.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Some bits won't quite be finished though like the soundtrack and a number of other sound effects due to some of the team having issues as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAj2v5HLstI" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">detailed in a video</a>. Seems the publisher, Fulqrum, just won't budge on the release date.</p>

      <title>Monsterpatch is Pokemon meets Stardew Valley from the dev of Littlewood and Kindergarten</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Monsterpatch is the latest game from Sean Young developer of Littlewood and Kindergarten, blending together Pokemon and Stardew Valley with a little of their own Littlewood thrown in. <em>It will have Native Linux support like their previous games.</em></p>
<p>Much like Pokemon games, it will have two different editions, although both come with the game and you can swap between them. Each version offers up two unique stories with different antagonists, and you'll be able to trade your MoNs between the save files on each — sounds like a pretty clever hook.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DEXvmpBXBPc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/474e8f6e17c7d2369e1fa0d6374c4b92.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DEXvmpBXBPc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore a floating continent teeming with magical creatures known as MoNs. These creatures love battling alongside the wizards that catch and care for them.</li>
<li>Catch magical MoNs, learn powerful spells, and battle other wizards across the continent.</li>
<li>An Epic Adventure unfolds as you explore each route and city. Return to your town at any time to plant some crops, harvest some fruit, or relax with the MoNs you've caught! Maybe some NPCs will even move into your town!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The game is being <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seanyoung/monsterpatch-a-cozy-monster-collecting-rpg/description" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">crowdfunded on Kickstarter</a>, and it's been a huge success. With 29 days still left to go it's currently on over $68,000 against the original $15,000 goal. So it's currently going through special stretch-goals for extra content like interior decorating, an increased number of MoNs creatures, special shiny MoNs and more.</p>
<p>Definitely excited about this one!</p>
<p>You can also follow the developer on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/seanyoungsg.bsky.social" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>.</p>

      <title>Folkways DLC for the excellent village builder dotAGE released - here&#39;s a little interview with the developer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>dotAGE is a very unique turn-based village builder that blends in roguelike survival elements. It's one that you should definitely add to your list, and a new DLC expansion is out now so I took the chance to speak to the developer a bit.</p>
<p><em>It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified too!</em></p>
<p>Firstly, check out the original trailer to get a feel for it if you missed it previously:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="m4crJPLWC30"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4a98eac279529566d8d01ee41a4cef01.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/m4crJPLWC30" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The new DLC, Folkways, adds a whole lot more content into the game. Including Pipfolks that live outside your village, and give you a chance to get them to join you. They bring with them unique bonuses special food and promotion requirements, dedicated events, and dedicated buildings for dwelling and for production and much more.</p>
<p>And now for the chat with the developer…</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can you introduce yourself, and tell us how you got into game development?</strong></p>
<p>Hello! I'm Michele, indie dev from Bergamo, Italy. 38 years old, been gaming for 35 years straight. I am an automation engineer and hold a PhD in computer science from the Polytechnic of Milan, where I graduated with a thesis on serious games for physical rehabilitation of elderly patients. I've been working as a freelance game developer for ten years since then for various companies, especially focusing on gameplay and systems design and programming. In the meantime, I kept following my dream of making my own game in the little spare time I had, and after 9 years, dotAGE was released to popular acclaim in 2023 which allowed me to transition to being a full time indie dev!</p>
<p><strong>Q: Tell us a little about dotAGE and the new DLC?</strong></p>
<p>dotAGE is the merciless turn-based worker-placement roguelike survival village builder (wow) where you play as the prophetic elder of a village that fights against the apocalypse! It is a mix of genres with base mechanics heavily inspired by board games like Agricola and Stone Age, but paired with the progression and tension of roguelikes and ironmode XCOM (I like contrast, what can I say). The new DLC Folkways expands the world of dotAGE with plenty of wacky ideas and is fueled by the love of dotAGE's fans and geared towards them! It increases complexity and variation in the game, making it bigger, larger, more varied, and wackier! It adds dryads, prisons, fish-pips, playable cats, 3 new elders, dwarves eating stone, you can eat cats, you can eat manure, and much more.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How did you come up for the idea of dotAGE?</strong></p>
<p>I had been wanting to make a game like The Settlers for a while, making various (bad) prototypes at the beginning of my career. They were really ugly games, and had nothing new, so I realized it made little sense to continue them. One day, in 2014, I played FTL, and it blew my mind. I realized you could apply the same feeling of a roguelike to any genre in that specific moment, and quickly I decided I would try to apply it to one of the genres that usually had not roguelike elements in them (yes, that was not a great idea).</p>
<p>After 9 years of bashing my head against that idea and cursing, dotAGE was ready!</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are you most proud of with dotAGE?</strong></p>
<p>I set out, alone, with the vision to make the tension of a traditional roguelike with its risk of loss paired with the tranquility and relaxing gameplay of board games, and I am very proud to have achieved that very complex mix! As a systems designer, I am fascinated with the emergent dynamics from game elements, and dotAGE is full of carefully designed interactions to reinforce that basic contrast. That is what I am most proud of!</p>
<p><strong>Q: Now dotAGE has been out for over a year, how has the reception been? Were the sales about what you expected?</strong></p>
<p>It has been stellar, and way above what I could dream of. I had no big aims for sales, as I just wanted to make the game, but after so many years of working on it I *had* to try and market it, I owed it to myself and the game itself. So I made sure to make a big launch without a publisher (marketing is an interesting area too!), and much to my surprise it worked! Sales have been above any expectation I had and it has allowed me to focus more on the game, and finally add all the weird ideas I had saved up in labeled files named "keep_this_for_the_dlc_or_you_will_never_finish_the_game.txt" and variations of that.</p>
<p><strong>Q: The game has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified. How difficult was it to support Linux and get it Steam Deck Verified too? Any top tips?</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to the Unity engine, I must say that Native Linux support has been easy to achieve, as by focusing on general optimizations the benefits were felt by all. This was true also for Steam Deck, as I had to optimize a bit for it (the ugly code I had, and still have, after 9 years of iteration!), and especially add controller support, but I think it was a good thing to do as the game plays great on it! Getting verified was not too hard once I asked kindly Valve to take a look at it, and they answered quickly (they do have great developer support). My advice is to keep controller support in mind from the beginning, as that can help in transitioning to it!</p>
<p><strong>Q: Any other general advice for developers releasing their first game?</strong></p>
<p>Please do not take 9 years to make your first game, as I was lucky this time around. My project is a mess, and I would redo almost everything differently with the knowledge I have now! The most important thing that I realized is that if you take so much to make it, *you will feel you will never finish the game*, because while working on it you will become a better game developer and what you did 2 years before will look *bad* to you and you will want to redo it. </p>
<p><strong>Q: Any thoughts on what game you'll make next? What's next for you?</strong></p>
<p>Now that I released the DLC, I will monitor how dotAGE's trajectory changes and decide what to do next! I still have plenty of stuff I'd like to do with dotAGE, but I also am eager to start prototyping something new, as while making dotAGE I saved up dozens of ideas of stuff to do next and can't wait to have a fresh start! Surely, next for me is more game dev!</p>

      <title>UnderMine 2 comes to Early Access in July with co-op</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>UnderMine 2 from developer Thorium is set to enter Early Access on July 22nd, promising to take the best bits of the fun original and expanding on it. It will also feature local co-op play this time around too so you can bring a partner along for the ride.</p>
<p>A demo will also be available during Steam Next Fest between June 9th—16th.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LkgGSkVfsI8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/92e721d094530b0bada93a7f0f20d800.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LkgGSkVfsI8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>PLAY WITH A FRIEND - Invite your friend to drop in and play through the entirety of UnderMine 2 together! Two-player co-op lets you tackle the game with each other, presenting a dynamic challenge and opening up new strategic options.</li>
<li>PLAYABLE CHARACTERS - Discover, unlock, and play as new characters, including Black Rabbit, a lucky and ambitious treasure hunter. Each character has unique stats, abilities, upgrades, and relics.</li>
<li>BRANCHING PATHS - New regions of the Undermine have been revealed, and each branches off into various other areas. Navigate it to complete builds, quests, and different objectives. Your final challenge depends entirely on your decisions throughout the run.</li>
<li>ARCANA - Wield new, interactive relics called Arcana. Each adds a new ability to your character, from casting fireballs to summoning skeleton minions to rearranging time and space.</li>
<li>FULL MOD AND WORKSHOP SUPPORT - Easily create new items, characters, encounters, quests, and more with paintable tilesets, a visual scripting editor, and other included development tools. You can also easily download other players' creations through Steam Workshop.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>While the original had Native Linux support, you'll need to run this one with Proton.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the first one and it's exactly the type of game I can happily sink hours into, so I'm also quite excited about an expanded sequel.</p>

      <title>Infinity Nikki devs are working on Steam Deck support for the Steam release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While there's no current release date for the Steam release, Infold Games are still working towards it for Infinity Nikki and it seems it may be good news for Steam Deck players.</p>
<p>I've spoken with their PR team a couple of times on this, and they've now allowed me to share a note from the developer to say "the team are working on Steam Deck support currently, and will share news as they have news to share". So it's not much right now, but good to see they are actually working on it as it's <em>incredibly</em> popular.</p>
<p>They didn't have anything to share on Desktop Linux though, which may be a little problematic, as they're using Anti-Cheat Expert (ACE). ACE seems to do some sort of <em>device</em> specific whitelisting for the Steam Deck as we've seen games using it work on Deck but not on Desktop Linux, like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/delta-force-developer-mentions-they-will-look-at-supporting-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Delta Force</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/anti-cheat-stops-mecha-break-running-on-desktop-linux-but-works-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mecha BREAK</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9649563571742985016gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I really do hope Valve can eventually properly sort this <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat</a> situation out so we don't end up with more titles having Steam Deck with SteamOS Linux and Desktop Linux separated.</p>
<p>Will be interesting to see how the Steam release is received, for what they call the coziest open-world game. Certainly does look bright and inviting.</p>

      <title>Junk Store plugin for Steam Deck plans new release as closed-source paid software to run other stores</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Junk Store may have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/that-didnt-last-long-the-junk-store-for-steam-deck-has-its-steam-page-removed/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">failed to get released on Steam</a> as Valve removed their store page, but that hasn't stopped their team working on this special Steam Deck plugin to bring other stores like Epic Games, GOG and Amazon Games to the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>While there's already various ways to get other stores on Steam Deck like the Heroic Games Launcher, Lutris, directly installing the stores Windows apps with Proton, plugins for Decky Loader and more, Junk Store plans to be a fully integrated direct solution. And, it will be able to sit alongside Decky Loader too.</p>
<p>Writing on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JunkStore/comments/1jjx3k4/junk_store_the_next_generation/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Reddit</a> they went over some progress recently along with clearly noting it will be "paid software and will be closed source". Initially it will launch with support for Epic Games, GOG and Amazon Games with more added over time.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some of what they say is new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Global download queue</li>
<li>Language selection</li>
<li>DLC selection</li>
<li>Installation of game dependencies, like C++ runtimes, without the need for proton tricks</li>
<li>Gog has proper support for DosBox and ScummVM games</li>
<li>Gog Dosbox support has a Dosbox config editor</li>
<li>The option to enable experimental cloud saves for supported games (we still don’t trust it, but it’s there if you’re a risk taker).</li>
<li>There’s a LOT more options (too many in fact), to control all manner of things. If you like to tinker, this is for you.</li>
<li>The new version is faster and more optimised so you can now see 1000 games per tab compared to the 100 in the python version.</li>
</ul>

<p>They noted in replies that the current open source Decky Loader plugin version will keep working, nothing will be taken away.</p>

      <title>Neverwinter Nights 2 Enhanced Edition hasn&#39;t been announced yet but it just got a Steam Deck Playable rating</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We know Neverwinter Nights 2 Enhanced Edition is probably coming, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/neverwinter-nights-enhanced-edition-gets-a-sequel-dlc-and-it-looks-like-neverwinter-nights-2-enhanced-edition-is-on-the-way/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">thanks to the previous leak</a>, but it still hasn't actually been announced yet. However, it's clearly getting closer.</p>
<p>Going by <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2738630/history/?changeid=28119543" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, it appears that Valve were able to get pre-release testing on this one done, and they've given it a Steam Deck Playable rating. While it has a green check for most things, Valve noted the game does not exit cleanly and "may require you to manually quit via the Steam overlay". If that's the only issue Valve have noted as per the listing, seems it might be another great classic to play on Steam Deck.</p>
<p><em>While SteamDB is a community website, it's generally a great source for early info like this.</em></p>
<p>From what we do know it seems Aspyr Media are involved with it, thanks to their name clearly stated in the EULA notice. And we also know that Beamdog are <em><a href="https://x.com/BeamdogInc/status/1890121268034519371" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">not</a></em> involved with this one even though they did a bunch of previous Enhanced Editions for the original and other RPGs.</p>
<p>Hopefully we'll get some real details on it soon. Will keep an eye out.</p>

      <title>Civilization VII update 1.1.1 adds quick move, lots of UI improvements, a new start position and lots of fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Firaxis Games are quickly cleaning up the messy release of Civilization VII, with more new additions now available in patch update 1.1.1. <em>The game has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</em></p>
<p>This update seems like it adds in some things the game was really missing, but there's plenty of work left to be done before it will likely sway more classic Civ fans over to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15647397911742912427gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The highlights of the patch include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new "Quick Move" option to make gameplay faster and disable some animations.</li>
<li>A new "Standard" start position option for map generation, which is closer to Civilization VI.</li>
<li>Settlement and Commander Renaming.</li>
<li>New Natural Wonder: Mount Everest.</li>
<li>Plenty of UI improvements including:
	<ul>
<li>Improve Unit Flag and Health Bar Visibility.</li>
<li>Improved Plot Tooltips.</li>
<li>New “District Under Attack” notification.</li>
<li>New Trade Lens and Ability to Send Merchants from Lens.</li>
<li>Age Progress Now Shows Turns Remaining Until Crises.</li>
<li>A new Restart Button to re-use your settings and start fresh within the first few turns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That's just the brief highlights. There's a lot more to the update including various game pacing and balance issues solved, lots of general AI improvement, narrative improvements, some cursor problems on Linux and macOS were also solved. And for the Steam Deck they also noted "Fixed several input flows and prompts for the UI when using a controller".</p>

      <title>Devs of Monster Crown: Sin Eater a 2D monster taming RPG want to &#39;take that concept to its absolute limits&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Studio Aurum are developing a new 2D monster taming RPG with Monster Crown: Sin Eater, a standalone follow-up to their previous Monster Crown.</p>
<p>One of the challenges faced with the previous game was solo developer Jason Walsh getting diagnosed with a significant disability in 2019. This time around, Walsh has moved into the role of Producer with an expanded team to help bring the ideas to life.</p>
<p>They said they want to take the concept "to its absolute limits" and it sounds like they have some nice ideas. From encountering creatures that act different between fleeing, chasing and stalking you to branching dialogue options that will "have a real impact on the game".</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EFS2oOOGc_s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f049325fdc6ba753823d0c5b7d664caf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EFS2oOOGc_s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's a demo available on the Steam page, although it only has a Windows build right now. It should have Native Linux support at the full release. The demo does work with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a>.</p>
<p>You can help fund the development on the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/monster-crown/monster-crown-sin-eater-monster-taming-rpg/description" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">just-launched Kickstarter page</a>. They're hoping to get at least CA$43,000 over the next 30 days.</p>

      <title>Mudborne is a wonderfully chilled sim about catching and breeding frogs out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mudborne from ellraiser / TNgineers is a wonderfully charming laid-back casual nature management sim about discovering &amp; breeding frogs. Officially out now with Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified. <em>Note: key provided for me.</em></p>
<p>Just like their previous game APICO, it's all about nature. Instead of breeding bees this time though, you're breeding frogs and trying to restore the pond back to its former glory. It's all bit more spiritual too. You're also a frog this time, not a person, and there's even a dedicated "ribbit" key which is really sweet and makes the other litter frogs speak back to you.</p>
<p>Imagine if you took Stardew Valley, turned you into a frog and swapped farming for breeding other frogs and that's sort-of what to expect from it. No rushing around, you do pretty much whatever you want to get through it at your own pace. Simply lovely. A little more on the puzzle side with the frog genetics but the mechanics around it are great to keep you wanting to explore more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="XuxM31FAOMM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/156a1c0d28eafa10e058f8103dc94ed3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/XuxM31FAOMM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about the developer: ellraiser is half of TNgineers, a small UK-based indie studio made of Ell (ellraiser) and their older brother Jamie (metakitkat). TNgineers’ first game, APICO, was released in 2022 and did well enough to allow Ell to start making games full-time. Ell works on development as well as the art for the games, with Jamie focusing more on writing and design. </p>
<p>While Jamie has been busy designing their second game, Snacktorio, Ell has been focusing on what started as a pet project - Mudborne. They wanted to take all the lessons learned from APICO into a spiritual sequel of sorts, combining elements from games they loved growing up, like Link To The Past and Dr Brain, all mashed together into one slimy baby.</p>
<p>When you buy this one a portion of the money made gets donated to national and international amphibian, wetlands, and environmental charities. So you've got the added feel-good factor here too.</p>
<p>Really nice clean design for the world, the art, the sound and the UI. Not a bad thing to say about this one. Just so thoroughly charming all the way through. Another seriously easy recommendation to go and buy.</p>

      <title>HP are interested in making a SteamOS handheld as the Windows experience sucks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you look at nearly all reviews of handheld gaming PCs that run Windows, the major problem is Windows itself. So with Valve opening up the door to SteamOS Linux for more devices, it seems HP are interested in jumping in too.</p>
<p>Windows simply isn't designed for the use-case of being on a gaming handheld. Forcing you through a terrible setup experience, and just a generally poor experience when using it in this form factor. A few vendors have tried doing their own UI on top of Windows, but it all feels rather disconnected. </p>
<p>A point made by HP's SVP and Division President of Gaming Solutions Josephine Tan when talking to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/hp-hasnt-made-omen-gaming-handheld/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">XDA Developers</a>, Tan mentioned "If you look at Windows, I struggle with the experience myself. If I don't like it, I don't know how to do a product for it.". Tan continued "If I'm buying a handheld, I want a very simple setup. The minute I turn on my handheld, it will remember the last game I played. In the Windows environment, it doesn't".</p>
<p>When XDA asked Tan if they're interested in doing a SteamOS handheld the answer was simply "Yes".</p>
<p>We just need Valve to get going on that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">upcoming public SteamOS 3 beta</a>. Still, it's going to take a lot to dethrone the Steam Deck, with Valve mentioning how it saw <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/330-million-hours-played-on-steam-deck-in-2024-up-64-from-2023-steam-year-in-review-2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">330 million hours played in 2024</a> which is a big increase from 2023.</p>

      <title>Nexus formally announce their open source cross-platform Nexus Mods App: Stardew Valley Preview</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The new cross-platform and open source Nexus Mods App is coming along with their team now formally announcing the Stardew Valley Preview. With support for Linux / Steam Deck baked right in.</p>
<p>I've been tracking it for a while, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/stardew-valley-modding-on-linux-steam-deck-takes-a-step-with-the-nexus-mods-app/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">regularly reporting on it</a> and testing it out and it has come a long way. Exciting, because modding has often been a sore spot for players on Linux platforms including the Steam Deck with Valve's SteamOS Linux. A properly supported app like this is simply a must-have.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20975901581742904757gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20975901581742904757gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Now, they really think it's ready for Stardew Valley fans to jump in and get modding, and give them some feedback on it. Other games will be supported with Cyberpunk 2077, Baldur's Gate 3 or Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord in progress (locked behind an experimental option). Going by their roadmap they do plan to expand it onto various Bethesda games like the Fallout series, Skyrim and more.</p>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Easy and Reliable Mod Installation</strong> – The app ensures a smoother installation process for most mods.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://nexus-mods.github.io/NexusMods.App/users/gettingstarted/DownloadACollection/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Collections</a>﻿</strong> – Easily turn them on and off, allowing you to experiment with using mods in conjunction with collections so that you can configure your perfect setup. Premium users will also have the extra benefit of super-fast collection installs.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://nexus-mods.github.io/NexusMods.App/users/features/Loadouts/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Loadout Management</a>﻿ </strong>– It offers loadouts and loadout switching, with separate configs per loadout, and fast loadout creation and cloning. This means you can easily swap between different sets of mods, perfect for switching between single-player and multiplayer setups.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://nexus-mods.github.io/NexusMods.App/users/features/HealthCheck/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Health Check</a>﻿</strong> – This feature will give you guidance on possible issues in your setup and how to fix them.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://nexus-mods.github.io/NexusMods.App/users/features/Workspaces/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Workspace System</a>﻿ </strong>– View and use every feature side by side with panels, with the ability to open 4 panels side-by-side for seamless multitasking, on demand. So you can cross-reference with ease and quickly compare information across pages, manage mods, and check details without losing your flow.</li>
<li><strong>Faster Than Vortex</strong> – Experience up to 10x faster collection installation compared to Vortex.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Since I last covered it they also put up a quick bug-fix release. The one <em>after</em> the latest release should also <em>hopefully</em> speed up the loading time on Linux, which can be a problem right now.</p>

      <title>Dawnfolk is a must-play if you like chilled unique city-builders</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you like your games that try to break the mold, you should definitely check out the recently released Dawnfolk from Darenn Keller. Made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot</a> it has Native Linux support and is also Steam Deck Verified. <em>Note: key provided for me.</em></p>
<p>Rather unique and not a city-builder like you would expect. Here you take on the role of a ruler who has lost their kingdom to an oppressive darkness. Guided by a mythical companion, Lueur, you explore the world tile-by-tile to expand and remove the darkness.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="79z_w1-XbpM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/64b0c919d64ecb16695fc435ee477d46.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/79z_w1-XbpM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What makes it really unique is not just the setup and visuals but how you actually interact with the game. Most tiles you build in give you little mini-games to do, making every action an added little challenge. It's all quite laid-back though, going as slow or as quickly as you want it to and easy enough to get through, but the result is a thoroughly different take. I couldn't help but be thoroughly charmed by it the more I played of it, and the more I was able to illuminate the map to see all the secrets hidden away.</p>
<p>Coming from the mind of Darenn Keller, who originally worked for Ubisoft Bordeaux on the likes of Ghost Recon and the Assassin's Creed franchises. This is their first independent game and they very much succeeded in making something really interesting.</p>
<p>The developer also announced that in managed to hit over 10,000 sales in the first 5 days. Not bad for a first indie release from a solo developer.</p>
<p>The mixture of simplicity with lots of little game mechanics together really sells the experience. One not to miss and easy to recommend to anyone.</p>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A Unique Blend of City-Building &amp; Mini-Games – Your success depends not only on strategy but also on skillful execution of resource-gathering mini-games.</li>
<li>A Dark, Atmospheric World – A fresh take on the city-builder genre with an eerie yet beautiful aesthetic.</li>
<li>Play at Your Own Pace – Build a thriving settlement in under an hour or take your time uncovering the lore and secrets of the realm.</li>
<li>Designed for Accessibility – Easy to pick up, yet filled with strategic depth for those who seek a challenge.</li>
</ul>

Wield an arsenal of infernal weapons, including nods to the original Painkiller plus totally new creations to discover.

      <title>Starship Troopers: Extermination gets a Steam Deck upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Starship Troopers: Extermination from Offworld just had another major upgrade released, and they're now improving the experience of playing it on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>For Update 1.3 they've added new Steam Deck specific Video settings between Performance and Quality. It's in "Alpha" and they said they hope to improve it in future updates. Nice to see! Although currently it does have an issue where swapping the mode during a match may crash it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9917564331742894557gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I'm definitely going to have to check this out again. Update 1.3 added some other properly exciting additions too like day and night cycles, dynamic weather, staged weapon reloads and various performance improvements. There's also numerous bug fixes, UI improvements, audio improvements and so on.</p>

      <title>Stellaris 4.0 &#39;Phoenix&#39; game-changing update due May 5 with the BioGenesis Expansion</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox have today launched the new Season 09 Expansion Pass, which initially launches with the Stargazer Species Portrait. There's stuff that's actually interesting to come though, but you have to wait until May 5th.</p>
<p>That's because not only is the BioGenesis Expansion launching then, which sounds exciting, but Stellaris 4.0 will officially arrive too overhauling various major parts of the game and hopefully improve performance too.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The Season 09 Expansion Pass includes: </p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>BioGenesis Expansion (May 5, 2025):</strong> Take command of the forces of life itself in BioGenesis. Engineer living ships, terraform entire ecosystems, and wield advanced genetic tools to shape the destiny of your empire. Will you create a utopia of adaptation and growth or weaponize biology to dominate the stars? </li>
<li><strong>Shadows of the Shroud Expansion (Q3 2025):</strong> The psionic plane holds untold power—but at what cost? Shadows of the Shroud is a complete overhaul of the Psionic Ascension path, introducing new moral dilemmas, patron allegiances, and the ever-present temptation of ultimate destruction.</li>
<li><strong>Infernals Species Pack (Q4 2025):</strong> Forge your destiny in the Infernals Species Pack. Adapted to relentless heat and volatile landscapes, you wield the power of extreme environments to reshape the galaxy. Will your empire thrive in the heat, or be consumed by the very forces it seeks to command?</li>
<li><strong>Stargazer Species Portrait (available now):</strong> Dream of the stars with this exclusive portrait, available immediately upon purchasing the Season 09 Expansion Pass. Featuring three phenotypes and unique animations, the Stargazer Species Portrait is perfect for players who seek to embody the spirit of cosmic curiosity.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_Mrj29R5Orw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/87e7115e0cfe319f9e6b6cceb8c47385.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_Mrj29R5Orw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The 4.0 update really is a huge one too, and makes you think - why don't they just do Stellaris 2 at this point? Multiple major features of the game have been completely changed (multiple times in some cases too). Anyway, just some of what to expect from the free update includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Pops and Pop Groups
	<ul>
<li>One of the biggest changes in the Stellaris 4.0 ‘Phoenix’ update, and one of the primary focuses of this Open Beta, is the new Pop system. Rather than being individuals, Pops are now grouped based on Species, Strata, Ethics, and Faction, mostly for calculation purposes. As part of this change, Pop numbers have been increased by a factor of 100, allowing more granular manipulation of Pops by various systems.</li>
<li>All Pop Groups on a planet have simultaneous growth every month following the existing Logistic Growth formulas.
		<ul>
<li>Underrepresented pops are no longer given population growth bonuses.</li>
<li>Fractional growth is not retained from month to month - if a Pop Group would have fractional growth, it has a chance to gain 1 pop that month based on that fraction.</li>
<li>All migration is now handled through the auto-migration system rather than push and pull that previously affected pop growth.</li>
<li>As more granular and simultaneous pop growth is now possible, the minimum growth for small colonies has been removed. Early colonization will be extremely reliant on migration from the empire capital.</li>
<li>Open Beta Note: Xenocompatibility no longer produces hybrid pops, but has not yet been updated to pool all planetary species into a single group for logistic growth purposes. When this is complete, we are likely to remove the Xenocompatibility galaxy setup toggle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A Civilian stratum has been added to represent the masses that do not generally contribute to the empire’s military economy.
		<ul>
<li>Open Beta Note: Civilians are intended to replace Clerks, which will be removed in a future Open Beta update.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Empires now begin with 2000 more pops, most of whom will be Civilians.</li>
<li>More details can be found in <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/stellaris-dev-diary-370-4-0-changes-part-4.1728047/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Stellaris Dev Diary #370</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Planet UI, Zones, Workforce, and Jobs
	<ul>
<li>The other major economic change in the Stellaris 4.0 ‘Phoenix’ update is a revamp to how jobs work.</li>
<li>Rather than Districts and Buildings being especially similar, we are shifting to a model where:
		<ul>
<li>Planets produce and consume resources through Jobs.</li>
<li>Districts provide Jobs based on their development. (Mining District: Add 200 Housing and 200 Miner jobs per development level.)</li>
<li>Zones manipulate what Jobs are provided by Districts. (Foundry Zone: Replace 200 Civilian jobs and 200 Housing with 100 Metallurgists per development level.)
			<ul>
<li>Open Beta Note: Currently the Zones are simpler, and will just provide the jobs. It is our intention for most Zones to convert rather than add.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Buildings are planet-unique and change what the Jobs produce. (Mote Harvesters: Technicians now also produce Volatile Motes.)</li>
<li>Pops produce Workforce that fills up Jobs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Open Beta Note: The Planet UI is still very much a work in progress.</li>
<li>More details can be found in <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/stellaris-dev-diary-371-4-0-changes-part-5.1729244/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Stellaris Dev Diary #371</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Empire Focuses and Timeline
	<ul>
<li>The Situation Log now contains a tab for the Empire Timeline, which keeps track of important milestones of your playthrough.</li>
<li>The Timeline tab also contains a set of Empire Focus Tasks, which are intended to assist players with forming short and medium terms that align with their empire’s nature, while reducing the randomness of the tech tree.
		<ul>
<li>Empires can choose between Conquest, Exploration, and Development as their primary Empire Focuses. You will still gain Tasks from other categories, but they will generally be weighted towards your choice. Some Tasks are basic “Core” Tasks, and will provide progress along all three tracks.</li>
<li>Completing Tasks provides progress towards Guaranteed Technology unlocks that are considered critical for that playstyle. You still need to research the technologies, they only provide the research option when you reach progress milestones. If you already have the technology unlocked or as a permanent research option, there is no alternate reward.</li>
<li>Because Task completion is retroactive and there are no alternate rewards, there should be no benefit in waiting to complete any that you have.</li>
<li>Should you end up with a Task that you find uncompletable or that you do not wish to complete, you can discard it and gain a new Task for a small cost in Unity.</li>
<li>It is our intention that empires that behave consistent with their Empire Focus should naturally complete the Tasks of that category.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>More details can be found in <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/stellaris-dev-diary-368-4-0-changes-part-2.1727417/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Stellaris Dev Diary #368</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trade has been revamped into a standard resource.
	<ul>
<li>Trade is now used as the Market currency.</li>
<li>The Trade Routes system has been removed.</li>
<li>Ships now have logistical upkeep paid by Trade based on whether they are docked (free), friendly space (reduced), neutral space (normal), or hostile space (expensive).
		<ul>
<li>Larger ships tend to have higher upkeep.</li>
<li>The multipliers based on location are set in defines.</li>
<li>Juggernauts do not have logistical upkeep, and reduce the logistical upkeep costs for ships in their system by 75%.</li>
<li>Resources blocks can now include a "logistics" block, which is currently only used by ships.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Planets now have logistical upkeep paid by Trade based on their local resource deficits. This represents the additional costs of diverting freighters to transport materials between planets.
		<ul>
<li>Local deficit costs vary based largely on the base market value of the resources in question.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trade Policies can set how much of your Net trade after logistics upkeep is converted into other resources.</li>
<li>Added galaxy setup sliders for Fleet Upkeep Logistics Costs and Planetary Deficit Logistics Costs.</li>
<li>More details can be found in <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/stellaris-dev-diary-369-4-0-changes-part-3.1728017/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Stellaris Dev Diary #369</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The main help button now displays the Databank window where you can explore brief articles on many in-game concepts, reducing the need to navigate to external information sources.</li>

      <title>Linux kernel 6.14 out late due to &#39;pure incompetence&#39; - don&#39;t get too excited about Linux gaming boosts</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Linux kernel 6.14 has arrived today, and a day later than it was expected. As usual there's lots new from supported hardware to various improvements.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Writing about the release Linus Torvalds <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2025/3/24/797" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So it's early Monday morning (well - early for me, I'm not really a morning person), and I'd love to have some good excuse for why I didn't do the 6.14 release yesterday on my regular Sunday afternoon release schedule.</p>
<p>I'd like to say that some important last-minute thing came up and delayed things.</p>
<p>But no. It's just pure incompetence.</p>
<p>Because absolutely nothing last-minute happened yesterday, and I was just clearing up some unrelated things in order to be ready for the merge window. And in the process just entirely forgot to actually ever cut the release. D'oh.</p>
<p>So yes, a little delayed for no good reason at all, and obviously that means that the merge window has opened. No rest for the wicked (or the incompetent).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the interesting inclusions in kernel 6.14 is enabling the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/ntsync-for-proton-wine-now-in-linux-kernel-6-14-that-should-make-many-steamos-users-happy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new ntsync driver</a> as it's ready, after being in kernel 6.13 but disabled. The idea is for it to better match Windows behaviour for compatibility tools like Wine to run Windows games and apps on Linux. In some cases it can have <em>much</em> better performance than what Wine was originally doing, although it hasn't yet been pulled into Wine but a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/ntsync-driver-support-heads-to-wine-in-a-new-merge-request/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">merge request is open</a>.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">For Valve's Proton however, don't go expecting much here with ntsync. As Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais replied to a user on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/plagman.bsky.social/post/3lkp26xmco22k" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> to note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We already include fsync, which should be as fast or faster as ntsync. We developed ntsync as a general solution that'd be acceptable in upstream Wine, but there's no urgency in including it in the Deck / SteamOS kernel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some other random cherry-picked highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>A fix for Steam Deck OLED potentially entering an unrecoverable faulty state when resuming from suspend.</li>
<li>Faster suspend and resume for some systems.</li>
<li>Lenovo Go S microphone and controller support.</li>
<li>Support for Microsoft's Copilot key on some devices.</li>
<li>SteelSeries Arctis 9 support.</li>
<li>Controller support for the ZOTAC Gaming Zone.</li>
<li>Support for the TECNO Pocket Go.</li>
<li>Support for the Nacon Evol-X Xbox One Controller, 8BitDo SN30 Pro, Hyperkin X91 and Gamesir G7 SE controllers.</li>
<li>Support for the Wooting Two HE.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course there's absolutely loads more including various other improvements to support newer and upcoming hardware from laptops to processors and graphics cards. See more in the <a href="https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v6.x/ChangeLog-6.14" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">full changelog</a>.</p>

      <title>Emulation manager EmuDeck 2.4 brings Steam library integration changes, improved BIOS checker</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>EmuDeck is an all-in-one solution for managing emulation on Linux, SteamOS, Steam Deck and other handhelds and the 2.4 release brings some nice additions.</p>
<p>With this release you can select the level of integration you want to see in your Steam Library, between using ES-DE directly or Steam Rom Manager where you'll get an icon for everything. There's a better BIOS detection system, support for the Citron Nintendo Switch emulator (you have to supply it yourself), support for the Nintendo 3DS emulator Azahar and they've gone through their <a href="https://manual.emudeck.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Wiki</a> to overhaul it.</p>
<p>See their highlights in their new video below:</p>

      <title>The board game Frosthaven is getting a video game with the designer of X-COM</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The popular board game Frosthaven is getting adapted into a video game, with Snapshot Games at the helm led by CEO Julian Gollop, known for designing X-COM. Hopefully it will do better than the last game they designed, Phoenix Point, which is a bit of a mess.</p>
<p>It serves as a spiritual successor to Gloomhaven. A dark fantasy tactical RPG. Isaac Childres, creator of Frosthaven, will be serving as a consultant on the project.</p>

      <title>Thief-like free and open source game The Dark Mod 2.13 brings better AI vision and new graphical goodies</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Dark Mod is a seriously impressive project giving us a completely free and open source standalone Thief-like stealth game, and The Dark Mod 2.13 release is another great one. </p>
<p>In this release they've managed to overhaul AI vision system, which sounds lot more impressive and accurate. They go into a bit of detail on the history on why it wasn't great originally, with light previously being calculated as "either cubes or pyramids with perfect exponential falloff" but now they have "a stochastic sampler model that does regular measurements of the actual light volume pixels and builds a running average of how illuminated different entities are". The result? Light works more like actual light with their example video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JhJYFMNLfT4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c3fb7882da5fdc50e81507133093534e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JhJYFMNLfT4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's also been an overhaul to Mission Management with a new UI. It has a search filter now that "follows modern conventions of reducing the listed items as each new letter eliminates a possible matching mission name" with new sorting options. You can also now scroll the additional mission details and more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QBycvr58ERs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6a6cfc3ae486cace0ef0d63dc6ebe5cd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QBycvr58ERs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They've also added in Parallax Occlusion Mapping and other new graphical goodies, an improved training mission, new potions were added, new assets are available for mission builders and <a href="https://wiki.thedarkmod.com/index.php?title=What%27s_new_in_TDM_2.13" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">much more</a>.</p>

      <title>The EchoPatch to modernize F.E.A.R. adds in gamepad support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>EchoPatch, a mod patch for the classic and awesome shooter F.E.A.R. has another new release out and this brings gamepad support. I wrote about this patch <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/echopatch-mod-is-a-great-way-to-modernise-the-classic-shooter-fear/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">only recently</a> because it's awesome.</p>
<p>The patch itself does work just fine with Proton on Linux, and now it should make it even better for players who prefer a gamepad and Steam Deck too. A great time for the game since it was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/silent-hill-4-fear-and-more-join-the-gog-preservation-program/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently added to the GOG Preservation Program</a>.</p>

      <title>Teslagrad devs reveal Knuckle Jet, a jetpunk nose-breaking ricochet action platformer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From Rain Games who made Teslagrad, Girl Genius: Adventures In Castle Heterodyne and World to the West their next game is Knuckle Jet. They describe it as an "off-the-wall, riveting jetpunk nose-breaking ricochet action platformer".</p>
<p>Their first teaser is up now:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="gsPqwR53Z3g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f192b8319d1e11975a1da8cf5c8c3e9a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/gsPqwR53Z3g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Jet-fueled knuckle acrobatics! Scientifically inaccurate flight action that rewards high-speed momentum and precision. Feel free to completely ignore G-force in the name of awesomeness, and keep smashing, crashing and crushing to stay in the flow!</li>
<li>Non-stop arcade action! Tons of standalone levels (How many? we don't know yet, we're still making them! but there will be plenty!) packed with fresh things to punch, easily navigable through a revolutionary new innovation we call a "map screen". Utilize the environment, find rewards, and chase perfection!</li>
<li>Hoard equipment for the challenges ahead! Collect and upgrade a large array of gear that offers drastic gameplay changes. Ignore all fashion sense and pick item combinations that suit your playstyle, specialize in optimized builds for each challenge, or go for stylish matching gear- it's all good.</li>
<li>A rogues gallery of despicable villains! From high-rise clockwork cities to soot black forests, each biome in Motorland is under the grip of the scheming business partners of power-hungry industrialist Baron Tychoon. They've kidnapped a whole orphanage and put the little ragamuffins to work among the crushing pistons and spinning cogs of their robotic death machines, and it's up to you to save the kids. Crush this cadre of conniving crooks before facing the ultimate foe!</li>
<li>Drop into battle together with a friend! It is nice to have friends. It's even better when they can join you in battle! Fight together across the main campaign, or beat the snot out of each other in a friendly game of Knuckleball.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Minecraft is getting a graphics overhaul with the Vibrant Visuals update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Minecraft Live has been and gone again and this time there was some pretty big news. Vibrant Visuals was announced as a future major upgrade, which will bring some fancier looking graphics to Minecraft. Now before you get your pitchforks out about how much you like the current look of Minecraft, it seems it will be entirely optional.</p>
<p><em>It will come to the Bedrock edition first, with the Java edition getting it later.</em></p>
<p>What to expect from it? It looks like a shader pack. They'll be officially adding in things like directional lighting, subsurface scattering, volumetric fog and more. With that you'll see lots of improvements to how it looks throughout the whole game. From light rays shining through windows to shadows moving with the sun and more. </p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5zcZJcXRdw0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/13bcabf3ada74cd3ed33c7b8e80fe251.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5zcZJcXRdw0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The next main update is Spring to Life, which should release tomorrow that includes variants of a few different mobs, new ambient features like the firefly bush and falling leaves. More on that when it's out.</p>
<p>Another new update was also teased that will feature the dried ghast – a new block you’ll find in the Nether. You can bring it back to the Overworld, and bring it back to life as a friendly mob. You'll be able to put a harness on it, mount up and go soaring through the sky.</p>

      <title>Wine 10.4 continues work on Bluetooth driver and more Vulkan video decoder support in WineD3D</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wine 10.4 is out now as the latest development release of the Windows compatibility layer, bringing new features and assorted bug fixes.</p>
<p>Highlighted additions in this release include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improvements to PDB support in DbgHelp.</li>
<li>More Vulkan video decoder support in WineD3D.</li>
<li>Accessibility support in the SysLink control.</li>
<li>More progress on the Bluetooth driver.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's also bug fixes for Battle.net, Steam, Need for Speed: Shift, Command &amp; Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath, Europa Universalis 4 Golden Century, ShaderMap 4.x, Chessbase, Zenless Zone Zero, Myst, iTunes, Firefox and more.</p>
<p>See all in <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/releases/wine-10.4" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the release notes</a>.</p>
<p>Since Valve's Proton is built from Wine, to preempt the question — no, we don't know exactly when Proton 10 will release after rebasing onto Wine 10. Proton 8 was released in April 2023, Proton 9 got a Beta in late April 2024 with a release in May, so it's probably not likely until sometime around April / May.</p>

      <title>The Last of Us Part II Remastered devs aiming for &#34;best possible experience on handheld gaming devices&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sony have revealed the system requirements and more info for the PC release of The Last of Us Part II Remastered, which is due to arrive on April 3rd. Looks like it might be good news for Steam Deck owners too.</p>
<p>The first game on PC released in quite a poor state so hopefully this time around they have learned from some mistakes. Sounds like they may have as they've pulled in Nixxes Software in addition to Iron Galaxy as well. On top of that, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/playstation-network-requirement-on-pc-will-now-be-optional-with-in-game-rewards/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">as Sony announced previously</a>, there's no PlayStation Network requirement here now but you will get bonus features if you sign-in.</p>
<p>For Steam Deck players, they didn't mention the handheld specifically but they did note how it offers a "wide range of graphics settings and presets, to ensure the best possible experience on hardware ranging from high-end PCs to handheld gaming devices". <em>The minimum system requirements seem quite reasonable too.</em></p>
<p>One <em>potential</em> issue here though is that they say it supports the PlayStation Overlay, which does not work on Linux platforms with Proton. It's part of why Ghost of Tsushima is rated Unsupported. However, since the sign-in is optional, hopefully that won't cause any problems.</p>
<p>The system requirements:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5475464221742577448gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5475464221742577448gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The PC release arrives with support for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nvidia DLSS 3 Super Resolution and Frame Generation support.</li>
<li>AMD FSR 3.1 and AMD FSR 4 support with upscaling and frame generation.</li>
<li>VSync and framerate cap options, including an uncapped framerate option.</li>
<li>DirectStorage support, and more.</li>
</ul>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nightdive Studios have finally revealed that their System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster arrives June 26th with a new trailer and new details.</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster Key Features:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Should work just fine on Linux / Steam Deck at launch, like most other Nightdive games they generally work really well in Valve's Proton.</p>

      <title>Get ready to defend a walking castle in the roguelike action game Castlebound</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From Ogre Pixel who made Lonesome Village and A Tiny Sticker Tale, their next game is an action roguelike where you're defending a walking castle. Castlebound seems like it could be a lot of fun.</p>
<p>You fight off various waves of different foes while trying to progress through each level, all while ensuring your castle keeps on walking. Available to play solo or in local co-op too, could be another great game to play with a partner. So it's a mixture of base defence with a whole lot of fast-paced action going on.</p>
<p>Check out the first gameplay teaser below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="W2vNQrAlxTc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f8c9208610ce0e02653640e552015f30.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/W2vNQrAlxTc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fast-Paced Combat: Jump, dodge, and unleash devastating attacks to fend off relentless enemy hordes!</li>
<li>Defend the Walking Castle: Protect your fortress as it moves through dangerous lands!</li>
<li>Solo or Co-Op Action: Take on the challenge alone or team up with a friend for an epic multiplayer adventure!</li>
<li>Multiple Playable Heroes: Fight alongside different warriors, each with unique abilities and playstyles that offer a fresh and dynamic experience!</li>
<li>Roguelike Progression: Each run is unique, unlock new skills, heroes, and upgrades to enhance your chances of survival!</li>
<li>A Unique Take on the Genre: Experience an innovative blend of castle defense and roguelike combat like never before!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Their previous games had Native Linux support and it looks like this will too.</p>

      <title>The Entertainment Software Association have launched the Accessible Games Initiative </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Accessible Games Initiative from the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) has been launched, with an aim to improve how developers and stores list clear information about the accessibility features available in video games.</p>
<p>It was announced at GDC this year with Electronic Arts, Google, Microsoft, Nintendo of America, Sony Interactive Entertainment, Ubisoft, Amazon Games, Riot Games, Square Enix and Warner Bros. Games signing up to it. It will be directly managed be the ESA.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11899726521742556755gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The primary purpose of the new Accessible Games Initiative is to help provide clear information about whether a specific video game has accessibility features and, if so, what those features are. The initiative is launching with a set of 24 “tags,” all with clear criteria about what each tag means. Sample tags include: <em>clear text, large and clear subtitles, narrated menus, stick inversion and save anytime</em>, among others. Over time, participating companies will place the Accessible Games Initiative tags near their game product information – for example on digital storefronts, product pages or digital catalogues. This can help provide players and other consumers, such as parents and teachers, with clear information about which features are in any given game before they make a purchase.</p>
<p>“Tens of millions of Americans have a disability and often face barriers to experiencing the joy and connection that comes with playing video games,” said Stanley Pierre-Louis, ESA president and CEO. “We are immensely proud to announce the Accessible Games Initiative in partnership with industry leaders. This initiative demonstrates how impactful we can be when we work together in our industry-wide pursuit of helping more people experience the power of play.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully we will see the likes of Valve expand on accessibility notices on Steam store pages, they could definitely do with noting various features on there to help people.</p>
<p>I would really like to be able to search directly for games on Steam that have font and UI scaling, which is one of the biggest nuisances not just for Steam Deck but for Desktop too. I find too many games have tiny text. I can't imagine how bad it is for people with worse vision than me. This all sounds like a good step in the right direction.</p>

      <title>Everything to grab from Prime Gaming, March 21st edition for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's the up to date list of games available on Amazon Prime Gaming for March 21st, and what compatibility you can expect for Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck. An easy way to build up your gaming collection with these games coming as part of your Amazon Prime subscription.</p>
<p>I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"/> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play. Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now.</p>
<p>You can install games from Epic, GOG and Amazon easily via <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/heroic-games-launcher-2152-released-fixing-amazon-gog-and-epic-games-issues/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Heroic Games Launcher</a> with Prime giving you a code for each game for whatever store it's on. For any games that use anti-cheat be sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat compatibility page</a>.</p>

      <title>SteamOS 3.7.2 Preview gets a fix for the Steam Deck OLED</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Valve continue working towards the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">public SteamOS 3 release for more devices</a>, and we've seen them note work towards that in the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/steamos-3-7-0-preview-brings-the-beginnings-of-support-for-non-steam-deck-handhelds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">initial SteamOS 3.7 Preview</a>, they continue rolling out more bug fixes for the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>The latest "SteamOS 3.7.2 Preview: 2 Safe 2 Sound" release is available with this fix:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fixed a sound crash on session switch on Steam Deck OLED</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Source: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/529841887223218179" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Valve</a></em></p>
<p>Since this is in Preview you need to manually opt into it via Settings &gt; System &gt; System Update Channel. SteamOS 3.7 is a big update but it's not reccomended if you want a properly stable experience.</p>
<p>One annoyance I've encountered so far is that all input seems to randomly break sometimes. On both the Steam Deck itself and external controllers. A bug is <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/SteamOS/issues/1838" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">already logged</a> with Valve on this.</p>
