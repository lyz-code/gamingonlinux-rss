      <title>Yawnoc is chaotic top-down shooter rogue-lite inspired by Conway&#39;s Game of Life and other cellular automata</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the source code available along with the game, Yawnoc is a chaotic top-down shooter rogue-lite inspired by Conway's Game of Life and other cellular automata that's out now. <em>Note: personal purchase.</em></p>
<p>This is a thoroughly strange one. And to be honest, I didn't initially have the tiniest idea what it all really means. I tried reading up on it for a while, into some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> pages and other literature and my brain is now thoroughly fried. Basically, you run around shooting strange machines in a wave, then go and buy a bunch of upgrades and new weapons before jumping into the next wave.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6497768291731518512gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>From the Steam page the developer explains it as this: "Fight machines from different automata algorithms including Conway's Game of Life, Brian's Brain, and LowDeath. As you progress through the forest, the machines will begin to follow different cellular automata rulesets that change their behavior. Master each algorithm to learn how to quickly exterminate machines in every area!"</p>
<p>Playing it helps you understand it. Depending on where you hit them with your bullets, will change what they do. Some do nothing or fire back, others grow and grow some more, a few might launch what appear to be mortars or some sort of grenades at you. It just gets <em>weird</em>. After a few waves a hostile but more living-like creature was running around firing everywhere, I took them down, and when finishing the wave they woke up and it was another living being like me and they decided to join me to help out. Nice.</p>
<p>During a wave enemies flicker about all over the place, and sometimes send you into what looks like another dimension when things get…weird.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7774496801731518579gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I've only begun scratching the surface of it but it has a really nice overall idea. And the Linux version does run great.</p>
<p>Be sure to check out the release trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5i5lAmJbaiA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c7f68183c385e6605a4264a7f1e4bdda.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5i5lAmJbaiA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Not only does it have full Native Linux support but it also includes the source code as well. As per the readme in the installed folder:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yawnoc is written in Python, Pygame, and ModernGL. Developed with Python 3.11.7 on Windows 11 &amp; Ubuntu 20.</p>
<p>The source code is hacked together to help ship the game in a reasonable amount of time, so while it may be easy to tinker with since it's Python, changing complex mechanics may be messy.</p>
<p>Steam launches the yawnoc executable, but the source can be run with a valid Python environment from yawnoc.py. The rest of the code is in the scripts folder.</p>

      <title>GOG launch their Preservation Program to make games live forever with a hundred classics being &#39;re-released&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> going back to their roots a little here with the announcement of the GOG Preservation Program, with an aim to ensure various games get to live on forever.<em> A fitting announcement for their 16th anniversary don't you think?</em></p>
<p>What's it all about then? GOG will be directly maintaining various classic games, ensuring they work on modern systems, and giving each of them a big special stamp on the GOG store page to show you. Like this one for one of my faves, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/theme_hospital" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Theme Hospital</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20223086901731506744gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>They've already been doing it for a while, and this includes the re-releases of recent classics like <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/alpha_protocol" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Alpha Protocol</a> and the <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil_bundle" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Resident Evil Bundle</a> — but now they're putting an official stamp on it. GOG said in a press release that "100 classic games from our catalog are being re-released today with updated or quality-tested builds" including <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_3_complete_edition" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Heroes of Might and Magic 3: Complete</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/dungeon_keeper_2" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Dungeon Keeper 2</a>.</p>
<p>However, it's not <em>just</em> classic retro games, they will be up for maintaining any game, even if it was only released "just a few months ago" but not brand new games as they expect the developer to do that directly. As long as GOG can commit to it, they'll seemingly look at any game to keep it going.</p>
<p>They won't be using community fixes and patches though, as they "want to avoid passing the responsibility of maintaining the game’s quality on to the community" and to preserve the original experience.</p>
<p>GOG say the GOG Preservation Program is currently Windows-only as their "priority is to preserve as many games as possible under the Program, before expanding to other operating systems". That's pretty much expected really from GOG.</p>
<p>See more on the <a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG website</a>. They also launched a <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/2024_16_gog_anniversary" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">big 16th anniversary sale</a>.</p>
<p>You can install and keep GOG games easily up to date on Linux / Steam Deck with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/heroic-games-launcher-2152-released-fixing-amazon-gog-and-epic-games-issues/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a>.</p>

      <title>Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition gets updated, needs a fix on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rockstar Games decided to update the Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition which includes Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Grand Theft Auto III but it seems you'll need this quick fix to run it now on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Various players have been reporting a "Fatal error" being encountered when trying to play any of them. However, there's two workarounds I know of to get around it. What's interesting is that this <em>might</em> be specific to the Steam Deck OLED, as it's to do with HDR not working. So you can try this launch option first:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">DXVK_HDR=0 %command%</code></p>
<p>To do this. Go into the game in your Steam Library, over to the little cog icon on the right for the Properties, and put that in the Launch Options box.</p>
<p>Another potential workaround is to force DirectX 12 for it:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">%command% -dx12 </code></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15685870081731506023gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Grand Theft Auto III – The Definitive Edition</em></p>
<p>An update for DXVK was <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4450" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">merged</a> that should fix this so it's likely to land in Proton Experimental sometime soon. After that, Valve will probably then switch the three games in the collection to default to it until a new main version of Proton is released. At least until then, you can use those workarounds to play each game.</p>
<p>According to Rockstar the <a href="https://support.rockstargames.com/articles/35337378670739/Grand-Theft-Auto-The-Trilogy-The-Definitive-Edition-Title-Update-Notes-1-112-PlayStation-5-Xbox-Series-X-S-PC" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> for the collection contained:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Numerous fixes and improvements.</li>
<li>Added Classic Lighting mode which restores the look and feel of the sky in the original games.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The trilogy is available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sub/817628/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Chrono is a puzzler about time-controlling objects in the world</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For fans of Portal and other first-person puzzle games, the indie game Chrono from Portuguese developer David Simoes is all about time-controlling objects across various rooms to progress. <em>Note: the developer sent me a key.</em></p>
<p>Here you get to explore a bunch of puzzle rooms after a computer accident sets you free. The game mechanics are quite simple, but used to great effect. After your escape you'll find a special remote, that allows you to control the temporal properties of objects. You can pause things, rewind them to send them backwards, change their direction and more. There's some really nice ideas in there and it won't take you particularly long to get through (a few hours).</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6Y1DOkvwDS8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1959f6ba3380c19cadbebc4b494fb885.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6Y1DOkvwDS8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As shown in the trailer above you'll come across moving platforms, lasers, spinning turbine blades and more that you'll need to figure out the sequence of changing them all using your remote.</p>
<p>It has a nice idea, that I hope they're able to expand on in future, perhaps with a slightly bigger budget. But if you like smaller puzzle games at £2.49 you can't really argue with that price.</p>
<p>Chrono has Native Linux support and works on the Steam Deck. There's also a demo available.</p>

      <title>Stellar Blade should come to PC in 2025, dev expects sales to exceed console</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Stellar Blade, the story-driven action adventure that's currently a PlayStation exclusive, looks like it's coming to PC sometime in 2025.</p>
<p>As posted in their 3Q 2024 <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/ir.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=203&amp;page=1&amp;code=ir_eng" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">earnings report</a> they said "The release is being considered within 2025. Considering recent trends such as Steam's expanding market share in the AAA game sector and the global success of , we expect the performance on PC to exceed that on consoles.".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20279867651731500624gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p><em>It's also set for a NieR:Automata crossover DLC to release soon.</em></p>
<p>Hopefully it will work well with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a> on Desktop Linux and Steam Deck. Nice to see more console exclusives making their way onto Steam. Having to own a specific piece of gaming hardware to play a specific game just seems so backwards to me.</p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ravaged by strange, powerful creatures, Earth has been abandoned, and what is left of the decimated human race has fled to a Colony in outer space.</p>
<p>After travelling from the Colony, 7th Airborne Squad member EVE arrives on the desolate remains of our planet with a clear-cut mission: to save humankind by reclaiming Earth from the Naytiba – the malevolent force that has devastated it.</p>
<p>But as EVE tackles the Naytiba one-by-one, piecing together the mysteries of the past in the ruins of human civilization, she realizes that her mission is far from straightforward. In fact, almost nothing is as it seems…</p>

      <title>Check out the demo for Into The Grid that blends dungeon-crawling hacking, deck-building and combat</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Into The Grid is coming next year and this award-winning mixture of dungeon-crawling, deck-building and turn-based combat now has a demo available. <em>It has Native Linux support.</em></p>
<p>Really interesting mixture of styles here. The dungeon crawling side of it reminded me of the hacking mini-game in the later Deus Ex games. And on top of that you get to build a deck of slick looking cards, then fight turn-based battles against various types of enemies that have some nice 3D animations on them. As far as deck-builders go, this is pretty dynamic and definitely feels unique in a crowded space. All wrapped up in a sleek cyberpunk style, with a story focused on taking down the evil mega corporations that control the world from the shadows — it's one to watch.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Main Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>An exciting blend of deckbuilding, card battler and dungeon crawler</strong> - Into The Grid introduces a map exploration system to the genre that’s a breath of fresh air. You will need to be tactical and strategical not only in the way you put together your deck and play your cards, but also in how you explore the map and manage your limited resources to find and reach your goal before The Grid kicks you out, sends a private security force to your location, or worse.</li>
<li><strong>A unique dual resource system to diminish RNG and leverage “dead draws”</strong> - Into The Grid introduces a novel combat mechanic called “Commands”, skills you can activate during combat by spending a resource that almost every card in the game generates just by playing them. Commands are designed to have supporting effects that help to play around RNG by letting you, for example, draw or fetch cards from specific places. Their varied effects also enable different archetypes within each character, creating a new fan of possibilities as you change your Commands in between battles and adjust them to your current deck.</li>
<li><strong>5 Characters and Factions to discover the deep lore of the “2112 Universe”</strong><br/>
	​Into The Grid takes place in the year 2112, in a universe that Flatline Studios has been developing for even longer than the game itself. This universe is full of characters and entities with their own agendas and motivations. In gameplay terms, the full game will include 5 different characters, each one belonging to a different hacker Faction that determines the hacker’s ethos and their reasons to be outlaws.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The Linux demo did appear to run very nicely.</p>
<p>Into The Grid also took part in the recent Save &amp; Sound festival, where the composer and sound designer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOlc0sNOUPU" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">did some tunes</a>.</p>

      <title>Face off against mutated snacks as a Banana in Bronana which aims to be the next Brotato</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bronana aims to be the next Brotato but you're a Banana, with clear inspiration from the potato wave-survival game along with all the survivor-likes. To be fair to it though, it once again does a few things differently to try and stand out amongst a crowded and constantly growing genre.</p>
<p>Here you pick your Banana and head off into an arena where you face off against all the weird snacks. Pick up the coins they drop as the wave continues to count down until the end, and then you'll get to upgrade your character. What makes it different is the progression here. At the end of each wave it will drop three items on the floor for you to pick from, and then you're given a choice of paths to run through to get to the next wave, with each door giving you a different benefit (like an XP boost).</p>
<p>There's also various NPCs to interact with that can present you with random events to participate in, so it is a bit more dynamic than Brotato (but nowhere near as polished). Check out the new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Hc8TpZ8Z5-U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/185d845b5f560db17ce36208ea34dea2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Hc8TpZ8Z5-U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release: "Bronana offers a thrilling gameplay experience full of unpredictable events and fun NPC interactions," said PK, director at busy bear "Prepare for a snacktastic struggle for survival with slippery maneuvers, quirky yet challenging stages, and incredibly high replayability potential when the title arrives on PC via Steam and Steam Deck next month!"</p>
<p>Another game made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> but no Linux version though, so you'll need <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> for this one. There's a demo available now which worked fine with Proton 9.0-3, although clearly a little rough around the edges. I liked what I saw though, it gets pretty chaotic and there's plenty of over-the-top action.</p>
<p>It's releasing December 13th for $4.99.</p>

      <title>Vehicle combat in Scaravan 66 looks nuts and I want it now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lithic Entertainment just revealed Scaravan 66, and I smashed that wishlist button faster than ever because it looks so damn delicious.</p>
<p>What is it? A fast-paced car combat game about exploding your way to freedom on the road where you'll battle all sorts of monsters and even the Devil directly. I was told to "Imagine the chaotic car combat of Twisted Metal blended with the endlessly engaging character-driven roguelike of Hades" and that's apparently what you get here. Like a lot of developers though, they're really stretching the limits of what a "roguelike" is.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Gunning for the End of the Road: </strong>As a Road Reaper, you'll gun down every Devil-sent demon and undead on your way to that elusive end of the road. With each attempt to escape your hell, you'll grow stronger and unravel more about yourself and the world you're tethered to.</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Perks, Powers, and Pit Stops: </strong>Need to make a pit stop? Make strategic stops and visit other Road Reapers on the route who will lend you their powers and help you go that extra mile.</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Geared for Replayability: </strong>No two attempts to escape your tether are ever the same. With each attempt, discover more about your fellow Reapers, the fiends who stand in your way, and even yourself.</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Devil’s Diabolical Designs: </strong>The Devil is always one step ahead as she orchestrates her symphony of carnage against you. Enemies sent to stop your escape will differ in number and strength, as she watches your every move and fine-tunes her strategy. She is always plotting against you!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Karate Survivor will have you kicking, punching, rolling over tables and throwing chairs at people</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Continuing my quest to play every survivor-like there is, Karate Survivor is the latest I've been kicking and punching through and it's great and surprisingly different to the rest of the crop. <em>Note: key provided by Vicarious PR.</em></p>
<p>This one is like playing through a camp 80s martial arts movie, only in a Vampire Survivors-like form. In fact, I got a little Streets of Rage vibe from this one too, I could have seen this on my shelf next to it in the days of the Sega Mega Drive. It has the usual marks of a survivor-like with auto-attacks, lots of enemies swarming you and various upgrades to build up a crazy character as you go.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/228605971731424411gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>However, compared to a lot of the survivor-likes, this genuinely does do plenty differently. For starters, it is of course melee focused, it's all about getting up close and personal.</p>
<p>There's also no specific weapon or ability timers. Instead, you have a <em>character</em> timer. You wait for it to tick down each time, and then it goes through a timeline of moves you've stacked and upgraded after each level-up. You can switch these abilities around in the timeline, and build up combo moves matching colour types to truly kick some ass as you run around. That alone is rather unique in the space, and quite challenging to be in the right position when the timeline is running through so you actually hit everyone. And thanks to that, each run can end up very differently.</p>
<p>There's also weapons spread around the maps like brooms, lamps and plenty more to grab and do some quick smashing over enemies heads. Weapons only have <em>limited</em> uses though as they'll break after only a few hits leaving you once again to spin those arms around. There's even funny special moves at times when you pick up certain objects, like a diving flying kick that will smash a big area after you select the direction.</p>
<p>Release trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WH_KjiLuvMg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/42d04534633b56b1a37669092367b3c3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WH_KjiLuvMg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I really love the map destruction too. As you fight you'll be smashing various parts of the map apart too. It doesn't feel quite as static and lifeless as a lot of similar games in the genre as you'll actually be using a lot of things placed around each map.</p>
<p>During your run through you'll be collecting teeth (hah!), which is your currency for permanent unlocks to boost your character properly with the usual suspects like more damage. What I also enjoyed about this is that as you progress more through it, you'll also unlock more general abilities like rolling over obstacles, kicking objects at people, accessing new areas and a lot more. It sprinkles it all in somewhat quickly too, as long as you do enough during a run and so even after an hour of gameplay you'll have an increasing amount of fun with it.</p>
<p>Played on Linux with the latest <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/proton-90-3-released-and-proton-experimental-upgraded-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-3</a> it works great. Really fun on Steam Deck too, although the performance can at times drop just a bit, it's always over 40FPS in my testing and largely around 60FPS. There's no Steam Deck rating for it yet but the developer noted in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3027930/view/4470479417177538616" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they were directly testing and optimising for it.</p>
<p>Really good fun, unique and worth jumping into for sure. It's strangely somewhere between a beat 'em up and a survivor-like that captivated me. I just wish your character was just a <em>little</em> bit speedier to begin with, but a minor point. Overall it's an easy recommendation.</p>

      <title>Claw machine deckbuilder Dungeon Clawler arrives November 21 and it&#39;s going to grab you</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dungeon Clawler from Stray Fawn Studio who also made The Wandering Village is a claw machine deckbuilder that's now planned to hit Early Access on November 21st.</p>
<p>I've had access for a while as the developer sent an early key, and it's totally grabbed me. I'm a huge sucker for these more casual games, most recently sinking hours into Peglin and now this is going to absolutely destroy my time. Such a simple idea but really makes you itch to have just one more run. Really clever idea and game mechanics, looking forward to seeing it out to see what more players think of it.</p>

      <title>Fan-made Half-Life 2 Episode 3 demo arrives with Project Borealis: Prologue now on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We may never get Half-Life 2: Episode 3 (basically Half-Life 3), but at least we have the first taster of Project Borealis out now with Project Borealis: Prologue. <em>You know how these prologues work, it's a glorified demo with a fancy name.</em></p>
<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 5 this game is "inspired by the epic cliffhanger from Half-Life 2: Episode Two, Project Borealis represents a fan-made effort to realize a cohesive story conclusion to the episodic series. This prologue chapter invites players back into the HEV suit of Gordon Freeman, offering a glimpse into the next chapter of his journey".</p>
<p>There's no Linux version, so you'll need Proton to try it out. Although, you will need to swap it to Proton Experimental, as the current main Proton 9.0-3 results in this error:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5290795201731405080gol1.png"/></p>
<p>It loads up fine with Proton Experimental. <em>See more in my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton beginner's guide</a> if you're confused.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1964537481731406274gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The developer said they are already planning plenty of updates to fix up various bugs and performance issues. If you can't even launch it, you might be able to with the "-vulkan" launch command on the game (right click -&gt; properties) but the developers noted it's not directly supported on that mode.</p>
<p>Performance on my system showed it to not be especially great, but playable enough when changing a few settings down. But even on Medium overall settings it struggled to stay at 60FPS with my Ryzen 5800x / Radeon 6800 XT.</p>
<p>Don't expect something big (yet) from it, the demo is incredibly short. I managed to finish it including the credits rolling in only about 15 minutes. Incredibly exciting though, they've clearly put a huge amount of effort into this and it really does look and feel the part.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8424739401731406275gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Although we might not be getting Half-Life 3 exactly, Valve do appear to be working on <em>something</em> Half-Life related as <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/valve-working-on-a-new-game-that-could-be-half-life-3/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">we saw from a previous leak</a>.</p>

      <title>Supernatural comedy point-and-click adventure A Vampyre Story: A Bat&#39;s Tale announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The original A Vampyre Story released back in 2008 and now there's finally going to be a new one with A Vampyre Story: A Bat's Tale.</p>
<p>Announced at the end of October, that I missed, Autumn Moon Entertainment that includes Bill Tiller (The Curse of Monkey Island, The Dig), Dave Harris and other ex-LucasArts veterans have partnered up with developer Tag of Joy for this one who made Crowns and Pawns: Kingdom of Deceit. We're set for a fresh and exciting adventure like the classics with this one.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kk4T0IhbtQw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fbf4dafa611055d81e27a323ef006ac9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kk4T0IhbtQw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Vampyre Story: A Bat’s Tale follows Mona, a Parisian opera singer who is kidnapped and taken to a castle in Draxsylvania where she is turned into a vampire. Fortunately, she’s aided by her loyal companion, a wisecracking bat named Froderick. Guide both Froderick and Mona through a landscape of crazy characters, clever puzzles and gorgeous locations, including Dr. Legume’s Home for the Sanity Challenged, the Executioner’s Practice Grounds, the Mortus Labs™ and many others! It will be up to the player to help Mona escape the clutches of a mad scientist and stop his evil plan, find a vampire familiar, and continue her quest to return home.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“I love LucasArts graphic adventures, Halloween, and the classic Universal Monster movies of the 40’s and 50’s. So when I created the original A Vampyre Story, I combined all those things I love together. Since its release, adventure game technology has vastly improved, and by partnering with Tag of Joy, we’ll be able to continue the story of Mona and Froderick in a modern gaming experience that also still evokes the feel of a classic LucasArts graphic adventure,” says Bill Tiller, CEO and Creative Director of Autumn Moon Games. “I couldn’t be more excited about our collaboration. With Tag of Joy’s help we raised enough funding to finally kick off development of the new game, so it’s really amazing to announce that this is finally happening!”</p>
<p>“My brother and I came of age playing games like The Curse of Monkey Island and have released a modern point and click adventure ourselves, so when we learned that Bill was looking to resurrect his A Vampyre Story franchise, we reached out and suggested a collaboration. We are super excited that Bill agreed, and he’s also really friendly and easy to work with!” says Šarūnas Ledas, the CEO and co-founder of Tag of Joy. “Bill’s knowledge, beautiful artwork and a very fun IP combined with our team’s recent experience in creating a 2.5D adventure makes a perfect mix.”</p>
<p>No release date has been given for it yet.</p>

      <title>Direct3D to Vulkan translation layer DXVK v2.5 released with rewritten memory management</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another big release of the Direct3D 8/9/10/11 to Vulkan translation layer (used by Proton) has been released. With DXVK v2.5 bringing rewritten resource and memory management. This should make it a whole lot more efficient at allocating video memory.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Noted in the announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Reduced fragmentation may reduce peak memory usage in games such as <strong>God of War</strong> by up to 1 GiB in extreme cases.</li>
<li>Memory defragmentation is now performed periodically to return some unused memory back to the system.<br/>
	The goal is <strong>not</strong> to reduce VRAM usage at all costs; instead this is done conservatively if the system is under memory pressure, or if a significant amount of allocated memory is unused. Keeping <em>some</em> unused memory is useful to quickly service subsequent allocations.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This will work best if you have GPU drivers that support both VK_EXT_memory_budget and VK_KHR_maintenance5. They're now recommending you have at least Mesa 24.0 or NVIDIA 560.35.03.</p>
<p>Hopefully then, this will mean less potential lock-ups in certain games on systems like the Steam Deck, which has in the past been a bit notorious for VRAM spiking up and then the system just locking up. Something I and many others have seen in God of War and various other AAA games.</p>
<p>Various other enhancements like support for emulated cursors was implemented for the D3D9 cursor API, allowing games to properly set an image as the mouse cursor.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">For D3D9, a fix was implemented for Unreal Engine 3 games that was causing some visual inaccuracies. They also noted some D3D9 games that had specific fixes including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ascension to the Throne.</li>
<li>Command &amp; Conquer: Generals.</li>
<li>King's Bounty: Warriors of the North.</li>
<li>Tomb Raider: Legend.</li>
<li>Rayman 3.</li>
</ul>
<p>Onto D3D11 / DXGI there's also improvements to "reduce system memory pressure and improve stability in 32-bit games" resulting in fixes for Total War: Rome II, Total War: Warhammer III and Ryse: Son of Rome. But some CPU-bound games will see lower performance like Shadow Warrior 2.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13397927841731400614gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some more games that had specific fixes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.</li>
<li>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Campaign Remastered.</li>
<li>Diablo 4.</li>
<li>The Sims 4.</li>
<li>Vindictus.</li>
<li>Yakuza 0 and Yakuza Kiwami.</li>
<li>Dishonored 2.</li>
<li>Tales of Arise.</li>
</ul>
<p>This release also brings an SDL3 backend for DXVK-Native, for using DXVK with Native Linux games.</p>
<p>See more in <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v2.5" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the release notes</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>If you're curious on how to upgrade, you <em>don't</em> actually need to do anything. Proton and GE-Proton use DXVK directly, and so they both pull in updates in their new releases. However, for those who like to live on the <em>wild</em> side, you <em>can</em> upgrade the DXVK version in Proton yourself. Do it at your own risk.</p>
<p>To do so you can just overwrite the existing DXVK files with the release download of the latest DXVK. You can find your Proton install <em>somewhere</em> like this (depending on your Steam Library drives):</p>
<p>For Proton 9 and Proton Experimental:</p>
<p><code>path-to-your/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Proton x.x/files</code></p>
<p>Proton 8 and below:</p>
<p><code>path-to-your/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Proton x.x/dist</code></p>
<p><em>Where x.x is whatever Proton version installed you wish to give a new DXVK.</em></p>
<p>Inside there you will see "lib" and "lib64", for 32bit and 64bit. Inside each of those, there's a "wine" folder and inside there is a "dxvk" folder and that's where you replace the files with new versions. If you mess anything up, one way to ensure it gets reinstalled cleanly is just to remove the "/dist" folder.</p>

      <title>Valve dev details more on the work behind making Steam for Linux more stable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/steam-game-recording-has-officially-launched/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Game Recording was recently released</a>, which came as part of a big Stable Steam Client update that noted it had fixes for "miscellaneous common crashes" on Linux. Now we know a little more on what's happening behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Coming from a <a href="https://ttimo.typepad.com/blog/2024/11/the-steam-client-update-earlier-this-week-mentions-fixed-some-miscellaneous-common-crashes-in-the-linux-notes-which-i-wante.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> from developer Timothée Besset, who does a lot of Valve work, Besset mentions how a change to how they approach the <em>setenv</em> and <em>getenv</em> functions that made the "most significant impact to Steam client stability on Linux".</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">For some context:</p>
<ul>
<li>setenv: change or add an environment variable.</li>
<li>getenv: get an environment variable.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to Besset, one of their colleagues claimed <em>setenv</em> as "the worst Linux API", even though it's such a common API available across all platforms "it was a little difficult to convince ourselves just how bad it is" — ouch. And they already knew, at least on Linux, that "setenv and getenv aren't safe to use in multithreaded environments".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3170509671731398948gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3170509671731398948gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Steam Client</em></p>
<p>Part of their problem though is how on Linux you have so many distributions with different window managers, desktop environments, driver versions, extensive user customization and so on. So their own crash reports end up "very noisy". Another issue is that setenv will at times in a multithreaded program "crash outright", on top of that they found that "other threads would blow up though, usually with a SIGABRT, shortly after calling getenv", and their backtraces for the crashes were "all over the place and could not be easily tied to a single cause".</p>
<p>So what did they do? Here's what:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>We removed the majority of <code class="inline-code">setenv</code> calls. It was mostly used when spawning processes, and refactoring to use <code class="inline-code">exevpe</code> to pass down a prepared environment is an all around improvement.</li>
<li>We reduced how much we rely on <code class="inline-code">getenv</code>, mostly by caching the calls. There is still an uncomfortable amount of it, but it's in OS libraries at this point (x11, xcb, dbus etc.) and we continue reducing it's usage.</li>
<li>For the few remaining <code class="inline-code">setenv</code> use cases that could not be easily refactored, we introduced an 'environment manager' that pre-allocates large enough value buffers at startup for fixed environment variable names, before any threading has started.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a fun little read worth a couple minutes of your time if you're interested on behind the scenes info, and how at times building for Linux can be a minefield.</p>
<p>According to a comment on the post, these issues are in fact being <a href="https://patchwork.sourceware.org/project/glibc/list/?series=36745" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">worked on</a> in glibc, so it may not be such a problem in future for Linux developers.</p>
<p>The more stable it is, the better the experience will be for people switching to Linux, and of course for the Steam Deck too since SteamOS is Linux. Nice to see Valve developers constantly trying to make everything better.</p>

      <title>New Steam Beta has more Game Recording improvements and a Linux fix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released another update to the Steam Beta Client for Steam Deck and Desktop Steam, which includes more improvements and tweaks to Game Recording.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's what the listed in the Desktop <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/4489619632029696340?snr=2___" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed some outdated or missing strings in non-English languages.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Game Recording</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed layout issues in the BPM Game Recording settings page.</li>
<li>Added export time to the progress bar in the send to phone dialog.</li>
<li>Increased Instant Clip default duration from 10s to 30s.</li>
<li>Fixed a race condition which could prevent audio recording.</li>
<li>(Windows) Prevent Windows mixer settings from affecting output level when recording game audio.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Linux</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed native titles occasionally running in the wrong runtime.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">And then for the Steam Deck <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4472731215261073652" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>

<li>Instant clip duration is now configurable in gaming mode.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Linux</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed native titles occasionally running in the wrong runtime.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They're mostly the same apart from the difference in timing on the clip defaults for Game Recording, and Valve added the clip duration configuration to the Steam Deck's Gaming Mode. </p>

      <title>Valve announced the Steam Deck OLED: Limited Edition White</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I am terribly jealous of anyone who is able to grab one of these. Valve just announced the Steam Deck OLED: Limited Edition White is coming soon.</p>
<p>Available starting November 18th at 11PM UTC, like the previous Limited Edition there will be only limited quantities available so it's very much first come first served until they run out. Unlike the other Limited Edition though that was US only, this will be available <em>everywhere</em> the Steam Deck currently is and that includes the newly launched Australia region.</p>
<p>Stock will be allocated "proportionally" across each region, with separate availability between US, CA, UK, EU, AU, and regions covered by KOMODO (Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12505343581731396832gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Valve say the Steam Deck OLED: Limited Edition White has all the <em>same</em> specs as the Steam Deck OLED 1TB model, but in white and grey (and it comes with an exclusive white carrying case).</p>
<p>Same price as the previous translucent Limited Edition at $679 USD.</p>
<p>Why are they doing this? From the press email sent to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last year, we released a smoky translucent limited edition Steam Deck OLED as an experiment to find out if there was interest in alternative colorways (there was!). This is our second experiment along those lines. The difference this time (aside from the color!) is that we're able to ship the Limited Edition White to all regions where Steam Deck already ships. We're curious to see what the response is, and will use what we learn to inform future decisions about any potential new color variants down the line.</p>
<p>We've been super happy with the reception of Steam Deck since we first launched the LCD version in March of 2022. We've always said our intent is to continually work on improving Steam Deck, and that's true from both a software perspective (continuing to ship improvements) and a hardware one (Steam Deck OLED, as well as ongoing work toward the future of Steam Deck and other hardware plans).</p>
<p>As always, we're looking forward to hearing feedback from customers once we start shipping.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keep an eye on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Deck website</a> for when it goes live to buy one. It's restricted to 1 per account, and you must have made a Steam purchase before November 2024 to be able to buy one.</p>

      <title>Rogue Point is a new tactical shooter from Half-Life remake Black Mesa developer Crowbar Collective</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Crowbar Collective are moving on from Half-Life remake Black Mesa, teaming up with Team17 as publisher for their new tactical FPS Rogue Point. They're not using the Source Engine this time, instead going with Unreal Engine.</p>
<p>This is an online co-op tactical FPS rogue-lite that the developer says is "perfect for both fresh recruits and seasoned veterans, presenting an accessible entry point that reveals layers of depth for those who seek a challenge". Check out the first trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="jFQvOaxl6lk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6cceb203bd4555d59dfdbfde8d0e9680.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/jFQvOaxl6lk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Unlock cosmetics, weapons and campaign modifiers to create loadouts specific to the needs of the mission.</li>
<li>Plan and shoot your way through a dynamic campaign, where no two playthroughs are alike.</li>
<li>Each MERX class presents a unique threat, that challenges you in new and surprising ways.</li>
<li>Evolve operators' skills, interacting with the rogue-lite element of the game.</li>
<li>Gather Intel, plan your assault, and adapt your strategy along the way. Fight your way through missions spread across 4 diverse locations, with each map reshaped by the game's Parametric Design System, offering new strategies and challenges with every play.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not clear if it will have Linux support like Black Mesa, I emailed them to confirm, but they only sent the announcement email about the game shortly before the public announcement. They did only recently do a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/black-mesa-has-a-new-beta-with-way-better-support-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">big upgrade in Beta for Black Mesa on Linux</a>.</p>
<p>From the press email — CEO and Project Lead, Adam Engels, said: “We’re very excited to share that we have partnered with Team 17 for our upcoming co-op shooter, Rogue Point. We cannot wait to go in depth about the game, and everything we learned while creating a new IP (as well as turning Crowbar Collective into a full time development studio). We can’t thank Team 17 enough for their support and expertise. Just like Black Mesa, we want to heavily involve the community in our development and updates. Our community was critical in the Early Access of Black Mesa and having Team 17 as a partner for Rogue Point helps us focus on development and community feedback!”</p>

      <title>With lovely artwork, go prospecting in the wild west one tile at a time in ColdRidge</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ColdRidge is a tile-based exploration strategy game that puts you in the wild west. As a prospector, you'll pick contracts and venture out to do some exploring. <em>Note: key provided by the developer.</em></p>
<p>I've seen quite a few websites previously state before it was released (even when it had a demo) that it was a bit like the early turns of Civilization games. Really, it's <em>nothing</em> like it though. So if you read that elsewhere, get it out of your mind first. Yes you explore tiles, and it's turn-based, but that's about as far as the comparison goes.</p>
<p>Here you control a single person and pick some contracts of things to find that they want, then set off by yourself to go and explore — and hopefully hit the quota of each contract you pick. Things like finding bison, wood, creating a special "portal" on a tile enabling you to warp to it at any point in the current year, or even just going over specific tiles as many times as possible giving you more and more gold each time you do.</p>
<p>There's no combat, no building, just pure tile-clicking in a world that's beautifully styled with some chill-out tunes to keep you focused. You have a limited amount of turns, and so planning your exploration is the key to the game and what makes it a surprising challenge. The challenge is of the casual and relaxing sort though, since it's just click-click-click in the tiles to move around.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14039558001731342807gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>You might think that sounds simple, and well — it is. But that's only a small part of it. There's a fair amount to discover in the game outside of just the basic contracts you take. And to help you on your way, once you finish an expedition, you're then able to stock up on a few goods based on the amount of gold you've personally received for doing a good job. Or not, if you fail a contract, you'll <em>lose</em> some of that precious shiny gold.</p>
<p>Guild Merchants can offer to give you various consumables like a map that reveals a few tiles, give you extra days for your expeditions, reveal tiles containing specific resources and more. You can only stack a few items at a time, ready to then use at any point during your expedition.</p>
<p>As you explore you may come across lost prospectors which have optional extra contracts you can take from them, which you have to be careful on given that you might only have a few turns left, but the extra gold is worth it if you can manage it. You can also come across special merchants, who will have permanent items you can buy and stack in a different set of inventory slots to have things like a special pot that increases in value constantly, additional gold when claiming, consumable price reductions and plenty more.</p>
<p>Once you finish the current expedition, you'll see a nice end of turn sequence where a group will venture out into the tiles you put down flags on to carry off the resources leaving the tiles empty. And from there, you then repeat the picking of contracts (which you can individually re-roll for a price), buying from the merchant and then setting off in a direction of your choosing hoping to fulfil your contracts to keep making a profit.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BhXA1aqDRH8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/aac419c6af02e6a9f0a22e32e704a292.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BhXA1aqDRH8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Each chapter of the game is split across a few years, with you doing multiple expeditions in each year until your time is up to then move onto unlocking the next chapter of the game. When a year is up, if you do manage to hit your quota, then you'll be given a fresh map wiped by the Winter to go exploring again.</p>
<p>Each time you finish a run (succeed or fail) you will begin to unlock more of the game regardless to access more permanent items, more consumable types and other extras depending on how much gold you earned during your run.</p>
<p>A really lovely exploration game that can get quite challenging. It's all about planning ahead and weighing up options to maximise your own profit. Good stuff. Worth picking up.</p>
<p>Developed by Frog Collective, a newer indie studio based in France that was formed by two AMPLITUDE Studios veterans. They previously worked on all of AMPLITUDE Studios' strategy games like the ENDLESS franchise and HUMANKIND.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The Native Linux version works to perfection as far as I can see. Although I expected it would given that it's made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>. Going with Godot, the developer said: "We decided to build on Godot because we’re believers in open source initiatives for gaming, we hope to do our part and contribute in the future.".</p>

      <title>House Hopper is a funny and challenging golf-like 3D platformer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After trying their previous demo, I was totally sold on the golf-like 3D platformer House Hopper, and now it's officially out.</p>
<p>Using a few different household objects, you throw yourself around various rooms in a house to gather up all the keys. The physics of it, and the shape of the items, makes it quite a challenging game and pretty funny to play through too. One that will test you but not overly frustrating, since the physics of it you can usually gauge how you will land…usually. Each room you flip and flop into gives its own set of unique challenges.</p>
<p>Check out the release trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="VsN17L1JVxs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/234d34f1cbeb52cec8f1a8a241746a13.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/VsN17L1JVxs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>House Hopper is a game about falling, falling some more, bouncing off of everything and at times setting yourself on fire. It's Golf but not the Golf you're thinking of. A nice little break from all the survivor-likes that have been released recently, at least not every developer is doing one (even if I love them).</p>
<p>House Hopper has Native Linux support that appeared to work great. Worth a shot!</p>

      <title>NVIDIA detail upcoming Linux driver features for Wayland and explain current support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA have a new official forum post up detailing the the state of Wayland on their Linux drivers, along with plans for upcoming features. Really nice to see NVIDIA being more open on their communication.</p>
<p>Written up by NVIDIA dev Aaron Plattner it firstly goes over some features not supported on Wayland due to a lack of support by Wayland compositors or the Wayland protocol. Here's what simply will not be supported:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Stereo rendering using GLX/EGL/Vulkan</li>
<li>Implicit SLI Mosaic
	<ul>
<li>This feature refers to when an application presents to a virtual display which is tiled across multiple physical displays.</li>
<li>Please see below for how “Explicit SLI” will be supported.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>nvidia-settings will not offer same level of configuration.
	<ul>
<li>There is no cross-compositor method for configuration that would allow nvidia-settings to manage displays on Wayland as it does on X11. nvidia-settings will still provide details about the system and power usage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Other features will be supported through Vulkan Direct to Display like:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Stereo rendering
	<ul>
<li>VK_KHR_multiview provides optimization for drawing multiple viewports.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Vulkan Explicit SLI
	<ul>
<li>Will be supported through VK_KHR_device_group</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Swap Groups
	<ul>
<li>Supported by VK_NV_present_barrier</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Frame Lock and Genlock</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps more exciting then, right now, is what NVIDIA plan to bring to their future driver releases. They've outlined this as well noting some of these are either already in progress, or at least planned to be implemented as the Wayland ecosystem continues to evolve. So you can look forward to:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Multi-monitor VRR on Wayland will be in an upcoming release.</li>
<li>nvidia-drm fbdev=1 parameter set by default
	<ul>
<li>This helps fix invalid output with compositors when nvidia-drm and simpledrm have device nodes driving the same display</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>nvidia-drm modeset=1 parameter set by default</li>
<li>Display multiplexers (muxes) are typically used in laptops with both integrated and discrete GPUs to provide a direct connection between the discrete GPU and the built-in display (internal mux) or an external display (external mux). On X11, the display mux can be automatically switched when a full-screen application is running on the discrete GPU, enabling enhanced display features and improved performance, but no Wayland compositors currently support this functionality.</li>
<li>Advanced display pipeline features including warp and blend, pixel shift, and the COLOR_ENCODING/COLOR_RANGE plane properties.
	<ul>
<li>These features may be exposed through DRM properties to allow compositors to use them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Front-buffer rendering in GLX with Xwayland.</li>
<li>nvidia-drm Presentation Timing information.</li>
<li>VDPAU support on Wayland.</li>
<li>vGPU support on Wayland.</li>
</ul>

      <title>s&amp;box the spiritual successor to Garry&#39;s Mod now has a Steam page up</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Making it easier to follow along and get notified when it's available, s&amp;box the spiritual successor to Garry's Mod now has a Steam page up.</p>
<p>Unlike Garry's Mod, it's not just going to be a platform for people to make games in, Facepunch plan to let you export games with it like a full game engine too. Using Valve's Source 2, Facepunch say they're working with Valve to properly license it so there will be no licensing fees or royalties for developers to pay. For those who stick to using s&amp;box directly, they will also be working on a monetization platform but details on that are still to be worked out.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15188792301731321312gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15188792301731321312gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - s&amp;box editor</em></p>
<p>Currently in an "open developer preview" it's not yet ready for the masses but Facepunch have been steadily expanding it. You can get access on the <a href="https://sbox.game" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully it will all work nicely with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a> to play the games on Linux / Steam Deck. I did try it myself today in a game or two, but performance seemed to be quite <em>atrocious</em> on my pretty powerful desktop so it seems Proton compatibility is not great just yet.</p>

      <title>City-building on a massive creature, The Wandering Village - Research &amp; Economy update is live</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Wandering Village is a city-builder where you're building on the back of a big walking creature, it's wonderful and a big new update is out now with Research &amp; Economy.</p>
<p>From Stray Fawn Studio it's still in Early Access and has been since September 2022 but is already worth playing! It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified too! Compared with other city-builders, it feels really different with you never knowing quite what's coming, and with the events system it keeps you on your toes. It also just looks really darn cool to see the creature moving about with all your people running around on its back.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19853584101731321378gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The major changes / highlights from this update include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The research system has received a major overhaul. Unlocking new technologies now costs resources, and everything has been unified in a single tree. The tree's design has also been overhauled to show all important information at a glance.</li>
<li>Onbu's back is now full of dense forests, large rocks and more. Your villagers will have to plan around these natural obstacles at first, and gradually free up more space to expand their village.</li>
<li>Build Woodcutting Camps and Mining Camps to automatically let your workers harvest nearby resources. And when the resources are exhausted, simply move the camps to a new location!</li>
<li>Nomads will want to join your village regularly as long as you manage to keep your villagers' happiness high enough.</li>
<li>The game now features two completely rebalanced difficulty modes, "Relaxed" and "Survival". In contrast to the old "Novice" mode, "Relaxed" will never get too difficult.</li>
<li>The tutorial has been completely reworked and adapted to all new and updated game mechanics.</li>
<li>Two new building materials, clay and brick, have been added to add more depth to building construction.</li>
<li>Five new Onbu food spots have been added! Each one comes with its unique up- and downsides.</li>
<li>Scavenging has received an overhaul. You can see the expected resources beforehand to make an informed decision, but be wary - something unexpected may always happen!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a lot more to it than that in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1121640/view/4478359995220492849" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>
<p>Really looking forward to seeing the finished product on this one.</p>

      <title>Luanti (formerly Minetest) v5.10.0 out now bringing UI updates, fancier shaders, renaming work</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/minetest-breaks-the-chains-of-being-a-minecraft-clone-with-a-new-name-luanti/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Minetest now called Luanti</a>, a fresh release is out bringing work towards getting things renamed along with some new features and fixes. Luanti itself is <em>not</em> a game, it's a voxel game engine, so instead you add games and mods into it like <a href="https://content.luanti.org/packages/Wuzzy/mineclone2/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">VoxeLibre</a>.</p>
<p>As of version 5.10.0 that's out now there's some compatibility changes with OpenGL ES 1.0 no longer supported, you need at least OpenGL ES 2.0, and basic shaders are starting to become a requirement now too.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two new updates for community-build versions of Proton are out now. As is tradition for GE-Proton, a hotfix arrived to fix problems and a new version of Proton-Sarek (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/check-out-proton-sarek-if-you-have-an-older-gpu-for-windows-games-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">that I recently wrote about</a>) for older GPUs is also out.</p>
<p><em>Confused on Proton? See <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my beginner's guide</a>.</em></p>
<p>GE-Proton 9-20 quickly followed on from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/ge-proton-9-19-brings-fixes-for-horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-monster-hunter-wilds-and-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the recent GE-Proton 9-19</a> release that includes these changes:</p>
<blockquote>

<li>DXVK updated with <code class="inline-code">dxvk.hideIntegratedGraphics = True</code> for Diablo IV (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/commit/125f0acefdb5c7e9422fc7b5afffc442d9cef34d" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">doitsujin/dxvk@<tt>125f0ac</tt></a>) to resolve the grey screen issue on systems with AMD iGPU + dGPU.</li>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Global Prefix Update:</strong></p>

<li><strong>Removed outdated customizations</strong> initially added to resolve issues that are now addressed in current versions of Wine and Proton.</li>
<li><strong>Two-week testing</strong> confirmed that previous issues are resolved, allowing removal of these customizations to avoid potential conflicts.</li>
<li><strong>No impact on other customizations</strong>: Changes only apply to the Global Prefix. Custom prefixes for specific games, including those from GE-Proton, Wine-GE, and additional Sarek-specific prefixes, remain unaffected.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Need for Speed (2003-2008) Mod Support:</strong></p>
<ul>

<li>Need for Speed: Underground 2</li>
<li>Need for Speed: Most Wanted</li>
<li>Need for Speed: ProStreet</li>
<li>Need for Speed: Undercover</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Executable naming requirement</strong>: Ensure your game executable matches one of the following for mod compatibility:
	<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">speed.exe</code>, <code class="inline-code">speed2.exe</code>, <code class="inline-code">nfs.exe</code>, or <code class="inline-code">nfsc.exe</code></li>

      <title>Sony say their PSN account requirement on PC is so you can enjoy their games &#39;safely&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sony forcing you to have a PlayStation Network account for all their recent PC releases hasn't been well liked, and they of course have no plans to back down on it.</p>
<p>During the latest Sony Group Corporation <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/fast/20241108/f5KHiS63/202503_2q_02_en/index.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">investors call</a> in their Q&amp;A session at about 45:40, a question came up about what lessons they will take away from Concord (which Sony shut down and then closed the game studio).</p>
<p>Hiroki Totoki (President, COO and CFO) replied with an English translation from a live interpreter, so the translation is a bit loose and <em>rough</em>, but this is what was said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Regarding that matter we have learned a lot. The way to face the issues regarding PC for instance, the PlayStation accounts that we have offered, by offering them for instance, sometimes that tends to invite push-back. But for the live service games, so in order to maintain order of the gaming, so that anybody can enjoy the game safely, we need to create environment conducive to that, of course enjoying the game freely. </p>
<p>Having some restrictions, may not call it rule, but to ask the users and gamers to follow the manner, and those balances are very important and we have to continue to seek the best way to achieve this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly the PSN requirement isn't going anywhere, and will be in all their future games, even though it's unpopular and locks out a whole lot of regions from buying their games. Sony want that extra control over their games, especially when they're now releasing outside of their own PlayStation console.</p>
<p>In <em>some</em> ways, it makes sense for their online live-service games, and you do have to remember the context of the question was for Concord that was <em>supposed</em> to be live-service. </p>
<p>However, it really makes very little sense for their single-player games where it's also now forced like Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, Until Dawn, God of War Ragnarök and more to come. Forcing online accounts for single-player games is never going to go down well but it's here to stay for Sony's PC releases.</p>

      <title>Steam Beta gets fixes for WiFi on Steam Deck, plus AMD GPU startup crash on Desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Following on from the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/steam-game-recording-has-officially-launched/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">big release of Steam Game Recording</a> in the stable Steam Client, there's a new smaller Beta available for Steam Deck and Desktop.</p>

<p>And the rest of the changes from the Desktop changelog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a potential startup crash on systems with an AMD GPU.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Game Recording</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue with the layout of the recording player in Big Picture.</li>
<li>Updated the Game Properties Game Recording tab to more accurately reflect the current state of the Game Recording feature.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a case where a controller could not show up in the UI the very first time it was connected for an account.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steam VR</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue with certain keys on the keyboard causing unexpected behavior.</li>
<li>Restores single-click Exit VR functionality</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Linux VR interface would show the incorrect UI</li>
</ul>

      <title>AYANEO 3 now officially announced with AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 and HDR OLED</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The AYANEO 3 has now had more of a proper announcement with more details and a clear picture of what it actually looks like.</p>
<p>Announced today it will come in two models with either the AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 or the AMD Ryzen 7 8840U. You also get two different screen options between a 7" high-refresh LCD horizontal display and a 7" high-refresh high-brightness HDR OLED. AYANEO didn't say, but I <em>presume</em> the older AMD Ryzen chip will be paired up with the plain LCD screen to make their manufacturing simpler and cheaper.</p>
<p>AYANEO also said it will have new rear buttons and trigger lock keys, an "impressive leap in audio quality" along with "several proprietary key components" with more info to be revealed later.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12367834241731089312gol1.jpeg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - AYANEO 3, credit: AYANEO.</em></p>
<p>And of course, there's some fancy lighting around the thumbsticks too because everything <em>gamer</em> related has to has some form of RGB lighting.</p>
<p>They also put up a video for the announcement:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="GWObbquf1l4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/242ab6a7e87a1b7d87197c0fa2ff7c01.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/GWObbquf1l4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They have not yet revealed a price. So while yes, it's an announcement, it's still pretty lacking in many details.</p>
<p>As a big fan of gaming handhelds as a regular Steam Deck gamer, I'm keen to see this hardware category continue to evolve, especially with a bit more power to run more of the latest games at acceptable performance.</p>
<p>For this though, since it will ship with Windows, we'll be waiting on the likes of Bazzite and ChimeraOS to get support for it hooked up for running Linux on it. Hopefully they won't have too much trouble with whatever these "proprietary key components" turn out to be, which does cause some concern.</p>
<p>So far then, it seems very much like their usual refresh of their handhelds, certainly <em>nothing</em> they've said comes even close to the "revolution" they <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/ayaneo-tease-the-ayaneo-3-as-a-revolution-and-a-completely-new-concept/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">initially announced it as</a>.</p>
<p>More info when I have it.</p>

      <title>Steam gets new tools for game devs to offer players version switching in-game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve announced something that I'm sure a lot of game developers and players will appreciate: new APIs to allow developers to have version switching directly in their games!</p>
<p>Steam has long a way for players to <em>manually</em> opt into a Beta individually per-game, if one is available. This can be used for testing new features or for accessing previous versions. However the current system is somewhat obscure, and relies on you looking around various Steam news posts or forum posts for each game to know if there's a new feature Beta available, or if they provide an older version of the game you can switch over to via the Beta system.</p>
<p>Valve's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4547039255696769967" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> makes it clear that the idea of this new set of APIs is to allow game developers to present this to gamers <em>directly</em> in-game. Valve give some examples on why developers may want to use this like preserving game saves when making major changes to your game, something Paradox Interactive do with their various strategy games. Like this for Stellaris:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4109455851731088033gol1.png"/></p>
<p>So with the new system, developers could just put this in-game directly.</p>
<p>As part of this, a recent Steam client update also shows you on the game page in your Library when you have a Beta picked:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1412717731731088693gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Really seems like a nice addition that I'm surprised hasn't been a thing until now. Hopefully more developers will think about keeping older versions available now, especially with Valve suggesting it as a good idea in some cases.</p>

      <title>Strategy game ZEPHON from the devs of Warhammer 40,000: Gladius is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Proxy Studios who made Warhammer 40,000: Gladius have just released their brand new 4x strategy game ZEPHON. It comes with Native Linux support. It's <em>similar</em> to Gladius in a lot of ways, but set in their own universe that they can continue to expand on.</p>
<p>"Control the survivors of humanity in a near-future apocalypse of alien origin. Pick a path between the indifferent abominations of the Voice and the uncaring automata of ZEPHON, with city management, turn-based tactical combat, unholy research, diplomatic maneuvering, and branching narrative quests. Gather your allies and pick your actions wisely.</p>
<p>On the planet Earth, that was once a cradle of life, the extinction of humanity is at hand."</p>
<p>Release trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zZXl5I73vys"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7c875cc338647d066581db592ab19351.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zZXl5I73vys" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking over email the developer previously said to me: "Our previous game, Gladius, has been played by over 1.5 million players. In Zephon we did some fun stuff to tackle the "endgame problem" in 4X games, leaned heavily into Souls-like world-building and added narrative design elements to reward players who play multiple sessions (inspired by Hades and co.)."</p>
<p>Looks like a good one! The developer did send me a pre-release key but I haven't had time to write up any extended thoughts on it just yet, but from what I played it was really interesting and worked well on a technical level.</p>

      <title>Fedora KDE gets approval to be upgraded to sit alongside Fedora Workstation</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fedora Workstation with GNOME is the main edition of the Fedora Linux distribution, but their Fedora KDE Desktop Spin just got approval to become a lot more important.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/tickets/issue/504" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noted</a> on their issue tracker, a proposal titled "Request to upgrade Fedora KDE Desktop Spin to Edition status under the Personal Systems WG" has now been approved! From the proposal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As discussed at Flock, the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/KDE" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Fedora KDE SIG</a> and the newly forming <a href="https://pagure.io/fedora-personalsystems/wg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Fedora Personal Systems Working Group</a> that will oversee the SIG are requesting that the Fedora KDE Plasma Desktop spin be upgraded to Edition status for Fedora Linux 42.</p>
<p>This includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Listing Fedora KDE Plasma Desktop Edition at the same level as Fedora Workstation Edition on fedoraproject.org</li>
<li>Production of a flagship site page for Fedora KDE similar to Fedora Workstation on fedoraproject.org</li>
<li>Marketing support in a similar vein to Workstation at events</li>
</ul>
<p>The Fedora KDE SIG will withdraw <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/FedoraPlasmaWorkstation" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">its Change for Fedora Linux 42 to replace GNOME with KDE Plasma on Workstation</a> with the acceptance of this request."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was opened 2 months ago, and was formally approved about 16 hours ago.</p>
<p>Now the work begins for the KDE maintainers at Fedora to get it all ready, and sometime soon hopefully it will then be prominently listed on the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Fedora website</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20185156231731071134gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Fedora KDE</em></p>
<p>As someone who mains KDE Plasma as their desktop environment, because I think it's fantastic, I'm really happy to see this happen.</p>

      <title>Comedy renaissance artwork styled adventure Death of the Reprobate is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Out now with Linux support is Death of the Reprobate, a comedy point and click adventure game styled like renaissance artwork from Joe Richardson.</p>
<p>This is the third and final instalment of the Immortal John Triptych, spiritual successor to Four Last Things and The Procession to Calvary. You don't need to have played previous games though, it's thoroughly funny and weird to play through entirely by itself. If you love classic British comedy like Monty Python, you're going to love this.</p>
<p>Check out the release trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="G_OoKQ1E15c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/30124f7cce6513c5fc637ba282666d5a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/G_OoKQ1E15c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Pointing and Clicking – A traditional point and click interface, with a 'verb coin' interaction menu and a simple inventory from which you can drag and drop your preciously hoarded items.</li>
<li>Renaissance Artwork – Renaissance, Rococo and even a hint of Romanticism, to be a little more precise. Hundreds of paintings, spanning hundreds of years, are all brought together into one consistent world.</li>
<li>Classical Music – Music by Eduardo Antonello. Period appropriate music that adapts as the story progresses, recorded using real medieval/renaissance instruments.</li>
<li>Standalone Story – Death of the Reprobate is set in the same world as Four Last Things and The Procession to Calvary, and features some recurring characters/themes, but it can be played independently.</li>
<li>Highbrow Buffoonery – Lofty subject matter is treated with gleeful flippancy. Gags about butts are taken very seriously. But rest assured, while some of the jokes may be ridiculous, the puzzles make perfect sense! (or at least adhere to a consistent internal logic)</li>
</ul>

      <title>Cross-platform Nexus Mods app expands Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 support plus further UI improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I can't tell you how excited I am for the future of modding, with Nexus building their cross-platform open source Nexus Mods app. Another new build is out now with v0.6.3. Still very experimental overall though, with each update needing you to purge all previous files, so play with it at your own risk for now until they decide it's ready to support upgrades.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5772133201731069357gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5772133201731069357gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The app currently supports Stardew Valley, Cyberpunk 2077 and Baldur's Gate 3. More will be added as they work on the various features needed. The <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/nexus-mods-new-cross-platform-app-adds-support-for-heroic-games-launcher-and-baldurs-gate-3/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previous update</a> even added support for games from the Heroic Games Launcher!</p>

<li>Collections allow users to modify the included mods but do not allow you to reset them to the original state.</li>

      <title>Valve&#39;s Deadlock adds proper Steam Input support with Steam Deck improvements and a new hero</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While we still have no idea when Deadlock from Valve will get a properly public launch, since it's still invite-only, they do keep expanding the game in some major ways. Another big update just rolled out to this third-person MOBA.</p>
<p>Another new hero has entered the Hero Labs testing ground with Trapper:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14970522781731066293gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14970522781731066293gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Valve also expanded the Hero Labs availability into Private Lobbies, Private Bot Games and Sandbox modes.</p>
<p>Making levelling up a bit simpler and quicker, there's now a Quickbuy system in the game. You can right-click items in the shop to add them to a queue, then you just need to pop to the shop to have them get automatically purchased.</p>
<p>On top of that Deadlock also now has full support of the new <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/steam-game-recording-has-officially-launched/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Game Recording</a> Timeline API so it will show markers for kills, deaths and more.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">For the new and improved Steam Input support here's what the developers did:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added all missing Steam Input Actions from the Key Bindings screen (including Fly Up/Fly Down)​</li>
<li>Added a "Replay Controls" action set​</li>
<li>Allow Steam Deck to see the Key Bindings Screen​</li>
<li>Improved Glyph Swapping behavior when mixing controller and keyboard inputs​</li>
<li>Added Controller tab to house Controller specific options.​</li>
<li>Added a Steam Input Configurator launch button.​</li>
<li>Added Glyph Locking options: { Automatic | Keyboard &amp; Mouse Only | Game Pad Only }​</li>
<li>Fixed crash in spectator mode when querying controller button state​</li>
<li>Fixed Controller not working until loading a level​</li>
<li>Official Steam Input configs for SteamDeck and DualSense have been updated​</li>
<li>Note: Legacy Analog Modes have been removed/replaced in favor of new Camera specific Steam Input modes. Some users may need to re-bind their joysticks/gyros.​</li>
</ul>
<p>There's lots more - see all in the <a href="https://forums.playdeadlock.com/threads/11-07-2024-update.44786/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update notes</a>.</p>
<p>To play it on Linux you need <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>. It's not clear if Valve will add a Native Linux version or not and it's not likely until much closer to the main release.</p>

      <title>Palworld dev details the patents Nintendo and The Pokemon Company are suing for</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-file-lawsuit-against-palworld-maker-pocketpair/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Back in September</a> Nintendo and The Pokemon Company filed a lawsuit in Japan against Palworld developer Pocketpair, and now we actually know why.</p>
<p>It's a messy situation and obviously given that it's Nintendo, a lot of media have wanted to know more specifics. So Pocketpair have put up a news post to do exactly that. Now remember this is about patents, not copyright, so it's not about any creatures included in Palworld.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, as Pocketpair make clear, that Palworld was released on January 19, 2024 here below are the patents that Pocketpair say Nintendo are using against them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Patent No. 7545191<br/>
[Patent application date: July 30, 2024]<br/>
[Patent registration date: August 27, 2024]<br/>
<br/>
Patent No. 7493117<br/>
[Patent application date: February 26, 2024]<br/>
[Patent registration date: May 22, 2024]<br/>
<br/>
Patent No. 7528390<br/>
[Patent application date: March 5, 2024]<br/>
[Patent registration date: July 26, 2024]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those individual patents were <em>all</em> applied for <em>after</em> Palworld was released. Looking through them it seems the focus of the patents covers game mechanics like catching creatures and riding creatures.</p>
<p>You might look at the dates Pocketpair gave there (which are correct) and think — well, they were filed after, so how can Nintendo sue using those? The answer is complicated. What Pocketpair <em>don't</em> say, is that these patents are from a <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7349486B2/en" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">parent patent</a> which was registered in 2021 and approved in 2023, meaning it very much does end up applying here to Palworld.</p>
<p>What are Nintendo after then? An injunction against Palworld, a payment of 5 million yen plus late payment damages to The Pokémon Company and a payment of 5 million yen plus late payment damages to Nintendo Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>So if Nintendo / The Pokémon Company win, and it's entirely possible based on the patent situation that they might, we will likely see Palworld no longer for sale.</p>
<p>See more in the Pocketpair <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The situation goes well beyond Palworld though. These patents for such specific game mechanics could stifle creativity in other games, and allow Nintendo to go after other game developers if they choose to do so. There's a growing amount of monster catching games, and this could end up causing future developers to reconsider making one. What a mess.</p>

<p>New since last covering include: Disney•Pixar Cars, Dishonored: Definitive Edition, Snakebird Complete, Close to the Sun, Bang Bang Racing.</p>
<p>There's lots more games coming throughout November including the likes of Tomb Raider: Anniversary, Blade of Darkness, Overcooked: Gourmet Edition, Chasm: The Rift, Elite Dangerous and more to come later.</p>
<p>The only one I'm <em>still</em> not including in this list is DOOM Eternal, as that's via the Microsoft Store (until Nov 13), which of course doesn't work at all on Steam Deck / Linux since it's a Windows-only thing. All the games in the list above you get to keep as Prime Gaming gives you a code to redeem!</p>
<p>You can install games from Epic, GOG and Amazon easily via <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/heroic-games-launcher-2152-released-fixing-amazon-gog-and-epic-games-issues/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Heroic Games Launcher</a>.</p>

      <title>The Spell Brigade is an online co-op survivor-like bullet-hell friendly-fire chaos festival</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Spell Brigade from Bolt Blaster Games looks like a fun mixture of online co-op action and survivor-like mayhem and it appears to have sold rather well. Somehow I <em>entirely</em> missed it as well, even though it has Native Linux support and looks genuinely fun.</p>
<p>Especially interesting that it has friendly fire, so no one in the arena is safe. Oh my. There's also special team-based objectives, so they're really turning the idea of what survivor-likes can be into something unique here. Have a little look at the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aWuqQ25JsAU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/860c6f2383e1957bad38450a8c1b25e7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aWuqQ25JsAU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As for how it's doing – they just announced it's sold over 125,000 in less than two months. Very impressive. That would put them somewhere near 1 million GBP£ (before deductions from Valve, taxes and so on). Goes to show clearly there's a <em>lot</em> of hunger for these quick survivor-like action games right now and so no surprise why so many developers are doing their own spin on the genre.</p>
<p>From the developer: "We had high hopes for our game, but this has exceeded all our expectations, and it's only the beginning."​ ​- Hans Jacobs, Game Director, Bolt Blaster Games</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Key Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Survivors-like Gameplay with Multiplayer Madness</strong>: Enjoy the thrill of fighting thousands of weird monsters together. Complete missions and upgrade spells as a team. Survive together!</li>
<li><strong>Team-Based Combat:</strong> Assemble your Brigade and traverse the mystical warpath together. Experience the benefits of fighting as a team, even if it means occasionally stepping on each other’s toes. Fear not, as even the most unfortunate deaths can be remedied through the power of sorcery &amp; friendship.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Spell System:</strong> Find, upgrade, and combine your spells with powerful elements. The game ensures that no two builds are ever the same, and with multiple wizards in your squad, the potential for pure, unhinged chaos is endless!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The Spell Brigade is also Steam Deck Verified. I have a key request in for this one today, so hopefully sometime soon I can have a proper look at it.</p>

      <title>Kojima Productions now fully controls the DEATH STRANDING IP, also now on Amazon Luna+</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In a press release shared today, Kojima Productions announced they now have full control over the DEATH STRANDING IP. The game has also landed on Amazon Luna.</p>
<p>A good time to try it, with a sequel on the way, and honestly it's just an amazing experience. I completed it across a mixture of Steam Deck and desktop Linux playtime and really thoroughly enjoyed it. There's truly nothing else like it with the strange blend of game mechanics.</p>
<p>Kojima Productions mentioned they "will continue its focus on bringing their award-winning IP, "DEATH STRANDING" to more platforms and audiences" and simply that they also "today confirmed that the studio now has full ownership of the DEATH STRANDING IP".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19435577761730992601gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>If you have an Amazon Prime subscription, you'll also be able to play it free on Amazon Luna from December 1st for a limited time, after you'll need to subscribe to Luna+ to continue (where it's also available right now). Surprisingly, it even released on Xbox today too.</p>
<p>Really hoping that Death Stranding 2 isn't exclusive to PlayStation for too long, it deserves to be played on PC. And thanks to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a> I expect it to work quite well on Linux at release.</p>
<p>Also 50% off on Steam until November 11 if you want to grab it cheaps right now.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA GeForce NOW will soon limit your hours per month but some memberships get upgraded</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA have announced some changes for the NVIDIA GeForce NOW game streaming service, so here's what you need to know. The service does work on Linux desktop and Steam Deck, and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/nvidia-make-it-easier-to-get-geforce-now-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NVIDIA even released a Steam Deck install script</a>, although last I checked NVIDIA were artificially limiting streams to 1080p on all Linux systems.</p>
<p>Firstly for people on the Priority plan (the first paid plan after Free): they're renaming it to Performance and giving it a bump up to 1440p from 1080p, with Ultrawide and support for saving graphics settings in certain games.</p>
<p>As for people on the Free plan NVIDIA say you will now "see they’re streaming from basic rigs, with varying specs that offer entry-level cloud gaming and are optimized for capacity".</p>
<p>Secondly, the big bit: they're going to cap subscribers to 100 hours of play time per month starting next year. They say this accounts for about "94% of their total members. 15 hours of unused playtime will automatically roll over to the next month, and you'll be able to buy 15 hours extra if you want ($2.99 Performance / $5.99 Ultimate).</p>
<p><em>Across a month with 30 days that would work out to a bit over 3 hours a day, every day.</em></p>
<p>If you're an existing <em>active</em> subscriber they will enable you to continue having unlimited playtime until January 2026, so you have until December 31st, 2024 to sign up and <em>stay</em> active to get that deal.</p>

      <title>Unrailed 2: Back on Track arrives in Early Access for more co-op chaos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Unrailed is a thoroughly entertaining and truly chaotic co-op game once it gets going, and now its bigger sequel has entered Early Access with Unrailed 2: Back on Track.</p>
<p>Just like the first game the idea is to clear a path and keep building a track for a train that will move between stations. This new edition to the series expands on it with a 4v4 versus mode (the previous game only had 2v2). If you liked the first game, it's an easy bet that you'll enjoy this one too. Seems like a careful evolution over the first game with new rewards and permanent upgrades with gameplay-modifying abilities, as well as new train engines, wagons and extensions to unlock. There's also the new custom map creation system included.</p>
<p>Release trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zNiFLdgPxl8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6569728187ab7b2ad5aa9a88a93473eb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zNiFLdgPxl8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The first game did have Native Linux support but this sequel currently does not. The developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2211170/discussions/0/4040354495827695993/#c4846526298375535907" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> in the Steam forum to note they may add it in a later update like they did with the first game. However, they also said for now "the Proton version works very well on the Steam Deck".</p>

      <title>Crazy vehicle combat rogue-lite REDLINE CROOKS is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>REDLINE CROOKS is a vehicle combat pixel-art rogue-lite from developer Alexander Golke that's officially out now. I played the heck out of the demo on this one, so it's an easy suggestion to go and grab. Worked great too and was a lot of fun just smashing cars around, especially when the boss vehicles appear.</p>
<p>More: "REDLINE CROOKS is a unique, fast-paced combat-racer combining roguelite elements and breakneck speeds to make for a one-of-a-kind, high-octane experience. Charge through walls, cops and more using anything ranging from a tuned-up sports car to a forklift lacking certification. Why outrun the long arm of the law when you can slam it into a wall instead?"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="VldPVeBuVXw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/af982d462e3218c1a11dbc41b9c8f57a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/VldPVeBuVXw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Pick one out of 9 playable convicts, each with distinct playstyles and character-specific upgrades.</li>
<li>Use the Boost to reach dangerously high speeds and blast through walls and enemies alike at the cost of your health.</li>
<li>Slam, blow up, launch, ram or otherwise destroy anyone looking to get you back behind bars, and be rewarded with cash and health.</li>
<li>Build an arsenal of powerful upgrades purchasable from the ever-trustworthy shopkeeper - there are over 100 items for you to mix and match, making every run unique.</li>
<li>Maneuver through randomly generated and fully destructible tracks, requiring constant improvisation.</li>
<li>Perform well to rank up, ramping up both the difficulty and the rewards you get using a God Hand-inspired difficulty scaling system.</li>
<li>Master the intricate mechanics and make it to the top of the online leaderboard, or just have a good time in this easy to play, hard to master experience.</li>
<li>Test your skills by completing jobs, earning stamps which can be exchanged for customization options and more.</li>
<li>Jam out to an awesome, original digital-fusion soundtrack by Adam Carey.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Another easy pick up and play game that has a Native Linux version available.</p>

      <title>Vampire Hunters turns Vampire Survivors into an FPS where you stack 14 weapons together</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There seems to be no end to games that will suck away all of my free time and now that Vampire Hunters is out now, it's also going into my regular rotation to blow off some steam. <em>Note: key originally provided for me.</em></p>
<p>I actually took a look at this originally in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Fv7ujr9YOA" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">video</a> for the Steam Deck well over a year ago. Back then though, it was a corridor-shooter where you just ran forwards blasting everything in your path. A good basic idea, but the gameplay just wasn't quite there. It was just too flat with it being a constant forwards runner. Now though? It's much more like Vampire Survivors in 3D as an FPS, with proper open levels to run around in — and that's great.</p>
<p>Here you run around shooting everything that comes you way, pick up experience orbs and when you level up you can pick up to 14 weapons to stack together to turn yourself into a one-person annihilation machine. There's various character buffs to choose, weapon upgrades as well and it just becomes pure and total chaos.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FJKtBTJj3N0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/823b73f8581b829b5b2ef28658bdbb1f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FJKtBTJj3N0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For players who like customization and progression there's plenty of that too. With multiple characters to choose from each with strengths and weaknesses, plus you can change starting equipment for each of them too. Outside of that as you progress more through the game, you will end up unlocking more and more to use during your next run. Then there's also character skill trees and permanent upgrades as well. Lots to keep you interested in playing more of it.</p>
<p>Since it's pretty over the top in both enemy numbers, and your screen filling up with weapons, it's nice to see there's a few accessibility options to help. You can play it like a proper FPS for starters, but by default weapons will auto-fire, so all you have to do is aim. You can also change the enemy outline that shows behind walls and objects to help you see them between a few different styles and colours - nice.</p>
<p>Plus, since you get a lot of weapons, you can also choose to have them combined down to one side, or both sides, to give you more room to focus. Which you'll probably need, because it's actually quite challenging once it gets going and you've got tons of enemies lining up from all directions.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stack Your Arsenal: </strong>Create mind-blowing builds by combining firearms, relics, artifacts, and character abilities.</li>
<li><strong>Slay Thousands: </strong>Battle against waves of vampires, demons, and other supernatural creatures.</li>
<li><strong>Fire At Will: </strong>Experience true control by switching between automatic and manual firing modes, giving you precise command over your arsenal.</li>
<li><strong>Unique Character Abilities: </strong>Each hunter has distinct playstyles and skill trees to customize your approach.</li>
<li><strong>Infinite Mayhem: </strong>Enjoy an engaging mix of old-school FPS action and roguelite gameplay, with an average playtime of around 20 hours and infinite replayability.</li>
<li><strong>Absurd, Cheesy, and Fun:</strong> Experience a lighthearted tone with exciting electronic disco vibes that make every session a blast!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you love the basic idea of Vampire Survivors to repeat runs, and create some utterly ridiculous character builds but prefer first-person shooters then this is absolutely for you. The shooting and destruction feels quite satisfying when you've got a nice stacked build of weapons.</p>
<p>On Steam Deck, I would suggest you drop it down to the Medium preset, otherwise later in the runs it may chug a little. But on medium it seemed to hold 45FPS quite nicely. Valve gave it the green Steam Deck Verified tick too. Naturally on desktop with even a slightly more powerful system it runs as well as you would expect it to.</p>

      <title>Disney-styled classic horror game Bye Sweet Carole looks great in the recent trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bye Sweet Carole is an upcoming chilling narrative-horror game inspired by classic animation movies like Disney along with the works of Chris Darril. Late last month a new trailer arrived and it looks good. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/bye-sweet-carole-blends-horror-with-what-looks-like-classic-disney-movies/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">A game I pointed out back in May</a> after somehow missing it before. I'm cautiously excited about this one, because the style really does look incredible, I just hope the gameplay is there too.</p>
<p>The new trailer shows off new gameplay and the awful owl, Velenia. Set in the early 1900s, in an age where the phenomenon of the feminist political movement begins to shake the British nation, Bye Sweet Carole takes players on a mysterious investigation of the eerie Bunny Hall orphanage where Lana Benton is the only one to suspect that her best friend Carole didn’t just run away.</p>
<p>Check it out below:</p>

<p>It's pretty high up on my own wishlist. You'll need <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a> to play it on Linux / Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is getting a free online co-op update soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth developer Edmund McMillen has announced that The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is soon to get a free online co-up update.</p>
<p>McMillen <a href="https://x.com/edmundmcmillen/status/1853502568863031303" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">mentioned</a> the update will come on November 18th and have "a full online co-op mode ( with completion markers ) along side a considerable balance update that heavily focuses on buffing items you guys believe are lackluster/bad".</p>
<p>The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth has a Native Linux build, but at this point it's unsupported, as the latest DLC The Binding of Isaac: Repentance doesn't even work with it. You should just use <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> and it's Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>What is it? The Binding of Isaac is a randomly generated action RPG shooter with heavy rogue-lite elements. Following Isaac on his journey players will find bizarre treasures that change Isaac’s form giving him super human abilities and enabling him to fight off droves of mysterious creatures, discover secrets and fight his way to safety.</p>

      <title>HORI Steam Controller releases in the USA in December</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're after a tightly integrated Steam Controller, maybe the new Wireless HORIPAD for Steam might be for you. And good news, it's finally releasing in the USA.</p>
<p>Originally <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/hori-announced-a-special-gamepad-for-steam-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced back in June</a> it was previously only available in Japan. At least now it's coming to the USA on December 16, many more people will be able to order it. This makes it significantly easier for everyone else too, since importing will be simpler.</p>
<p>Quite a feature-filled controller with 4 extra buttons (2 on the front at the bottom, 2 on the back) to program to do whatever you want. Unlike a lot of other controllers (I'm talking about you 8bitdo), you can actually change the extra buttons via Steam Input too. It also has Capacitive Touch thumbsticks, gyro, and dedicated Steam function buttons.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5804901501730886645gol1.png"/></p>
<p>HORI say it will give you about 12 hours of battery via Bluetooth, and can be used while plugged in and charging too. They claim full support of the Steam Deck, but curiously only say the wired mode via Xinput is for Windows 11/10 - likely they just haven't done any testing on desktop Linux.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">There are some downsides however, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>No rumble.</li>
<li>A built-in battery.</li>
<li>No headset jack.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can pre-order it on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLLKRFG8" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Amazon</a>. Priced at $59.99. More on their <a href="https://stores.horiusa.com/hpc-055U" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
<p>I'm a little torn. I don't need another controller, but I love tech, and it's a nice idea to have all the dedicated Steam buttons making it a great fit for my Steam Deck gaming when docked. Being able to actually have full support though of all the buttons directly via Steam is a big selling point for me. I've never really cared about rumble personally.</p>

      <title>Steam Game Recording has officially launched</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>No longer should you need external software just to record a fun clip of gameplay on Steam desktop and Steam Deck, with Steam Game Recording now officially live for everyone. Arriving as part of a big update to the Steam Client there's a lot of changes, which also has Valve drop support for Windows 7 and 8.</p>
<p>This system enables you to have continuous recording of gameplay, or you can set it to record manually on a hotkey. From there you can then clip it easily directly in the Steam client to share anywhere. It works for any game, even non-Steam games you've added to your library.</p>
<p>It comes with a new SDK and API developers can hook into as well. If a game adds direct support they can add various special markers to the recording timeline.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20073396591730884932gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Shipped as part of this update are some Steam Deck specific changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed games stored on an external drive still showing as available when the drive is removed.</li>
<li>Changed the enter action on the login password entry to attempt login rather than requiring navigation to the "submit" button.</li>
<li>Improve compatibility for native titles that have not been reviewed yet by launching them in the same runtime environment as reviewed titles.</li>
<li>Fixed a case where the Bluetooth settings tab would disappear if the system was in sleep mode for an extended period of time and resumed without an internet connection.</li>
<li>Fixed a case where controllers were unresponsive if a malfunctioning third party compatibility tool was installed.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And also various Linux improvements too:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed some miscellaneous common crashes.</li>
<li>Fixed slow startup on systems where the reverse hostname lookup for the loopback interface is not localhost.</li>
<li>Detecting and passing commands to an already running Steam client is significantly faster.</li>
<li>Added a -disable-screensaver-inhibit command line option to prevent Steam from inhibiting the screen saver when activity is detected.</li>
<li>Fixed Linux crash launching steamwebhelper occurring with some system configurations.</li>
<li>Steam developers can now select which Steam for Linux runtime to use for native titles. Please consult the partner site for more details.</li>
<li>Native titles will execute in 'Steam for Linux runtime 1.0 (scout)' by default, instead of the legacy runtime environment.<br/>
	This behavior is consistent with Steam Deck and promotes better compatibility across all Linux desktop distributions.<br/>
	Note that this new feature can be turned off globally with "-compat-force-slr off" on the Steam client command line.</li>
<li>Always allow the Steam client to fallback to X11 when SDL_VIDEODRIVER/SDL_VIDERO_DRIVER is set to wayland.</li>
<li>Removed the UI toggle to disable Steam Play globally, correctly reflecting that Steam Play is always enabled on Linux. Steam Play was always partially active even when set to off in the UI as it is a requirement for Steam client operation.</li>
<li>Fixed a case where the wrong DPI scaling factor would be used for systems using a non-gnome based session with an active gnome-desktop-portal service.</li>
<li>Extended recent Steam Play fixes to third party compatibility tools.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Lucky Tower Ultimate is an absurdly funny dungeon crawler you need to play</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lucky Tower Ultimate from Studio Seufz is probably one of the funniest real-time dungeon crawlers I've ever played and I can't wait to play more. Developed by Studio Seufz, who some might recognise from their previous game <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/03/the-longing-is-out-today-so-you-can-begin-your-own-400-day-adventure/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Longing</a> (which I also really liked).<em> Note: key provided by Evolve PR.</em></p>
<p>Older readers might recognise the name Lucky Tower too, since it was a series of Flash games from quite a few years ago. Lucky Tower Ultimate is the third in the series, updated for new audiences and given a modern rogue-lite taste, you don't need to know anything about it to play this though it's completely standalone.</p>
<p>Here's the thing — some dungeon crawlers can be thoroughly frustrating to play. I end up getting annoyed, cursing at the screen and not in a fun way and so just stop playing and give up on them. Not the case here though thanks to the totally ridiculous slapstick comedy of Lucky Tower Ultimate. Each death was either a belly laugh or a rather silly surprise. It captured my attention instantly, and I haven't wanted to put it down and I still don't want to.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13530955131730828395gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13530955131730828395gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>The idea here is that one night while having a drink at the local tavern, you go to use the <em>facilities</em> and you're suddenly teleported into a strange tower with nothing but your underwear. The <em>top</em> of the tower too, not the bottom, so you have to work your way down as you go through various doors. With some truly comical moments, backed up by some nice voice acting, it's certainly an experience you won't forget. Part of what makes it funny, is that you can pick up pretty much all items to use as weapons — including creatures and people.</p>
<p><em>I'm just going to give you a small slice of what to expect from it…</em></p>
<p>In my first run, I came across an old lady wandering around. After a little chat, I accidentally picked her up and shook her about for some loot. Obviously she was unhappy about this and slapped me dead. Well, that was a short run for my first go. On my second run I opened a door and walked into a room that was entirely full of barrels of dynamite with lit fuses, and then the entire tower blew up. Taking a second look inside "just to be sure" wasn't my best idea. You can see where this is going right? This game is the story of how you will die a thousand different ways.</p>
<p>At times a creepy wizard will appear and offer you items for free. Like potions! Who doesn't love a fancy potion! I decided to drink it, for science, and — dead again. The very next run they promptly appeared in front of me again, and dropped a hammer for me, so perhaps I can trust them? That is a helpful item indeed to smash some goblins with.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19582950261730826955gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19582950261730826955gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Run number…oh I don't know I've lost count, I found the old lady again. This time she was trapped in a cage, so I freed her and it turns out her name is Alva and she can give you potions. Hooray! Off we go into another room where a creature was sat at a table with three pots. They offered me a bet: pick the right pot that has a tooth under it after they spin them around and win a prize, lose and forfeit a wager. I clearly wasn’t paying attention as my wager was supposed to be placed on a button behind me…right where Alva was stood. I lost and Alva got turned into food. Stupid creature <em>cheated</em> though! I picked right at least once and they said they weren’t paying attention so spun the pots again. Annoyed, I hit them with a hammer and they punched the life out of me. <em>That's another run over.</em></p>
<p>One run lasted all of about 30 seconds. As I walked into a room that <em>seemed</em> safe, so I took a hand off my controller for a few seconds to grab a drink next to me and the floor opened up and goodbye hero — dammit!</p>
<p>Every time I think I'm doing well, and that I'm safe, the tower has other ideas. Hear some screaming getting louder? Well, standing around to find out wasn't my brightest idea as this thing below smashed through the wall and promptly smashed <em>me</em> with a rather large hammer.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14516132261730826763gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14516132261730826763gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Okay. Next time I will beat it for sure, I say to myself.</p>
<p>I walk into a room and there's a creature asleep on a chair. Near the creature is a horn on the floor, obviously I didn't see it so I stepped on it creating a <em>honk</em> and the creature cheekily opens one eye to take a little look. So I back off, wait for them to sleep again and try to creep past…but they wake up and quickly scoop me up into their mouth. I became lunch. Run over. Ouch.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1929342951730826651gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1929342951730826651gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>What makes it great is that it really is mechanically simple. From movement to combat, it's all very basic. It's the silliness of it, and all the different encounters and traps that make it worth playing through. The design is just fantastic.</p>
<p>I could go on for quite some time about how stupidly I died, and how each death made me want to just play more. But I'll leave you with that small slice for now. Lucky Tower Ultimate is all about expecting the unexpected, and then probably dying in some really silly way. Truly fun.</p>
<p>Since it's in Early Access these are just my initial thoughts on it, and I'll be playing a whole lot more right up until release where I'll be covering it again no doubt. The developer has announced a big content update is due out <em>today</em> (Nov 5th) too, so that's my late evening and probably into the early hours entirely written-off to play and discover more.</p>
<p>It plays <em>beautifully</em> with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/proton-90-3-released-and-proton-experimental-upgraded-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-3</a>, with my time playing it on Steam Deck across a mixture of docking it up to a TV and playing it handheld. Not a single problem encountered, which is why it's a surprise to see it only rated Steam Deck Playable as everything appears to work out of the box.</p>
<p>This is one of the easiest recommendations I've ever done. Go buy it.</p>

<p>One I missed from Halloween - Two Point Museum got a new trailer to showcase the haunted Wailon Lodge as the latest playable museum location. As curator of Wailon Lodge, your task is to join the ghostly front-of-house and discover show-stopping exhibits that will turn the old haunted hotel into a bustling location once more.</p>
<p>Just like the previous games in the Two Point series (Two Point Campus / Two Point Hospital), there will be various locations for you to build through to create the perfect attraction. </p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>

      <title>Croc Legend of the Gobbos remaster to release in December</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently we had the news that the classic Croc Legend of the Gobbos was getting a remaster, and then we learned it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/croc-legend-of-the-gobbos-remaster-will-be-a-gog-exclusive/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">would be a GOG exclusive</a>. Now we at least know it will release in December, although they're not giving us an exact date as to when just yet.</p>
<p>More about it: Croc Legend of the Gobbos follows the heartwarming journey of an endearing, humble little crocodile equipped with only his iconic backpack and a wiggly butt as he sets off on his quest to rescue the Gobbos from the clutches of the nefarious Baron Dante and his hordes of Dantinis. Croc must platform his way across a series of unique worlds by running, jumping, climbing, swimming, and tail spinning to save the Gobbos from captivity.</p>
<p>Trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="T2SZtxMF2Jg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fede7814905cacae43f7a28050fd3b36.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/T2SZtxMF2Jg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release: “From the outset, our vision has been to release Croc only when we’re happy with it. We are speed-running towards a December 2024 release and are very close to being complete. However, if we need to add a little more polish, we won’t hesitate to do so. After waiting 27 years, we trust that our dedicated fans can wait a few weeks longer,” said Jez San, Founder of Argonaut Games.</p>
<p>San continued: "The Croc remaster aims to reignite the imaginations of players with its enhanced HD graphics, updated modern controls, and an authentic gameplay experience that will transport players back to the golden age of gaming."</p>
<p>At release it will be $29.99.</p>

      <title>Playing with special beans in Bean To Me! is messing with my brain</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Don't judge me on this one, but I've been playing with beans for a while in the new release of Bean To Me! from Melonleaf Industries / Very Evil Demons. Note: key provided to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4218320-GamingOnLinux/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">our Steam Curator</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, beans. Inspired by the ancient game of Mancala, it's all about two players trying to move beans around a simple board with little cups. It's strangely captivating and takes a while to learn properly but the basic idea is simple enough. You're just moving beans from one side of the board to the other, eventually getting them into your big pot to score and it's a race of minds in turn-based strategy to get as many beans as possible before one player runs out and the game is over.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2744000521730808630gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>On the surface it may <em>seem</em> quite simple however it's anything but. And I don't think I've quite gotten the hang of it properly yet, but I'm really enjoying the idea as I've not actually played a game like this before. Mechanically simple at least, you just click a pot that has beans and your hand will gather them all up, moving to the right depositing one bean over each pot as it goes. It doesn't stop on your side though, if you click a pot with many beans your hand will keep going over to your opponent to deposit beans as well.</p>
<p>The key is in the bean placement, as there's ways to steal a whole big lot of beans from your opponent. You can also get an extra go if you plan right, by dropping your last bean in your hand into your big pot to add to your score with no beans going to your opponent's side. Then there's all the special kinds of beans you can unlock to take into battle with you, some might even explode destroying other beans that can really mess with things.</p>
<p>There's quite a lot to think about during each run. And I actually needed to play the tutorial twice to properly get the mechanics. After that, it's a lot of trial and error with all the different types of special beans and before you know it a few hours have vanished like a runner bean.</p>
<p>Playable in single-player, local multiplayer and online too so you can challenge friends. It has Native Linux support and works great.</p>
<p>Really great. A wonderful idea that's simple to get into but surprisingly hard to master and will keep you thinking for hours. Cheap too at £4.29 when not on sale.</p>

      <title>Stardew Valley 1.6.9 released with a new friend to help you find lost items</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Much like Terraria, work never seems to be finished on Stardew Valley, with a brand new update out now with a few new features and surprises. Stardew Valley is probably one of the best casual games out there, really nice to chill with. It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified!</p>
<p>As detailed in the <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-6-9-changelog/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a> here's the main new content and features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If you lost an item that can’t be found again, a <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Secret_Woods#Lost_Items_Shop" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">new friend appears in the secret woods</a> who can get it back (for a price).</li>
<li>You can now put legendary fish in fish ponds. These are limited to one per pond and produce legendary fish roe. Each fish has a unique water color.</li>
<li>You can now place beds and sleep inside any constructed buildings that allow furniture.</li>
<li>Items dropped in water now float for a short time, so you can collect them if you’re quick or have a magnet ring.</li>
<li>Sam and Shane now have work portraits while working at JojaMart.</li>
<li>Slightly tweaked some dialogues.</li>
<li>Added new Easter eggs.</li>
<li>Added <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Multiplayer#Cheat_commands" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">hidden cheat commands</a>. (Only on platforms where a save edit is possible)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20852832921730806162gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>There's plenty more balance changes, quality of life improvements and bug fixes too. The developer also updated SDL from 2.0.x to 2.30.4 that should keep it running nicely, and they also swapped from FAudio to OpenAL which they said should "improve performance when playing audio".</p>
<p>Players using a controller / Steam Deck will also be glad to know there's also some gamepad improvements too like various crashes being fixed and some UI issues.</p>

      <title>Manjaro Linux want your system info with their new data collection tool</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Manjaro Linux team are asking for testers for their new data collection tool called "Manjaro Data Donor", which they plan to have as opt-out and not opt-in.</p>
<p>As expected, they are catching some comments from users not particularly happy about their plan to have it hooked up as something you have to opt out of due to privacy concerns. Telemetry is often a bad word to a lot of people, but the reality is that when done correctly it can be truly essential for projects to know where to focus. </p>
<p>Manjaro developer Roman Gilg said in the <a href="https://forum.manjaro.org/t/testers-needed-manjaro-data-donor/170163" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> that currently they use <a href="https://matomo.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Matomo</a>, which is pinged via the Network Manager but it's unreliable for various reasons. So they created Manjaro Data Donor (MDD) which gives more information and should be more reliable overall, and they actually have full control over it.</p>
<p>Currently they just want Manjaro users to test it and give feedback, but eventually it will be hooked up as a systemd service:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the next few days we’ll do some more testing and if results are positive, I plan on installing it on all Manjaro systems and adding a systemd service to submit the data automatically.</p>
<p>As a reminder: Right now you have to install MDD manually and there is no systemd service yet.</p>
<p>With this systemd service later in place, sending the hardware data with MDD will be opt-out because I believe, if you do opt-in, the data you gather will be so heavily skewed you can just leave it be.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think. I know telemetry is a contentious subject, but we need at least some data about how Manjaro is being used by so many people around the world in order to show that the project has a future and also to plan for that future.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck SteamOS 3.6.20 update released for everyone</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve are acting quickly to clean up some Steam Deck problems from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-deck-steamos-36-officially-out-with-improved-performance-mura-compensation-lots-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the huge SteamOS 3.6 update</a> with a new SteamOS 3.6.20 update released for everyone.</p>
<p>This time it's just a few bits but all pretty nice to see:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the updater could repeatedly revert you to the previous OS version if certain configuration files were user-modified.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with taking multiple screenshots if Game Recording is on.</li>
<li>Improved performance in Metaphor: ReFantazio by up to 20%.</li>
</ul>

<p>Are you currently having issues you want to see solved? What are your biggest problems right now?</p>
<p>Mine is a small one but still annoying: when docking to my main 4K TV, the performance overlay is absolutely tiny and unreadable. It's a really odd issue, but I would like to see it solved with some proper scaling of the performance overlay. It happens with every dock I've tried including Valve's official dock, multiple from JSAUX to the recently tested <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/the-benq-becreatus-gr10-usb4-steam-deck-dock-is-simply-great/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BenQ beCreatus GR10</a>.</p>

      <title>The BenQ beCreatus GR10 USB4 Steam Deck Dock is simply great</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While a little on the pricey side, the BenQ beCreatus GR10 USB4 Steam Deck Dock is a worthy addition to your arsenal for both at home and while you're on the go. <em>Disclosure: BenQ sent over the device for review, I did not need to send it back.</em></p>
<p>There's a <em>lot</em> of docks out there now including the official one from Valve, multiple from JSAUX, UGREEN and the list of companies doing them goes on for a while. Valve basically created another little accessory industry here. Most of them are quite similar but BenQ are at least doing something a little <em>different</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4452880041730740182gol1.png"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">It has some nice specifications to begin with including:</p>
<ul>
<li>USB4 Type-C cable for device connection. This comes with a removable 90 degree USB-C adaptor already attached.</li>
<li>USB-C PD charger (input max 100W).</li>
<li>USB-A Connector (10 Gbps, 4.5W charging) x 2.</li>
<li>USB-C Connector (10 Gbps, 7.5W charging) x 1.</li>
<li>2.5 Gigabit Ethernet RJ-45.</li>
<li>HDMI 2.1 (4K 120Hz/8K 60Hz).</li>
</ul>
<p>So with it you get a reasonable amount of ports, that all work great and have a good fit with various connectors. The fun part though? The stand for your devices folds out from it. Making it easy to fold back and pack away for any travels you're doing. A bit of a novelty perhaps, but for anyone who does travel a fair bit, this will make it quite a nice space-saver for docking it wherever you go. The device connection cable also folds away into the device as well keeping it all safe and secure.</p>
<p>Having the device connector with a removable 90 degree USB-C adaptor is a nice touch too, if you're planning to hook it up to other devices when the stand is folded away, doubling it up as a decent USB HUB for other devices too. BenQ say the beCreatus GR10 will be plug and play across iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux devices.</p>
<p>BenQ certainly aren't the first to have a stand that you pull out, I believe JSAUX got there first with their RGB Docking Station, but that's a little flimsy feeling and wobbly as it does not sit flat as there's a gap under it. Not a problem at here, as the designers at BenQ made sure the foldable stand actually folds out flat onto the surface. So it feels a lot sturdier than the competition. The build quality overall is fantastic too. Feels solid and looks nice while staying out of your way — not much more is needed than that.</p>
<p>Other docks I've looked at before had ports that were a bit overly snug when connecting / disconnecting wires, which I'm pleased to say is not a problem here at all. The cuts for the ports are as snug as they should be, but not where it may cause issues.</p>
<p>I've been testing this constantly for about a week and a half now, and I haven't had a single problem with it. While I only have a Steam Deck to test with it, BenQ note it will fit and work well with other handhelds too including the ROG Ally, MSI Claw and the Legion Go thanks to the spacious 21.5mm size of the foldable stand.</p>
<p>You can see their own video on it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mlcIJgcMIyE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6e7010d6b59efe8c5c66dedf6785de78.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mlcIJgcMIyE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The only downsides really are the <em>price</em> and <em>shipping</em>. At $109 it's a bit more than most other docks, and it seems they're only shipping in the USA right now. For the price though you get rather nice specifications and the useful foldable stand that sits nicely. I'll also say personally I think it's a bit <em>silly</em> that BenQ so prominently list 120Hz and 4K for it, despite the Steam Deck not performing well at 4K for really anything. But hey, that's great for other uses!</p>
<p>Overall this is easily one of the nicest docks I've had for review and I've been through quite a few now. For me personally it's going to be my own go-to for when travelling between places, which I actually do a fair bit of recently, so it came at a good time. And it actually works <em>better</em> than Valve's official dock, which I still at times have issues with displaying on my main TV whereas this as it should — just works. You don't get a better recommendation than that right?</p>
<p>This is a premium dock with the price, build quality and ease of use to match with the added bonus of being good for travel. If you have yet to get a dock for your handheld, or you're looking for a <em>better</em> one, the BenQ beCreatus GR10 would be a great purchase that I'll happily recommend.</p>

      <title>Half-Life 3 fan game Project Borealis: Prologue gets a Steam page - due out soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Project Borealis is finally coming to Steam, to give you a taste of what Half-Life 3 or Half-Life 2: Episode 3 could have been. A good time to do so, since we're coming up on the 20th anniversary of Half-Life 2.</p>
<p>Created by a bunch of passionate fans they aim to give you a proper conclusion to Valve's popular FPS series. Built with Unreal Engine 5 they aim to create a faithful recreation of iconic Half-Life 2, although with plenty of upgrades. This is only a Prologue though, which is basically a demo.</p>
<p>I missed it but they did release a teaser trailer back in September:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="dwdjgE74-98"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/59783061bf438aa945bb6652c9d53f88.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/dwdjgE74-98" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Legacy Continues</strong></p>
<p>Inspired by the epic cliffhanger from Half-Life 2: Episode Two, Project Borealis represents a fan-made effort to realize a cohesive story conclusion to the episodic series. This prologue chapter invites players back into the HEV suit of Gordon Freeman, offering a glimpse into the next chapter of his journey.</p>
<p><strong>A Familiar Yet Different World</strong></p>
<p>Step into a Ravenholm transformed by time and the elements. The once-familiar town now lies buried under a blanket of snow, hiding the past and new present dangers beneath its pristine surface. As you navigate through this hauntingly beautiful landscape, you'll encounter some classic enemies reimagined and completely new secrets hidden within.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The developers say it will be a "condensed, standalone game experience showcasing an early look and feel of the upcoming full Project Borealis game" with an original score to accompany it.</p>

      <title>Atari acquires Transport Tycoon from Chris Sawyer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Atari have announced they've now acquired Chris Sawyer's Transport Tycoon, as Atari continue building themselves back up.</p>
<p>This follows on from other acquisitions from Atari including the<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/infogrames-atari-have-acquired-the-surgeon-simulator-franchise/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Surgeon Simulator franchise under Infogrames</a>, the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/atari-acquires-intellivision-brand-and-over-200-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Intellivision brand and over 200 games</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/atari-revives-infogrames-and-acquires-totally-reliable-delivery-service/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Totally Reliable Delivery Service</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/atari-acquires-awesomenauts-swords-soldiers-and-digital-eclipse/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Awesomenauts, Swords &amp; Soldiers and Digital Eclipse</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/atari-are-acquiring-night-dive-studios/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Night Dive Studios</a>.</p>
<p>From the press release: "We are honored that Chris has entrusted us with Transport Tycoon and our team is committed to both honoring and advancing his groundbreaking creation." said Atari Chairman and CEO Wade Rosen.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14930145311730737698gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Transport Tycoon, taken by me.</em></p>
<p>They said they plan to "expand digital and physical distribution, potentially develop new titles or content, and explore brand and merchandising collaborations as part of a long-term plan to preserve and expand this classic sim".</p>
<p>Makes sense for Atari to grab it since they were the publisher for Chris Sawyer's Locomotion too. On top of that Atari also currently control the licensing for RollerCoaster Tycoon as well, although they don't own it as Sawyer still does.</p>
<p>A bit of a colourful history between Sawyer and Atari though, as Sawyer actually sued Atari back in 2005 for unpaid royalties. Atari then counter-sued for damages in 2007, and later it was settled out of court in 2008 with an undisclosed sum paid to Sawyer.</p>
<p>Worth nothing that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/openttd-140-brings-a-scalable-font-a-new-ship-pathfinder-social-platform-integration/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">OpenTTD</a> exists, it's an open source simulation game based upon Transport Tycoon Deluxe, and it's pretty darn popular.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Raspberry Pi team have released a brand new version of the Raspberry Pi OS that brings with it Wayland support to all models.</p>
<p>As detailed in the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/a-new-release-of-raspberry-pi-os/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they've dropped their Wayland compositor called wayfire, and replaced it with <a href="https://github.com/labwc/labwc" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">labwc</a>, which is based on a <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlroots" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">wlroots</a>. They say this project was a "much better fit for the Raspberry Pi graphics hardware" and when speaking to the developers they found "their future direction very much aligned with our own".</p>
<p>They've been working on it for most of this year in collaboration with the developers of both labwc and wlroots, and now it's reached the point where it runs just as fast as Xorg on older Raspberry Pi models and so the latest released Raspberry Pi OS runs Wayland by default across all models.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some other improvements in this release include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Significantly improved support for using the Desktop with a touch screen.</li>
<li>Better Raspberry Pi Connect integration.</li>
<li>A better and rewritten panel application for the taskbar at the top of the screen.</li>
<li>A new Screen Configuration tool.</li>
</ul>
<p>Seems 2025 will truly be the year of Wayland on Linux with most distributions and desktops now being in pretty good shape with it.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma 6.3 will show when apps are killed due to out of memory (OOM)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Work continues as always on the next version of the popular KDE Plasma desktop environment. My favourite desktop, and the one used for the Steam Deck Desktop Mode.</p>
<p>Developer Nate Graham also recently announced that the This Week in Plasma blog posts have moved to a new home. They're no longer going to be on their personal blog, instead actually on the official KDE blog system as noted in <a href="https://blogs.kde.org/2024/11/02/this-week-in-plasma-spoooooky-ooooooooom-notifications/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the latest post</a>.</p>
<p>One new feature coming for Plasma 6.3 is that you will get nice clear notifications in the case of your system experiencing out of memory (OOM) where the Linux kernel terminated an app. Graham noted there's "now a little service to detect this and show you a system notification explaining what happened, plus suggestions for what you can do about it in the future". This sounds great to have.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5832418511730718961gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Some other improvements noted to be coming include improvements to the Emoji Selector app to have "sub-string matching from the middle of words too, so you can find emojis more easily" due for Plasma 6.2.3. Additionally the grouping indicator for apps on the task manager bar will no longer always be green, and will instead follow your selected accent colour, this is due in Plasma 6.3.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4737823901730719070gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Plus as usual plenty of bug fixes are coming like XWayland-using apps acting weird when resizing them.</p>

      <title>Check out Proton-Sarek if you have an older GPU for Windows games on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve's work with Proton to run Windows games on Linux / Steam Deck is amazing, but they do require you have newer GPUs so some have been a bit left behind. Proton-Sarek aims to fix that.</p>
<p>What is it? A community built version of Proton (like GE-Proton) designed specifically for those of you who have a GPU that doesn't support newer Vulkan, or with no Vulkan support at all but still want all the latest updated from Proton to keep gaming on Linux.</p>
<p>As the developer explains on the GitHub page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because there are still users with GPUs that support Vulkan 1.1+ but not Vulkan 1.3, as well as others with non-Vulkan support. Those who can use DXVK often rely on older Proton versions, which suffer from lower compatibility and performance compared to newer builds. Meanwhile, users dependent on WineD3D frequently face poor gaming experiences. This repository provides patched versions of Proton and/or Proton-GE, offering better performance with DXVK v1.10.3 and WineD3D mainly trough the custom parameter <code class="inline-code">PROTON_TWEAKS</code>, along with other enhancements, ensuring a smoother experience for both Vulkan and non-Vulkan setups.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems like a nice idea for older systems. And much like GE-Proton, there's no support from Valve for this, but it's useful if you need it.</p>
<p>The developer recently released Sarek 9-18 and 9-17 with the base of the project updated to GE-Proton 9-17. On top of that it includes two new options:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">PROTON_VK_SOFTWARE</code>: Uses Lavapipe to enable CPU-based rendering for Vulkan, supporting API version 1.3.</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">PROTON_OGL_SOFTWARE</code>: Uses LLVMpipe to enable CPU-based rendering for OpenGL, supporting API version 4.6.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Linux Mint partners up with Framework, also working on Night Light for Cinnamon desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some fun Linux distro news for you this morning as the Linux Mint team have a fresh <a href="https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=4762" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> up on what they've been doing and it's quite exciting to see.</p>
<p>The first thing is that for the Cinnamon desktop environment they're working on a Night Light feature. Previously they shipped Redshift but now they're working on one that's properly integrated, and plan for it to work with both Wayland and Xorg. On top of that they're also continuing the work to port key Cinnamon dialogs to Clutter.</p>
<p>A fun announcement in the post is that they've begun working with <a href="https://frame.work/gb/en" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Framework</a>, who make the popular modular laptops. According to Mint lead Clement Lefebvre, Framework want "to achieve full compatibility with Linux Mint and the Cinnamon desktop" and their laptops are "packed with components we don’t have or technologies which we hadn’t really focused on yet" so it will "boost new areas of development for us". Lefebvre now has a Framework Laptop and seems to like it quite a lot.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

<p>More about it: "ASYLUM is an ambitious and intricate first-person horror adventure casting you into the hallucinatory setting of the Hanwell Mental Institute. Interact with its curious denizens, gather clues, unravel the mystery, and march towards a shocking conclusion."</p>

<li>Between 10 and 15 hours of gameplay — and that's without learning all the dark secrets!</li>
<li>An atmosphere so engrossing you will almost smell the stench of decrepitude and putrefaction around you.</li>
<li>Exciting challenges rewarding your wit and observation.</li>
<li>Memorable soundtrack inspired by 80s horror films and quite a bit of John Carpenter.</li>
<li>No jump scares! OK, maybe just a frightening handful that will hit you when you least expect them.</li>

      <title>Terraria hits over 60 million sales with Terraria 1.4.5 shaping up to be another big update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest State of the Game developer <a href="https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/terraria-state-of-the-game-october-2024.139253/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> for Terraria gives out some big new sales numbers, and announces a new use for Life Fruit.</p>
<p>Firstly, on the subject of sales, Terraria has now crossed over 60 million (60.7m) with 33 million of those just on PC. Simply amazing, and it continues to be one of the most popular games on Steam as it's pretty much always in the top 100 most played games. It's in the top 100 over the last month and year specifically for Steam Deck too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14487642851730545971gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>As for some announced changes the team revealed the new Jungle Juice, an upgraded healing potion for 180 points of health that can be crafted using Life Fruits in Hardmode. Good for those of you towards the end-game to keep you stocked up during some big battles.</p>
<p>There's a whole lot more coming in Terraria 1.4.5 that's being tracked in a <a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Upcoming_features" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Wiki</a> including a Dead Cells crossover, new whips, new furniture sets, music blocks, transformation mounts, new accessories, a new film noir styled shader and a whole lot more.</p>
<p>No date is being given for Terraria 1.4.5 as they're continuing their mantra of "it's ready when it's ready".</p>
<p>Terraria has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Windows to Linux compatibility layer Wine 10.0 planned for mid-January 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lead developer Alexandre Julliard <a href="https://list.winehq.org/mailman3/hyperkitty/list/wine-devel@winehq.org/thread/FVV5ZB7263Q5OIV5U4BUX6XPHF6WOGVT/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> that Wine 10.0 is going to be releasing in mid-January 2025.</p>
<p>There's been a delay to the latest development build though, due to low activity and Julliard is travelling. So Wine 9.21 is instead coming out November 8th (instead of yesterday).</p>
<p>Two weeks after that, Wine 9.22 will be out and then another two weeks later on December 6, the first Release Candidate for Wine 10.0 will be available and mark the annual code freeze where the focus is purely on bugs and not new features.</p>
<p>That freeze will last until the final 10.0 release due "sometime around mid-January".</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Wine 10.0 will have a lot of additions compared to Wine 9.0 like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved Unicode.</li>
<li>Improved Wayland support.</li>
<li>Lots of DirectPlay support upgrades.</li>
<li>A new Media Foundation backend using FFMpeg.</li>
<li>ARM64 support upgrades.</li>
<li>An initial Driver Store implementation.</li>
<li>Expanded support for ODBC Windows drivers.</li>
<li>Support for elevating process privileges.</li>
<li>Better Dvorak keyboard detection.</li>
<li>And much, much more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Eventually then we will see a new <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> version too based on Wine 10 to continue improving Windows gaming on Steam Deck / Linux from Steam.</p>

      <title>Linux hits exactly 2% user share on the October 2024 Steam Survey</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey is out for October 2024, and the Linux user share has gone back up again to exactly 2%.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Overall:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows: 96.61% -0.23%</li>
<li>Linux 2.00% +0.13%</li>
<li>macOS: 1.39% +0.10%</li>
</ul>
<p>Quite likely we're seeing the drop of Windows because the English language share overall went up by 8.09%, with Simplified Chinese dropping by 1%. We generally see the Linux share drop when Simplified Chinese on Steam rises, which it had done for two months in a row. So this seems like things going back to a more normal position.</p>

      <title>Stuck for what to play this weekend? DayZ works really nicely on Linux now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're in need of something to game on Linux this weekend, why not try out the open-world survival game DayZ. The game is also going through a player surge thanks to a new expansion release.</p>
<p>The DayZ Frostline expansion launched October 15, and Bohemia Interactive announced it sold over 300,000 copies of the DLC in the first week. Along with that on October 20th they marked the best day ever with "501,522 total daily active users" and an all-time high on concurrent players "with 79,000 on Steam, 33,000 on PlayStation, and 36,000 on Xbox".</p>
<p>The thing is, I've been trying to play DayZ on and off for a while but always had issues with the launcher. Valve even <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/12/more-battleye-titles-for-proton-on-linux-including-dayz-arma-3-now-supported/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced back in late 2021</a> that DayZ was one of the titles that enabled BattlEye anti-cheat support, ahead of the Steam Deck release. As of the latest DayZ update though? No problems at all getting into the game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1354828141730491948gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1354828141730491948gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15530831761730492841gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15530831761730492841gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - DayZ on Linux, click pics to enlarge</em></p>
<p>Nice to see that some developers appear to have no problem with keeping their anti-cheat enabled for Linux unlike <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/grand-theft-auto-v-gets-battleye-anti-cheat-breaks-online-play-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GTA Online for GTA V</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/ea-respawn-now-block-apex-legends-from-running-on-linux-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Apex Legends</a>.</p>
<p>The only issue I've encountered is that if you leave the game launcher open, you get a weird outline of it on top of the game window. Simply closing the launcher once you're in the game gets rid of it. Other than that on the latest Proton 9.0-3 it seems to work <em>really</em> nicely.</p>
<p>Pretty reasonable performance too on the Extreme graphics preset on 2560x1440 I've been seeing it run swimmingly over 60FPS all of the time in the open-world, and higher when in various buildings. Depends on the area though, some areas give much better performance.</p>
<p>DayZ is also 50% off until November 4th.</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Full Steam Deck support (issues and CTDs fixed, performance optimizations, and more).</li>
<li>Proton support.</li>
<li>New sound player implementation (sound should now work on Steam Deck, Proton and for anyone without the "Windows Media Player" system feature installed).</li>
<li>Functionality to switch monitors (You can now switch the monitor the game runs on by pressing Shift + Windows + left/right arrow).</li>
<li>A new automatic tooltip that informs players about the currently playing song.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's two new versions of GE-Proton that have been released in the last day, although it's mostly just updating components from upstream to continue to improve Windows games on Linux platforms including Steam Deck.</p>

<p>Nothing major here, just a refresh of various parts that need updates from git, mostly to add new video playback fixes from upstream proton.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4763709421730481762gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em></p>
<p>And then GE-Proton 9-18:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hotfix:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add missing proton script python uuid import (which broke prefix creation)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Taken from the <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> releases page.</em></p>
<p>A lot of their work right now is going into Open Wine Components like UMU, the unified launcher for Windows games on Linux, which allows the likes of GE-Proton to run properly outside of Steam for use in tools like Lutris, Heroic, Bottles and other launchers. The creator, Thomas Crider, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/ubuntu-summit-2024-highlights-linux-gaming-talks-on-umu-and-heroic-launcher/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently did a talk at the Ubuntu Summit</a> you should check out.</p>

      <title>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered may need a workaround on desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered is out now and like other recent Sony PlayStation releases on PC, it forces a PlayStation Network Account which is causing issues for some desktop Linux players.</p>
<p>You can run it on Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a>, but you might have issues actually logging into the PSN account system to play it. Not particularly surprising, since with<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/god-of-war-ragnarok-steam-deck-verified-needs-a-launch-option-for-desktop-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> God of War Ragnarök</a> you needed to pretend your desktop Linux system was a Steam Deck but in this case you <em>don't</em> want to do that.</p>
<p>Writing on the Steam forum, a developer at Nixxes Software <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2561580/discussions/0/4634860082274840611/#c4634860082274843235" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">said to do this</a> instead:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The SteamDeck parameter includes other changes specifically designed for the Steam Deck.<br/>
If you are experiencing issues with the login flow on Linux, please use the following workaround:<br/>
<br/>
On Steam, right click the game in your Library, choose Properties, go to General.<br/>
Add <strong>-showlinkingqr</strong> in the field for Launch Options</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see this sort of thing has been thought about, and to have a developer directly reply with a solution.</p>

      <title>Black Mesa has a new Beta with &#39;WAY better&#39; support for Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Crowbar Collective have a fresh Beta available for Black Mesa, their fan-made reimagining of Valve Software's Half-Life. This brings with it some nice improvements all across the game, especially for Linux platforms like Steam Deck.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/362890/view/4486241294570487809" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they mentioned "Welcome to Fall, and a Black Mesa beta patch post! We have pushed a build to public-beta that includes a bunch of fixes to some lingering issues, and WAY better Linux/Steam Deck support" with these highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improved game start up for a smother first time launch and improved stability.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused the game to crash to the menu when changing video settings during gameplay.</li>
<li>Fixed performance issue with moving wires (Thanks to npc_pigeon, narkvic, and the community).</li>
<li>Re-added DXVK for Windows as a launch option.</li>
<li>Significantly better native Linux implementation and Steam Deck support.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12565454981730400051gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>They go into quite a lot more detail on all the changes too, which is nice to see. We often see developers note improvements, but not many go deep into the individual details. Specifically for Linux here's everything they listed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ToGL/Linux:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated ToGL/Linux shaders with the latest GBuffer changes to ensure the application of up-to-date rendering techniques.</li>
<li>Cleaned up the shadow filter state in ToGL/Linux, resulting in more accurate and stable shadow rendering.</li>
<li>Migrated ToGL/Linux to use the OpenGL 3.3 Compatibility Profile, enhancing compatibility with a broader range of hardware and driver configurations while maintaining access to modern OpenGL features.</li>
<li>Introduced an optional experimental Binary Shader Cache for ToGL/Linux, accessible via the -glusebinarycache command line option on Linux and native Steam Deck builds, which improves shader load times on supported platforms.</li>
<li>Resolved a half-pixel halo issue in the ToGL/Linux rendering pipeline, improving visual accuracy in rendered scenes.</li>
<li>Added per-triangle and optional per-vertex validation for studio models to resolve issues in ToGL/Linux related to static and dynamically lit models. A second pass for per-vertex validation can be enabled via the +r_studio_validate_vertices 1 command line argument.</li>
<li>Improved lighting buffer quality on ToGL/Linux to resolve a red hue in specular highlights, ensuring consistent visual output across platforms.</li>
<li>Added a missing window icon on ToGL/Linux to address a minor visual issue.</li>
<li>Configured default arguments for the Linux launcher to optimize display settings on Steam Deck, ensuring a better out-of-the-box experience for AMD/Intel GPU users.</li>
<li>Fixed debug assertions in Havok that leaked into the release build on Linux, preventing potential crashes during runtime.</li>
</ul>
<p>Proton/Linux:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forced the shipped DXVK configuration on Proton if no overrides are provided, enhancing compatibility with Proton 9.x and newer versions.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For some background: <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/ToGL" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ToGL</a> is the original translation layer Valve used in their earlier Linux ports, that translated Direct3D to OpenGL. Later Valve games have native Vulkan support, and they also nowadays of course have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> with DXVK and VKD3D-Proton for translating Direct3D to Vulkan.</p>
<p>That's a rather surprising amount of effort that's been put into the Native Linux version of the game.</p>

      <title>Vampire Survivors: Ode to Castlevania is out now and it&#39;s a huge expansion</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vampire Survivors: Ode to Castlevania DLC is out now and it's a rather large addition to an already great game. <em>Note: DLC key provided by Future Friends Games, the base game I purchased myself originally.</em></p>
<p>Taking an already fantastic content-filled game and just giving you a whole lot more of it, what's not to love about Vampire Survivors? Accessible action that you can hop into for a run whenever you want, and now there's a healthy dose of Castlevania too? Yes please.</p>
<p>It probably needs no real introduction right? Vampire Survivors spawned a whole genre with its simple mechanics of building up a crazy character with auto-firing attacks. Vampire Survivors: Ode to Castlevania adds in over 20 new characters, 40 new weapons, over 30 new music tracks and a huge new castle map to battle through. That's only really scratching the surface of this monstrous expansion though.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="RnzmiDonN2E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8843e1edff4652e79b2f3644e4ae6bfb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/RnzmiDonN2E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The themed map is a nice addition to the game and quite different from most of the maps. With a mixture of closed and open areas, with plenty of extras in it to find and unlock. Unlike other maps, it also has dedicated spots to spawn various Castlevania themed bosses so you can take them on when you feel you're powered up enough.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5594656041730398248gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5594656041730398248gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>While the map is nice the real weight of the DLC comes down to all the characters and weapons, but it will take you a good while to get through it all. We're talking tens of hours of gameplay here on the normal speed to battle through the bosses, and deal with the challenges to unlock all the new characters.</p>
<p>I won't spoil it, but lets just say that they're <em>massively</em> underselling this DLC thanks to a big secret. There's a <strong>lot</strong> more to it than what they're telling you. No doubt you'll be able to find what easily somewhere else, but I'm not a fan of ruining a very nice surprise that really was awesome to see. I have no doubt this will bump the game back up the most played lists on Steam and for good reason.</p>
<p>All the usual jank of Vampire Survivors with enemies walking on top of all the walls, while in other sections they all get stuck on them. It's the game you know and love, just more of everything.</p>
<p>Vampire Survivors: Ode to Castlevania DLC is a brilliant addition to the game, and one that is really a no-brainer on recommending you pick up. The price ($3.99 / EUR 3.99 / £2.99) for the content is just absurd, poncle really did some great stuff here.</p>
<p>Vampire Survivors is Steam Deck Verified, and has Native Linux support (although not advertised).</p>

      <title>EA / Respawn now block Apex Legends from running on Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developers of Apex Legends have announced that they're going to be blocking the game completely on Linux platforms including Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Writing in a <a href="https://x.com/PlayApex/status/1852019667315102151" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X / Twitter I'll copy it below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey Legends,</p>
<p>We’re sharing today that Linux (and Steam Deck using Linux) will no longer be able to access Apex Legends.</p>
<p>Our dev team wanted to provide a bit more context into this and share some of the decision-making process that happened along the way. As mentioned in our prior <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/anti-cheat-update-082124" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">anti-cheat dev blog</a>, competitive integrity is a top priority for our team and there are many ways in which we’re battling cheaters—this is one to add to the list. We remain committed to more regular updates on topics like this and appreciate your continued reports.</p>
<p>Read on to hear from our Anti-Cheat Team.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>What’s happening?</p>
<p>In our efforts to combat cheating in Apex, we've identified Linux OS as being a path for a variety of impactful exploits and cheats. As a result, we've decided to block Linux OS access to the game. While this will impact a small number of Apex players, we believe the decision will meaningfully reduce instances of cheating in our game.</p>
<p>Linux is used by default on the Steam Deck. There is currently no reliable way for us to differentiate a legitimate Steam Deck from a malicious cheat claiming to be a Steam Deck (via Linux).</p>
<p>Decision making process</p>
<p>The openness of the Linux operating systems makes it an attractive one for cheaters and cheat developers. Linux cheats are indeed harder to detect and the data shows that they are growing at a rate that requires an outsized level of focus and attention from the team for a relatively small platform. There are also cases in which cheats for the Windows OS get emulated as if it’s on Linux in order to increase the difficulty of detection and prevention.</p>
<p>We had to weigh the decision on the number of players who were legitimately playing on Linux/the Steam Deck versus the greater health of the population of players for Apex. While the population of Linux users is small, their impact infected a fair amount of players’ games. This ultimately brought us to our decision today.</p>
<p>Next steps</p>
<p>To eliminate this cheat vector, we have made the decision to prevent access to the game for Linux users. This means that Apex Legends will be unplayable immediately for those running this operating system. Playing on handhelds, such as the Steam Deck, is still possible if the user opts to install Windows.</p>
<p>To clarify, this will not impact users who play Apex via Steam on Windows (or other supported platforms).</p>
<p>Thanks for everyone’s continual support and we look forward to sharing future anti-cheat updates!</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>This is only a part of our ongoing efforts towards Apex’s anti-cheat. We are continually expanding and refining our detection and banning capabilities globally. Keep an eye out for more news to come in the future. Please continue to report cheaters using <a href="https://help.ea.com/no/help/apex-legends/apex-legends/report-player-apex-legends/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the designated tools and channels</a>. Your reports are helpful and matter to us and anti-cheat continues to be a top priority for us.</p>
<p>For future updates and the latest info, continue to follow us here or check out the <a href="https://trello.com/b/ZVrHV38P/apex-tracker" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Apex Tracker Trello</a> for bugs or concerns we’re investigating.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Valve are really going to need to do something more about the anti-cheat situation on Linux. We only <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/grand-theft-auto-v-gets-battleye-anti-cheat-breaks-online-play-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently had GTA Online in GTA V blocked</a> (single-player still works). EA also broke the likes of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/ea-anti-cheat-arrives-for-battlefield-1-breaking-it-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Battlefield 1</a> and various other multiplayer games as well on Linux / Steam Deck, and I did say it was likely only a matter of time until EA messed with Apex. The list of blocked titles just keeps going like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/game-over-for-roblox-on-linux-steam-deck-as-its-now-blocked/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Roblox</a> too — it's just a repeating problem that seems to have no end in sight.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3288417851730392752gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Soon then the official Steam Deck rating from Valve will drop from Playable to Unsupported. <em><strong>Update 18:16 UTC</strong> - Valve have now marked it as Unsupported on Steam Deck.</em></p>
<p>When you try to play on a Linux platform now, you're just given an anti-cheat message. So this is the end of Apex Legends on Linux and Steam Deck.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10408696591730393051gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>How much of a loss is it? Well, for Apex fans on Linux platforms it will of course be a <em>big</em> one. However, looking at Valve's own stats, Apex isn't actually in the Top 100 for the last month of most played games on Steam Deck. The past year though? It's number #48 overall.</p>
<p>Oh, and before you suddenly go "but…but Microsoft are banning kernel-level anti-cheat!" — no they're not. Various YouTube videos and other media made headlines about it, but <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/microsoft-windows-kernel-changes-dont-suddenly-mean-big-things-for-linux-gaming/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">they're wrong which I wrote about before</a>. Even <em>if</em> in some far-away future Microsoft managed to do so, companies will still block Linux directly if they wanted to (and they already do like Roblox!).</p>
<p>In related news, Valve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-games-will-now-need-to-fully-disclose-kernel-level-anti-cheat-on-store-pages/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">only announced yesterday</a> that Steam store pages will need to properly note what kernel-level anti-cheat they use.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck the &#39;perfect platform&#39; for their game say Escape From Castle Matsumoto devs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Escape From Castle Matsumoto looks like quite a unique one, and the developers give the Steam Deck some rather high praise. It's releasing with Native Linux support on December 5th.</p>
<p>In the game two shinobis race against each other to recover stolen items and escape a Japanese castle, using your wits and tricks to outsmart your opponent. What makes it interesting is the split-screen mechanic, along with the slick retro pixel-artwork that looks like it was inspired by the classic Spy vs. Spy.</p>

      <title>Epic roguelike Caves of Qud now has a proper tutorial</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gearing up for the final 1.0 release on December 5, the sci-fi fantasy epic roguelike Caves of Qud now has a proper tutorial released.</p>
<p>You still have to wait for the 1.0 release for the end of the main story though, but at least now you can jump right in and get a proper good idea of what to do. I suggest you do too, because it's a fantastic game that is at times completely absurd in what you can do and what your character can become.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="87TKcq4tcJ4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/52258000d8bb63ab7374b84c18b68a7c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/87TKcq4tcJ4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I've gone through and tested the tutorial, and it really is a nice introduction to the game. Since it's a huge roguelike though, it does only scratch the surface of what the game is about and what you can do. Does the job well though and works great on Linux.</p>
<p>The price, as they previously announced, has also now risen to £24.99 / $29.99 / €28.99.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>DEEP PHYSICAL SIMULATION</strong> — Don’t like the wall blocking your way? Dig through it with a pickaxe, or eat through it with your corrosive gas mutation, or melt it to lava. Yes, every wall has a melting point.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>FULLY SIMULATED CREATURES</strong> — Every monster and NPC is as fully simulated as the player. That means they have levels, skills, equipment, faction allegiances, and body parts. So if you have a mutation that lets you, say, psionically dominate a spider, you can traipse through the world as a spider, laying webs and eating things.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>DYNAMIC FACTION SYSTEM</strong> — Pursue allegiances with over 70 factions: apes, crabs, trees, robots, and highly entropic beings, just to name a few.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>RICHLY DETAILED SCIENCE FANTASY SETTING</strong> — Over fifteen years of worldbuilding have led to a rich, weird, labyrinthine, one-of-a-kind storyworld, layered on top of the simulation, all for you to explore. Live and drink, friend.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>TACTICAL GAMEPLAY</strong> — Turn-based, sandbox exploration and combat offers as many solutions as you and your mutations, implants, artifacts, and skills are creative enough to invent.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>RPG ELEMENTS</strong> — Quests, NPCs, villages, historic sites; some dynamic and some handwritten, interwoven to produce a transportative RPG experience.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>ATMOSPHERIC ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK</strong> — Over two hours of otherworldly music to delve to.</p>
</blockquote>

      <title>Steam games will now need to fully disclose kernel-level anti-cheat on store pages</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve announced a change for Steam today that will make things a lot clearer for everyone, as developers will now need to clearly list the kernel-level anti-cheat used on Steam store pages.</p>
<p>In the Steamworks Developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4547038620960934857?snr=2___" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> Valve said: "We've heard from more and more developers recently that they're looking for the right way to share anti-cheat information about their game with players. At the same time, players have been requesting more transparency around the anti-cheat services used in games, as well as the existence of any additional software that will be installed within the game."</p>
<p>Developers with games already on Steam will also need to do this, as it's not just for new games coming up for release, and it is also part of the release process now too. So Valve will be doing checks on games to ensure the notices are there and correct.</p>
<p>However, it's only being <em>forced</em> for kernel-level anti-cheat. If it's only client-side or server-side, it's <em>optional</em>, but Valve say "we generally think that any game that makes use of anti-cheat technology would benefit from letting players know".</p>
<p>Valve's example pictured below:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7927772011730316555gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Some games don't properly remove everything when you uninstall either, with Valve noting this happens with older games, so it's nice to also see this will be noted too.</p>
<p>This should make it a bit easier knowing what to avoid on Steam Deck / Desktop Linux now too, since kernel-level anti-cheat games are usually blocked by the developer from running with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>
<p>Valve have done a few rather interesting Steam updates lately like dealing with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/steam-store-pages-are-about-to-get-a-lot-cleaner-valve-puts-an-end-to-game-advert-spam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">publisher banner spam</a>, implementing <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/valve-makes-a-big-improvement-for-native-linux-games-in-a-steam-beta-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">improvements for Native Linux games</a>, actually noting clearly when you go to purchase a game <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-purchases-now-clearly-state-youre-just-getting-a-license-not-ownership/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">it's just a license</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/steam-subscriber-agreement-updated-for-disputes-removing-the-need-for-individual-arbitration/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">removing the need for individual arbitration</a>.</p>
